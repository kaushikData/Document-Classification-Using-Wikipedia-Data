In 1936 the government of [[Canada]] conducted the fourth of a series of special [[census]]es covering the rapidly expanding Northwest Provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]. These censuses were conducted every ten years from 1906 to 1946. This census was conducted as at June 1, 1936.

The entire population of Canada for 1936 was estimated at 10,950,000, an increase of 1.0% over the previous year.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Canada's ''[[Statistics Act]]'' legislation does not permit the release of personal information until 92 years have elapsed. Detailed information from this census is not due for release until 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 1921|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/Pages/census.aspx#after_1921|website=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:East-Hem 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Hemisphere at the end of the 1st century BC]]

The '''1st century [[Before Christ|BC]]''', also known as the '''last century BC''', started on the first day of [[100 BC|100&amp;nbsp;BC]] and ended on the last day of [[1 BC|1&amp;nbsp;BC]]. The [[Anno Domini|AD/BC notation]] does not use a [[year zero]]; however, [[astronomical year numbering]] does use a zero, as well as a minus sign, so "''2&amp;nbsp;BC''" is equal to "''year&amp;nbsp;–1''". This is the 100th century in the [[Holocene calendar]]; it spans the years 9,901 to 10,000. [[1st century AD]] ([[Anno Domini]]) follows.

In the course of the century all the remaining independent lands surrounding the Mediterranean were steadily brought under Roman control, being ruled either directly under governors or through puppet kings appointed by Rome. The Roman state itself was plunged into civil war several times, finally resulting in the marginalization of its 500-year-old republic, and the embodiment of total state power in a single man—the emperor. 

The internal turbulence that plagued Rome at this time can be seen as the death throes of the Roman Republic, as it finally gave way to the autocratic ambitions of powerful men like [[Sulla]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]]. Octavian's ascension to total power as the emperor [[Augustus]] is considered to mark the point in history where the [[Roman Republic]] ends and the [[Roman Empire]] begins. Some scholars refer to this event as the [[Roman Revolution]]. It is believed that the birth of [[Jesus]], the central figure of [[Christianity]] took place at the close of this century.

In the eastern mainland, the [[Han Dynasty]] began to decline and the court of [[China]] was in chaos in the latter half of this century. Trapped in a difficult situation, the [[Xiongnu]] had to begin emigration to the west or attach themselves to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]].

===Historical and chronological description of two Stones that were found in the plaza of Mexico upon the occasion of laying the new pavement===
This book was published in 1792. In it León y Gama described the discovery in 1790 of two of the most important pieces of aztec art in the [[Zócalo]], main plaza of the city of Mexico: the [[Aztec calendar stone|sun stone]] and a statue of [[Coatlicue]], an aztec goddess. León y Gama also included in it most of his knowledge and theories on how aztecs measured time. The work, as opposed to authors of previous centuries, praised Aztec society and their scientific and artistics achievements in line with the growing Mexican nationalism in the late 18th century. It was published by [[Felipe de Zúñiga y Ontiveros]], owner of one of the most important printing establishments in America at the time. In addition to print the book had three folded manuscript watercolor drawings. Thanks to the publication of the book León y Gama is considered by many the first Mexican archeologist.&lt;ref name="World Digital Library"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/516/ |title=Historical and Chronological Description of ... - World Digital Library |accessdate=2009-12-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091128225259/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/516/| archivedate= 28 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], there was an '''Austro-Slovene conflict in Carinthia''' in which ethnic [[Slovenes]] and ethnic [[Austrians|Germans]] (Austrians) fought for control of the linguistically mixed region between [[Styria]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].
The Slovenes were loyal to the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), while the Austrians were loyal to the newly proclaimed [[Republic of German Austria]]. The disputed territory had belonged to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]. At the centre of conflict was the position of the border that separated the two new states. In [[Slovene-language]] historiography, the conflict is known as the ''Boj za severno mejo'' ("battle for the northern border"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mss.svarog.si/zgodovina/4/index.php?page_id=8115|title = Nastanek novih meja – boj za severno mejo|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-10|website = Svarog|publisher = Svarog|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kamra.si/Default.aspx?module=5&amp;id=1728|title = Boji za severno mejo na Koroškem|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-10|website = KAMRA|publisher = KAMRA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[German-language]] historiography it is the ''Kärntner Abwehrkampf'' ("Carinthian defensive struggle").

==Background==
[[Slovene lands|Slovene-speaking regions]] were integrated into several [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] states throughout much of the [[2nd millennium]]. The idea of [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]]–speaking territories creating a new state of their own has been one of the key issues debated among [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[intelligentsia]] throughout the second part of the 19th century, especially in the aftermath of the [[spring of nations]]. As a consequence of Austro-Hungarian [[World War I|invasion]] of [[Serbian Kingdom]] the [[Yugoslav committee]] was formed, with its goal being the [[Creation of Yugoslavia|unification]] of South Slavic lands known as [[Yugoslavia]]. In 1916 the Serbian parliament in exile [[Corfu Declaration|voted]] in favour of creating a Kingdom of Yugoslavia as a plan of post-world war governance of the [[Balkan peninsula]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"&gt;[http://www.corfu.gr/en/profil/theatro.htm History of the municipal theatre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623224051/http://www.corfu.gr/en/profil/theatro.htm |date=June 23, 2007 }} from Corfu city hall Quote: "The Municipal Theatre was not only an Art-monument but also a historical one. On its premises the exiled Serbian parliament, the Skoupsina, held up meetings in 1916, which decided the creation of the new Unified Kingdom of Yugoslavia."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs===
As a consequence of the World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire began to dissolve even before an official end to war was declared. In period between 5–8 October 1918 a [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|pro-Yugoslav National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] took control over the regional administration in [[Zagreb]]. On 29 October the National Council declared the formation of a Yugoslav state, following a rejection of a plan of greater autonomy within [[Austria-Hungary]].
Entente powers did not recognise the newly found state before it [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|merged]] with [[Kingdom of Serbia]] only three days later in an effort to gain a stable and recognised country of all South Slavs, as well as discouraging [[Italy]] from conquering Slav-settled territory not accounted as war reparation to Italy in [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mss.svarog.si/zgodovina/4/index.php?page_id=8111|title=SVAROG APMG MSS|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Territorial claims ===
No formal border was yet recognised among the newly created entities, with both sides claiming that they are in control of the area along the ethnically mixed settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/razstava/razstava.aspx?item=1&amp;page=6|title = Prevzem vojaške oblasti na štajerskem|date = |accessdate = |website = Vojaški Muzej|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Government in Ljubljana did not pay any particular attention to the border issue, as it was planning on gaining much area through negotiations on the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace conference]]. The municipal council of the largely German-speaking town of [[Maribor]] (''Marburg an der Drau'') declared the municipality to be a part of German-Austria on 30 October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.maribor24.si/lokalno/maribor-ali-marburg/11532|title = Maribor24|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-10|website = Maribor ali Marburg|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escalation==

=== Mobilization ===
The National Council for Styria (Slovene: ''Narodni svet za Štajersko'') gave permission to take control of the military branch in Maribor to [[Rudolf Maister]], a veteran of the World War and a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army|officer of Austria-Hungary]]. He also gained the rank of a [[General]], and was given authority over all military forces located in [[Slovene Styria|Styria]] under control of the Kingdom of SHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/razstava/razstava.aspx?item=1&amp;page=6|title = Prevzem vojaške oblasti na štajerskem|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31 Rudolf Maister announced his disagreement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.24ur.com/praznujemo-dan-rudolfa-maistra.html|title = Praznujemo dan Rudolfa Maistra|date = |accessdate = |website = 24ur|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the municipal declaration of Maribor in front of an audience of  Lieutenant Colonel [[Anton Holik]] and his officers at the Melj military barracks of the 26th infantry regiment. On 9 November Maister announced full mobilization of Lower Styria, which was disagreed with by both, the German-Austrian government and authorities in Ljubljana. The mobilization decree was successful as the armed forces grew to about 4,000 fighters, and establishing a new infantry regiment in Maribor by November 21.&lt;ref name="rtvslo.si"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/razstave/kako-se-je-rudolf-maister-boril-za-severno-mejo/216513|title = Kako se je Rudolf Maister boril za severno mejo|date = |accessdate = |website = RTVSLO|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military movements begin ===
First Lieutenant [[Franjo Malgaj]] and his unit entered Carinthia on November 6. Captain Alfred Lavrič's unit was designated to be in charge of capturing Carinthia, and began taking control of the territory on 13 November, when his units entered the [[:de:wikipedia:Jauntal|Jaun Valley]] (German: ''Jauntal'', Slovene: ''Podjuna'') and [[Ferlach]] (Slovene: ''Borovlje''). The [[Loibl Pass]] (German: ''Loiblpass'', Slovene: ''prelaz Ljubelj'') was captured the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/razstava/razstava.aspx?item=1&amp;page=7|title = Boji na Koroškem, November 1918|date = |accessdate = |website = Vojaški muzej|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maister's fighters in carinthia.pdf|thumb|left|250px|Maister's fighters in Carinthia in 1919. The Slovene national flag is seen in the background]]
On November 23 Maister's fighters began to seize control of guard posts throughout the Maribor region by disarming the local guardsmen controlled by the Maribor municipality. Captain Rudolf Knez entered [[Sittersdorf]] (''Žitara vas'') and settled his units there. From November 27 onward, the Slovene fighters under direct command of Maister, took control of [[Spielfeld]] (''Špilje''), [[Bad Radkersburg]] (''Radgona''), [[Mureck]] (''Cmurek''), [[Leutschach]] (''Lučane''), [[Radlje ob Dravi|Marenberg]] (now Radlje ob Dravi), and [[Muta, Muta|Muta]] (''Hohenmauthen''), while the units from [[Celje]] under command of Franjo Malgaj took control of the [[:sl:wikipedia:Mežiška dolina|Meža Valley]] (''Mießtal''), [[Bleiburg]] (''Pliberk''), where Serb volunteers returning from the Eastern front of World War I also joined Malgaj's unit. All the areas captured were agreed upon by General [[Rudolf Passy]] of Carinthia and General Maister on November 27. The agreement included allowance to take control of all Slovene-majority settlements, but remained unsupported and criticized by Styrian, Carinthian, German-Austrian authorities, as well as the National council in Ljubljana. Units from Ljubljana took control of [[Dravograd]] (''Unterdrauburg''), [[Lavamünd]] (''Labot'') and [[Sankt Paul]] (''Šentpavel'').&lt;ref name="rtvslo.si"/&gt; The capture of [[Völkermarkt]] (''Velikovec'') on November 30 sparked much criticism, as it allegedly wasn't included in the demarcation line plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/razstava/razstava.aspx?item=1&amp;page=7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armed conflicts ===

First armed clashes already occurred under command of Malgaj during the attack on Bleiburg, but it was not until the battle in Lučane when violent confrontations became apparent. Lučane was the site of a first major clash between the two factions on January 14, 1919. Following minor fights between the two militias, a larger battle occurred on February 4 near Radgona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/razstave/kako-se-je-rudolf-maister-boril-za-severno-mejo/216513|title = Kako se je Rudolf Maister boril za severno mejo|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were set by Maister to attack and capture [[Klagenfurt]] (''Celovec'') but were abandoned following negotiations. On February 13 a peace treaty was signed by both parties.

== Graz-Ljubljana Protocol ==
With the occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops, and the confrontation evolving into armed clashes, the provisional Carinthian government under Governor Arthur Lemisch decided to lead off the armed struggle in order to preserve the southern Carinthian border on the Karawanks. Bitter fighting of paramilitary groups around Arnoldstein and Ferlach alarmed the Entente powers. They arbitrated a ceasefire, whereafter a nine-day U.S. Army commission under Lt. Col. Sherman Miles scouted the disputed region between river and mountains in January and February 1919 and made the crucial recommendation that the Karawanks frontier should be retained, thus opening the possibility of a [[Carinthian plebiscite, 1920|plebiscite]]. Yugoslav representatives urged for a border on the Drava; American delegates however spoke in favor of preserving the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and convinced the British and French delegations to support their plan of plebiscite for the entire Klagenfurt region.

== Yugoslav offensive and Austrian counter-offensive ==
On April 29, Yugoslav troops breached ceasefire agreement after months of relative peace. Armed clashes occurred throughout the region, with noticeable territorial gains achieved by Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Yugoslav troops experienced much resistance in the following days, as Austrian troops already made effective counter-offensive actions. The situation for Slovenes worsened, and on the 2nd of May Carinthian units had already taken control of Völkermarkt. Two days later Austrian counter-offensive reached the [[Gallizien]] (Slovene: ''Galicija'')-[[Apače]] (German: ''Abstall'')-[[Sankt Margareten im Rosental]] (''Šmarjeta'') line. After two days of fierce fighting the German-Austrian units successfully conquered the line and in process destroyed the 3rd infantry battalion from Ljubljana.

The remaining Slovene units continued to retreat back into lower Styria, while almost all of the Carinthian area that was gained during the winter clashes was lost to the advancing Austrian units. The last to fall was Dravograd before the Royal Yugoslav Army's 36th infantry regiment under control of Lt.Col. Vladimir Uzorinac managed to hold ground in [[Ravne na Koroškem|G''uštanj'']] (''Gutenstein in Kärnten'') and therefore stop the counter-offensive. General Maister sent two units of his Maribor infantry regiment to aid the troops holding ground near Slovenj Gradec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.franjomalgaj.si/index.php?site=vsebine_l&amp;kat=3955&amp;parent=0&amp;lid=1480|title = Ponesrečena ofenziva|date = |accessdate = |website = Franjo Malgaj|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officer Malgaj was killed on 6 May, one of the key leaders of the Slovene fighters in Carinthia.

After a military defeat in the offensive initiated in April, authorities in Ljubljana mobilised all their assets and drafted regiments from Serbia to regain lost territory. On May 26 a new offensive was authorised which lasted throughout May and until June 6, during which they managed to capture much of the Klagenfurt region to as north as [[Maria Saal]] (''Gospa Sveta''). The offensive was considered a military success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.franjomalgaj.si/index.php?site=vsebine_l&amp;kat=3955&amp;parent=0&amp;lid=1482|title = Boji se nadaljujejo|date = |accessdate = |website = Franjo Malgaj|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Carinthian plebiscite, 1920|l1=Carinthian Plebiscite, 1920}}

The Paris peace conference turned the tide, when an order was given to the Yugoslavs to completely retreat from the northern B zone of the Klagenfurt Basin area in a time frame set to end on 31 July, at the latest, to enable the commission to carry out the planned plebiscite.

The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] with the Republic of Austria, signed on 10 September 1919, should have determined the Austrian-Yugoslav border. It ascertained that some small parts of Carinthia, the Meža Valley with the town of Dravograd and the Jezersko municipal area, would be incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes while the fate of wider southeastern Carinthia area down to the Klagenfurt Basin was to be determined by a plebiscite.

The outcome of the plebiscite held on 10 October 1920, was 22,025 votes (59.1% of the total cast) for adhesion to Austria and 15,279 (40.9%) for annexation by the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. If the whole German-speaking minority voted for Austria, every second Carinthian Slovene agreed.

While a majority in the remote Alpine villages on the slopes of the Karawanks voted for Yugoslavia, the inhabitants of the densely-settled Klagenfurt Basin were motivated by their evolved social, cultural and economic ties to the central Carinthian region.

The region was placed under Austrian administration on 18 November 1920 and declared part of the sovereign Austrian Republic on November 22. Until today, October 10 is a public holiday in the State of Carinthia.

The plebiscite ultimately determined the border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The border remained unchanged after World War II, even as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia gave way to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], bur at the end of the war, Yugoslav Partisans again briefly occupied the area, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. Since the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the border separates [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].

'''Benedetto Bacchini''' or '''Bernardino Bacchini''' (August 31, 1651 – September 1, 1721) was an Italian monk and man of letters, born, Aug. 31, 1651, at Borgo San Domino, in the [[duchy of Parma]]. He studied at the Jesuit institution, and entered the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Order of St. Benedict]] in 1668, when he took the [[praenomen]] ''Bearnardin.'' Prepared by his studies, he devoted his attention to preaching. Having become secretary of the abbot of St. Benedict of Ferrara, he accompanied him to [[Venice]], [[Piacenza|Placentia]], Parma, and [[Padua]], and was known among the celebrated literati of the time. In 1683 he devoted himself entirely to the study of literature. In 1688 he became theologian of the [[duke of Parma]], who desired to secure a man of such merit. In 1689 he introduced into the regulations of the Benedictine Order of St. Alexander of Parma certain modifications, which resulted in his being obliged to leave Parma. The [[Duke of Ferrara and of Modena|duke of Modena]] appointed him in 1691 counsellor of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]]. After some journeys in the interests of science, he refused the offers of [[José Saenz d'Aguirre|cardinal Aguirre]], who wished to retain him at Rome, and was appointed librarian of the duke. In 1704 he was made [[prior]] of his order at Modena. He received other ecclesiastical honors, and died at [[Ferrara]], Sept. 1, 1721.

He wrote, ''Oratzione mell Esequie della Ser. Margherita de Medici, Duchessa di Parsma'' (1670):-De ''Ecclesiasticce Hierarchiec Originibus Dissertatio'' (Modena, 1703). See Hoefer, ''Nouv. Biog. Generale,'' s.v.

[[File:Connie Mack, Philadelphia Athletics manager, by Paul Thompson, 1911.jpg|thumb|right|Athlete and manager [[Connie Mack]] sporting a boater in 1911]]

A '''boater''' (also '''straw boater''', '''basher''', '''skimmer''', '''cady''', '''katie''', '''canotier''', '''somer''', '''sennit hat''', or in Japan, '''can-can hat''', '''suruken''') is a kind of summer [[hat]] worn by men, regarded as somewhat formal, and particularly popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

It is normally made of stiff [[sennit]] straw and has a stiff flat crown and brim, typically with a solid or striped [[grosgrain]] ribbon around the crown. Boaters were popular as summer headgear, especially for boating or sailing, hence the name. They were supposedly worn by [[FBI]] agents as a sort of unofficial uniform in the pre-[[World War II|war]] years. It was also worn by women, often with [[hatpin]]s to keep it in place. Nowadays they are rarely seen except at sailing or rowing events, period theatrical and musical performances (e.g. [[barbershop music]]) or as part of old-fashioned [[school uniforms]]. Since 1952, the straw boater hat has been part of the uniform of the [[Princeton University Band]], notably featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated Magazine]]'' in October, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://puband.mycpanel.princeton.edu/about/history/ History, The Princeton University Band]. Retrieved 2011-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Boaters are also a part of the traditional and persisting garb of [[barbershop quartet]]s. Recently, soft, thin straw hats with the approximate shape of a boater have been in fashion among women.

The boater is a fairly formal hat, equivalent in formality to the [[Homburg (hat)|Homburg]], and so is correctly worn either in its original setting with a blazer, or in the same situations as a Homburg, such as a smart lounge suit, or with black tie. [[John Jacob Astor IV]] was known for wearing such hats. Actors [[Harold Lloyd]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]] and the Italian engineer [[Stefano Zacchè]] were also famous for their trademark boater hats.

Inexpensive foam or plastic skimmers are sometimes seen at political rallies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1988_GOP_Convention.jpg 1988 GOP Convention]. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1952_Republican_National_Convention.jpg 1952 Republican National Convention]. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090308011011/http://i.l.cnn.net/cnn/2008/images/02/20/gall.delegates.gi.jpg 2004 Democratic Convention delegates wearing boaters]. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] the boater is still a common part of the school uniform in many boys' schools, such as at [[Harrow School]], [[Shore School]], [[Brisbane Boys' College]], [[Knox Grammar School]], [[Maritzburg College]], [[South African College School]], [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)]], [[Wynberg Boys' High School]], [[Parktown Boys' High School]] and numerous [[List of Christian Brothers schools|Christian Brothers schools]] (CCB).

The boater may also be seen worn by the "carreiros" of [[Madeira]], the drivers of the traditional wicker [[toboggan]]s carrying visitors from the parish church at [[Monte (Funchal)]] down towards [[Funchal]] centre.

[[Coco Chanel]] was fond of wearing boaters and made them fashionable among women during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/887106132|title=Coco Chanel|first1=Isabella|last1=Alston|first2=Kathryn|last2=Dixon|date=2014|publisher=TAJ Books International|isbn=9781844063826|location=Charlotte, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Straw Hat Day ==
[[File:Crowd awaits news of Dempsey - Carpentier.JPG|thumb|right|A sea of boaters in New York's [[Times Square]], July 1921]]
Being made of straw, the boater was and is generally regarded as a warm-weather hat.  In the days when all men wore hats when out of doors, "Straw Hat Day", the day when men switched from wearing their winter hats to their summer hats, was seen as a sign of the beginning of summer. The exact date of Straw Hat Day might vary slightly from place to place. For example, in [[Philadelphia]], it was May 15; at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], it was the second Saturday in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/traditions/heyday/straw_hat.html Straw Hat Day, University of Pennsylvania Archives]. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Its cold-weather counterpart was "Felt Hat Day", occurring in September or October. The practice of wearing formal hats largely disappeared by the mid-1900s; however, as late as 1963, Straw and Felt Hat Day were commemorated in an editorial in the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref name="Times 1963-09-17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sailors Out of Season |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1963-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, the convention was forcefully observed by young men who would seize and destroy any straw hat worn after the appointed day. On a number of [[stock exchange]] floors, traders wore straw hats with the deliberate intention of getting them destroyed.&lt;ref name="Times 1900-09-16"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sharp Break in the Ostracized Headgear on 'Change and on the Curb |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1900-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times 1921-09-26"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pittsburgh Brokers to Wear Their Straw Hats Until Oct. 1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1921-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Confusingly, the term "straw hat day" was used in that era to refer both to the day of their adoption, at the beginning of summer, and their destruction, at the end.)&lt;ref name="Times 1932-05-16"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor Cernak Will Proclaim Straw Hat Day for Chicago |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1932-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times 1900-09-16" /&gt; In 1922 in New York City, the tradition escalated into the [[Straw Hat Riot]], which lasted eight days, involved a mob of 1,000 young hat destroyers at its peak, and resulted in a number of arrests and injuries.&lt;ref name="Times 1922-09-16"&gt;{{cite news |title=City Has Wild Night of Straw Hat Riots |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1922-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bringing Them Home''''' is the [[Australia]]n ''Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] Children from Their Families''. The report marked a pivotal moment in the controversy that has come to be known as the [[Stolen Generations]].

The inquiry was established by the federal [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[Michael Lavarch]], on 11 May 1995, in response to efforts made by key Indigenous agencies and communities concerned that the general public's ignorance of the history of forcible removal was hindering the recognition of the needs of its victims and their families and the provision of services.&lt;ref name="bth1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/social_justice/bth_report/index.html|title=Bringing them home: The 'Stolen Children' report |accessdate=8 January 2008|publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 680-page report was tabled in Federal Parliament on 26 May 1997.&lt;ref name="hreochowtoaccess"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social%5FJustice/stolen%5Fchildren/how_to.html|title=How to access the 'Bringing them home' report, community guide, video and education module|accessdate=15 July 2008|publisher=HREOC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323085042/http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social_Justice/stolen_children/how_to.html|archivedate=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Aboriginal organisations pushed for a national inquiry as early as 1990. The Secretariat of the National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) resolved at its national conference in 1992 to demand a national inquiry. Other state Aboriginal organisations were also active during this period.

In 1994, the [[Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia]] (ALSWA) began soliciting statements from Aboriginal people who had been removed from their families as children or who were parents of removed children. The service interviewed over 600 people during this time and produced a report titled ''Telling our Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v11n4/buti114_text.html | journal= E LAW - Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law, Paper presented at the 23rd Annual [[Australian and New Zealand Law and History Society]] Conference, [[Murdoch University]], Western Australia (2–4 July 2004) | issn=1321-8247 | title = Bringing Them Home the ALSWA Way | author = [[Antonio Buti]] | date = December 2004 | volume =11 |number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioners==
The inquiry was primarily conducted by [[Ronald Wilson|Sir Ronald Wilson]], President of the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]], and [[Mick Dodson]], the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner.&lt;ref name="hreoccommissioners"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social%5FJustice/stolen%5Fchildren/commissioners.html|title=Inquiry Commissioners |accessdate=15 July 2008|publisher=HREOC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323085052/http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social_Justice/stolen_children/commissioners.html|archivedate=23 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous women, appointed as co-commissioners, provided support to the people who gave evidence in each region the inquiry visited. The co-commissioners were: Annette Peardon, Marjorie Thorpe, Dr Maryanne Bin Salik, Sadie Canning, Olive Knight, [[Kathy Mills]], Anne Louis, Laurel Williams, Jackie Huggins, Josephine Ptero-David and Professor [[Marcia Langton]]. The co-commissioners also assisted in the development of the report and its recommendations.&lt;ref name="hreoccommissioners"/&gt;

The inquiry also appointed an Indigenous Advisory Council made up of members from all the major regions of Australia. Members of the Council were: Annette Peardon, Brian Butler, Yami Lester, Irene Stainton, Floyd Chermside, Barbara Cummings, Grant Dradge, Carol Kendall, Lola McNaughton, [[Isabel Coe]], Peter Rotimah, Nigel D'Souza, Maureen Abbott, Margaret Ah Kee, Bill Lowah, Matilda House and Jim Wright.&lt;ref name="hreoccommissioners"/&gt;

==Hearings and submissions==
The inquiry undertook an extensive programme of hearings in every capital city and in many regional and smaller centres.

The first hearings took place on 4 December 1995 on Flinders Island with the last round of hearings ending on 3 October 1996 in Sydney.&lt;ref name="bth1"/&gt;

During the course of the inquiry 777 submissions were received,&lt;ref name="bth1"/&gt; which included 535 Indigenous individual and group submissions, 49 church submissions and 7 government submissions.

500 of the submissions were made [[Confidentiality|confidentially]].

==Report summary==
{{main|Stolen Generation}}
Two reports were produced:&lt;ref name="hreochowtoaccess"/&gt;
*Formal, 700-page report ''Bringing them Home'' and subtitled ''Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families''
*Less formal and shorter community guide called ''Bringing them Home—Community Guide'' and subtitled "A guide to the findings and recommendations of the National Inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families".&lt;ref name="BTH Guide"/&gt;

The Community Guide summarised the report's conclusions that "indigenous families and communities have endured gross violations of their [[human rights]]. These violations continue to affect indigenous people's daily lives. They were an act of [[genocide]], aimed at wiping out indigenous families, communities, and cultures, vital to the precious and inalienable heritage of Australia".&lt;ref name="BTH Guide"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/55165/20051230-0000/www.humanrights.gov.au/bth/additional_resources/bth_guide/bth.pdf |archive-date=30 December 2005  |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/bth/additional_resources/bth_guide/bth.pdf |title=Community Guide |accessdate=8 October 2010 |year=1997 |work=Bringing Them Home |publisher=[[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
The report made many recommendations, including that:
* Funding be made available to Indigenous agencies to allow Indigenous people affected by the forcible removal policies to record their history
* [[reparation (legal)|Reparations]] be made to people forcibly removed from their families, and that the [[Theo van Boven|van Boven]] principles guide reparation measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishr.ch/hrm/archive/CHRWG/Remedy/Remedy-3rdConsultation.pdf |title=BASIC PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES ON THE RIGHT TO A REMEDY AND REPARATION FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN LAW |accessdate=7 November 2006 |year=2004 |format=PDF |work=Third Consultative Meeting (Geneva, 29 September to 1&amp;nbsp;October 2004) |publisher=[[International Service for Human Rights]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326231119/http://www.ishr.ch/hrm/archive/CHRWG/Remedy/Remedy-3rdConsultation.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Australian Parliament]]s offer official apologies and acknowledge the responsibility of their predecessors for the laws, policies, and practices of forcible removal

==Government apologies==
Formal apologies have been tabled and passed by the Commonwealth Government, as well as the state parliaments of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1767768.htm| title = Lennon commits $5m for Stolen Generation| accessdate = 7 November 2006| date = 18 October 2006| publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the territory parliament of the [[Northern Territory]]. It may be that all states have done this because Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] was quoted in 1999 as saying that "every State Parliament has passed an apology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s46322.htm| title = Ridgeway puts apology back on political agenda |accessdate = 7 November 2006 |date=1999-08-24 | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] 7.30 Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[John Howard]] issued a statement of regret but resolutely refused to issue a formal apology. He has been quoted many times as refusing to take a [[black armband view of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |accessdate=2 November 2006 |last=McKenna |first=Dr Mark |date=10 November 1997 |publisher= Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]], who succeeded Mr. Howard, tabled a formal apology on 13 February 2008, which was passed unanimously.

===Federal===
On Thursday 26 August 1999, the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, moved a [[Motion of Reconciliation]], which included an expression of "deep and sincere regret that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those practices". The opposition leader [[Kim Beazley]] moved to replace Howard's motion of regret with an unreserved apology, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="hansard26aug1999"&gt;{{cite web | title=House of representatives Hansard Thursday 26&amp;nbsp;August 1999| date=26 August 1999 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr260899.pdf| format=PDF| pages=152| publisher= Parliament of Australia Hansard |accessdate=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2007, the newly elected government of Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] announced that an [[Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples|official apology]] would be made to Indigenous Australians. The wording of the apology would be decided in consultation with Indigenous leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/how-to-say-sorry-and-heal-the-wounds/2007/12/11/1197135463459.html | title = How to say sorry and heal the wounds | accessdate = 11 December 2007 | last = Peatling | first = Stephanie | date = 11 December 2007 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2008, at 9:00am ([[Australian Eastern Daylight Time|AEDT]]), Rudd tabled the following apology as the first order of business at the opening of Australia's Parliament in 2008; it was passed unanimously by the members of the lower house at 9:57&amp;nbsp;a.m.:

{{quotation|I move that:&lt;br /&gt;
Today we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history.&lt;br /&gt;
We reflect on their past mistreatment.&lt;br /&gt;
We reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generations—this blemished chapter in our national history.&lt;br /&gt;
The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page; a new page in Australia’s history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.&lt;br /&gt;
We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments, that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.&lt;br /&gt;
We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.&lt;br /&gt;
For the pain, suffering, and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;
For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written.&lt;br /&gt;
We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.&lt;br /&gt;
A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.&lt;br /&gt;
A future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in [[life expectancy]], educational achievement, and economic opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
A future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed.&lt;br /&gt;
A future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;
A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia.|[[Kevin Rudd]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]], 13 February 2008, at a sitting of the [[Parliament of Australia]].}}

===Victoria===
On 17 September 1997, the Premier of Victoria, [[Jeff Kennett]], moved a parliamentary motion that included the words: "That this House apologises to the Aboriginal people on behalf of all Victorians for the past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and expresses deep regret at the hurt and distress this has caused and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians".&lt;ref name="stateapologies"/&gt;

===Northern Territory===
On 24 October 2001, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, [[Clare Martin]], moved that the Northern Territory legislative assembly "apologises to Territorians who were removed from their families under the authority of the Commonwealth Aboriginals Ordinance and placed in institutional or foster care" and "calls upon the Commonwealth government to make a formal and specific apology to all those persons removed pursuant to the Aboriginals Ordinance, acknowledging that the Commonwealth failed in discharging its moral obligations towards them".&lt;ref name=HREOC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/social_justice/bth_report/apologies_states.html|title=Content of apologies by State and Territory Parliaments|accessdate=7 February 2008|year=2008|publisher=[[Australian Human Rights Commission]] |work=Bringing them home: Apologies by State and Territory Parliaments (2008) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The ''National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families'' sought to provide an opportunity to discover the experiences of people removed from their families. It was anticipated that given the trauma witnesses had experienced that they would be at risk of further trauma if they were to be [[cross examination|cross examined]] on their testimony and their evidence challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social_Justice/bth_report/report/ch1_part1.html|title= Bringing them Home - The Report|accessdate= 26 April 2008|year= 1997|publisher= Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|quote=I know people who have become extremely distraught at the thought of this inquiry ... If people have been traumatised and are still suffering from the effects of that trauma, they are re-traumatised every time something reminds them of the trauma, even people who have made some degree of recovery. And that is the case in any situation where there is a [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Things that remind people of the trauma will bring back memories of the trauma and severe distress (Jane McKendrick, Victorian Aboriginal Mental Health Network, evidence 310).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Social_Justice/bth_report/report/ch1_part1.html|title= Bringing them Home - The Report|accessdate= 26 April 2008|year= 1997|publisher= Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|quote=The nature of the Inquiry process and of the information sought and provided meant that evidence and submissions could not be tested as thoroughly as would occur in a courtroom. ... We carefully report what we have heard so that the community generally will know the different perspectives on what has occurred.

Among a number of criticisms of the report, also reflected in the arguments of those arguing the impact of the events described were exaggerated or minimising or denying their occurrence this "failure" to "prove the evidence" was considered critical, a number of other criticisms were made, chief among the critics were [[John Herron (Australian politician)|John Herron]]&lt;ref name="herron"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060613051523/http://australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc Senator the Hon John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to the Senate Legal And Constitutional References Committee, "Inquiry Into The Stolen Generation", Federal Government Submission, March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ron Brunton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Brunton  |first= Ron  |authorlink= Ron Brunton|title= Betraying the Victim: The Stolen Generations Report|url= http://www.ipa.org.au/files/IPABackgrounder10-1.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate= 15 July 2008|series= IPA Backgrounder|volume = 10|issue = 1|year=1998|publisher= Institute of Public Affairs Ltd|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061012011857/http://www.ipa.org.au/files/IPABackgrounder10-1.pdf  |dead-url= yes  |archivedate=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brunton |first=Ron |author-link=Ron Brunton |title=Letters to the Editor |journal=[[Indigenous Law Bulletin]] |volume=4 |issue=14 |pages=23 |date= |year=1998 |url=http://www.austlii.org/au/journals/ILB/1998/68.html |doi= |id= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |access-date=4 May 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414084308/http://www.austlii.org/au/journals/ILB/1998/68.html# |archive-date=14 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">For [[astronomy]] and [[calendar]] studies, the '''Callippic cycle''' (or Calippic) is a particular approximate [[Least common multiple|common multiple]] of the [[year]] (specifically the [[tropical year]]) and the [[Month#Synodic month|synodic month]], that was proposed by [[Callippus]] during 330 BC. It is a period of 76 years, as an improvement of the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]].

A century before Callippus, [[Meton]] had discovered the cycle in which 19 years equals 235 lunations.  If we assume a year is about {{frac|365|1|4}} days, 19 years total about 6940 days, which exceeds 235 lunations by almost a third of a day, and 19 tropical years by four tenths of a day. It implicitly gave the solar year a duration of {{frac|6940|19}} = 365 + {{frac|5|19 }} = 365 + {{frac|4}} + {{frac|76}} days = 365 d 6 h 18 min 56 s. Callippus accepted the 19-year cycle, but held that the duration of the year was more closely {{frac|365|1|4}} days (= 365 d 6 h), so he multiplied the 19-year cycle by 4 to obtain an integer number of days, and then omitted 1 day from the last 19-year cycle. Thus, he computed a cycle of 76 years that consists of 940 lunations and 27,759 days, which has been named the ''Callippic'' cycle after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Neugebauer | date = 1975 | title = A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy | volume = 1 | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | place = New York | pages = 621–624 | isbn = 0-387-06995-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cycle's error has been computed as one full day in 553 years,&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728 | title=Calippic Period|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0294 | volume=1 | page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 4.95 [[Parts per notation|parts per million]], in actuality 27,759 days in 76 years has a mean year of exactly {{frac|365|1|4}} days, which relative to the mean northward equinoctial year is about 11 minutes too long per year, in other words the cycle drifts another day late per {{frac|130|10|11}} years, which is considerably worse than the drift of the unrounded [[Metonic cycle]].  If the Callippic cycle is considered as closer to its unrounded length of {{frac|27,758|3|4}} days (based on 940 lunations) then its accuracy is essentially the same as the unrounded Metonic cycle (within a few seconds per year).  If it is considered as 940 lunations less one day then the Callippic mean year will be shortened by {{frac|76}} of a day (18 minutes 57 seconds), making it grossly too short, and it will also grossly drift ahead with respect to the mean lunar cycle at the rate of {{frac|940}} of a day (1 minute 31 seconds) per lunar month.  If the cycle length is truncated to 27,758 days then the mean year is 365 days 5 hours 41 minutes 3 seconds, or almost 8 minutes too brief per year, and it will drift ahead of the mean lunar cycle by about {{frac|({{frac|3|4}})|940}} day (1 minute 9 seconds) per lunar month. Altogether, the purported accuracy of this cycle is not impressive, but it is of historical interest.{{Citation needed | reason=lacks sources for calculation and underlying data. | date=January 2017}}

The first year of the first Callippic cycle began at the summer [[solstice]] of 330 BC (28 June in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]), and was subsequently used by later astronomers. In [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', for example, he cites (''Almagest'' VII 3, H25) observations by [[Timocharis]] during the 47th year of the first Callippic cycle (283 BC), when on the eighth of [[Anthesterion]], the [[Pleiades]] star cluster was [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{ Citation | last = Evans | first = James | date = 1998 | title = The History &amp; Practice of Ancient Astronomy | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | place = New York / Oxford | pages = 186&amp;ndash;187 | isbn = 0-19-509539-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Callippic calendar originally used the names of months from the [[Attic calendar]]. Later astronomers, such as [[Hipparchus]], preferred other calendars, including the ancient [[Egyptian calendar]]. Also Hipparchus invented his own [[Hipparchic cycle|Hipparchic calendar cycle]] as an improvement upon the Callippic cycle. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' provided some conversions between the Callippic and Egyptian calendars, such as that Anthesterion 8, 47th year of the first Callippic period was equivalent to day 29 of the month of [[Month of Hathor|Athyr]], during year 465 of [[Nabonassar]]. However, the original, complete form of the Callippic calendar is no longer known.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

The '''Centre for Medieval Studies (CMS)''' is a [[research centre]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]] dedicated to the history, thought, and artistic expression of the cultures that flourished during the [[Middle Ages]].

The centre was founded in 1964, with [[Bertie Wilkinson]] as its first director. Its foundation was announced in [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Graduate Center for Mediaeval Studies: University of Toronto |journal=Speculum |date=October 1963 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1017/S0038713400061698 |jstor=2851698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of the Center is to make available to students various approaches to the Middle Ages in programs of studies not available in existing departments. The purpose of the Center is the training of scholars who know the Middle Ages in depth as well as in breadth. The courses of study will freely cross limits of traditional disciplines and departments, but they will be limited to the Middle Ages. By concentrating on a single period, the student will be able to acquire in some depth the basic linguistic and technical skills necessary for teaching and research in mediaeval studies; these include palaeography, diplomatics, and vernacular languages, in which the Center is strong. He will also be able to read widely in the period. His research will follow the material of his subject in order to gain a better understanding of the cross currents and variations in the cultures, interests, and beliefs of the Middle Ages.}}

The centre had originated in a Medieval Club that met at [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/history/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] (PIMS), which had been founded in 1929 by [[Étienne Gilson]].

The Centre's logo was designed by [[Allan Fleming]], while he was head of graphic design at [[University of Toronto Press]], from 1968–76.&lt;ref name="device"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre Device |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/device/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is now located in the [[Lillian Massey Building]], part of [[Victoria University, Toronto]].

The '''Chausa hoard''', thus named after the place of discovery: [[Chausa]] or Chausagarh is located in the [[Buxar district]] of [[Bihar]] state, India.  This was the first known [[bronze]] hoard discovered in the Gangetic valley and consists of a set of 18 [[Jain]] bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Framing the Jina : Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History: Narratives ...

The '''County of Álava''' ({{lang-eu|Arabako konderria}}) was one of the [[Basque señoríos|Basque ''señoríos'']], a feudal territory during the 9th and 13th centuries that corresponds to present-day [[Álava]], in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Until its final incorporation into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in the year 1200, the County was governed by counts vassals of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Leon|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], being under the sphere of influence of one or the other at different times. The figure governing Alava received the title of Count of Álava.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez Díez, Gonzalo (2005).

== Counts of Álava ==

The Counts of Álava were the governing figures of the County of Álava and were, at different times, under the sphere of influence of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and, ultimately, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].

'''David Bierens de Haan''' (3 May 1822, [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 12 August 1895, [[Leiden]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[mathematician]] and [[historian of science]].

==Biography==
Bierens de Haan&lt;!--his last name is 'Bierens de Haan'--&gt; was a son of the rich merchant Abraham Pieterszoon de Haan (1795–1880) and Catharina Jacoba Bierens (1797–1835). In 1843 he completed a study in the exact sciences and received his [[PhD]] from the [[University of Leiden]] in 1847 under [[Gideon Janus Verdam]] (1802–1866) for the work ''&lt;!-- Dissertatio Mathematica Inauguralis --&gt;{{lang|la|De Lemniscata Bernouillana}}''. After this he became a teacher of physics and mathematics at a gymnasium in [[Deventer]]. In 1852 he married Johanna Catharina Justina {{Not a typo|I|Jssel}} de Schepper (1827–1906) in Deventer.

In 1856 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002430 |title=David Bierens de Haan (1822 - 1895) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1866 he was professor of mathematics at [[Leiden University]]. Since 1888 he was co-editor of the works of [[Christiaan Huygens]] and in 1892 edited the ''Algebra'' of [[Willem Smaasen]] (1820–1850).

He had a large library on mathematics, the history of science and pedagogy, which currently resides at the [[Leiden University Library]].

His most important contribution to mathematics consist of the issuing of a large [[table of integrals]] ''{{lang|fr|(Nouvelles) tables d'intégrales définies}}'' in 1858 (and 1867). His doctoral students include [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute]].

She has written many books about the [[Suffragettes]], and about women in history, most recently ''The Criminal Conversation of Mrs Norton'', for Random House (2012). The legal case that [[George Chapple Norton|George Norton]] brought against his free-thinking wife [[Caroline Norton|Caroline Sheridan]] for [[criminal conversation]] – adultery, that is – in 1836 was a scandal of the Georgian era, that drew in [[Lord Melbourne]] and other leading figures. Atkinson's book is "the liberating life story of the first feminist legislator", according to [[Kathy Lette]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbooks.co.uk/product.aspx?id=1848093012&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this fascinating book, Diane Atkinson does a lot more than simply remind us of a story that deserves to be more widely known", wrote Kathryn Hughes about Atkinson's ''Elsie and Mairi Go To War'': "She also given us a ripping yarn about two plucky English gels who performed miracles while also having the time of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Hughes,  [http://www.dianeatkinson.co.uk/gallery/reviews/mailonsunday26-07.html "The wild girls who turned into angels"], ''Mail on Sunday,'' 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She narrated the stage presentation ''[[Marilyn Imrie#Elsie and Mairi Go To War|Elsie and Mairi Go To War]]'' at the 2010 [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianeatkinson.co.uk/ElsieAndMairi_PressPack.pdf ''Elsie and Mairi Go To War'' – Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkinson's book ''Love and Dirt'' about the marriage of [[Arthur Munby]] and [[Hannah Cullwick]] was [http://www.dianeatkinson.co.uk/reviews.html also very widely reviewed] and Atkinson contributed to [http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/V/victorian-passions/arthur-munby/index.html ''Upstairs Downstairs Love''], a [[Channel Four]] drama documentary based upon it that was screened on 16 June 2008.

Atkinson was a curator at the [[Museum of London]] and prepared their Suffragette exhibition in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Atkinson, ''The Purple, White and Green: Suffragettes in London'', Museum of London Catalogue, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitri Bakradze''' ({{lang-ka|დიმიტრი ბაქრაძე}}) (26 October 1826 – 10 February 1890) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] scholar who authored several influential works in the history, archaeology and ethnography of Georgia and the [[Caucasus]].

He was born in the village Khashmi in [[Kakheti]], eastern Georgia (then under the [[Imperial Russia]]n rule). Educated at the theological academies of [[Tbilisi]] and [[Moscow]], Bakradze worked as a teacher at [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] and a governmental clerk at [[Kutaisi]] in the 1850s. At the same time, he regularly wrote articles on Georgia's history and ethnography for Georgian and Russian press. In 1861, Bakradze permanently settled in Tbilisi where he energetically engaged in public and scholarly activities. In 1875, he published his resonant work ''The Caucasus in Ancient Monuments of Christianity'' ({{lang-ru|Кавказ в древних памятниках христианства}}). In 1878, Bakradze was the first scholar to have travelled and studied [[Adjara]] and [[Tao-Klarjeti]], the historical Georgian lands recently recovered from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His accounts of this research appeared in several publications and, in 1879, he was elected a [[corresponding member]] of [[Imperial Academy of Sciences]], [[St. Petersburg]]. He helped found the [[Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians]] (1879), Society of Amateurs of Caucasian Archaeology (1873), the Society for Caucasian History and Archaeology (1881; chaired it until 1886) and the Museum of Church Antiquities at the [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral]] (1889). His last major work, ''The History of Georgia'' (Georgian: ისტორია საქართველოსი), appeared in 1889 and was an insightful study into the [[History of Georgia (country)|history of Georgia]] from the beginnings to the end of the 10th century. Bakradze died in Tbilisi in 1890. His son, [[Zakaria Bakradze]], was a general in the Georgian and Polish armies.

Hamilton began her career as an educator and head of the [[Bryn Mawr School]], a private college preparatory school for girls in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; however, Hamilton is best known for her essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.

Hamilton's second career as an author began after her retirement from Bryn Mawr School in 1922. She was sixty-two years old when her first book, ''The Greek Way,'' was published in 1930. It was an immediate success and a featured selection by the [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] in 1957. Hamilton's other notable works include ''The Roman Way'' (1932), ''The Prophets of Israel'' (1936), ''[[Mythology (book)|Mythology]]'' (1942), and ''The Echo of Greece'' (1957).

Critics have acclaimed Hamilton's books for their lively interpretations of ancient cultures, and she is described as the classical scholar who "brought into clear and brilliant focus the Golden Age of Greek life and thought&amp;nbsp;... with Homeric power and simplicity in her style of writing".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Her works are said to influence modern lives through a "realization of the refuge and strength in the past" to those "in the troubled present."&lt;ref name=Anniston/&gt; Hamilton's younger sister was [[Alice Hamilton]], an expert in industrial [[toxicology]] and the first woman appointed to the faculty of [[Harvard University]].

==Early life and education==
===Childhood and family===
Edith Hamilton, the eldest child of American parents Gertrude Pond (1840–1917) and Montgomery Hamilton (1843–1909), was born on August 12, 1867, in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]. Shortly after her birth, the Hamilton family returned to the United States and made their home in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], where Edith's grandfather, Allen Hamilton, had settled in the early 1820s. Edith spent her youth among her extended family in Fort Wayne.&lt;ref name=Weber40&gt;{{cite journal| author=Catherine E.

Edith's grandfather, Allen Hamilton, was an Irish immigrant who came to Indiana in 1823 by way of [[Canada]] and settled in Fort Wayne. In 1828 he married Emerine Holman, the daughter of [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]] Justice [[Jesse Lynch Holman]]. Allen Hamilton became a successful Fort Wayne businessman and a land speculator. Much of the city of Fort Wayne was built on land he once owned. The Hamilton family's large estate on a three-block area of downtown Fort Wayne included three homes.&lt;ref&gt;Edith's grandparents lived in the old homestead, called Old House; her uncle, Andrew Holman Hamilton, and his family lived in Red House; and Edith and her family lived in White House on the family compound. See Weber, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sicherman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sicherman|title=Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-01553-3|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family also built a home at [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]], where they spent many of their summers. For the most part, the second and third generations of the extended Hamilton family, which included Edith's family, as well as her uncles, aunts, and cousins, lived on inherited wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', pp. 14, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery Hamilton, a scholarly man of leisure, was one of Allen and Emerine (Holman) Hamilton's eleven children; however, only five of the siblings lived. Her father attended [[Princeton University]] and [[Harvard Law School]] and also studied in [[Germany]]. Montgomery met Gertrude Pond, the daughter of a wealthy [[Wall Street]] broker and sugar importer, while living in Germany. They were married in 1866.&lt;ref name=Weber40/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', pp. 15, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery Hamilton became a partner in a wholesale grocery business in Fort Wayne, but the partnership dissolved in 1885 and the business failure caused a financial loss for the family.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Montgomery Hamilton retreated from public life. Edith's mother, Gertrude, who loved modern literature and spoke several languages, remained socially active in the community and had "wide cultural and intellectual interests."&lt;ref name=Weber40/&gt; After the failure of her father's business, Edith realized that she would need to provide a livelihood for herself and decided to become an educator.&lt;ref name=Jayes729&gt;Jayes, p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith was the oldest of five siblings that included three sisters ([[Alice Hamilton|Alice]] (1869-1970), [[Margaret Hamilton (educator)|Margaret]] (1871-1969), and [[Norah Hamilton|Norah]] (1873-1945)) and a brother (Arthur "Quint" (1886-1967)), all of whom were accomplished in their respective fields. Edith became an educator and renowned author;  Alice became a founder of industrial medicine;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Hamilton became a resident of [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]], a settlement house that offered food, shelter, and educational classes as a charitable effort on the part of wealthy donors and scholars who volunteered their time. She later became a noted pioneer in industrial [[toxicology]], a professor of pathology Woman's Medical School of [[Northwestern University]], a special scientific investigator for the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Bureau of Labor]]. In 1919 Alice became the first woman professor (assistant professor of internal medicine) at [[Harvard Medical School]]. Later in life  she was a reformer, political activist, and consultant in the U.S. Division of Labor Standards. She also served as president of the [[National Consumers League]] and authored textbooks on industrial poisons and industrial toxicolory.

After graduating from [[Bryn Mawr College]], Landsberg also resided at Hull House, where she was in charge of its evening programs and shared a room with Alice Hamilton. Landsbert went on to teach Latin at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, where Edith was headmistress. Margaret later taught at Bryn Mawr School and served as its headmistress before retiring in 1935. See: Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', pp. 141 and 257. Alice considered Landsberg part of the Hamilton family: "I could not think of a life in which Clara did not have a great part, she has become part of my life almost as if she were one of us." See Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 197. See also: {{cite book | author=Sandra L.

Hamilton's youngest sibling, Arthur, was nineteen years her junior. He became a writer, professor of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and assistant dean for foreign students at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Arthur was the only sibling to marry; he and his wife, Mary Neal (d. 1965), had no children.&lt;ref name=Weber40/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Because Edith's parents disliked the public school system's curriculum, they taught their children at home.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt; As she once described him, "My father was well-to-do, but he wasn't interested in making money; he was interested in making people use their minds."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''New York Times'', Obituary, June 1, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Edith, who learned to read at an early age, became an excellent storyteller. Hamilton credited her father for guiding her towards studies of the classics; he began teaching her [[Latin]] when she was seven years old. Her father also introduced her to [[Greek language]] and literature, where her mother taught the Hamilton children [[French language|French]] and had them tutored in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber40/&gt;

In 1884 Edith began two years of study at Miss Porter's Finishing School for Young Ladies (now known as [[Miss Porter's School]]) in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], where attendance was a family tradition for the Hamilton women.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt; Three of Hamilton's aunts, three cousins, and her three sisters attended the school.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton returned to Indiana in 1886 and began four years of preparation prior to her acceptance at [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1891. She majored in Greek and Latin and was awarded a [[bachelor of arts]] and a [[master of arts]] degree in 1894. Hamilton spent the year after her graduation as a fellow in Latin at Bryn Mawr College and was awarded the Mary E. Garrett European Fellowship, the college's highest honor. The cash award from Bryn Mawr provided funds to enable Edith and Alice, who had completed her medical degree at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1893,  to pursue further studies in Germany for an academic year.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton became the first woman to enroll at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=Kort&gt;

====Studies in Germany====
In the fall of 1895 the Hamilton sisters departed for Germany,&lt;ref name=Weber43&gt;Weber, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; where Alice intended to continue her studies in [[pathology]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] and Edith planned to study the classics and attend lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, most North American women, including Edith and Alice, registered as auditors for their classes.&lt;ref&gt;Their adventures in Germany are described in Alice's autobiography. See {{cite book | author=[[Alice Hamilton]] | title =Exploring the Dangerous Trades: the Autobiography of Alice Hamilton, M.D. | publisher = Northeastern University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1985 | location =Boston | pages =44–51 | url = | isbn =0-930350-81-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;{{cite book | author=Sandra L.

They were informed that women could attend lectures, but they were expected to remain "invisible" and would not be allowed to participate in discussions.&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;

According to Alice, "Edith was extremely disappointed with the lectures she attended."&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt; Although they were thorough, the lectures "lost sight of the beauty of literature by focusing on obscure grammatical points."&lt;ref&gt;Alice remarked, "Instead of the grandeur and beauty of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], it seemed that the important thing was their use of the [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)#Second|second aorist]]." See Singer, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they decided to enroll at the [[University of Munich]], but it was not much of an improvement. Initially, it was uncertain whether Edith would be allowed to audit lectures, but she was granted permission to do so, albeit under trying conditions.&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt; According to Alice, when Edith arrived at her first class, she was escorted to the lecture platform and seated in a chair beside the lecturer, facing the audience, "so that nobody would be contaminated by contact with her."&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alice44-45&gt;Hamilton, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Edith is quoted as saying, "the head of the University used to stare at me, then shake his head and say sadly to a colleague, 'There now, you see what's happened? We're right in the midst of the woman question.'"&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;

==Career==
===Educator===
Hamilton intended to remain in Munich, Germany, to earn a doctoral degree, but her plans changed after [[Martha Carey Thomas]], president of Bryn Mawr College, persuaded Hamilton to return to the United States. In 1896 Hamilton became head administrator of [[Bryn Mawr School]].&lt;ref name=Weber43/&gt; Founded in 1885 as a college preparatory school for girls in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Bryn Mawr School was the country's only private high school for women that prepared all of its students for collegiate coursework. The school's students were required to pass Bryn Mawr College's entrance exam as a requirement for graduation.&lt;ref name=Jayes729/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt;

Although Hamilton never completed her doctorate, she did become an "inspiring and respected head of the school"&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt; and was revered as an outstanding teacher of the classics, along with being an effective and successful administrator. She enhanced student life, maintained its high academic standards, and offered new ideas. Hamilton was unafraid to suggest new initiatives such as having her school's basketball team compete against another girls' team from a nearby boarding school. The proposed athletic competition was considered a scandalous suggestion for the time because news coverage would include the names of the participants. After Hamilton convinced the local press not to cover the event, the games proceeded and it became an annual tradition.&lt;ref name=Weber38&gt;Weber, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jayes730&gt;Jayes, p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Hamilton's accomplishments as an educator and administrator were recognized when she was named the first headmistress in the school's history.&lt;ref name=Jayes730/&gt; Hamilton, who believed in providing students with a "rigorous" curriculum, successfully transitioned the girls school from its "mediocre beginnings into one of the foremost preparatory institutions in the country."&lt;ref name=Weber44&gt;Weber, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Her insistence on offering challenging standards to the students and different options on school policies led to confrontations with Dean Thomas. As Hamilton became increasingly frustrated with the situation at the school, her health also declined. She retired in 1922 at the age of fifty-four, after twenty-six years of service to the school.&lt;ref name=Jayes730/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', pp. 252, 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classicist and author===
After retiring as an educator in 1922 and moving to New York City in 1924, Hamilton began a second career as an author of essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.&lt;ref name=NAW308&gt;Sicherman and Green, ''Notable American Women'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; She had studied Greek and Latin from her youth and it remained her lifelong interest. "I came to the Greeks early," Hamilton told an interviewer when she was ninety-one, "and I found answers in them. Greece's great men let all their acts turn on the immortality of the soul. We don't really act as if we believed in the soul's immortality and that's why we are where we are today."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

For more than fifty years her "love affair with Greece had smoldered without literary outlet".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; At the suggestion of Rosamund Gilder, editor of ''[[Theatre Arts Magazine|Theater Arts Monthly]],'' Hamilton began by writing essays about [[Greek drama]] and comedies. Several of her early articles were published in ''Theater Arts Monthly'' before she began writing the series of books on ancient Greek and Roman life for which she is most noted. Hamilton went on to become America's most renowned [[classicist]] of her era.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt;

According to her biographer, Barbara Sicherman, Hamilton's life was "ruled by a passionately nonconformist vision" that was also the source of her "strength and vitality" as well as her "appeal as public figure and author."&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt; However, Hamilton was not, and did not claim to be, a scholar. She did not attempt to present excessive detailed facts from the past. Instead, Hamilton focused on readability and uncovering "truths of the spirit," which she found from ancient writers.&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt; Drawing from Greek, Roman, Hebrew, and early Christian writings, Hamilton put into words what ancient people were like by concentrating on what they wrote about their own lives. Using the qualities and styles of the ancient writers, she emulated their directness, strived for perfection, and did not include footnotes.&lt;ref name=Current/&gt;

;''The Greek Way''
Hamilton was sixty-two when her first book, ''The Greek Way'', was published in 1930 and is considered by some as her most honored work,&lt;ref name=Current&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Moritz, ed.|title=Current Biography Yearbook, 1963 |publisher=H. W. Wilson Company |location=New York |year=1964|pages=175–77|url=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful book, which Hamilton wrote at the urging of Elling Annestad, an editor at [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W. W. Norton Company]], made her a well-known author in the United States. The bestseller drew comparisons between ancient Greece and modern-day life with essays about some of the great figures of Athenian history and literature. Critically praised for its "vivid and graceful prose," the book brought Hamilton immediate acclaim and established her reputation as a scholar.&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt; Biographer [[Robert Kanigel]] states that "''The Greek Way'' renders the ancient Greek mind accessible to the modern reader. It serves up a delectable appetizer of Greek civilization that leaves you begging for the rest of the meal. It is a work of popularization of the highest order."&lt;ref name=Kanigel&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Kanigel |title=Vintage Reading: From Plato to Bradbury |publisher=Bancroft Press |location= |year=1998 |page=121 |url=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamilton's view, Greek civilization at its peak represented a "flowering of the mind" that has yet to be equaled in the history of the world.&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal| author=Thomas B. Sherman | title =Quality of Life in the Great Days of Greece | journal =Saint Louis Post-Dispatch | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =November 28, 1948| url =| accessdate = }} (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Greek Way'' showed that the Greeks recognized and appreciated such things as love, athletic games, love of knowledge, fine arts, and intelligent conversation.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt; In "East and West," the first of the book's twelve chapters, Hamilton described the differences between the West and the  Eastern nations which preceded it. One book reviewer noted that the Greeks, which Hamilton considered the first Westerners, challenged Eastern ways that "remained the same throughout the ages, forever remote from all that is modern." Hamilton further suggested that the modern spirit of the West was "a Greek discovery, and the place of the Greeks is in the modern world."&lt;ref name=Schilplin&gt;{{cite journal| author=Maud Schilplin | title =''The Greek Way'' Reviewed | journal =Saint Cloud Times | volume = | issue = | page=6 | publisher = | location = | date =January 26, 1932| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent writers have used Hamilton's observations in contrasting the civilizations and cultures of the East with that of the West. In comparing ancient Egypt with Greece, for instance, Hamilton's writing describes the unique geography, climate, agriculture, and government. Historian James Golden cites from ''The Greek Way'' that "Egyptian society was preoccupied with death." Its [[pharaohs]] erected giant monuments to themselves to impress future generations and its priests advised the slaves to "look forward to an afterlife."&lt;ref name=Golden&gt;{{cite book |author=James L. Golden|title=The Rhetoric of Western Thought|publisher=Kendall Hunt |year=2004|location= |page=38 |url= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden used Hamilton's research to contrast these differences with the Greeks, especially the Athenians. Hamilton argued that individual "perfection of mind and body" dominated Greek thought and as a result, the Greeks "excelled at philosophy and sports" and that life "in all its exuberant potential" was the hallmark of Greek civilization.&lt;ref name=Golden/&gt;

;''The Roman Way''
''The Roman Way'' (1932), her second book, provided similar contrasts between ancient [[Rome]] and present-day life. It was also a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1957.&lt;ref name=Weber44/&gt; Hamilton described life as it existed according to ancient Roman poets such as [[Plautus]], [[Virgil]] and [[Juvenal]], interpreted Roman thought and manners, and compared them to people's lives in the twentieth century. She also suggested how Roman ideas applied to the modern world.&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt;&lt;ref name=Current/&gt;

Although her books were successful and popular among readers, she conceded "that it was hopeless to persuade Americans to be Greeks" and that "life had become far too complex since the age of [[Pericles]] to recapture the simple directness of Greek life&amp;nbsp;... the calm lucidity of the Greek mind, which convinced the great thinkers of Athens of their mastery of truth and enlightenment."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

;''The Prophets of Israel''
Her books later covered other areas of interest, especially from the Bible. In 1936 Hamilton wrote ''The Prophets of Israel'' (Norton, 1936), which interpreted the beliefs of the "spokesmen for God" in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt; With no knowledge of the Hebrew language, she relied on English language versions of the Bible to similarly compare the achievements and personal lives of the prophets with those of twentieth-century readers.&lt;ref name=Current/&gt; She concludes that the prophets were practical and their political views reflected their time, but their ideals were modern.&lt;ref name=Hamilton1&gt;{{cite journal| author= | title =Israel's Men of Genius in Fine Survey | journal =Publishers Weekly | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =November 22, 1936| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton also summarized the importance of that connection to people in modern times: "Love and grief and joy remain the same forever beautiful" and "poetic truth is always true" as are truths of the spirit. "The prophets understand them as no men have more, and in their pages we can find ourselves. Our aspirations are there, our desires for humanity."&lt;ref name=Hamilton1/&gt; American historian [[Bruce Catton]] noted the prophets, whose "religion was an affair of the workaday world," and their messages that Hamilton described in her "excellent book" are still as relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bruce Catton | title =A Modern Message From Ancient Israel | journal =Lansing State Journal | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location =Lansing, Michigan | date =May 25, 1936| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent edition of the book, ''Spokesmen for God: The Great Teachers of the Old Testament'' (Norton, 1949), supplied additional commentary on the first five books of the Old Testament. Christian Science historian [[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]] described it as "a work of sheer delight."&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Science Monitor'', Nov. 17, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Mythology''
[[John Mason Brown]], American drama critic, praised Hamilton's ''The Greek Way'', placing it at the top among modern-day written about ancient Greece," and ''Mythology'' as "incomparably superior to [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s work on the subject.&lt;ref name=Citizen/&gt; Hamilton's ''Mythology'' (1941), recounts the stories of classical mythology and ancient fables.&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt; She used an approach to [[mythology]] that was entirely through the literature of the [[classics]]. (She had not traveled to Greece until 1929 and was not an [[archaeology|archaeologist]].) The book received favorable reviews, was another a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and had sold more than four and a half million copies by 1957.&lt;ref name=Citizen&gt;{{cite journal| author= | title =Honorable Citizen | journal =The Hartford Courant | volume = | issue = | page=128 | publisher = | location =Hartford, Connecticut | date =September 22, 1968| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp. 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Later works
In 1942, after moving to Washington, D.C., Hamilton continued to write. At the age of eighty-two she offered new perspectives on the [[New Testament]] in ''Witness to the Truth: Christ and His Interpreters'' (1948) and produced a sequel to ''The Greek Way'', titled ''The Echo of Greece'' (1957).&lt;ref name=Kort/&gt; The sequel to her first book discusses the political ideas of such teachers and leaders as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], and [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=Current/&gt;

Hamilton continued traveling and lecturing in her eighties, and wrote articles, reviews, and translations of Greek plays, including ''The Trojan Women,'', ''Prometheus Bound,'' and ''Agamemnon.'' She also edited ''The Collected Dialogues of Plato'' (1961).&lt;ref name=Citizen/&gt;

==Doris Fielding Reid==
Doris Fielding Reid (September 4, 1895 – January 16, 1973) was an American stockbroker. She was the daughter of [[Harry Fielding Reid]], an American geophysicist,&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Hamburger Archives of the Johns Hopkins University Libraries, correspondence between the subject and colleagues/family members, and a biography of Reid written by Andrew Lawson and Perry Byerly for the Biographical Memoirs of the National Aacdemy of Sciences, vol.

Reid was employed by Loomis, Sayles and Company beginning in 1929. Reid and Hamilton became lifelong companions. They lived together in [[Gramercy Park]], Manhattan and Sea Wall, Maine, during which time they raised and home-schooled Reid's nephew, Francis Dorian Fielding Reid (1917-1973).&lt;ref name="Dorian obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/magazine/in_memory/1938/dorianreid |title=Dorian F.

==Later years==
Hamilton and Doris Reid remained in New York City until 1943, then moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], and spent their summers in Maine. In Washington, Reid was in charge of the local offices of [[Loomis, Sayles &amp; Company|Loomis, Sayles and Company]], an investment firm that had been her employer since 1929; Hamilton continued to write and frequently entertained friends, fellow writers, government representatives, and other dignitaries at her home. Among the eminent and famous were [[Isak Dinesen]], [[Robert Frost]], Harvard classicist [[Werner Jaeger]] and labor leader [[John L. Lewis]].&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt;

After her move to Washington, Hamilton became a commentator on education projects and began to receive honors for her work. Hamilton also recorded programs for television programs and [[Voice of America]], traveled to Europe, and continued to write books, articles, essays, and book reviews.&lt;ref name=Weber47&gt;Weber, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|px240|The Parthenon]]
Hamilton considered the high point of her life to be a trip to [[Greece]] at age 90 in 1957,&lt;ref name=Hallett151&gt;Hallett, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; where, in [[Athens]], she saw her translation of [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' performed at the ancient [[Odeon (building)|Odeon]] theater of [[Herodes Atticus]]. As part of the evening's ceremonies, King [[Paul of Greece]] awarded the Golden Cross of the [[Order of Beneficence (Greece)|Order of Benefaction]] — one of Greece's highest honors — to her. The mayor of Athens made her an honorary citizen of the city.&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber47/&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizen/&gt; The US news media, including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, covered the event. An article in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' described the event in Hamilton's honor: floodlights illuminated the [[Parthenon]], the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Zeus]] and, for the first time in history, the [[Stoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter= Chapter 17| editor-first= Kathryn |editor-last= Bosher| title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek Drama in the Americas | series = | volume = | edition = | publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2015 | pages = | url =  | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton called the ceremony "the proudest moment of my life."&lt;ref name=Bosher&gt;As ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' described the event in Hamilton's honor, floodlights illuminated the [[Parthenon]], the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Zeus]] and, for the first time in history, the [[Stoa]].

==Modern influences==
Many of the facts in ''The Greek Way'' (1930) have surprised modern readers. One reviewer in Australia explained Hamilton's view "that the spirit of our age is a Greek discovery, and that the Greeks were really the first Westerners, and the first intellectualists." The same reviewer also credited the book with noting that modern concepts of play and sport were actually common activities to the Greeks, who engaged in exercise and athletic events, including games, races, and music, dancing, and wrestling competitions, among others.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Greek Way', Its Modern Value", ''The Age'' (Melbourne, Australia), December 6, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those whose lives were influenced by Hamilton's writings was [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. In the months after his brother, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], was assassinated, Robert was consumed with grief.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite book | author=Evan Thomas | title =Robert Kennedy: His Life | publisher =Simon and Schuster | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2002 | location = | pages = | url = | isbn =9780743203296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] gave him a copy of ''The Greek Way,'' which she felt was certain to help him. Political commentator [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] reported that Hamilton's essays helped him better understand and then recover from his brother's tragic death.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;{{cite journal| author=David Brooks  | title =After JFK's death, Bobby Kennedy drew strength from ancient Greeks | journal =Arizona Daily Star | volume = | issue = | page=7 | publisher = | location = | date =November 28, 2006| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's writings remained important to him over time, as Brooks explains, and changed Kennedy's life. "He carried his beaten, underlined and annotated copy around with him for years, reading sections aloud to audiences in a flat, unrhythmic voice with a mournful edge" and could recite from memory various passages of [[Aeschylus]] that Hamilton had translated.&lt;ref name=Brooks/&gt;

According to reviewers, Hamilton's ''The Prophets of Israel'' (1936) had similarities to her earlier books about Greeks and Romans by making the prophets' messages relevant to contemporary readers. She accomplishes this, according to one writer, by showing that "behind all great thought stands an individual mind, fired by passion and possessed of an eye that sees deeply into humanity."&lt;ref name=Detroit1&gt;{{cite journal| author= | title =Americans Welcome Book About Prophets | journal =Detroit Free Press | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location =Detroit, Michigan | date =June 21, 1936| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of the prophets, it adds, are very similar to those in modern times: "The prophets were forerunners of three genuinely American movements{{mdash}}[[humanism]], [[pragmatism]] and the philosophy of common sense."&lt;ref name=Detroit1/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hamilton died in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 1963, at the age of nearly ninety-six. Four years after her death, Doris Fielding Reid published ''Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait.'' As of 2017 the memoir remains the only full-length biography of Hamilton. Reid died on January 15, 1973. Both women are buried at Cove Cemetery in [[Hadlyme North Historic District|Hadlyme]], Connecticut,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Doris Fielding Reid | work = | publisher =Find A Grave | date =September 10, 2014 | url =https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Reid&amp;GSfn=Doris&amp;GSmn=Fielding&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=8&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=135699598&amp;df=all&amp; | format = | accessdate =May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Hamilton's sisters had retired, in the same cemetery as Hamilton's mother (Gertrude) and her sisters (Alice, Norah, and Margaret), and Margaret's life partner, Clara Landsberg.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt; Hamilton's adopted son, Dorian, a graduate of from [[Amherst College]], where he earned a degree in [[chemistry]], died at [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], in January 2008, at the age of ninety.&lt;ref name=Hallett151/&gt;

Hamilton was long recognized as a great classicist of her era. Her best-selling books were especially noteworthy for their accessibility to a wide readership and for "representing the Greeks in particular as a prestigious source of cultural inspiration for American society during the decade before and the two decades after [[World War II]]."&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt;

Although Hamilton's reputation as an author is closely tied to her writings about Greece, much of her professional life focused on Latin. Hamilton "claimed special expertise in Greek," but after her graduation from Bryn Mawr College, where she majored in Greek and Latin, she spent another year at the college as a fellow in Latin and another year studying Latin in Germany. Hamilton also taught Latin to girls in the senior class during her twenty-six-year career at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. However, with the exception of ''The Roman Way'', Hamilton's written works primarily focused on fourth and fifth century [[Anno Domini|BC]] Athens.&lt;ref name=Hallett151/&gt; Hamilton's correspondence and papers are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]].&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt;

==Honors and recognition==
In 1906 Hamilton became the first headmistress of the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name=Jayes730/&gt;

In 1950 Hamilton received an honorary degrees of [[Doctor of Letters]] from the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. She was also the recipient of an honorary degree from [[Yale University]] in 1960. In addition, Hamilton was elected to the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1955 and the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, ''Alice Hamilton, A Life in Letters'', p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite book |author=Edith Hamilton | title =The Echo of Greece | publisher =W. W. Norton and Company | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1957 | location = | pages = | url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton received the National Achievement Award in 1951 as a distinguished classical scholar and author. She received the award along with Anna M. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Defense. The award was created in 1930 to honor women of accomplishment and inspire others.&lt;ref name=Anniston&gt;"Anna Rosenberg, Mrs. Hamilton Get U.S. Achievement Awards", ''The Anniston Star'', Feb. 25, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton was awarded the Golden Cross of the Order of Benefaction, Greece's highest honor, and became an honorary citizen of the city in 1957.&lt;ref name=Hallett151/&gt;

In 1957 and 1958 she was interviewed by NBC television, and in 1957 ''The Greek Way'' and ''The Roman Way'' were selected by the [[Book of the Month Club]] as summer readings. [[John F. Kennedy]] invited her to his inauguration, which she declined. He also sent an emissary to her home asking for advice about a new cultural center.&lt;ref name=NAW308/&gt;

In 1958 the Women's National Book Association awarded her for her contribution to American culture through books. [[George V. Allen]], director of the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) and one of the speakers at the award ceremony, remarked that her interpretation of the democratic spirit of ancient Greece, defined "the fundamental of the democratic ideal itself." He also noted that USIA included seven of her books in its overseas libraries in order to help people of other countries interpret American ideals.&lt;ref name=Current/&gt;

She is the subject of a biography by Doris Fielding Reid, ''Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

On April 4, 1968, while attending a campaign rally in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], on the eve of the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] quoted from Hamilton's translated works "in what is perhaps his most memorable [[Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|speech]]."&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt; Kennedy quoted from memory several lines from Hamilton's translation of [[Aeschylus]]'s tragedy, ''[[Agamemnon]]'', telling the grief-stricken crowd: "In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert F. [https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/RFK-Speeches/Statement-on-the-Assassination-of-Martin-Luther-King.aspx "Robert F Kennedy Speeches"], [[The Kennedy Library]], Boston, 4 April 1968. Retrieved on 09 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy also incorporated another line from Hamilton's writing, "her representation of an ancient Greek inscription" in his closing remarks to the crowd: "Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago––to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world."&lt;ref name=Hallett151/&gt; According to classicist Joseph Casazza, that line about "taming the savageness of man" was created by Hamilton herself and has no direct relation to a single ancient text. Based on his research, Casazza believes that the phrase is a combination of a line from a 125 B.C. decree about Athens by Delphi and another line from ''On the Character of Thucydides'' by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;Casazza, Joseph. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4352738.html "Taming the Savageness of Man": Robert Kennedy, Edith Hamilton, and Their Sources"], ''The Classical World'', Baltimore, Winter 2003. Retrieved on 09 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, erected statues of two Hamilton sisters, Edith and Alice, along with their cousin, Agnes, in the city's Headwaters Park.&lt;ref name=Hallett150/&gt;

The '''Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimo centras}} or ''LGGRTC'') is a state-funded research institute in [[Lithuania]] dedicated to "the study of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Lithuania; the study of the persecution of local residents by occupying regimes; the study of armed and unarmed resistance to occupying regimes; the initiation of the legal evaluation of the activities of the organisers and implementers of genocide; and the commemoration of freedom fighters and genocide victims." The centre was founded on 25 October 1992 by the [[Supreme Council of the Lithuanian Republic]] as the "State Genocide Research Centre of Lithuania".&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.genocid.lt/centras/en/# AN OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE GENOCIDE AND RESISTANCE RESEARCH CENTRE OF LITHUANIA] (retrieved March 4, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=belonging&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8QpeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT108&amp;lpg=PT108&amp; Modernity in Crisis: A Dialogue on the Culture of Belonging]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member organisation of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].&lt;ref name="Platform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/10/20/czech-prime-minister-petr-necas-the-years-of-totalitarianism-were-years-of-struggle-for-liberty/|title= Czech Prime minister Petr Nečas: The years of totalitarianism were years of struggle for liberty|last=|first=|date=14 October 2011|publisher=[[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]]|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The Center considers the resistance to be the Lithuanian nationalist partisans during World War II who fought communist partisans. This includes fascist groups such as the [[Lithuanian Activist Front]]. One anti-Soviet partisan controversially honored by the center is {{Interlanguage link multi|Jonas Noreika|lt}}, who led the extermination of the Jews in the city of [[Plungė]].&lt;ref name=slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2015/07/lithuania_and_nazis_the_country_wants_to_forget_its_collaborationist_past.html Slate: Double Genocide - Lithuania wants to erase its ugly history of Nazi collaboration—by accusing Jewish partisans who fought the Germans of war crimes.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vilnews.com/2015-11-20832 Doing business in Lithuania]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Centre recommends former members of resistance for larger state pensions and other awards.&lt;ref name=pension/&gt;

The Center is a strong advocate of the "Lithuanian genocide thesis" and sees itself as a "guardian" of Lithuanian memory.&lt;ref&gt;Pettai, Eva-Clarita. "Negotiating history for reconciliation: a comparative evaluation of the Baltic presidential commissions." Europe-Asia Studies 67.7 (2015): 1079-1101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center uses a broadened definition of "genocide" including the targeting of social, political, and economic groups by Stalin.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;  The center declares an equivalence between Nazi and Soviet crimes, this "[[Holocaust uniqueness debate|double genocide]]" formulation is common in Eastern Europe, particularly the Baltic States.&lt;ref name=belonging/&gt;&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; However in practice the Nazi genocide of the Jews and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Lithuania|Lithuanian collaboration]] is minimized, while the "genocide" of Lithuanians by Soviet partisans is described extensively. One plaque at the Genocide Center says that these partisans were “mostly of Jewish nationality [since] native people didn’t support Soviet partisans.” &lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

==Activities==
In 1998, Lithuania passed a law restricting employment in the public sector for former employees of the [[KGB]], the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], and other Soviet security institutions. The centre and the State Security Department had the authority to determine whether a person was an employee of the KGB.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; In 2002, commemorating the 30th anniversary of [[Romas Kalanta|Romas Kalanta's self-immolation]], [[Seimas]] listed May 14 as the Civil Resistance Day ({{lang-lt|Pilietinio pasipriešinimo diena}}) based on recommendations by the centre.&lt;ref name=bns2/&gt;

The centre publishes the journal ''Genocidas ir rezistencija''. One of its long-term research projects is a database and multi-volume publication of names and biographies of the victims of the Soviet and Nazi persecutions.&lt;ref name=bns4/&gt;  In 2001–2001, the centre handled some 22,000 applications for compensation from the [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"]].&lt;ref name=bns3/&gt;

The centre operates the [[Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights]] in the former prison of [[KGB]] in [[Vilnius]] and memorial at the [[Tuskulėnai Manor]]. Prior to 2018 the museum was known as "the Museum of Genocide Victims" reflecting a broadened definition of the term "genocide" used by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre,&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; even tough these events considered a genocide only by few historians.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Only a small part of the museum space, a small room added in 2011 following international criticism, is devoted to the [[Holocaust in Lithuania]], the event that is universally considered a genocide. According to [[Dovid Katz]], the museum is "a 21st-century version of Holocaust denial.".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |first=Rod |last=Norland |title=Where The Genocide Museum Is (Mostly) Mum on the Fate of Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/europe/lithuania-genocide-museum-jews.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, the museum was renamed to the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights.&lt;ref name=Andruk&gt;{{cite web|first=Milena |last=Andrukaitytė |url=https://www.15min.lt/kultura/naujiena/naujienos/genocido-auku-muziejus-pervadintas-i-okupaciju-ir-laisves-kovu-muzieju-1104-959156 |title=Genocido aukų muziejus pervadintas į Okupacijų ir laisvės kovų muziejų |language=lt |date=19 April 2018 |publisher=15 min |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre has been active in seeking the prosecution of Jewish partisans on the grounds of war crimes. In 1999–2002, the centre was involved in legal proceedings regarding [[Nachman Dushanski]], an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt; In 2007 the head of the Genocide Center at the time, Arvydas Anusauskas, initiated a criminal investigation against Holocaust survivor [[Yitzhak Arad]] who headed the The International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; The investigation, which derailed the work of the international commission whose members resigned in protest, was viewed internationally as a "contemptible farce",&lt;ref name="HikmaMichlic"&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hW8pDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=arad+%22contemptible+farce%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihzd-x8t_eAhUKZ1AKHWmECYEQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arad%20%22contemptible%20farce%22&amp;f=false Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe], University of Nebraska Press, John-Paul Himka, Joanna Beata Michlic, pages 337-340&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to erase Lithuanian's history of collaboration with the Nazis,&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; and victim blaming,&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/11958563 Prosecution and persecution, Economist, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly due to the lack of prosecution of the many Lithuanian Nazi collaborators.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HikmaMichlic"/&gt;

==Directors==
The centre's director is nominated by the [[Prime Minister of Lithuania]] and confirmed by the [[Seimas]] (Lithuanian parliament).&lt;ref name=bns5/&gt;
On November 26, 1992, [[Juozas Starkauskas]] was approved by the Lithuanian government to be the acting head of the centre.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;
On 17 February 1994 the Seimas appointed Vytautas Skuodis general director of the reorganized centre.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;
On 18 February 1997 Dalia Kuodytė was appointed general director.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;
In 2009, the Seimas confirmed [[Birutė Burauskaitė]], a dissident of long standing, as the Center's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimų vadove paskirta B.Burauskaitė (1)|url=http://www.lrytas.lt/-12324549031232191542-gyventojų-genocido-ir-rezistencijos-tyrimų-vadove-paskirta-b-burauskaitė.htm|publisher=[[Lietuvos rytas]]|accessdate=2010-07-18|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">'''Georg Fabricius''' (23 April 1516 – 17 July 1571), born '''Georg Goldschmidt''', was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[historian]] and [[archaeologist]] who wrote in [[Latin]] on age of [[German Renaissance]].

== Life ==

Fabricius was born in [[Chemnitz]] in [[Saxony]] and educated at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. Travelling in [[Italy]] with one of his pupils, he made an exhaustive study of the antiquities of [[Rome]]. He published the results in his ''Roma'' (1550), in which the correspondence between every discoverable relic of the old city and the references to them in ancient literature was traced in detail. In 1546 he was appointed rector of [[Sächsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Meißen|Saint Afra]] in [[Meissen]].&lt;ref name=Britanica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/f/georg_fabricius.html |title=Georg Fabricius |work=Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1549 Fabricius edited the first short selection of Roman inscriptions specifically focusing on legal texts. This was a key moment in the history of classical [[epigraphy]]: for the first time in print a humanist explicitly demonstrated the value of such [[archaeology|archaeological]] remains for the discipline of law, and implicitly accorded texts inscribed in stone as authoritative status as those recorded in manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Britanica /&gt;

In his sacred poems he affected to avoid every word with the slightest savour of paganism; and he blamed the poets for their allusions to pagan divinities.&lt;ref name=Britanica /&gt;

Fabricius died at [[Meissen]].

With the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] in the [[Renaissance]], the poetry of [[Ovid]] became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of '''[[Greek mythology]]''' through subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="BrBurn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;br /&gt;* L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledas]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Through the medium of [[Latin]] and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Dante]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature.  Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, [[Chaucer]], the [[Elizabethan]]s and [[John Milton]] were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Robert Bridges]] turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. [[Jean Racine]] in [[France]] and [[Goethe]] in [[Germany]] revived Greek drama.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Racine reworked the ancient myths &amp;mdash; including those of [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaidra]], [[Andromache]], Oedipus and [[Iphigeneia]] &amp;mdash; to new purpose.&lt;ref name="Burn75"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Francisco Goya, [[Europa (mythology)|''The rape of Europa'']] ''(El rapto de Europa),'' 1772]]
In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread throughout Europe.  It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the [[libretti]] for [[Handel]]'s operas ''[[Admeto]]'' and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn75" /&gt; By the end of the century, [[Romanticism]] initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including  Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and [[Homer]]'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as [[Keats]], [[Byron]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Burn75-76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[poet laureate]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of [[King Arthur]] are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the [[Parthenon marbles]] in 1816; many of the "Greek" paintings of [[Lord Leighton]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.&lt;ref name="Burn76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

American authors of the 19th century, such as [[Thomas Bulfinch]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.&lt;ref name="Klatt"&gt;Klatt-Brazouski, ''Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulfinch, "The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste."&lt;ref name="Bulfinchintroduction"&gt;T. Bulfinch (1855). [https://books.google.com/books?id=r8oVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 ''The Age of Fable: Or, Stories of Gods and Heroes''], p.11. Sanborn, Carter, and Bazin.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Jean Giraudoux]] in France, [[Eugene O'Neill]] in America, and [[T. S. Eliot]] in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish [[James Joyce]] and the French [[André Gide]]. [[Richard Strauss]], [[Jacques Offenbach]] and many others have set Greek mythological themes to music.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

'''Helen Maria Chesnutt''' BA MA (December 6, 1880 - August 7, 1969) was an African American teacher of Latin and the author of an influential biography and Latin text book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Family life ==
Helen Maria Chesnutt was born in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] in 1880.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://camws.org/meeting/2005/abstracts2005/ronnick.html|title=Ronnick: Within CAMWS territory Helen M. Chesnutt (1880-1969), Black Latinist|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were the African American author [[Charles W. Chesnutt|Charles Chesnutt]], said to be the first important black American novelist, and Susan Perry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-W-Chesnutt|title=Charles W. Chesnutt {{!}} American Writer {{!}} Britannica.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Helen Maria Chesnutt attended [[Smith College]] with her sister, Ethel, living off-campus as did [[Otelia Cromwell]], the only other black student attending Smith College at this time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libex.smith.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/black-students-alliance/helen-and-ethel-chesnutt|title=Helen and Ethel Chesnutt · History of the Black Students Alliance at Smith College · Smith Libraries Exhibits|website=libex.smith.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chesnutt sisters moved to four different addresses during their time at Smith: boarding houses at 95 West Street (1st year), 10 Green Street (2nd year), 36 Green Street (3rd year), and as seniors at 30 Green Street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A diary entry by English Professor Mary Jordan gives a glimpse of the sisters' experiences at Smith College, which appear not to have been happy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She wrote that the "Chesnutt girls are having a hard time with the color line...".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1902 Helen Chesnutt graduated with a B.A. from [[Smith College]], only a year after [[Otelia Cromwell]] became the college's first African American graduate, but it was not until 1925 that she would earn an M.A. in Latin from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career and wider influence==
Helen Chesnutt taught Latin for many years at Central High School in Cleveland, Ohio, including to the poet [[Langston Hughes]], who found her inspiring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Virgil's 2,000 birthday she put on a play involving the whole school and published a report of the production in the Classical Journall.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Ecce Vergilius!|jstor=3289960|journal=The Classical Journal|publisher=The Classical Association of the Middle West and South|volume=26 n.4|pages=273–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that: "Roman costumes were gay in color, a fact which seemed to surprise the pupils, who were accustomed to think of them as made of white marble. The dresses and scarfs and tunics had to be dyed, and so the laundry classes spent some days in dyeing and tinting the garments. Their great achievement was a royal toga for Augustus to wear, dyed a perfect Roman purple and  stenciled in gold."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"During that hour the pupils of this cosmopolitan high school, situated in the downtown district of a great city, hemmed in on all sides by acres of scrapped automo- biles rusting in heaps, and enveloped by the smoke and grime of a great railroad system not far distant, in a neighborhood where the guns of gangsters can be heard roaring day and night, were transported to another age, walked hand in hand with beauty and romance, and were made to feel that poetry and music and art were precious and that human aspiration was indeed worth while. This is what the celebration of the Bimillennium Vergilianum did for the two thousand pupils of this high school, and they have drunk a draft of inspiration that will remain with them forever."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She co-authored, with Martha Olivenbaum and Nellie Rosebaugh, a beginners Latin textbook entitled ''The Road to Latin'' (1932),  which was published in 1932, republished in 1938, 1945 and 1949, and received several positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Review 'THE ROAD TO LATIN.

Helen Chesnutt was elected to the Executive Committee of the [[American Philological Association]] in 1920, remaining an active member until 1934.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1920|title=Proceedings of the Fifty-Second Annual Meeting of the American Philological Association Held at Baltimore, Md., December, 1920.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">'''''Historiography and Historiophoty''''' is the name of an essay by historian and literary critic [[Hayden White]] first published in 1988 in ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. In the essay Hayden coins the term '''Historiophoty''' to describe the "representation of history and our thought about it in visual images and filmic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden says historiophoty "..is in contrast to [[Historiography]] which is the representation of history in verbal images and written discourse,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayden originally coined the term as a rhetorical device in response to an essay by [[Robert A. Rosenstone]] in the same issue of ''AHR'' entitled "History in images/History in words: Reflections on the possibility of really putting history onto film". Hayden, for the sake of exploring Rosenstone's premise (that history can be portrayed on film), created the term historiophoty as a description of the study of history through film. White was not necessarily claiming that historiophoty exists, or that it ought to; his essay was a [[thought experiment]] on what historiophoty would be like if in fact such a thing did exist.

Whatever Hayden's intention, since the publication of his 1988 essay the word historiophoty has entered into public and professional discourse. For example Brian Le Beau wrote "Historiography Meets Historiophoty: The Perils and Promise of Rendering the Past on Film" in ''American Studies'' Volume 38, no. 1 (Spring 1997) [http://www.ku.edu/~amerstud/1997.spring.html].

'''Jacob the Dacian''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Jacobo Daciano'''; [[Latin]]: '''Iacobus de Dacia'''; c. 1484 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]&amp;nbsp;– 1566 in [[Michoacán]], [[New Spain]]) was a [[Danish people|Danish]]-born [[Franciscan]] monk.  He achieved fluency in eight languages and fame among the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]] of Michoacán as a righteous and helpful man toward his flock. His relics, now lost, were kept for a long time by the Indians of [[Tarécuato]] who still celebrate his birthday every year. Jacob has been identified as a son of King [[John of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://calderon.presidencia.gob.mx/felipecalderon/cronica_mensual/15_el_gobierno_mexicano_2008_02.pdf Article] ''México-Dinamarca'' El Gobierno Méxicano crónica mensual (Government of Mexico) 2008-02-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nordjyske.dk/nyheder/broed--dans-og-en-jakke-til-dronningen-kontrast--moede-med-indianere-afsluttede-dronning-margrethe-og-prins-henriks-statsb/cdd0e59f-cc9a-418a-8bff-2d226a17b7d8 Article] by Anette Bredmore in ''[[Nordjyske Stiftstidende|Nordjyske]]'' 2008-05-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The translation of his name into Medieval Latin as ''Iacobus de Dacia'' stems from the fact that, during the Middle Ages, the toponym ''[[Denmark|Dania]]'', meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with ''[[Dacia (disambiguation)|Dacia]]''.

Brother Jacob also went by the name ''Iacobus Gottorpius'', referring to the royal estate of [[Gottorp]] (now located in Germany).

==Royal descent==
Danish historian [[Jørgen Nybo Rasmussen]] (Rasmussen 1974, 1986) has asserted that Jacob was a son (possibly extramarital) of King John of the [[Kalmar Union]] and a younger brother of King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], both Danes. This has not been mentioned by all historians but is also the basis for a novel ''Brother Jacob'' by Danish author [[Henrik Stangerup]]. Key arguments in a case for Jacob's royal lineage are the facts that he described himself as coming from Gottorp, the estate of Kings [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] and John of Denmark; that he had an excellent education normally reserved for the higher nobility; and that he seemed to enjoy the protection of higher political forces. It was also common for younger sons of royalty to enter into the clergy, since they normally would not inherit the thrones. Jacob's position as an inter-continental missionary would have been very unusual for a royal prince.

==Life in Denmark until the Reformation==
Entering the Franciscan Order as a young man, Jacob received a good education studying [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] as well as his mother tongues [[German language|German]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]. In the years prior to the reformation he lived in a convent in [[Malmö]] (now in Sweden), where he argued against the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] leaders. In 1530 the Fransciscans were driven from the convent, as they were in the following from the other Danish towns. He described this in the ''Chronicle of the expulsion of the Greyfriars'', written to serve as evidence in a potential trial to attempt to reclaim the convents later. Such a trial never came. During the religious wars known as the [[Count's Feud]], fought between the supporters of his deposed brother, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] King Christian II, and the forces of King [[Christian III of Denmark]], many Franciscans left Denmark and went to Catholic provinces in northern Germany.

Jacob stayed in Denmark until the fall of Malmö in 1536 when the region's [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|Lutheran Reformation]] was completed and the proscription of [[Mendicant orders]] forced him into exile. First he went to [[Mecklenburg]] under the protection of Duke [[Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg|Albrecht]] who had fought on the Catholic side in the civil war. Here he was made the last ''Provincial'' (head) of the Franciscan province of Dacia, whence his name. He subsequently went to [[Spain]] where he studied the [[Arabic language]] and was authorized by King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]] to go to New Spain as a missionary.

==Missionary to Mexico==
In 1542, Brother Jacob arrived in [[Veracruz]], and was to remain in New Spain for the rest of his life, learning several indigenous languages and founding several convents. He spent three years at the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] studying [[Nahuatl]] before being sent to Michoacán to work among the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], where the bulk of his missionary work was done. He learned the [[Purépecha language]] and worked ardently to improve ''Indian'' rights, causing problems with the colonial authorities and with local church leadership, alike. He wrote a treatise, ''Declamacion del pueblo barbaro de los Indios, que habiendo recibido el bautismo, desean recibir los demas sacramentos'', in which he argued that ''Indians'' should be allowed to be ordained into the priesthood. In this question he was overruled by church authorities and had to do penitence for these actions – he had claimed that denying ''Indians'' the right to ordination was in fact tantamount to [[heresy]], a standpoint which has been vindicated in the modern Roman Catholic Church.

He died in the convent of Tarécuato, in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Mexico|bishopric of Zamora]] where he had served as a guardian. Beginning in 1996, attempts have been made toward his [[canonization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">'''Johannes a Leydis''' or '''Jan Gerbrandszoon van Leiden''' was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[chronicler]] from the 15th century. A Leydis died in 1504.

==Life==
Not much is known with certainty about Johannes a Leydis' life. In all likelihood he came from a family of [[poorter]]s (a special type of citizenship) from [[Leiden]]. He entered the [[carmelite]] [[monastery]] in [[Haarlem]] before 1455. In 1476 he was named [[prior]] of the monastery, but in 1479 we find him as prior of the monastery at [[Woudsend]] in [[Friesland]]. It seems that, during the struggles between the [[Vetkopers and Schieringers]], discipline had become lax in the monastery. A Leydis attempted to reform the monastery, but apparently encountered so much resistance to his reforms that he was forced to leave in 1480. From sources we know that A Leydis was back in the monastery in Haarlem in 1495, filling the function of subprior. A Leydis died in 1504 in Haarlem.

During the [[Hook and Cod wars]], A Leydis supported the Hook faction. His sympathies lay in particular with the family [[van Brederode]] and the [[Egmond Abbey]].

==Historical work==
Johannes a Leydis is mostly known as a historian. He wrote the following works:

*''Chronicon comitum Hollandiae et episcoporum Ultraiectensium'', a chronicle of the [[Count of Holland|counts of Holland]] and the [[Bishopric of Utrecht|bishops of Utrecht]]. The first edition of the work is known only from manuscripts and was written between 1467 and 1469. The second edition, begun between 1485 and 1494, was printed in 1620 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] by Franciscus Sweertius.
*''Opusculum de gestis regalium abbatum monasterii sancti Athalberti ordinis sancti Benedicti in Egmonda'', a chronicle of the abbots of Egmond. Written between 1477 and 1484, commissioned by abt Nicolaus van Adrichem. Published by [[Antonius Matthaeus III]].
*''Cronica illustrium dominorum de Brederueden'', a chronicle of the lords of Brederode. Written between 1483 and 1486. There is also a [[middle Dutch]] version of this chronicle. The relation between the two versions is unclear.

The work of Johannes a Leydis was well known in the first half of the 16th century, and was used as a source by early humanist historians like [[Cornelius Aurelius]] and [[Reinier Snoy]]. Later on, the tendency of A Leydis to include fantastic stories in his work was criticised, with the harshest criticism coming from [[Janus Dousa]].

'''K. C. Hsiao''' ({{zh|t=蕭公權}}; 29 December 1897{{snd}}4 November 1981) was a Chinese scholar and educator, best known for his contributions to Chinese political science and history.

==Life and career==
Hsiao first travelled to the United States in 1920 on the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]],&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;Zhou Mingzhi, "Xiao Gongquan (Hsiao Kung-Ch'üan) and American Sinology", ''Chinese Studies in History'', 41:1 (Fall 2007), pp.41-94&lt;/ref&gt; remaining there for six years and earning a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=Fung&gt;Edmund S. K. Fung, ''The Intellectual Foundations of Chinese Modernity'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to China and was professor of political science at [[Yenching University]] from 1930 to 1932, then at [[Tsinghua University]] from 1932 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Antoon de Baets, ''Censorship of Historical Thought: a World Guide, 1945-2000'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002): 100.&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, he left to teach at [[Sichuan University]] and Kwang Hua University. Frustrated by the shortage of research materials produced by the [[Chinese Civil War]], he went to teach at [[National Taiwan University]] in 1949, and continued to the United States later that year.&lt;ref name=Fung/&gt; He taught at the [[University of Washington]] from 1949 to 1968, initially as a visiting professor, and from 1959 as a tenured professor.

Hsiao's ''magnum opus'' is his two-volume ''Zhōngguó zhèngzhǐ sīxiǎng shǐ ''{{lang|zh|中國政治思想史}}'' ["History of Chinese Political Thought"]'', a work that traces Chinese political thought from its earliest recorded history in the [[Shang dynasty]] to his day.  An English translation of the first volume by the American Sinologist [[Frederick W. Mote]] was published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 1979, but the second volume has never been translated into English.  Hsiao hoped that the 20th century would come to embody 'liberal socialism', thereby reconciling the political movements of the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Fung/&gt;

Jokipii was born in [[Helsinki]]. Jokipii attended [[University of Helsinki]] from 1952 to 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.helsinki.fi/kansatiede/histmaatalous/extrat/erillisartikkelit_maatalousmuseo.htm |last= Korhonen |first= Teppo |title= Sata Vuotta Maatalousmuseotoimintaa |publisher= University of Helsinki |accessdate= 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began publishing almost immediately (1954).

Although some of his early works had been noted, Jokipii sprung on the world scene with his 900-page study of the Finnish [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] battalion in World War II.  This study established a new level of detail in [[World War II]] military history.&lt;ref&gt;Hamalainen, Pekka Kalevi (December 1969) "Review: ''Panttipataljoona: Suomalaisen SS-pataljoonan Historia'' by Mauno Jokipii" ''The American Historical Review'' 75(2): pp. 521-522&lt;/ref&gt; Jokipii's massive work ''The Continuation War: An Investigation of German-Finnish Military Collaboration 1940-1941'' firmly established him as a world scholar and moved the debate about German Finnish relations during World War II to a new level.&lt;ref&gt;Hamalainen, Pekka Kalevi (December 1989) "Review: Mauno Jokipii ''Jatkosodan synty: tutkimuksia Saksan ja Suomen sotilaallisesta yhteistyöstä 1940-41''" ''The American Historical Review'' 94(5): p. 1413&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Ivanovich Rostovtzeff''', or '''Rostovtsev''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Ива́нович Росто́вцев}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 10|1870|October 29}} – October 20, 1952) was a historian whose career straddled the 19th and 20th centuries and who produced important works on ancient Roman and Greek history.&lt;ref name="Briggs1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ward W. Briggs|title=Biographical Dictionary of North American Classicists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8-uLxAnngUC&amp;pg=PA547|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-24560-2|pages=547–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtzeff, M. (1922) ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028575060 Iranians and Greeks in South Russia]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Title page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rostovtzeff was the son of a Latin teacher. Upon completing his studies at the universities of [[Kiev]] and {{nowrap|[[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]}}, Rostovtsev served as an assistant and then as a full Professor of Latin at the {{nowrap|[[Saint Petersburg State University|University of St. Petersburg]]}} 1898–1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510296/Michael-Ivanovich-Rostovtzeff Michael Ivanovich Rostovtzeff] britannica.com, 2014. Retrieved 6 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, following the [[Russian Revolution]], he emigrated first to Sweden, then to England, and finally in 1920 to the United States. There he accepted a chair at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] before moving to [[Yale University]] in 1925 where he taught until his retirement in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/classics/rostovtzeff.html Michael I. Rostovtzeff 1870–1952] Yale Department of Classics, 2009. Retrieved 5 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105115008/http://www.yale.edu/classics/rostovtzeff.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw all archaeological activities of the latter institution in general and the excavations of [[Dura-Europos]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Rostovtzeff1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Ivanovitch Rostovtzeff|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wL1tAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have coined the term "[[caravan city]]".&lt;ref name="Rostovtzeff2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Rostovtzeff|title=Caravan Cities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHmPKP8z7XMC|date=November 2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4437-2888-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in [[Russia]], Rostovtzeff became an authority on the ancient history of South Russia and Ukraine. He summed up his knowledge on the subject in ''Iranians and Greeks in South Russia'' (1922) and ''Skythien und der Bosporus'' (1925). His most important archaeological findings at Yale were described in ''Dura-Europos and Its Art'' (1938).

[[Glen Bowersock]] described Rostovtzeff's views as having been largely formed by the age of thirty, developing mainly only in the quality of execution in later life, and making him "the last of the nineteenth-century ancient historians".&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; Rostovtzeff was known as a proud and slightly overpowering man who did not fit in easily. In later life, he suffered from depression.

==''The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire''==
Rostovtzeff was notable for his theories of the cause of the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] which he expounded in detail in his magisterial ''The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire'' (1926). Scarred by his experience of fleeing from the Russian Revolution, he attributed the collapse of the Roman Empire to an alliance between the rural proletariat and the military in the third century A.D. Despite not being a Marxist himself, Rostovtzeff used terms such as [[proletariat]], [[bourgeoisie]] and [[capitalism]] freely in his work and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world, where they did not necessarily apply, caused criticism.&lt;ref name=bow/&gt;

Rostovtzeff's theory was quickly understood as one based on the author's own experiences and equally quickly rejected by the academic community. Bowersock later described the book as "the marriage of pre-1918 scholarly training and taste with post-1918 personal experience and reflection." At the same time, however, the detailed scholarship involved in the production of the work impressed his contemporaries and he was one of the first to merge archaeological evidence with literary sources. Today, Rostovtzeff's theories in this area continue to be rejected by scholars as untenable.&lt;ref name=bow&gt;Bowersock, G.W. "The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire by Michael Ivanovitch Rostovtzef" in ''Daedalus'', Vol. 103, No. 1, Twentieth-Century Classics Revisited (Winter, 1974), pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Michiyuki'''''|道行文|michiyuki-bun|lit. "[[:wikt:道|road]] [[:wikt:行|travel]] [[:wikt:文|literature]]"}} is the term for a journey scene in [[Japanese theatre]], which shows the characters dancing or conversing while travelling.

The term  ''michiyuki'' (道行) in its generic sense of  ''michi wo yuku'' "to go on a road" is used in lyrical descriptions of journeys from the 8th century. It was also a term for the music in [[bugaku]] dances of the [[Heian period]], played while a dancer was moving onto the stage. As a technical term in [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] theatre, ''michiyuki'' is used from the 16th century.

In Noh, the michiyuki customarily takes the function of a prologue, the characters introducing the play while travelling to the location where the main action will take place.
In Kabuki, by contrast, the michiyuki often takes place in the last act.
The michiyuki is performed by the travelling characters moving about in a steady pace either on the main stage or on the [[hanamichi]] (a walkway or "corridor" attached to the main stage).

==Career==
From 1921 till 1936 he lived in [[Ternopil]], where he graduated the state [[Ternopil state gimnasium|Polish gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="harvard2009"/&gt; Pritsak began his academic career at the [[University of Lviv]] in [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|interwar Poland]] where he studied Middle Eastern languages under local orientalists and became associated with the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] and attended its seminar on Ukrainian history led by [[Ivan Krypiakevych]]. After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] annexation of Galicia, he moved to [[Kiev]] where he briefly studied with the premier [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] orientalist, [[Ahatanhel Krymsky]]. During the war, Pritsak escaped to the west. He studied at the universities in [[Berlin]] and [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], receiving a [[doctorate]] from the latter, before teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]]. In the 1960s, he moved to the [[United States]], where he taught at the [[University of Washington]] for a while, before moving to Harvard at the invitation of the prominent [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Roman Jakobson]], who was interested in proving the authenticity of the twelfth century "[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Song of Igor]]" through the use of oriental sources. At Harvard, he founded the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute (1973), became the first Mykhailo Hrushevsky Professor of Ukrainian History (1975), and started the journal, ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' (1977). In 1989, he retired from his Harvard professorship. After the emergence of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Pritsak returned to Kiev where he founded the Oriental Institute of the National Academy of Sciences and the journal ''Skhidnyi svit'' (The Oriental World). He spent his final years back in the United States and died in Boston at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jul/27/20060727-121558-6195r/|title=Omeljan Pritsak, 87, professor, linguist|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main interests==
Pritsak was a [[medievalist]] who specialized in the use of [[orient]]al,&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; especially [[Turkey|Turkic]], sources for the  history of [[Kievan Rus']], early modern [[Ukraine]], and the European Steppe region. He was also a student of [[Old Norse]] and was familiar with Scandinavian sources for the history of Kievan Rus'. His ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''The Origin of Rus''', only one volume of which has appeared in English (1981), inclines toward, but does not totally adopt, a [[Normanist]] interpretation of Rus' origins. He saw Kievan Rus' as a multi-ethnic polity.&lt;ref name="harvard2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/05/omeljan-pritsak/|title=Omeljan Pritsak|newspaper=[[Harvard Gazette]]|date=14 May 2009|first1=Michael S.|last1=Flier|first2=Richard N.|last2=Frye|first3=George G.|last3=Grabowicz|first4=Roman|last4=Szporluk|first5=Edward L.|last5=Keenan|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oriental-studies.org.ua/en/about/personal/omeljan-pritsak/|title=Omeljan Pritsak «  Інститут сходознавства|website=oriental-studies.org.ua|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the early Rus', Pritsak's works focused on [[Eurasia]]n [[nomad]]s and [[steppe]] empires such as those created by the [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], [[Pechenegs]], and [[Kipchaks]]. However, he firmly rejected the [[Eurasianists|"Eurasian" approach]] to Ukrainian and [[Russia]]n history and would have nothing to do with its Russian nationalist postulates.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Ukrainian historian==
Unlike his predecessors [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], [[Dmytro Doroshenko]], and [[Ivan Krypiakevych]], who wrote national histories or histories of the Ukrainian people, Pritsak followed the Ukrainian historian of [[Poland|Polish]] background, [[Viacheslav Lypynsky]], in proposing the ideal of writing a "territorialist" history of Ukraine that would include the Polish, Turkic, and other peoples who have inhabited the country from ancient times. This idea was later taken up by his younger contemporary [[Paul Magocsi]], who was for some time an associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Institute.

Pritsak sought to improve quality and extent of Ukrainian studies at Harvard University. He supported establishing three different chairs for Ukrainian studies in the university: Ukrainian history, [[Ukrainian literature]] and Ukrainian philology.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/journalofukraini3334cana/journalofukraini3334cana_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Pritsak was a political [[Conservatism|conservative]] and during his youth in eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], and later also during the [[Cold War]] was a supporter of the conservative "[[Hetman]]ite" or [[monarchist]] movement among Ukrainians. This led him to criticize [[Hrushevsky]]'s political radicalism and historical populism, although, ironically, he claimed that Hrushevsky's "school" of history was being continued at Harvard. Also during the Cold War, Pritsak became prominent in the movement towards [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian-Jewish reconciliation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Pritsak often was invited to brief [[Pope John Paul II]] on developments in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"/&gt;

'''Stephenson Percy Smith''' (11 June 1840 – 19 April 1922) was a New Zealand [[ethnologist]] and surveyor. He founded The [[Polynesian Society]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career as a surveyor ===
[[Image:SPSmithsurveyparty1886.jpg|thumb|Stephenson Percy Smith and his survey party in a bivouac at the foot of [[Mount Tarawera]], 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Photograph by kind permission of the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand, Reference number: 1/2-061056-F.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Percy Smith (as he was known) was born in [[Beccles]], Suffolk, the eldest son of Hannah Hursthouse and John Stephenson Smith, a merchant and later a civil servant. Smith emigrated to New Zealand with his family in February 1850. Percy Smith attended school at New Plymouth and later Omata, leaving to help on the family farm in 1854. Interested in the natural world and the landscape of the [[Taranaki Region]], Smith took lessons in painting from John Gully, a landscape artist. In 1855, aged 14, he joined the provincial survey department, helping to survey the land around New Plymouth, spending long periods in the bush and coming into frequent contact with Māori. Following two years of training, he was made assistant surveyor. While still in his teens, he began a series of expeditions in his spare time, joining a party to scale [[Mount Taranaki]] in 1857, for example, and undertaking a journey in 1858 up the [[Mokau River|Mōkau River]] to Taupo, Lakes Rotomahana and Tarawera, the Tongariro-Ruapehu area, returning via Rangitikei and Wanganui. This expedition was over 1000 kilometres (600 miles) on foot, horse, and canoe.

During his service in the local militia, Smith also witnessed at first hand the conflict leading up to the Taranaki wars. In March 1858 he saw the fighting at Waitara, where he was employed to make sketches of the stockades. In 1859 was transferred to the Auckland district where he worked with the Land Purchase Department, surveying newly acquired government land in the Kaipara and Northern Wairoa. In April 1860 he was instructed to return at once to Kaipara, where he acted as an interpreter and intermediary to persuade Ngāti Whātua to help in the defence of Auckland against a rumoured attack from the Waikato tribes. Smith was then employed in laying out the boundaries of blocks at Coromandel and in the survey of military settlements in the Waikato.

Smith married Mary Anne Crompton on 23 April 1863. They remained in Auckland until 1865, when he was transferred back to Taranaki as district surveyor. There his main duties were the survey of lands confiscated from the Māori. In the following decade, he surveyed territories in various parts of New Zealand. In 1868 he was undertaking a survey of Pitt Islands in the Chathams at the time when Te Kooti escaped on the ''Rifleman'' to Poverty Bay. Smith was appointed the first geodesical surveyor and chief surveyor of the provincial district of Auckland in the department of the surveyor general in 1877 and assistant surveyor-general in 1882. Immediately after the eruption of [[Mount Tarawera]] in 1886, he made visits to the region and reported his findings in ''The Eruption of Tarawera'' (1886). Smith reported the Pink and White Terraces could not be located due to the absence of any pre-eruption survey. In 2017 researchers using a forgotten 1859 survey were finally able to map the Pink and White terrace locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Rex|last2=Nolden|first2=Sascha|date=2017-06-07|title=Forensic cartography with Hochstetter’s 1859 Pink and White Terraces survey: Te Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|issn=0303-6758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn and Nolden|first=Rex and Sascha|date=December 2016|title=Te Tarata and Te Otukapuarangi: Reverse engineering Hochstetter’s Lake Rotomahana Survey to map the Pink and White Terrace locations|url=https://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/3988/3555|journal=Journal of New Zealand Studies|volume=NS23|pages=37–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, he joined an expedition to the Kermadec Islands to confirm New Zealand possession and to report on the group, which he did in ''The Kermadec Islands: Their Capabilities and Extent'' (1887). His career as a surveyor reached its peak when he was appointed as [[Surveyor-General of New Zealand]] in January 1889.

===Work as an ethnologist===
In the course of his surveying expeditions, Smith took advantage of any opportunity to collect and record information on the traditional history and culture of the Māori, material which would later form the foundation for his work as a Polynesian scholar. Not until he retired from the civil service was he able to give his unrestricted attention to these studies. By now a recognised scholar of the Māori language, Percy Smith was regarded by his contemporaries as a leading Pākehā authority on Māori history and traditions. To provide a focal point for ethnological research in New Zealand, he called a meeting in Wellington in January 1892 to establish the [[Polynesian Society]], becoming its first secretary and treasurer. He was also the first co-editor of the ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', alongside [[Edward Robert Tregear|Edward Tregear]]. Smith was to be the main contributor to the ''Journal'' until his death 30 years later, during which time he also published a lengthy series of studies of Māori history. In 1897 undertook a six-month tour of the Pacific, promoting the Polynesian Society and gathering material in support of his thesis regarding the history of the Polynesians. The tour was 'a seminal event' in Smith's ethnological career and he gained access to a number of manuscripts from Rarotonga and other places. Using these manuscripts gathered in Polynesia and other sources from New Zealand, Smith constructed an elaborate history of the Polynesians from a purported [[Aryan]] origin in India,&lt;ref&gt;Smith used the methods pioneered by [[Abraham Fornander]] to derive a similar history for the Hawaiians.&lt;/ref&gt; a history originally published in volumes 7 and 8 (1898–1899) of the ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'' (Walker et al. 2000:viii-ix).&lt;ref&gt;In the same period, Smith published ''The Peopling of the North, the Maori history of the Ngāti Whātua tribe'', (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; This study was republished in book form as ''Hawaiki, the Original Home of the Maori'' (1921), later reprinted in a number of editions. ''Hawaiki'' had a tremendous impact on the popular view of Māori history, becoming the authorised version until relatively recent times when its authenticity came under scrutiny in the writings of [[David Simmons (ethnologist)|David Simmons]] (1976) and M.P.K. Sorrensen (1979).

===Latter years===
Smith retired in October 1900, and from that time onwards he dedicated himself increasingly to his research, although in 1902 he was appointed as Government Resident in Niue Island after its annexation by New Zealand. He spent five months on Niue, arranging the administrative and legal systems and drafting the constitution. At the same time, however, he gathered material on the ethnology and language of the island for two further publications. In 1904 appeared one of his most enduring studies, ''The Wars of the Northern Against the Southern Tribes'', which was revised as ''The Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century''.

A few years later, Smith published ''History and Traditions of the Maoris of the West Coast, North Island'' (1910), a monumental study of the traditional history of the regions with which he was best acquainted.

He died at his home in New Plymouth, on 19 April 1922.

==Legacy==
The assessment of Smith's contribution, unreservedly generous at his death, has changed somewhat in recent decades. In 1966, The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand was generally positive, with some qualification. "His careful recording of traditional material, cross checked as far as possible by varying tribal histories, left an invaluable contribution... Although they can now be amplified or corrected on points of detail, the structure is substantially unchanged. In his studies on Maori origins he was more uncritical and framed hypotheses on what now seems slender linguistic and traditional evidence. The nevertheless high standard, for the period, of his own work and its publication provided a touchstone for later amplification which is being revised only today by more developed archaeological and critical techniques" (Bagnall 1966:266).

Smith's biography (first published in 1993) in the ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography'' is more forthright, stating that "In some areas, particularly his account of the origins of the Maori and their arrival in New Zealand, Smith's interpretation has not survived the light cast on it by later historical and archaeological research. Scholars have criticised Smith's use of his source materials and his editing of Maori traditions for publication.... Smith's careers in surveying and ethnology were characterised by hard work and dedication, and he received recognition for both in his lifetime. Although it is now generally accepted that much of his work on the Maori is unreliable, his research nevertheless provided a basis for the development of professional ethnology in New Zealand. As a successful civil servant and respected scholar he was perhaps one of New Zealand's most prolific intellectuals of the late nineteenth century, and was a major contributor to the scientific debate over the origins and nature of the Maori" (G.M. Byrnes 2006).

Historian Rāwiri Taonui, writing in 2006 for the website ''[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', accuses Smith of falsification: "The [[Māori migration canoes|Great Fleet]] theory was the result of a collaboration between the 19th-century ethnologist S. Percy Smith and the Māori scholar [[Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury]]. Smith obtained details about places in Rarotonga and Tahiti during a visit in 1897, while Jury provided information about Māori canoes in New Zealand. Smith then 'cut and pasted' his material, combining several oral traditions into new ones. Their joint work was published in two books, in which Jury and Smith falsely attributed much of their information to two 19th-century tohunga, [[Moihi Te Mātorohanga]] and [[Nēpia Pōhūhū]]" (Taonui 2006).

[[File:Ptolemaic-Empire 200bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ptolemaic kingdom|Ptolemaic dominions]] in 200 BC]]
'''Coinage of the Ptolemaic Kingdom''' was in use during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|last dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and, briefly, during [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule of Egypt]].

Ptolemaic coinage was struck in [[Phoenician weight]], also known as Ptolemaic weight (about 14,20 grams). This standard, which was not used elsewhere in the [[Hellenistic world]], was smaller than the dominant&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991_2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Mørkholm|title=Early Hellenistic Coinage from the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamaea (336-188 BC)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_5Ez0kAOuIC&amp;pg=PA8|date=31 May 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39504-5|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attic weight]]. Consequentially, Ptolemaic coins are smaller than other Hellenistic coinage. In terms of art, the coins, which were made of silver, followed the example set by contemporary Greek currencies, with dynastic figures being typically portrayed. The Ptolemaic coin making process often resulted in a central depression, similar to what can be found on [[Seleucid coinage]].

The Ptolemaic dynasty introduced coinage to Egypt, where pre-existing [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|native dynasties]] did not use coins. The first Ptolemaic mint was in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and was later moved to [[Alexandria]]. Succeeding in monetizing the Egyptian society, largely due to efforts of king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Ptolemaic kingdom flourished. For most of its history, the kingdom vigorously enforced a policy of a single currency, confiscating foreign coins found on its territory and forcing its dominions to adopt Ptolemaic coinage. In the rare cases when these dominions were allowed their own currency, such as the [[Jewish]] community in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], they still had to observe the Ptolemaic weight. These policies, along with inflation and increasing difficulty to obtain silver, caused monetary isolation of the Ptolemaic coinage.

After Egypt was [[Egypt (Roman province)|annexed]] into the [[Roman Empire]] and the Ptolemaic dynasty ceased to exist, its currency still remained in circulation. This was the case until the rule of [[Emperor Nero]]. Silver from the coins was reused for [[Roman tetradrachm]]. [[Denarii]] and [[aurei]] did not circulate in the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, so Egypt's monetary isolation continued.

==Design and symbolism==
{{further|Ancient Greek coinage}}
[[File:Ptolemy V Bronze 1.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]]' bronze coin. Depression in center of the coin can be clearly seen both on obverse and reverse sides. Reverse shows a common Ptolemaic symbol, the eagle standing on a thunderbolt.]]
Ptolemaic Kingdom used [[Phoenician weight]] instead of the more common [[Attic weight]].&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; Phoenician weight, also known as Ptolemaic weight, is about 14,20 grams. The more common Attic weight from other Hellenistic states is approximately 17,26 grams. Ptolemaic coinage was struck in different standard, and the kingdom sought to obtain full royal control on coinage in circulation.&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"/&gt; The largest denominations of Ptolemaic bronze coinage weight up to 100 grams.&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William David Davies|author2=Louis Finkelstein|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 1, Introduction: The Persian Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxrgAVkVysAC&amp;pg=PA30|date=16 February 1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-21880-1|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistically, Ptolemaic coinage closely followed contemporary Greek currencies. A commonplace symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty is an eagle standing on a thunderbolt, first adopted by [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. The more peculiar Ptolemaic coinage include so-called "dynastic issues". [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] married his sister [[Arsinoe II]], possibly to gain legitimacy in eyes of the local [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] population. Egyptian rulers had traditionally married their sisters to signify a connection to sacred union between the deities [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. A [[medal]]-like coin with one side portraying Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, and the other side portraying Ptolemy I and [[Berenice I]] was struck after the death of Arsinoe II. She had significant posthumous influence on Egyptian religious life, and the ruling Greek dynasty was [[deified]].&lt;ref name="Fulinska"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1496642/Iconography_of_the_Ptolemaic_queens_on_coins_Greek_style_Egyptian_ideas|title=Iconography of the Ptolemaic queens on coins: Greek style, Egyptian ideas?|first=Agnieszka|last=Fulinska|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coin making process, there were similarities with Seleucid coinage. For instance, Ptolemaic coins often have a central depression from the coin making process.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Mørkholm|title=Early Hellenistic Coinage from the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamaea (336-188 BC)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_5Ez0kAOuIC&amp;pg=PA13|date=31 May 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39504-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=George MacDonald|title=The Evolution of Coinage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl2xtizf1OAC&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-60599-2|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mints==

The first Ptolemaic mint was at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. It was later moved to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Cohen1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Getzel M. Cohen|title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p4lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08329-5|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] was the most important coastal city out of the five Ptolemaic cities with a mint in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; After the Seleucid Kingdom led by [[Antiochus III the Great]] conquered [[Coele-Syria]] [[Ptolemais in Phoenicia]] (Acre) was still allowed to strike coins using the Phoenician weight. The mint remained very prolific, and was among the most active ones in the Seleucid Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Howgego|title=Ancient History from Coins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07GKPP5RLQwC&amp;pg=PT38|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-87783-6|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Newell|first=Edward T. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/77751499/The-first-Seleucid-coinage-of-Tyre-by-Edward-T-Newell|title=The first Seleucid coinage of Tyre|publisher=Digital Library Numis (DLN)|access-date=22 December 2017|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the city struck silver coinage without an interruption after it changed hands, as it was a very important city in [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt; However, the Seleucids discontinued a Ptolemaic mint in [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"/&gt;

In [[Greece]], Ptolemaic coinage mainly originate from [[Peloponnese]] and [[Euboea]]. [[Corinth]] did not strike Ptolemaic coinage during its brief subordination to the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;

[[Cyprus]] had many important mints, and the island struck large amounts of Ptolemaic coinage from 200 BC to 80 BC.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; Cyprus was also richer in silver than Egypt.&lt;ref name="Watson2014"/&gt; In the second century BC, most of the Cypriot coinage are easily identifiable and datable because they include abbreviations for mints and dates for both gold and silver coinage. Cypriot mints from this period include [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] (abbr. ΣA), [[Kition]] (abbr. KI) and [[Paphos]] (abbr. Π, and later as ΠA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyprioscharacter.eie.gr/en/scientific-texts/details/numismatics/coinage-of-ptolemies-in-cyprus|title=The Coinage of the Ptolemies in Cyprus|website=kyprioscharacter.eie.gr|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at [[Crete]], there was no royal coinage in use, and Cretan cities had a strong autonomy of minting their own coins.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;

There are no evidence that Ptolemaic mints existed in [[Asia Minor]]. Furthermore, regions such as [[Cilicia]] and [[Lycia]] had no autonomous mints striking local currency. It seems that there was little circulation of Ptolemaic currency in [[Caria]], Lycia, [[Pamphylia]] and Cilicia. Local Pamphylian silver coinage was discontinued under Ptolemaic control. It is likely that people in southern Asia Minor simply did not have a habit of using coinage in everyday economic transactions.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;

==History==

===Background===
{{Further|Diadochi}}

Silver was scarcer than gold in Egypt, and the exact ratio of their value is unclear. Silver was however probably shipped in significant quantities from abroad.&lt;ref name="Milne"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3854105|title=Ptolemaic Coinage in Egypt|first=J. G.|last=Milne|date=22 December 2017|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=15|issue=3/4|pages=150–153|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/3854105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ptolemaic Cyprus produced some silver for coinage struck locally.&lt;ref name="Watson2014"/&gt;

Coinage was not used in Egypt during pre-Ptolemaic [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|native dynasties]]. It has been deducted from discoveries of ancient foreign coinage in Egypt that foreign currency was used as [[bullion]] rather than as money during the native dynasties.&lt;ref name="Milne"/&gt; During Ptolemaic rule, Egypt transformed from a widely currency-free society to a largely monetized one by the course of the third century BC. King [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] had a marked influence in the process. Greek rule monetized Egyptian taxation, and this was one of the key reasons for the success of the Ptolemaic state. Before the Ptolemaic period, metals such as copper, and grain, were used as mediums of exchange. Ptolemaic rule brought, in addition to the coinage, banks and tax farming to the country. However, even centuries earlier, increasing trade with Greece seemingly had strengthened the process of monetization. Founding of the Greek trading colony of [[Naukratis]] had coincided with the strengthening trade relations.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite web|author=JG Manning|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/manning/120603.pdf|title=Coinage as 'code' in Ptolemaic Egypt|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=December 2006|access-date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary isolation===

The Ptolemaic Kingdom did not use the Attic weight, or Attic standard, which was very common in other contemporary [[Hellenistic]] states such as the [[Seleucid Kingdom]]. Instead, the Ptolemaic Kingdom used Phoenician weight, which was smaller than the Attic weight. Consequently Ptolemaic coinage was smaller than coins used by other Hellenistic states.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger S. Bagnall|title=The Administration of the Ptolomaic Possessions Outside Egypt: With 3 Maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrI3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA193|year=1976|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-04490-6|pages=176–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom also briefly utilized [[Rhodian standard]] in the transition process to the Phoenician weight. A possible reason for this very brief usage of the Rhodian weight in coinage may have resulted from strong commercial ties with the island of Rhodes.&lt;ref name="Hill2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hill|title=A History of Cyprus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYxi-PQiDL8C&amp;pg=PA180|date=23 September 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-02062-6|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahaffy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Pentland Mahaffy|title=The Empire of the Ptolemies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psKZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA488|date=6 November 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-07865-8|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the Rhodian standard was lighter than Attic but heavier than Phoenician weight. As a result, the process shows a clear downward scale in size of the coinage. Despite this coincidence, political reasons and trade partnerships are still offering better explanations than a proposed theory that value of silver was in appreciation during Ptolemy I's reign.&lt;ref name="Mahaffy2014"/&gt;

During most of the Ptolemaic Kingdom's history, it was a policy that all foreign coinage within Egypt would be confiscated by the state and replaced with Ptolemaic currency. Parallels between [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] and the Ptolemaic Kingdom can be drawn as Athens attempted to introduce a sole currency in its empire. The Ptolemaic Kingdom forced its own monetary system to its foreign dominions. In rare cases, where cities under Ptolemaic dominion were allowed to keep their local currency, the cities were still forced to convert their currency to Phoenician weight.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"/&gt; One such instance was the [[Jewish]] community in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as they were allowed to mint coins with the names of their magistrates.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; However, the local Jewish currency effectively disappeared by the third century.&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"/&gt; In comparison, neighboring Seleucid Kingdom's policy was less strict in imposing the royal control on mints.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;

During the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the kingdom, diverse local currencies were allowed to exist. They may even have been encouraged. The exact date of elimination of non-Ptolemaic coinage varies by region.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; As early as during Ptolemy I's reign, the closed nature of Ptolemaic monetary system started to form.&lt;ref name="Watson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Watson|title=A Brief Introduction to Egyptian Coins and Currency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGPuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17|date=16 October 2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-9020-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt and Syria, Ptolemy I discontinued local coinage, which had Alexander the Great's image struck in them, after feeling secure in power.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt; Such coinage with Alexander on them were very common in the successor states of the [[Macedonian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt; Cypriot coinage was eliminated when the local monarchies ceased to exist. In [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] it took even longer to eliminate municipal coinage. In [[Crete]] the local currency was never suppressed. Uniformity of the currency was sought flexibly, yet opportunistically.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;

As it became increasingly difficult to obtain silver for the Ptolemaic kingdom, bronze coinage largely replaced silver in Egypt. Furthermore, monetary isolation was increased by other factors, like considerable inflation and the use of a unique standard to replace the Attic weight.&lt;ref name="Bagnall1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DaviesFinkelstein1984"/&gt; Early Ptolemaic silver coinage was struck from pure silver, but by the time of [[Cleopatra VII]] it had suffered a very large degree of [[debasement]]. Despite of the economic difficulties in the Ptolemaic realm, economically notable debasement began in 136 BC. After Cleopatra VII's economic reform in 51 BC a type of [[stater]] that was only one third silver was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/numi_0484-8942_1984_num_6_26_1865|title=The silver standard of the Ptolemaic coinage|first1=R.A.|last1=Hazzard|first2=I.D.|last2=Brown|date=27 May 1984|publisher=|journal=Revue numismatique|volume=6|issue=26|pages=231–239|accessdate=27 May 2018|doi=10.3406/numi.1984.1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman era===
[[File:Cleopatra VII tetradrachm Syria mint.jpg|thumb|[[Tetradrachm]] of [[Cleopatra VII Philopator]], the last ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom]]
After the demise of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and [[Egypt (Roman province)|annexation]] into the growing [[Roman Empire]], silver coinage struck by the Ptolemies still continued to circulate. The Ptolemaic silver coinage mostly disappeared by the time of [[Emperor Nero]]. It is assumed that by that time, in the first half of the first century, the Ptolemaic silver coinage was probably recycled into a new currency, [[Roman tetradrachm]]s, struck at mints managed by the Romans. Roman Egypt remained monetarily as a closed system, like it had been under Ptolemaic dynasty. Roman [[denarii]] and [[aurei]] did not circulate in provincial Egypt.&lt;ref name="ButcherPonting2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin Butcher|author2=Matthew Ponting|title=The Metallurgy of Roman Silver Coinage: From the Reform of Nero to the Reform of Trajan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_EKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA609|date=2 April 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-06089-6|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Bagwell''' (9 December 1840 – 4 December 1918) was a noted historian of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] and [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]  periods in Ireland, and a political commentator with strong [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] convictions.
He was the eldest son of [[John Bagwell (1811-1883)|John Bagwell]], M.P. for [[Clonmel (UK Parliament constituency)|Clonmel]] from 1857 to 1874. His son [[John Philip Bagwell]] followed the family tradition in politics becoming a [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] in the government of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1923.

== Academic career ==
Bagwell was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in England and [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]], being admitted to [[Inner Temple]] in 1866. He was the author of ''Ireland  Under the Tudors'' (1885-1890) and ''Ireland Under the Stuarts'', 3 vols. (1909–10), in recognition for which he was given the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters|Litt. D.]] by [[Trinity College, Dublin|Dublin University]] in 1913 and that of D.Litt. by Oxford University in 1917. He also wrote the historical entry on ‘Ireland’ for the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (Chicago 1911).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Bagwell was a Commissioner on National Education between 1905 and 1918 and a member of the Patriotic Union (Southern Unionists).&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FKX/is_3-4_38/ai_111265621/pg_26 ''Landlord responses to the Irish Land War, 1879-87''] Éire-Ireland:Journal of Irish Studies, at BNet&lt;/ref&gt; He held the position of [[High Sheriff of Tipperary|High Sheriff of County Tipperary]] in 1869. He was a [[Justice of the Peace]]  for [[County Tipperary]] (and later for [[County Waterford|Waterford]]), and held the office of [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of  Tipperary. He was also Special Local Government Commissioner between 1898 and 1903&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p26513.htm#i265122 Richard Bagwell at ThePeerage.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Borstal Association of Ireland.

== Personal life ==
Bagwell married [[Harriet Bagwell|Harriet Philippa Joscelyn]] (née Newton) on 9 January 1873. The couple had one son, [[John Philip Bagwell]], and three daughters, Emily Georgiana, Margaret and [[Lilla Minnie Perry|Lilla Minnie]].

[[File:Turbid Waters Surround New Zealand.jpg|thumb|The Roaring Forties in the [[Cook Strait]] of [[New Zealand]] produce high waves, and they erode the shore as shown in this image.]]
The '''Roaring Forties''' are strong [[Westerlies|westerly]] winds found in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally between the [[latitude]]s of [[40th parallel south|40]] and [[50th parallel south|50 degrees]].&lt;ref name=ABCScience&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/09/20/2038604.htm |title=Roaring forties |last=Catchpole |first=Heather |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |publisher=ABC Science |work=In Depth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong west-to-east air currents are caused by the combination of air being displaced from the [[Equator]] towards the [[South Pole]], the Earth's rotation, and the scarcity of landmasses to serve as windbreaks.

The Roaring Forties were a major aid to ships sailing the [[Brouwer Route]] from [[Europe]] to the [[East Indies]] or [[Australasia]] during the [[Age of Sail]], and in modern usage are favoured by yachtsmen on round-the-world voyages and competitions. The boundaries of the Roaring Forties are not consistent, and shift north or south depending on the season. Similar but stronger conditions occurring in more southerly latitudes are referred to as the Furious Fifties and the Shrieking or Screaming Sixties.

==Mechanics==
{{See also|Atmospheric circulation}}
Hot air rises at the [[Equator]] and is pushed towards the poles by cooler air travelling towards the Equator (an atmospheric circulation feature known as the [[Hadley Cell]]).&lt;ref name=ABCScience/&gt; At about 30 degrees from the equator, the outward-travelling air sinks to lower altitudes, and continues toward the poles closer to the ground (the [[Ferrel Cell]]), then rises up again from about 60 degrees as the air joins the [[Polar vortex]].&lt;ref name=ABCScience/&gt; This travel in the 30 to 60 degree zone combines with the rotation of the earth to move the air currents from west to east, creating westerly winds.&lt;ref name=ABCScience/&gt;  

Unlike the northern hemisphere, the large tracts of open ocean south of the [[40th parallel south]] (interrupted only by [[Tasmania]], [[New Zealand]], and [[southern Cone|the southern part]] of [[South America]]) allow higher windspeeds to develop.&lt;ref name=ABCScience/&gt; Similar but stronger wind conditions prevalent closer to the [[South Pole]] are referred to as the "Furious Fifties" ([[50th parallel south|50]] to [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]]), and the "Shrieking" or "Screaming Sixties" (below 60 degrees south).&lt;ref name=EcoPhoto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecophotoexplorers.com/antarctica_southocean.asp |title=Exploring the Southern Ocean |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2011 |publisher=Eco-Photo Explorers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latitude ranges for the Roaring Forties and similar winds are not consistent, shifting towards the South Pole in the southern summer, and towards the Equator in the southern winter.&lt;ref name=ABCScience/&gt;

==Use for sailing==
[[File:ClipperRoute.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[Clipper Route]], taken by ships sailing from Europe to Australia in order to take advantage of the Roaring Forties]]
During the [[Age of Sail]], ships travelling from Europe to the [[East Indies]] or [[Australasia]] would sail down the west coast of Africa and round the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to use the Roaring Forties to speed their passage across the Indian Ocean,&lt;ref name="OxfordCompanion"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Dear, I. C. B. |editor2=Kemp, Peter |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |title=Roaring Forties |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t225.e2007 |accessdate=14 April 2011 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860616-8 |oclc=60793921}}&lt;/ref&gt; then on the return leg, continue eastwards across the Pacific Ocean and under [[Cape Horn]] before sailing up the east coast of the [[Americas]] to home. It was first used by Dutch explorer [[Hendrik Brouwer]] in his [[Brouwer Route]], discovered in 1611, which effectively halved the duration of the trip from Europe to [[Java]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} "To run the easting down" was the phrase used to describe the fast passages achieved in the Roaring Forties.&lt;ref name="OxfordCompanion" /&gt;

Round-the-world sailors also take advantage of the Roaring Forties to speed travel times, in particular those involved in [[Around the world sailing record|record attempts or races]].&lt;ref name="OxfordCompanion" /&gt;

'''Robert Lomas''' is a British writer, physicist and [[business studies]] academic. He writes primarily about the history of [[Freemasonry]] as well as the [[Neolithic]] period, ancient engineering and [[archaeoastronomy]]. 

==Career==
===In engineering and business studies===
Lomas gained a First Class Honours degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from the [[University of Salford]] before being awarded a PhD for his research into [[solid state physics]] and [[crystals|crystalline structures]].&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, R. (1972) ''Electrical and Structural Properties of Some Evaporated Semiconducting Films'', PhD Thesis, University of Salford.&lt;/ref&gt; From here he went on to work on electronic weapons systems and emergency services command and control systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Lomas/e/B000APEYPM/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1341597285&amp;sr=8-2-ent Amazon biography of Robert Lomas]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He currently lectures on [[Information Systems]] at the [[University of Bradford]]'s School of Management.&lt;ref name="bradford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manag.brad.ac.uk/people/people.php?name=ralomas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322140954/http://www.manag.brad.ac.uk/people/people.php?name=ralomas|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-03-22|publisher=Bradford University School of Management|title=Dr Bob Lomas, Lecturer in Technological Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his website, Lomas is a regular supporter of the Orkney International Science Festival, having lectured there, chaired sessions, and taken part in the school's support sessions over a period of eight years.&lt;ref name="orkney"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.turningthesolomonkey.com/?s=foreword|title=Turning The Solomon Key|author=Lomas, Robert (Foreword by Katherine Neville)|date=September 2006|publisher=Fair Winds Press|isbn=1-59233-229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===As writer on masonic and other topics===
Outside of his academic specialities, Lomas writes on the Neolithic period and archaeoastronomy, ancient mysteries, stone monuments and [[megaliths]], and on [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] topics, as well as the history, ritual, and spiritual journey of [[Freemasonry]]. He has also written a biography of the electrical pioneer, [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertlomas.com/ Robert Lomas] List of Lomas' work, retrieved 6 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomas' main claim to notability is the authorship of several highly speculative works on the origins of Freemasonry. Positive reviewers admit that his works have attracted "a great deal of criticism and even outrage" but argue that his writing is "loaded with all sorts of interesting theories and information that seem emblematic of an insider's point of view on the subject matter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasonhall.com/reviews/book-review-the-hiram-key/ Freemason Hall website] for example: – review of ''The Hiram Key'', retrieved 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elements of his work have been described as 'hoaxes' by members of the Freemasonry community. For example, the redaction of a document called "The Masonic Testament" by Lomas and co-author Christopher Knight, in their ''Book of Hiram'' (2003), from fragments of old manuscripts and ritual,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knight-lomas.com/masonic_testament.html The Masonic Testament] Description retrieved 6 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "An invention by the highly imaginative authors&amp;nbsp;... which has no historical validity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry06.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Part of ''The Book of Hiram'' listed under 'Hoaxes', retrieved 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A review from ''The Square'', reprinted on Lomas' website states that ''Turning the Hiram Key'' "should be viewed as an invitation to think, rather than a prescriptive statement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://turningthehiramkey.robertlomas.com/?s=reviews Robert Lomas website] review of ''Turning the Hiram Key'' by Douglas Inglesent, retrieved 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whilst writing ''The Book of Hiram'' and continuing his research into the cultural origin of scientific ideas, Lomas established an electronic database of [[Masonic]] material,&lt;ref name="hiramweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/webofhiram/|title=The Web of Hiram|publisher=University of Bradford: J.B.Priestley Library Special Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[University of Bradford]]'s Special Collections Library.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford University Special Collections http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/&lt;/ref&gt; Lomas  also published an online version of [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston]]'s ''Illustrations of Masonry''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertlomas.com/preston/padlock/index.html Illustrations of Freemasonry] Index retrieved 7 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Freemasons find Lomas's work worthy of study, as shown by the [[Grand Lodge]] of [[Queensland, Australia]] requesting Lomas to write a history of Freemasonry for its 'Masonic Training Module'.&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, R (2002) ''A Brief History of Freemasonry''. Produced as a contribution to the Masonic Training Programme of the Grand Lodge of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12350">'''Ruth Shick Montgomery''' (June 11, 1912 – June 10, 2001) was a journalist with a long career as a reporter and syndicated columnist in Washington, DC. Later in life she became a self-proclaimed [[psychic]] and author of numerous books on occult and New Age subjects, whose predictions regarding the "polar shift of 1999" heads a long list of attempts to foretell the future. She was a biographer of alleged paranormal medium [[Jeane Dixon]] and a protégée of [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] who posited unsupported claims that he (like [[Edgar Cayce]]) could access the [[Akashic Records]] (or database) of the Universe.

After her long-time friend and mentor, celebrity medium Arthur Ford, died, Montgomery began [[automatic writing]], first with a pencil, later with a typewriter, and said she was able to communicate with Ford, though this claim was never tested under laboratory conditions. According to Montgomery, this postmortem communication was the basis for a lengthy series of books which resulted in her achieving minor celebrity status during the 1960s and 1970s, at which time Montgomery became a regular on the morning talk show circuit, and was for a time a household name.

Montgomery, who enjoyed great financial success via her prolific New Age writings, initially claimed to believe her mission on Earth was to educate the public regarding her views on [[Afterlife|life after death]], which is common among [[spiritualist]]s. However, she also studied [[reincarnation]] and came to believe that mental and physical illnesses often have their origins in past lives. Montgomery wrote of such things as [[birth marks]] indicating the possible sites of past life injuries, and commented that often children born with serious defects or illnesses are in fact re-paying debts incurred in previous existences. Her books were often filled with claims about the past lives of the famous among her contemporaries, stating that Ernest Hemingway had once been a Hun warrior, and that in a previous incarnation Jacqueline Kennedy was a famed French queen.

Montgomery was a believer in the existence of extraterrestrial contact, and claimed to have met non-human aliens on a number of occasions, particularly when she resided in [[Mexico]] in the 1970s, though she presented no physical evidence of these experiences. In one book she wrote of missing an opportunity to ride in a flying saucer due to her husband, Bob, enduring a minor illness at the time the offer of a ride was made by space aliens.

With other like-minded [[mysticism|mystics]], Montgomery founded the Association for Past Life Research and Therapy. Her many books (allegedly channeled via [[automatic writing]] from her [[spirit guide]]s) popularized [[spiritualist]] notions in public consciousness in the 1960s through the 1990s, and paved the way for what is now known as the [[New Age]] movement. Montgomery is particularly noted for popularizing the [[walk-in]] theory whereby a person's soul can depart a hurt or anguished body and be replaced with a new soul which overtakes the body. She filled a book with an extensive list of present-day and historical individuals she said were examples of "walk-ins" and claimed several US Presidents were among this group.

== Journalism ==

Montgomery began her long journalism profession as a cub reporter for ''Waco-News-Tribune'' while receiving her education at [[Baylor University]] (1930–1935). Later she graduated from [[Purdue University]] (1934) and began work as a reporter on the ''[[Louisville Herald-Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, she became the first female reporter in the Washington bureau of the ''New York Daily News'', and embarked on her extensive Washington DC career. She covered notable foreign affairs (the [[Berlin Airlift]] among them), was a syndicated columnist for Hearst Headlines and [[United Press International]]&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; and was a well-read correspondent with the [[International News Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery wrote of her 25 years covering Washington in her 1970 book, “Hail to the Chiefs; My Life and Times with Six Presidents”.

Montgomery wrote annual newspaper columns listing predictions by psychic Jeane Dixon beginning in 1952. In 1962, “Once There was a Nun: Mary McCarran's Years as Sister Mary Mercy” was published and thus began Montgomery’s long career as a non-fiction author. In 1965 her book, “A Gift of Prophecy” about Jeane Dixon was published and became a best-seller, selling over 3 million copies.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

She held honorary doctor of law degrees from Baylor University and Ashland College.

== Past Life Regression ==

In her book ''A World Beyond'', Montgomery revealed that in a past incarnation she had been alive during the time of Christ and known as Lazarus' third sister Ruth, who is not mentioned in the Bible. As this woman, Montgomery claims to have witnessed Jesus' [[circumcision]].

== Predictions ==

Echoing the earlier predictions of Edgar Cayce, Montgomery believed that ancient advanced civilizations of ''[[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]]'' and ''[[Atlantis]]'' had destroyed themselves thousands of years in the pre-history of modern man. Montgomery claimed we would see remnants of the lost continent of Atlantis rise from the sea after a "Polar Shift" which she foretold coming to pass in 1999.

Montgomery predicted in the 1970s (with the help of her supposed spirit guides) that [[World War III]] would begin in the mid-1980s when a brush-fire conflict, started by Ethiopian strongman [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], would spread first to the Middle East, and then Europe. Montgomery's alleged "guides" stated that humans have [[free will]] and can make their own decisions regarding their [[destiny]], and after the failure of her predictions regarding global strife, attributed her error to this cause.

Montgomery also predicted that [[Ronald Reagan]] would be a one-term President to be followed in 1984 by a big-spending [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and that in the 1970s and 1980s, America would have a "[[walk-in]]" as president in the 1990s, ("unsure which term, 1992 or 1996") before a Polar Shift, which was to happen "in the last months of the century" would eradicate most human life on Earth, and greatly alter existing coastlines.

The Guides predicted in her 1999 book ''The World To Come'' that the walk-in president would not come until 2008 at the earliest, and therefore the Shift would be delayed until 2010-2012 at least. The potential catastrophe of the shift was also reduced by human free will. Except for Florida and the coast of California, the Guides reported, most of America will survive, a direct contradiction of Montgomery's earlier forecast of significant global destruction in the coming event.

==Influence in popular culture==
Montgomery's book "Aliens Among Us" has been cited by Sammy Hagar as the inspiration for the 1985 Van Halen song "Love Walks In".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love Walks In|url=http://www.vanhalenencyclopedia.com/entries/love-walks-in.html|work=The Van Halen Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126024346/http://www.vanhalenencyclopedia.com/entries/love-walks-in.html|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book’s account of benevolent aliens residing on earth in human form for the purpose of assisting humanity during a critical time is the template for speculation in UFOlogy communities. Alleged extraterrestrial candidates include far-reaching public figures such as technology visionary [[Steve Jobs]], psychic medium [[Danielle Egnew]] and the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helpful Aliens / Hybrids in Powerful USA Positions?|url=http://www.alien-ufos.com/ufo-alien-discussions/50530-helpful-aliens-hybrids-powerful-usa-positions-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215120047/http://www.alien-ufos.com/ufo-alien-discussions/50530-helpful-aliens-hybrids-powerful-usa-positions-2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 February 2013|work=Alien-Ufo's|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siege of [[Salses-le-Château|Salses]]''' (1639–1640) was a double siege during the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659)]], starting with a French success, but ending with a Spanish victory.

== Siege ==
First, a French army of 16,000 men under [[Henri, Prince of Condé (1588–1646)|Henri, Prince of Condé]] besieged the castle held by 600 Spanish from 9 June 1639. After a siege of 40 days, the Spanish garrison surrendered on 19 July. However, six weeks later a large Spanish army of 24,000 men, (13,000 Catalans recruited by the government of the Principality of Catalonia), under [[Filippo Spinola, 2nd Marquis of the Balbases|Filippo Spinola]] and Francesc de Tamarit appeared and now besieged the French garrison of 2,000 men. 

Condé sent an army of 22,000 men to lift the siege, but suffering from very bad weather, they were defeated in battle by the Spanish on 2 November, with the loss of 3,000 men. Now Salses was alone and hunger forced the French to surrender on 6 January 1640. By then only 800 Frenchmen, of whom 300 sick, were left. The Spanish army had also lost 10,000 men to disease and desertions.

== Consequences ==
The presence of large number of troops in Catalonia contributed to the outbreak of the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] a few months later and the murder of [[Dalmau de Queralt, Count of Santa Coloma]], second in command at the siege of Salses. Salses was retaken by the French after the [[Siege of Perpignan (1642)|Fall of Perpignan]] in September 1642 and remains in their hands until today.

==Background==
Federici grew up in Italy, and came to the US in 1967 to study for a PhD in philosophy at the [[University at Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsandculture.org/2009/11/03/silvia-federici-on-capitalism-colonialism-women-and-food-politics/ "Silvia Federici, On capitalism, colonialism, women and food politics"], interview by Max Haiven, ''Politics and Culture'', 2009, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught at the [[University of Port Harcourt]] in Nigeria, and was Associate Professor and later Professor of Political Philosophy and International Studies at New College of Hofstra University.

She was co-founder of the International Feminist Collective, and an organizer with the [[Wages for housework]] campaign. In 1973, she helped start Wages for Housework groups in the US. In 1975 she published ''Wages Against Housework,'' the book most commonly associated with the [[Wages for housework]] movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/permanent-reproductive-crisis-interview-silvia-federici|title = Permanent Reproductive Crisis: An Interview with Silvia Federici|date = March 2013|accessdate = |website = Meta Mute|publisher = Mute|last = Vishmidt|first = Marina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also co-founded the [[Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa]] (CAFA), and was involved with the Midnight Notes Collective. In 1995, she co-founded the Radical Philosophy Association (RPA) anti-death penalty project.

==Scholarly contributions==

In it, she argues against [[Karl Marx]]'s claim that [[primitive accumulation]] is a necessary precursor for [[capitalism]]. Instead, she posits that primitive accumulation is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism itself—that capitalism, in order to perpetuate itself, requires a constant infusion of expropriated capital.

Federici connects this expropriation to women's unpaid labour, both connected to reproduction and otherwise, which she frames as a historical precondition to the rise of a capitalist economy predicated upon wage labor. Related to this, she outlines the historical struggle for [[the commons]] and the struggle for [[communalism]]. Instead of seeing capitalism as a liberatory defeat of [[feudalism]], Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.

She situates the institutionalization of [[rape]] and [[prostitution]], as well as the [[Heresy|heretic]] and [[witch-hunt]] trials, burnings, and torture at the center of a methodical subjugation of women and appropriation of their labor. This is tied into colonial expropriation and provides a framework for understanding the work of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]], and other proxy institutions as engaging in a renewed cycle of primitive accumulation, by which everything held in common—from water, to seeds, to our genetic code—becomes privatized in what amounts to a new round of [[enclosure]]s.

'''Washington-on-the-Brazos''' is an [[unincorporated area]] along the [[Brazos River]] in [[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]], [[Texas]], United States.&lt;ref name="gnis"/&gt; Founded when Texas was still a [[Mexican Texas|part of Mexico]], the settlement was the site of the [[Convention of 1836]] and the signing of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]]. The name "Washington-on-the-Brazos" was used to distinguish the settlement from "Washington-on-the-[[Potomac River|Potomac]]"&amp;mdash;i.e., [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
Founded largely by immigrants from the southern United States, Washington-on-the-Brazos is known as "the birthplace of Texas" because it was here that, on March 1, 1836, Texas delegates met to formally announce Texas' intention to separate from Mexico and to draft the [[constitution]] of the new [[Republic of Texas]]. They organized an interim government to serve until a government could be elected and inaugurated.&lt;ref name=Historic&gt;[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/washington_on_the_brazos/hist.phtml Washington the Brazos State Historic Site], [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]]. Retrieved 2008-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegates declared independence on March 2, 1836. They adopted their constitution on March 16. The delegates worked until March 17, when they had to flee with the residents of Washington, to escape the advancing Mexican Army. The townspeople returned after the Mexican Army was defeated at [[Battle of San Jacinto|San Jacinto]] on April 21. Town leaders lobbied for Washington’s designation as the permanent capital of the Republic of Texas, but leaders of the Republic favored Waterloo, which later was renamed [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

[[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]] was established by the legislature of the Republic of Texas in 1836 and organized in 1837, when Washington-on-the-Brazos was designated as the county seat. Although the county seat moved to [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]] in 1844, the town continued to thrive as a center for the [[King Cotton|cotton]] trade until the mid-1850s, as it was located on the Brazos River to use for shipping out the crop. The construction of [[Rail transport|railroad]]s bypassed the town and pulled off its business. The strife of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] took another toll on the town, and by the turn of the 20th century it was virtually abandoned.

The State of Texas purchased {{convert|50|acre}} of the old townsite in 1916 and built a replica of the building where the delegates met. The state acquired more of the site in 1976 and 1996.

Located between [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]] and [[Navasota, Texas|Navasota]] off [[State Highway 105 (Texas)|State Highway 105]], the site is now known as Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site.  It covers {{convert|293|acre}}, and features three main attractions: Independence Hall, Barrington Living History Farm, and the [[Star of the Republic Museum]], which is administered by [[Blinn College]]. The site's visitor center is free and includes interactive exhibits about the [[Texas Revolution]] and the park's attractions, a gift shop, a conference center and an education center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birthplaceoftexas.com/visitor_svcs_complex.htm Visitor Services Complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225170016/http://www.birthplaceoftexas.com/visitor_svcs_complex.htm |date=2009-02-25 }}, Birthplace of Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrington Living History Farm===
The Barrington Living History Farm is a [[living museum]] homestead that represents the mid-19th-century farm founded by Dr. [[Anson Jones]], the last [[President of the Republic of Texas]]. Costumed interpreters raise cotton, corn, cattle and hogs using period techniques.  The 1844 Anson Jones Home was moved to the site in 1936 as part of the Texas Centennial Celebration.&lt;ref name="birthplaceoftexas.com"&gt;[http://www.birthplaceoftexas.com/barrington/index.htm Barrington Living History Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205235042/http://www.birthplaceoftexas.com/barrington/index.htm |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructed outbuildings include two [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] cabins, a kitchen building, a [[smokehouse]], a cotton house and a barn. The farmstead opened in 2000,&lt;ref name="birthplaceoftexas.com" /&gt; and is operated by the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]].

==Names elsewhere==
*In [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Washington Avenue was named after Washington-on-the-Brazos. It was the western route to Washington County. Following the present-day road: Washington Avenue; Hempstead Highway; [[US 290 (TX)|US 290]] (Northwest Freeway), then outside of Harris County, US 290 is called Houston Highway.
