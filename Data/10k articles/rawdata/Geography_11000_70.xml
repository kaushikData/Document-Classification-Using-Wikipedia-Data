'''Albrecht Penck''' (25 September 1858 &amp;ndash; 7 March 1945) was a German geographer and geologist and the father of [[Walther Penck]].

== Biography ==
Born in Reudnitz near [[Leipzig]], Penck became a university professor in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], Austria, from 1885 to 1906, and in [[Humboldt University|Berlin]] from 1906 to 1927. There he was also the director of the "Institute and Museum for Oceanography" by 1918. He dedicated himself to [[geomorphology]] and [[climatology]] and raised the international profile of the "Vienna School of physical geography".

With [[Eduard Bruckner]], he was co-author of ''Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter'', a work in which the two scientists identified the four ice ages of the European [[Pleistocene]] ([[Gunz glaciation|Gunz]], [[Mindel glaciation|Mindel]], [[Riss glaciation|Riss]], [[Würm glaciation|Würm]]); these being named after the river valleys that were the first indication of each glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp2pRDIatSgC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Penck,+Albrecht%22+1858&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CUmmuJk9m-&amp;sig=ZziZWo7zv7mQ__8383VtMUZwDqc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwz4u0m4DKAhXi6IMKHQ27BrsQ6AEISzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Penck%2C%20Albrecht%22%201858&amp;f=false A to Z of Marine Scientists] by Barbara Charton&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1886, he was married to the sister of the successful [[Bavaria]]n regional writer [[Ludwig Ganghofer]]. In 1945, Penck died in [[Prague]]. In memory of Penck, the painter and sculptor Ralf Winkler adopted the nom de plume [[A. R. Penck]] in 1966.

In 1928, Penck taught as a Visiting Professor at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] led by [[Carl O. Sauer]].

Albrecht Penck was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1905 and awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=24 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The glacier of [[Penckbreen]] in [[Wedel Jarlsberg Land]] at [[Spitsbergen]], [[Svalbard]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=penck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://placenames.npolar.no/stadnamn/Penckbreen |title=Penckbreen (Svalbard) |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1958 the "Albrecht-Penck-Medaille" is awarded by the '' Deutsche Quartärvereinigung'' for accomplishments associated with [[Quaternary science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz22502.html Penck, Friedrich Karl Albrecht] Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Alessio Piemontese''', also known under his [[Latin]]ized name of '''Alexius Pedemontanus''', was the pseudonym of a 16th-century [[Italy|Italian]] [[physician]], [[Alchemy|alchemist]], and author of the immensely popular book, ''The Secrets of Alexis of Piedmont''. His book&lt;ref&gt;''De' secreti del reuerendo donno Alessio Piemontese, prima parte, diuisa in sei libri'', In Venetia: per Sigismondo Bordogna, 1555.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in more than a hundred editions and was still being reprinted in the 1790s. The work was translated into Latin, German, English, Spanish, French, and Polish.  The work unleashed a torrent of '[[books of secrets]]' that continued to be published down through the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eamon, ''Science and the Secrets of Nature:  Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Piemontese was the prototypical 'professor of secrets'. His description of his hunt for secrets in the preface to the ''Secreti'' helped to give rise to a legend of the wandering empiric who dedicated his life to the search for natural and technological secrets. The book contributed to the emergence of the concept of science as a hunt for the secrets of nature, which pervaded experimental science during the period of the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Eamon, "Science as a Hunt", ''Physis'' 31 (1994), 393-432.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally assumed that Alessio Piemontese was a [[pseudonym]] of '''Girolamo Ruscelli''' (Viterbo 1500 &amp;mdash; Venice 1566), [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[cartographer]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano Melzi. Alessio Piemontese, in ''Dizionario di opere anonime e pseudonime di scrittori italiani o come che sia aventi relazione all'Italia''. Milano, L. di G. Pirola, 1848. vol. I (A-G), p. 32 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d7IYAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:0ItC1xdPCPk_yCNTiDnnUiM#PPA32,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a later work, Ruscelli reported that the ''Secreti'' contained the experimental results of an 'Academy of Secrets' that he and a group of humanists and noblemen founded in Naples in the 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ruscelli, ''Secreti nuovi'' (Venice, 1567).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruscelli's academy is the first recorded example of an experimental scientific society.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eamon and F. Paheau, “The Accademia Segreta of Girolamo Ruscelli: A Sixteenth Century Italian Scientific Society,” ''Isis'' 75 (1984): 327 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The academy was later imitated by [[Giambattista Della Porta]], who founded an ‘Accademia dei Secreti’ in Naples in the 1560s.

[[File:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|right|350px|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (in this example north) and a [[sightline|line]] from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction orthogonal to the [[zenith]].]]

An '''azimuth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-azimuth.ogg|ˈ|æ|z|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}) (from the pl. form of the Arabic noun "السَّمْت" ''as-samt'', meaning "the direction") is an [[Angle#Measuring angles|angular measurement]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. The [[vector space|vector]] from an observer ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) to a point of interest is [[graphical projection|projected]] [[perpendicular]]ly onto a [[reference plane]]; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a [[horizontal coordinate system|celestial coordinate]], the azimuth is the [[horizon]]tal direction of a [[star]] or other [[astronomical object]] in the [[sky]]. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5&amp;nbsp;km in radius at [[sea level]]) around an observer on [[planetary surface|Earth's surface]], and the reference vector points to [[true north]]. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the [[horizontal plane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth |title=Azimuth |work=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azimuth is usually measured in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°). The concept is used in [[navigation]], [[astrometry|astronomy]], [[engineering]], [[map]]ping, mining, and [[ballistics]].

==Navigation==
[[File:True North Mount Allen.fw.png|thumb|left|Azimuth Marker, Mount Allen (Sandstone Peak), Southern California, USA.]] In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted [[alpha]], ''α'', and defined as a horizontal angle measured [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] from a north base line or ''[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21–26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C.

(28 March 1956), ch. 3, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Azimuth'' has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ch. 6 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C.

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically [[true north]], measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units ([[grad (angle)|grad]], [[Angular mil|mil]]) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as "(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated "S30°E", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the [[cardinal point]]s, a different notation, e.g. "due east", is used instead.

==Cartographical azimuth==
The cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane ([[Spatial reference system|cartographical coordinates]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{180}{\pi} \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical [[polar coordinate system]] and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in [[radian]]s would be slightly easier:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \operatorname{atan2}(X_2 - X_1, Y_2 - Y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

::'''Caveat:''' Most computer libraries (C/C++, Python, Java, ...) reverse the order of the [[atan2]] parameters.

===Calculating coordinates===
When the coordinates (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of one point, the distance ''L'', and the azimuth ''α'' to another point (''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_2 &amp;= X_1 + L \sin\alpha \\
  Y_2 &amp;= Y_1 + L \cos\alpha
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is typically used in [[triangulation]].

==Calculating azimuth==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The azimuth between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projection in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
We are standing at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2&lt;/math&gt;, longitude ''L'' (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth ''α'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\cos\varphi_1 \tan\varphi_2 - \sin\varphi_1 \cos L}&lt;/math&gt;

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an ''[[oblate spheroid]]''); ''azimuth'' then has at least two very slightly different meanings. ''Normal-section azimuth'' is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; ''geodetic azimuth'' is the angle between north and the ''geodesic''; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100&amp;nbsp;km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.

Various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., [http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/datums/vincenty_inverse.jsp GeoScience Australia site]. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the [[Geographical distance#Ellipsoidal-surface formulae|distance article]].

Normal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance {{citation needed|reason=No mention of (Guy) Bomford or Cunningham anywhere else on this page|date=September 2015}}. If ''f'' is the flattening for the chosen spheroid (e.g., {{frac|{{val|298.257223563}}}} for [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]) then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         e^2 &amp;= f(2 - f) \\
     1 - e^2 &amp;= (1 - f)^2 \\
     \Lambda &amp;= \left(1 - e^2\right) \frac{\tan \varphi_2}{ \tan \varphi_1} + e^2 \sqrt{\cfrac {1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_2\right)^2}{1 + \left(1 - e^2\right)\left(\tan \varphi_1\right)^2}} \\
  \tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\sin L}{(\Lambda - \cos L)\sin\varphi_1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{\sin L}{\left(1 - e^2\right)\tan\varphi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).

==Mapping==
There is a wide variety of [[Map projection#Azimuthal .28projections onto a plane.29|azimuthal map projections]]. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.

==Astronomy==
Used in celestial navigation, an ''azimuth'' is the direction of a celestial body from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, Carl, The Wilderness Route Finder, University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In astronomy, an ''azimuth'' is sometimes referred to as a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]. In modern [[astronomy]] azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.
(The article on [[Celestial coordinate system|coordinate systems]], for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the [[hour angle]] of a [[star]] was zero. This assumes, however, that the star [[culmination|(upper) culminates]] in the south, which is only true if the star's [[declination]] is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's [[latitude]].

==Other systems==

===Right ascension===
If, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the [[celestial equator]], the angles are called [[right ascension]] if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the [[celestial meridian]].

===Horizontal coordinate===
In the [[horizontal coordinate system]], used in [[celestial navigation]] and [[satellite dish]] installation, azimuth is one of the two [[coordinate system|coordinates]]. The other is [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: [[Sat finder]].

===Polar coordinate===
In mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] or [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] is the anticlockwise [[angle]] between the positive ''x''-axis and the projection of the [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] onto the ''xy''-[[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The angle is the same as an angle in [[polar coordinates]] of the component of the vector in the ''xy''-plane and is normally measured in [[radian]]s rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications [[theta]], ''θ'', is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol  [[phi (letter)|phi]] ''φ''.

==Other uses of the word==
For [[tape drive|magnetic tape drives]], ''azimuth'' refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.

In [[sound localization]] experiments and literature, the ''azimuth'' refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.

An [[azimuth thruster]] in [[shipbuilding]] is a [[propeller]] that can be rotated horizontally.

==Etymology of the word==
The word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic ''al-sumūt'', pronounced ''as-sumūt'' in Arabic, meaning "the directions" (plural of Arabic ''al-samt'' = "the direction"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the [[Astrolabe]] astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomía]]'' commissioned by [[King Alfonso X]] of Castile.&lt;ref&gt;"Azimuth" at [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/602/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']; "azimut" at [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/azimut ''Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'']; "al-Samt" at [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-samt-SIM_6591 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam'']; "azimuth" at [http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 EnglishWordsOfArabicAncestry.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102020035/http://englishwordsofarabicancestry.wordpress.com/#cite_note-39 |date=January 2, 2014 }}. In Arabic the written ''al-sumūt'' is always pronounced ''as-sumūt'' (see [[Sun and moon letters|pronunciation of "al-" in Arabic]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blowouts''' are sandy [[depression (geology)|depression]]s in a sand [[dune]] ecosystem ([[psammosere]]) caused by the removal of sediments by [[wind]].

Commonly found in coastal settings and arid margins, blowouts tend to form when wind erodes into patches of bare sand on stabilized vegetative dunes. Generally, blowouts don’t form on actively flowing dunes due to the fact that they need to be bound by some extent, such as plant roots. These depressions usually start on the higher parts of the stabilized dunes on the account that [[desiccation]] and disturbances are more considerable which allows for greater surface drag and sediment entrainment when sand is bare. Most of the time, exposures become quickly re-vegetative before they could become blowouts and expand; however, when the opportunities are given, [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]] can lower the exposure surface and create a tunneling affect, which increases the wind speed. The depression may continue until it hits a non-erodible substrate or morphology limits it. The eroded substances climbs the steep slopes of the depression and become deposited on the downwind side of the blowout which can form a dune that covers vegetation and lead to a larger area of depression; a process that helps create [[Dune|parabolic dunes]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, Ian, and Andrew Warren. ''Aeolian Geomorphology: An Introduction''. Wesley Longman Limited, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vegetation ==
Although there is a wide variety of vegetation that live in [[Sand dune ecology|dune environments]] around the world, most plant species play a key role in determining whether blowouts will form or not by the result of how strong their protective skins can suppress erosion and how capable some pioneer species can repress further erosion if a dune becomes exposed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Barchyn, Thomas E, and Chris H Hugenholtz. "Reactivation of Supply-limited Dune Fields from Blowouts: A Conceptual Framework for State Characterization." Geomorphology, 201 (2013): 172-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protective Skin'''

In the first case, the primary objective for the protective skin is to resist disturbances that will form open exposures and create blowouts. To prevent erosion, vegetation helps reduce shear stress by covering the surface and mechanically binding soil together.  The protective skin is composed of vegetation that is above and below ground surface and decomposing plant liter. Additionally, the protective skin can also be composed of a wide variety of species that could constitute environments like [[grassland]]s and forest.  However, if the [[climate change]]s, it can directly influence the health of the vegetation, which can make the skin fragile; nevertheless, the rate of change may take some time and may be different for stabilized dunes in different environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Pioneer Species'''

Once disturbances destroy a portion of the protective skin, the exposure can expand and erode other portions of the skin; however, some vegetation, such as [[pioneer species]], can settle in an opening and prevent any further expansion and deflation. Even though a few plants species can be classed as a colonizer, these plants tend to withstand high rates of sediment deposition and poor nutrient conditions in the blowout.  Moreover, if a blowout does form, the deposited material that travels out of the depression can either continue to become deposited at a greater rate than pioneer vegetation can grow or become stabilized again. Mostly due to changes in the [[climate]], colonizer species heavily rely on conditions of the environment, which can change dramatically unlike the vegetation in the protective skin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coastal sand dunes are found just inland from a beach, and are formed as the wind blows dry sand inland beyond the beach. It follows that this can only happen when there is an area of reasonably flat land inland from the beach. In time, this rather inhospitable surface will be colonised by pioneer species. These species (e.g. [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]]) will stabilise the dunes and prevent them moving any more. The process of [[Ecological succession|plant succession]] will eventually see these [[dune]]s converted to woodland (depending on the climate) and a mature soil will have formed.&lt;ref&gt;Hugenholtz, C.H. and Wolfe, S.A. 2006. Morphodynamics and climate controls of two aeolian blowouts on the northern Great Plains, Canada. ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' 31(12):1540-1557.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blowouts provide an important [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Rydberg, P.A. 1895. Flora of the sand hills of Nebraska. Contributions from the United States National Herbarium 3:133-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disturbances ==
Disturbances are generally phrases to define a cause that creates an exposure in the vegetative skin, which leads to blowout formation. Rather being described as events, disturbances are terms to describe the rate that breaches create an opening and expand, yet there are numerous types of disturbances that can penetrate the protective vegetative skin. Despite the fact that many factors could influence blowout formations, disturbances usually have three characteristics to determine if a depression will form and expand. The first property states that disturbances must have a penetration magnitude greater than the toughness of the protective vegetative skin. Simply if the breach cannot remove the shielding vegetation wind erosion cannot create a depression in [[Sand dune stabilization|stabilized dunes]].  The second property asserts that sediment transportation in an exposure would be limited if exposure’s spatial coverage is too small. Presuming that the opening is very compacted, the fetch length would also be very cramped which doesn’t allow much [[sediment]] particles to be moved out of the exposure. Lastly the third property exclaims that spatial configuration of the disturbed openings greatly influences the fetch length and [[sediment transport]]ation in the exposure. If there were numerous disturbed patches that borderline each other in a down wind direction, wind erosion may be capable of removing and transporting large amounts of sediment particles, which could create blowouts. Thus, although the scale of the disturbances does assist in blowout formation, these characteristics generally help dictate if Aeolian processes can create a depression or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Airflow Dynamics &amp; Morphology ==
Once an exposure has been spawned, the morphology of the blowout depends on the interaction of wind speed and direction with the stabilized dune’s vegetation and topography. There is a wide range of blowout types that form depending on these factors; however, the scientific community mostly utilizes two types of blowouts: trough and saucer. Although there is no obvious reason why one type is formed rather another in a particular region, saucer blowouts generally have semicircular and saucer shapes while trough blowouts have more elongated shapes with deep deflation basins and steeper slopes. Nevertheless, both types of blowouts have structures that can affect wind flow within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hesp, Patrick. "Foredunes and Blowouts: Initiation, Geomorphology and Dynamics." Geomorphology, 48.1 (2002): 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In troughs, the structure’s topography can accelerate flows and form jets that result in maximum erosion along the deflation basin floor and laterally expand the slopes of the blowout. Additionally, when the wind flows on top of the blowout’s lateral walls, sediment transport is at its maximum in the middle axis of the trough depositional lobe, leading to formation of a parabolic dune.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although some studies like Hesp and Prinlge (2001) noted that wind flow that was oblique to blowouts’ orientation became pulled into the depression due to a zone of low pressure at the deflation basin and was steered parallel to the orientation of the trough blowout. However, in Smyth, Jackson, and Cooper’ study (2014), little evidence supported that wind flow was being steered along the axis of the blowout, rather the flow remained constant to the direction that it was flowing before or showed other characteristics like turbulent separated flows.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Thomas Andrew George, Derek Jackson, and Andrew Cooper. "Airflow and Aeolian Sediment Transport Patterns Within a Coastal Trough Blowout During Lateral Wind Conditions." ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'', 39.14 (2014): 1847-1854.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saucer blowouts indicate a deceleration of wind flow along the deflation basin as the structure widens over time by reversing flows eroding the sides and expanding upwind. Due to rapid deceleration, saucers tend to form short, wide, radial depositional slopes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When wind flow enters a saucer shape blowout, the wind speed decreases upon entering the blowout and accelerates at the downwind side of the formation. A zone of separation develops along the lee slope as the wind enters the blowout and decrease in speed, yet it accelerates again as it re-attaches at the basin and flow up to the depositional lobe, where sand becomes evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;Hugenholtz, Chris H, and  Stephen A. Wolfe. “Form-flow Interactions of an Aeolian Saucer Blowout.” ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'', 34 (2009): 919-928.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they’re more influences blowout structures have on their morphology, both types basically tend to have deflation basins eroded until they reach their non-erodible base level. A study conducted by Hesp (1982) indicates that depositional length isn’t correlated with the eroded depth but rather the blowout width. In other words, as the depositional lobe increases, the blowout width also increases by a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 in saucer blowouts and 1:4 in trough blowouts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Finland Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Finland]]
The '''climate of Finland''' is influenced most by its [[latitude]]: [[Finland]] is located between 60 and 70 N. Because of Finland's northern location, winter is the longest season. Only on the south coast and the southeast is summer as long as winter. On average, winter lasts from early January to late February in the outermost islands in the archipelago and the warmest locations along the southwestern coast – notably in [[Hanko]], and from early October to mid May in the most elevated locations, such as northwestern Lapland and the lowest valleys in northeastern Lapland. This means that southern portions of the country are snow-covered about three to four months of the year, and the northern for about seven months. The long winter causes about half of the annual {{convert|500|to|600|mm|in|1}} precipitation in the north to fall as snow. Precipitation in the south amounts to about {{convert|600|to|700|mm|in|1}} annually. Like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though not so much of it is snow.&lt;ref name="FMICLI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/climate-elements |title=Climate elements | |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute |access-date=November 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Köppen climate classification]] Finland belongs to the Df group (continental subarctic or boreal climates). The southern coast is Dfb (humid continental mild summer, wet all year), and the rest of the country is Dfc (subarctic with cool summer, wet all year).&lt;ref&gt;http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/Europe_MiddleEast.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/162263/  Köppen Climate Classification System] Encyclopedia of Earth&lt;/ref&gt; 

The climate of Finland has characteristics of both [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] and [[continental climate]]. The Atlantic Ocean to the west and the [[Eurasia]]n continent to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]] and the [[North Atlantic current|North Atlantic Drift Current]], play a big role in the climate of Norway, Sweden and Finland which continuously warm the region, if it weren't for these currents the winters in Scandinavia and Fennoscandia would be much colder. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south and southwest in cities like Helsinki and Turku where winter highs tend to be between {{convert|0|and|5|C}} but a cold snap like the one that occurred in mid-January 2016 can cause temperatures to plunge well below {{convert|-20|C}}. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and are high temperatures in the summer.

== Temperature ==
The warmest annual average temperature in Southwestern Finland is {{convert|6.5|C}}. From there the temperature decreases gradually towards north and east. [[Suomenselkä]] and [[Maanselkä]] [[drainage divide]]s rise higher than the surrounding areas, and the climate is there cooler than at same latitudes elsewhere in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Karttunen, Hannu &amp; Koistinen, Jarmo &amp; Saltikoff, Elena &amp; Manner, Olli: Ilmakehä, sää ja ilmasto. Ursan julkaisuja 107. Helsingissä: Ursa, 2008. {{ISBN|978-952-5329-61-2}}. page 357-358&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barents Sea]] between Finland and North Pole is open even in winter, so northerly airflows are not as cold as in Siberia or Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://journal.fi/tt/article/view/57983 |title=  Suomen ilmaston erityispiirteitä  |last=Solantie |first=Reijo |year=2001 |website=Tieteessä tapahtuu |access-date=November 15, 2017 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The highest ever recorded temperature is {{convert|37.2|°C|°F}} ([[Liperi]], July 29, 2010).&lt;ref name="yle.fi_20100729"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/07/mercury_hits_all_time_record_of_372_degrees_1863179.html |title= Mercury Hits All Time Record of 37.2 Degrees |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |date= July 29, 2010 |work= YLE Uutiset |publisher= Yleisradio Oy |location= Helsinki }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest, {{convert|−51.5|°C|°F}} ([[Kittilä]], January 28, 1999). The annual average temperature is relatively high in the southwestern part of the country ({{convert|5.0|to|7.5|°C|°F|disp=or}}), with quite mild winters and warm summers, and low in the northeastern part of [[Sápmi (area)|Lapland]] ({{convert|0|to|-4|°C|°F|disp=or}}).

==Wind ==
The most common wind direction in Finland is from southwest, but the [[Extratropical cyclone|low pressure areas]] typical for these latitudes cause great variations in wind speed and direction.&lt;ref name="FMICLI"/&gt;

Storm, defined as at least one Finnish coastal station reporting at least 21 m/s as a 10-minutes average wind speed, is observed on Finnish seas in average 19 days a year. Strong winds are most frequent between October and January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/tuulitilastot |title=Tuulitilastot | website=fmi |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute |access-date=November 18, 2017 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Snow ==
The first snow cover is observed on average in September in Lapland, and in November in Southern and western areas. Permanent snow cover time starts typically after Christmas in the Southwestern corner, but before mid-November in most of Lapland. The maximum snow depth is usually found around March.&lt;ref name="FMISNOW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/snow-statistics |title=Snow statistics | |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute |access-date=November 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow and supercooled droplets can accumulate in tree crowns and cause damage to trees. The trunks of pine trees can break under the weight of a snowloaded crown, and deciduous trees can bend permanently. The snowload of a tree is typically 100–150 kg per one meter tree trunk, but the heaviest measured snowload of a spruce was over 3000 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.luke.fi/en/natural-resources/forest/forest-damage/snow-damage/ |title=Snow damage | website=Luke |publisher=Natural Resources Institute Finland |access-date=November 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowmelt contributes to spring floods. In north, the peak flow of rivers always happens in spring, in the south 70–80% of floods happen in spring. In the south, maximum flow happens in mid-April, in the north, in mid-May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/31432/Vesientutkimuslaitoksen+julkaisuja+55.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Snow accumulation and snowmelt in Finland | last=Kuusisto |first=Esko|publisher=National board of waters |access-date=November 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corrie''' is a unisex [[surname]] in the [[English language]]. The name has several different [[etymological]] origins. The name is found in numbers in the north of [[Ireland]]. The surname has been borne by a noted [[Scottish family]], that was originally seated in what is today the [[Civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]] of [[Hutton and Corrie]].

==Etymology==

In some cases the surname originated as a [[habitational name]], derived from several different locations named ''Corrie''. For example, the surnames are derived from the places so-named on the [[Isle of Arran]], and in [[Dumfries]] (both of which are located in [[Scotland]]). The place names are derived from the [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''coire'', meaning "[[cauldron]]", which was used in place names to describe a circular [[valley]] on the side of a [[mountain]].&lt;ref name="ancestry-Corrie"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |publisher=[[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}, which cited: {{citation |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-508137-4 }}, for the surnames "Corrie".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another origin of the surname is from a variation of the surnames ''[[Corry (disambiguation)|Corry]]'' and ''[[McCorry]]'', which are common in the north of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="ancestry-Corrie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irishtimes-Corry"/&gt; These particular surnames are derived from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[Mac Gothraidh]]'', meaning "son of ''[[Gothradh]]''".&lt;ref name="irishtimes-Corry"&gt;{{citation |title=Irish Ancestors |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/surname/ |publisher=[[Irishtimes.com]] (www.irishtimes.com) |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}, which cited: {{citation |last=MacLysaght |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward MacLysaght |title=More Irish Families |publication-place=Dublin |year=1982 }}, for the surname "Corry".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ancestry-McGorry"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |publisher=[[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}, which cited: {{citation |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-508137-4 }}, for the surnames "McGorry".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
In [[Ireland]], the surname is rare, although it is found in numbers in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]]. The surname, when found in Ireland, can originate as either the northern Irish patronym, or from any of the Scottish toponyms.&lt;ref name="irishtimes-Corrie"&gt;{{citation |title=Irish Ancestors |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/surname/ |publisher=[[Irishtimes.com]] (www.irishtimes.com) |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}, which cited: {{citation |last=de Bhulbh |first=Seán  |title=Sloinnte na hÉireann - Irish Surnames |publisher=Comharchumann Íde Naofa |year=1997 }}, for the surname "Corrie".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Families==
The name has been borne by a notable [[Scottish family]], the [[Corrie family]], that was seated in Dumfries. The family derived its surname from the toponym in Dumfries, which is located in what is now the [[Civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]] of [[Hutton and Corrie]].&lt;ref name="Black-172"&gt;{{citation |last=Black |first=George Fraser |title=The Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning, and History |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |publication-place=New York |year=1946 |page=172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading branch of the family were known as the ''Corries of that Ilk''.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{citation |last=Anderson |first=William |title=The Scottish nation; or, The surnames, families, literature, honours, and biographical history of the people of Scotland |volume=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/scottishnationor01ande |publisher=A.

'''Dun Mountain''' is a mountain in the Richmond Range near the city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in [[New Zealand|New Zealand's]] [[South Island]]. It is located between the catchments of the [[Pelorus River|Pelorus]], [[Roding River|Maitai]] and [[Roding River|Roding Rivers]]. The mountain is named for its brown (Dun) colour. The colour is caused by the [[ultramafic rock]] which forms the mountain. Ultramafic Rock weathers to this colour and plant growth is also stunted due to the soils high heavy metal content.&lt;ref name="RobinsonBrooks1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Brett H.|last2=Brooks|first2=Robert R.|last3=Kirkman|first3=John H.|last4=Gregg|first4=Paul E.H.|last5=Gremigni|first5=Patrizia|title=Plant‐available elements in soils and their influence on the vegetation over ultramafic ("serpentine") rocks in New Zealand|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=26|issue=4|year=1996|pages=457–468|issn=0303-6758|doi=10.1080/03014223.1996.9517520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultramafic rock formed in the earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in the Permian and is now part of the [[Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt]].

'''E-Corce''' was a planned remote sensing satellite constellation of [[CNES]], slated for launch in 2014.

Designed by an engineer from CNES, JP Antikidis, in the frame of a prospective unit led by JJ Favier, this project is revolutionizing satellite [[Earth observation]] methodologies by allowing at acceptable cost a rapid coverage of the entire planet (1 day to 1 week) with [[Image resolution|high resolution]] (metric) color pictures. The solutions use [[image compression]] ([[Psychophysics|psycho-visual]]) coupled with new methods of receiving and processing information distributed across the planet. The project aims by 2014 to photograph all of the continents in color at a resolution of 1 meter, every week, with a constellation of 13 Earth-orbiting [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]] at 600&amp;nbsp;km, imaging everything in their path and down-linking compressed data to processing centers on the world.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Definition:''' "e-Constellation of Observation by Recurrent Cellular Environment" combining of three technological "cells"(space, telecom, Grid) to produce a [[multi-spectral image]] of the Earth. "e" as intended to feed the new vectors of the mass-based Internet, "Constellation" because relying on a constellation of satellites observing the earth in "saturation" [[Recurrence relation|REcurrent]] "because based on a systematic information delivery high resolution refreshed daily to weekly "Cellular " because using the combined virtues of new technology based on cellular processing (Wide Area Grid) distributed across the full globe.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The '''Eastern Ghats''' are a discontinuous range of mountains along [[India]]'s eastern coast. The Eastern Ghats run from the northern [[Odisha]] through [[Andhra Pradesh]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south passing some parts of [[Karnataka]] and in the [[Wayanad district|Wayanad region]] of Kerala. They are eroded and cut through by four major rivers of peninsular India, viz. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Mahanadi]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri]].

The mountain ranges run parallel to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Deccan Plateau]] lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. The [[coastal plain]]s, including the [[Coromandel Coast]] region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Ghats are not as high as the [[Western Ghats]].

==Geography==
The Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Rodinia]] and the assembly of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent.

The Eastern Ghats are made up of [[charnockite]]s, [[granite]] [[gneiss]], [[khondalite]]s, [[metamorphic]] [[Gneiss|gneisses]] and [[quartzite]] rock formations. The structure of the Eastern Ghats includes [[Thrust fault|thrusts]] and [[strike-slip fault]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF03052185.pdf#page-1 | doi=10.1007/BF03052185 |journal = Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Section B

The [[Eparchaean Unconformity]] of the Tirumala Hills is a major [[unconformity|discontinuity]] of [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] significance that represents an extensive period of [[erosion]] and [[Deposition (geology)|non-deposition]]. It is seen at the steep natural slopes, road scars and ravines in the [[Tirumala ghat roads]] in the [[Chittoor district]] of Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name=Monument&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/pls/portal/url/page/GSI_STATIC/GSI_STAT_GEO_TOURISM_MONUMENTS| title=Eparchaean Unconformity, Tirumala Ghat section| accessdate=2009-09-20| publisher=Geological Survey of India| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419091251/http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/pls/portal/url/page/GSI_STATIC/GSI_STAT_GEO_TOURISM_MONUMENTS| archive-date=2013-04-19| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSI"&gt;{{cite book| title= Geological Monuments of India| work=Eparchaean Unconformity (Tirupati Tirupati Road)| pages=5–8| publisher=Geological Survey of India| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hill ranges==
[[File:Tamil_Nadu_topo_deutsch_mit_Gebirgen.png|thumb|300px|right|Topography- Eastern Ghats (Southern part)]]
As with the Western Ghats, these mountain ranges also have local names along the discontinuous hill ranges.

At their southern end, the Eastern Ghats form several ranges of low hills. The southernmost of the Eastern Ghats are the low [[Sirumalai]] and Karanthamalai Hills of southern Tamil Nadu.

North of the [[Kaveri River]] are the higher [[Kolli Hills|Kollimalai]], [[Pachaimalai Hills|Pachaimalai]], [[Shevaroy Hills|Shevaroy]] (Servarayan), [[Kalrayan Hills]], [[Chitteri]], Javadhu Hills, Palamalai and [[Mettur]] Hills in northern Tamil Nadu state. The climate of the higher hill ranges is generally cooler and wetter than the surrounding plains, and the hills are home to [[coffee]] plantations and enclaves of dry forest.

The [[hill station]] of [[Yercaud]] is located in the [[Shevaroy Hills]]. The [[Biligiriranga Hills]], which run east from the Western Ghats to the River Kaveri, form a forested ecological corridor that connects the Eastern and Western Ghats, and allows the second-largest wild [[Asian elephant]] population in India to range between the South Eastern Ghats, the [[Biligiriranga Hills]] and [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri Hills]], and the South [[Western Ghats]].

The [[Male Mahadeshwara Hills]] Temple is situated in [[Chamarajanagar district]] in [[Karnataka]] state in the Eastern Ghats.

The [[Ponnaiyar River|Ponnaiyar]] and [[Palar River|Palar]] rivers flow from headwaters on the [[Kolar Plateau]] eastward through gaps in the Ghats to empty into the Bay of Bengal; the [[Javadi Hills|Javadhu Hills]] lie between the two rivers. There are waterfalls in remote areas, such as the [[Kiliyur Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

North of the [[Palar River]] in Andhra Pradesh, the central portion of the Eastern Ghats consists of two parallel ranges running approximately north-south. The lower [[Velikonda Range]] lies to the east, and the higher Palikonda-Lankamalla-[[Nallamalai Hills|Nallamalai Ranges]] lie to the west. They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the [[Coromandel Coast]] for close to 430&amp;nbsp;km between the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Penna River|Pennar]] rivers. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin, while in the south it merges with the [[Tirupati]] hills. An extremely old system, the hills have been extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520&amp;nbsp;m, but reaches 1,100&amp;nbsp;m at Bhairani Konda and 1,048&amp;nbsp;m at Gundla Brahmeswara.

The Tirumala Hills are located along the [[Seshachalam Hills|Seshachalam]]-Velikonda Range of the Eastern Ghats. The Palar River cuts through the ranges. The [[Velikonda Range]] eventually descends to the coastal plain in northern [[Nellore district]], while the Nallamalla Range in Kurnool continues to the River Krishna.

The Kondapalli Hills are a range of low hills which lie between the Krishna and the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] rivers. These hills are located in the Guntur, Krishna, West Godavari and Khammam districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna River bisects these hills of the Eastern Ghats. The main hill range starts from Nandigrama to [[Vijayawada]] known as [[Kondapalli]].

The Papi Hills (Papi Kondalu) are distributed among the Khammam, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh and lie in the Eastern Ghats.

[[Madhurawada]] Dome in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt is formed by a tectonic arrangement with the khondalite suite and quartz Archean rocks along the Eastern Ghats north of [[Visakhapatnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=P.| last1=Jagadeeswara Rao| last2=Harikrishna| first2=P.| last3=Srivastav| first3=S.K.| last4=Satyanarayana| first4=P.V.V.| last5=Vasu Deva Rao| first5=B.| title=Selection of groundwater potential zones in and around Madhurawada Dome, Visakhapatnam District - A GIS approach| journal=J.

The [[Maliya Range]] is located in the northern portion of the Eastern Ghats. The Maliya Range generally ranges between elevations of 900–1200&amp;nbsp;m, although some of its summits soar higher. The tallest peak in this range is [[Mahendragiri (Odisha)|Mahendragiri]] (1,501&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name="Kohli2013"&gt;{{cite book | author=M.S.

The [[Madugula Konda Range]] is located in the northern portion of the Eastern Ghats. The Madugula Konda range is higher than the Maliyas and generally ranges between elevations of 1100–1400&amp;nbsp;m. Prominent summits include the highest peak of the Eastern Ghats - [[Arma Konda]] (1680&amp;nbsp;m), Gali Konda (1643&amp;nbsp;m) and Sinkram Gutta (1620&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name="Kohli2013"/&gt;

The highest mountain peak in the state of [[Odisha]] is [[Deomali, Koraput|Deomali]] (1672&amp;nbsp;m), which is situated in the [[Koraput district]] of southern Odisha.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It is part of the Chandragiri-Pottangi mountain system. The region covers about three-fourths of the entire [[Odisha]] state. Geologically it is a part of the Indian Peninsula which was a part of the ancient land mass of Gondwanaland. The major rivers of Odisha with their tributaries have cut deep and narrow valleys.

The [[Garhjat Range]] is a northeastern prolongation of the eastern Ghats which rises abruptly and steeply in the east and slopes gently to a dissected plateau in the west running from north-west ([[Mayurbhanj]]) to south-west ([[Malkangiri]]). The Odisha highlands are also known as the Garhjat Hills. This region is well marked by a number of interfluves or watersheds which interrupt the terrain in the form of broad and narrow river valleys and flood plains. The average height of this region is about 900&amp;nbsp;metres above mean sea level.

The [[Simlipal National Park|Similipal]] [[massif]] is considered the farthest northeast extension of the Eastern Ghats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/indiaconservation/icr20031html.html "National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan profiles the Eastern Ghats of southern India"] originally from http://sdnp.delhi.nic.in/nbsap/dactionp/ecoregion/eghatdraft.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3375">'''Eduard Brückner''' (29 July 1862 – 20 May 1927) was a German geographer, meteorologist, glaciologist and climate scientist.

He was born in [[Jena]], the son of the [[Baltic-German]] historian [[Alexander Brückner]] and Lucie Schiele. After an education at the [[Karlsruhe]] gymnasium, beginning in 1881 he studied meteorology and physics at the [[University of Dorpat]], graduating in 1885. He joined the Deutsche Seewarte (German Hydrographic Office) in [[Hamburg]], then, following studies at [[Dresden]] and [[Munich]], he became a professor at the [[University of Bern]] in 1888. The same year he married Ernestine Steine. In 1899, he was rector at the university. He moved back to Germany in 1904, becoming a professor at the [[University of Halle]]. Two years later in 1906, he was a professor at the [[University of Vienna]]. He died in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=allaby2002/&gt;

Professor Brückner was an expert on alpine [[glacier]]s and their effect upon the landscape.&lt;ref name=allaby2002/&gt; Between 1901–1909 he collaborated with German geographer and geologist [[Albrecht Penck]] to produce a three volume work titled ''Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter'' (''The Alps in the Ice Age''). This served as a standard reference on the [[ice age]]s for several decades thereafter.&lt;ref name=berge_shor2009/&gt; Brückner was a proponent of the importance of climate change, including the effects on the economy and social structure of society.&lt;ref name=allaby2002/&gt; His research included studies of past climate changes and he proposed the 35-year-long ''Brückner cycle'' of cold, damp weather alternating with warm, dry weather in northwest Europe.&lt;ref name=StehrandVonStorch2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=harper2007/&gt;

The GKSS Research Centre's ''Eduard Brückner Prize'', for outstanding achievement in interdisciplinary climate research, is named after him.

'''Environmental anthropology''' is a sub-specialty&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.

== Philosophies ==

===Adaptation: environment over culture===
The sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"/&gt; The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in [[Marcel Mauss]]' ''Seasonal Variation of Eskimo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Mauss|title=''Seasonal variations of the Eskimo: a study in social morphology''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRbl6DmN8vkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33035-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed later in Julian Steward's work.&lt;ref&gt;Steward JH. 1938. The Great Basin Shoshonean Indians: An Example of A Family Level Of Sociocultural Integration. ''Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Read''. 168–180.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vayda|first1=Andrew P.|author1-link=Andrew P. Vayda|last2=McCay|first2=Bonnie J.|author2-link= Bonnie McCay |title=New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=4|pages=293|year=1975|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by [[Julian Steward]],&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"&gt;Steward JH. 1955. Theory of Cultural Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or "laws." Steward's [[ecological anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"/&gt; was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While [[Marvin Harris]]' cultural materialism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Harris|title=Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC|accessdate=3 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0135-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants.

=== Diversity, history and associations ===
The new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost &amp; benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Richard B.|doi=10.1525/aa.1992.94.1.02a00030|title=Art, Science, or Politics?

This perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as "loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity" and possible "incentives or inhibitors" in relations to behavior.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biersack|first1=Aletta|title=Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=5|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods,&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt; acknowledges, "The social unit is not always well defined&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt;

=== Policy and activism: politics versus environmentalism ===
The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"/&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"/&gt;

Critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they "generalize" and "obscure" local discourse and message.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/200019|author=Brosius JP|year= 1999|title= Analyses And Interventions; Anthropological Engagements With Environmentalism|journal= Current Anthropology|jstor=200019|volume= 40|pages= 277–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"/&gt; An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Brosius|first1=J.|title=Green Dots, Pink Hearts: Displacing Politics from the Malaysian Rain Forest|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=1|pages=36–57|year=1999|pmid=19280759|jstor=683340|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and pioneers ===

Environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;Sponsel L. (2004, May). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecological_anthropology Ecological Anthropology]. Encyclopedia of Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;
It focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902–1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies.
Steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned.&lt;ref name="Grinker R.R 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinker|first1=ROY Richard|title=The Politics of Knowledge: Julian Steward, Leslie White, Melville Herskovits, and L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=37|pages=259|year=2008|doi=10.1080/00938150802038935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformations ===
Steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s–60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists [[John Bennett (anthropologist)|John Bennett]], [[Roy A. Rappaport]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop "cultural materialism" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. [[Eric Alden Smith]] and [[Bruce Winterhalder]] laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
Anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology.

Environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SfAA),

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the common good."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"&gt;The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). [http://www.sfaa.net/eap/ea.html “What is Environmental Anthropology?”] Accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;

Environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms of diversity, and capacity for planning and development."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as [[emic]] (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.{{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

'''Fern''' (also '''''Stichting Fern''''') is a [[Private foundation#Netherlands|Dutch foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aMjXCF4rmDUC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=Fern+dutch+foundation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CdbvVYGm16&amp;sig=MIpMJhPV68aOWUExttEJ8GLnufg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ1tWal8vbAhUJAXwKHd_7AG4Q6AEIdjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Fern%20dutch%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Standard Floras of the World: An Annotated, Geographically Arranged Systematic Bibliography of the Principal Floras, Enumerations, Checklists and Chorological Atlases of Different Areas|last=Frodin|first=David G.|date=2001-06-14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139428651|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; created in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://old.fern.org/page/ferns-statutes|title=Fern's statutes|date=2011-03-02|work=FERN|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[international]] [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organization]] (NGO) set up to keep track of the [[European Union]]'s involvement in [[forests]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pfbc-cbfp.org/news_en/items/new-paradigm.html|title=FERN-Project CoNGOs: Discussing a new paradigm for Community Forestry (Douala) - CBFP|website=pfbc-cbfp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to coordinate NGO activities at the European level. Fern works to protect forests and the rights of people who depend on them.&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Fern is known for its work on forests, since 2000 it has widened its scope to include climate&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/climate&lt;/ref&gt;, development aid&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/development-aid&lt;/ref&gt;, trade&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/trade&lt;/ref&gt; and consumption&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/consumption&lt;/ref&gt; as many of the decisions made in these areas have a direct or indirect impact on forests and forest peoples’ rights. In all these areas, Fern works very closely with a large number of [[environmental group]]s and [[social movements]] across the world.

Fern is a non-hierarchical [[flat organization]]. Currently, it has two offices ([[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]; and [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], UK) and 17 staff.

Fern's official mission statement is "We identify the threats facing the world's forests, and work with affected peoples, social and environmental organisations and policy makers to devise and deliver solutions where the EU can make a difference."&lt;ref&gt;www.fern.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Fern's origin lies in the [[World Rainforest Movement]] meeting in [[Penang]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=FERNwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fern.org/node/3727 |title=Annual Report 2005 |publisher=FERN |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting Southern participants decided they needed closer co-operation with a network of like-minded European organisations to further their objectives. An already existing ad hoc European coalition of NGOs responded and adopted the name European Rainforest Movement. This movement changed its name into [[Forest Movement Europe]] in 1994 after linking up with the newly formed [[Taiga Rescue Network]] (1992) and widening its focus to all forests, including [[Russia]].

As most NGOs of the [[Forest Movement Europe]] were working at national level, and increasingly trade and aid decisions that impacted on forests were made at EU level, it was felt by most in the movement that more attention should be given to influencing the EU institutions. Hence, in March 1995 [[Saskia Ozinga]] (formerly working for Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands) and Sian Pettman (formerly working for the [[European Commission]]) created the organisation Fern with a mandate to monitor EU activities in relation to forests, inform and educate the Forest Movement Europe about these activities and facilitate joint advocacy work towards the different EU institutions.

Starting with two part-time people in 1995, Fern has grown to an organisation with sixteen staff and its area of work has widened to include looking at climate change, carbon trading, finance, governance and development aid. Underlying issues such as lack of transparency, insufficient participation of civil society groups in decision-making at EU level and corruption are routinely addressed as part of all its campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Fern [http://www.fern.org site] and [http://www.fern.org/node/4765]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fern's way of working still reflects its origin, as in its activities the organisation aims to create ad hoc or permanent [[North-South]], North-North or South-South NGO coalitions to jointly develop campaigns or activities, mostly –but not always- targeted at the EU institutions. Facilitation of the wider movement and supporting Fern's partners in the South remain Fern core activities.

== Fields of activity ==

The organisation currently actively addresses many areas that have a direct or indirect impact on forests and forest peoples’ rights issues. To achieve its aims, Fern follows many conventional [[environmental organisation]] methods, such as lobbying politicians and attendance at meetings. In addition to these activities, Fern supports both Northern and Southern NGOs in putting their case to the EU institutions and, where needed, helps NGOs with fundraising and strengthening its advocacy skills.&lt;ref name=fernaboutus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fern.org/about-us |title=About us |publisher=FERN |date= |accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fern advocacy activities aim to link different movements and organisations and create effective networks to campaign on issues the organisation believes to be important. Among its advocacy activities FERN links issues, stimulates informed discussion and develops joint strategies in areas that are of critical environmental and social concern, in most cases, but not exclusively, focused on EU institutions. Some of Fern's most outstanding coordination and facilitation work is the organisation of NGO meetings on various issues, such as the annual [[Forest Movement Europe]] meeting.

Since 1996, Fern publishes a monthly bulletin entitled ''EU Forest Watch'', specialised briefing notes and reports on selected topics (e.g. [[illegal logging]]).

== Campaigns ==

Fern currently has six different campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;FERN [http://www.fern.org site]&lt;/ref&gt; These are: [[illegal logging]]; [[forest certification]]; [[climate change]]; [[Export Credit Agencies|export credit agencies]]; European forests and [[biodiversity]]; and [[development aid]]. In all these campaigns, Fern works closely with environmental as well as social NGOs in Europe and the South.

Fern’s work on '''European forests and biodiversity''' works to ensure that existing EU forest-related and rural development policies are implemented to aid the restoration and protection of biologically diverse, well-managed forests in the EU as well as to ensure that international government policies will positively contribute to halting the forest crisis, by reversing the trend of increasing forest and biodiversity loss and addressing the underlying causes that lead to forest loss.

In addition to the work on European forests, other Fern campaigns tackle the underlying causes of forest loss outside the EU. The '''EC development aid''' campaign aims to improve the quality of EC aid so that it contributes both to the protection and sustainable use of forests and to ensuring respect for forest peoples’ rights. The '''illegal logging campaign''' works to ensure that effective measures are developed and implemented so as to allow EU Member States to control the import of illegal timber and to support processes for forest law reform in wood producing countries which will lead to legal and sustainable forest management. Fern’s '''climate change''' campaign aims to ensure that climate policies and international climate agreements address the root causes of climate change and deforestation and refuse [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]] as an unsuitable approach to avert climate chaos and respect the rights of forest peoples affected by carbon trading and carbon 'offset' projects (see FERN's SinksWatch initiative).

Other Fern campaign is the '''Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and finance and trade campaign''', which aims to secure mandatory procedural environmental and human rights standards for European [[Export credit agency|ECA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, set at a significant level, and drawing upon international 'best practice' standards and relevant EU legislation.

== Achievements ==

Some of the most visible Fern achievements include the rejection of the scientifically flawed concept of planting trees to reverse climate change (‘carbon sinks’) by the [[European Parliament]]; highlighting the undue and unjust influence by large companies on environmental and social laws in host countries when executing large projects, such as the [[Chad-Cameroon Pipeline|Chad-Cameroon pipeline]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/821131468224690538/pdf/36569.pdf|title=CHAD-CAMEROON PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT AND PIPELINE PROJECT: OVERVIEW|last=|first=|date=|website=Document of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved integration of environmental concerns and demands for recognition of [[indigenous peoples]] rights’ into EC aid programmes and policies and the creation of networks of Southern NGOs to improve the quality of EC aid; the presentation by the Commission of an EU Action Plan to combat illegal logging followed by legislation to halt illegal timber imports; and successfully coordinating the European network for reforming export credit agencies leading to the adoption of environmental guidelines for [[Export Credit Agencies|export credit agencies]].

Although are successes are foremost at policy level, they impact on local people's lives as most policy decisions trickle down. Some of FERN's successes have already reduced threats to local livelihoods as well as contributed to significant positive improvements. For example, Fern's work on highlighting the flaws in carbon sinks and direct correspondence with the CDM board, has led the CDM board to reject all plantation projects put to it, many of which such as V&amp;M in [[Brazil]], would have had serious negative impacts on people. Also, the EU Action Plan to combat illegal logging would not have been drafted without Fern. This Action Plan – if implemented properly - will create a leverage point to get customary rights accepted as 'legal' in countries as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ghana]] and [[Cameroon]]: the lack of recognition of these rights is arguably the most significant obstacles to poverty alleviation, [[justice]] and even [[democracy]].

Moreover, the campaign on reforming ECAs has led to halting ECA funding and subsequently cancelling some projects, which would have had serious negative consequences for local people, such as in the case of the [[Ilisu Dam]] in Turkey which would have led to the replacement of around 80,000 people, with women suffering most. This was a clear success despite current attempts to revive the project.

== Funding ==

Fern receives its money from [[private foundation]]s and [[government]]s. In order to ensure its independence and impartiality, FERN has committed to not directly participate in the selection, award or administration of a contract when a real or apparent conflict of interest may be involved.

Fern's donors during 2014 included: The [[Ford Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/1529/ar2002.pdf|title=Ford Foundation Annual Report 2002|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; US; [[Department for International Development]], UK;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d7.fern.org/sites/fern.org/files/2015%20financial%20statements.pdf|title=Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Fern|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DG Environment]] of the [[European Commission]]; [[Sigrid Rausing Trust]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sigrid-rausing-trust.org/Grantees Sigrid Rausing Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/search Ford Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally in [[geomorphology]], a '''flatiron''' is a steeply sloping triangular landform created by the differential erosion of a steeply [[Strike and dip|dipping]], erosion-resistant [[Stratum|layer of rock]] overlying softer strata. Flatirons have wide bases that form the base of a steep, triangular facet that narrows upward into a point at its summit. The dissection of a [[Hogback (geology)|hogback]] by regularly spaced streams often resulted in the formation of a series of flatirons along the strike of the rock layer that formed the hogback.&lt;ref name="Ollier1985a"&gt;Ollier, C.

Routledge. New York, New York. 516 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-415-56774-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in some, but not all definitions, a number of flatirons are perched upon the slope of a larger mountain with the rock layer forming the flatiron [[Strike and dip|inclined]] in the same direction as, but often at a steeper angle than the associated mountain slope. The name ''flatiron'' refers their resemblance to an upended, household [[Iron (appliance)#History of flat iron|flatiron]].&lt;ref name="Jackson2005a"&gt;Jackson, JA, J Mehl and K Neuendorf (2005) ''Glossary of Geology.'' American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Flatirons]] near Boulder, Colorado, is both an example of these landforms and the source of their name. Other well-developed flatirons are found in the eastern [[Uinta Mountains]] in northwestern Colorado,&lt;ref name="Hansen2005a"&gt;Hansen, WR (2005) [http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/1291/report.pdf ''The Geologic Story of the Uinta Mountains.''] [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/bul/1291/index.htm Bulletin no. 1291], United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Waterpocket Fold]] in [[Capitol Reef National Park]], the [[Superstition Mountains]] near [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and on the flanks of the Marathon Uplift in west Texas.&lt;ref name="MaCleod2009a"&gt;MaCleod, B. (2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120329075256/http://texasgeologicalpress.com/blog5/2009/10/13/flatirons/ ''Southern Margin of the Marathon Basin.''] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110830173309/http://texasgeologicalpress.com/blog5/category/big-bend-photographs/ Big Bend Photographs], Texas Geological Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "flatiron" is also used for very small-scale landforms that are known as '''pediment flatirons''' and '''talus flatirons'''. These [[landform]]s are small [[Hillock|knolls]] with a triangular to [[trapezoid]]al-shaped sloping surface with the long side of this surface as their base and a point at their top. Both pediment flatirons and talus flatirons are associated with the [[Escarpment|scarps]] of a [[cuesta]], [[mesa]], or [[butte]] and with their tips directed towards the scarp. Both types of these flatirons are typically separated from the scarp by well-defined [[ravine]]s and [[gulley|gullies]]. These flatirons consist of either [[scree|talus]], in the case of the talus flatirons, or pedisediment and [[colluvium]] that cover [[Pediment (geology)|pediments]], in the case of pediment flatirons. Their surfaces are protected by a thin layer of [[caprock]]. The caprock commonly consists of [[caliche]], which is about {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} thick and rarely as much as {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us}} thick, that has developed in either talus, pedisediment, or colluvium. Talus flatirons lie within the scarp slope &amp;ndash; and pediment flatirons occur within the transition zone between scarp and foreland. Pediment flatirons can merge downward into a [[fluvial terrace]]. Both talus and pediment flatirons are the relict remnants of formerly active slope systems that were once part of the scarp's history.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1989a"&gt;Schmidt, K-H (1989) ''Talus and pediment flatirons – erosional and depositional features on dryland cuesta scarps.''

'''Gangwon Province''' or '''Gangwon-do''' ({{IPA-ko|kaŋ.wʌn.do}}) was one of the [[Eight Provinces of Korea]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].  The province was formed in 1395, and derived its name from the names of the principal cities of [[Gangneung]] (강릉; 江陵) and the provincial capital [[Wonju]] (원주; 原州).

In 1895, Gangwon-do was replaced by the [[Provinces of Korea#Districts of Late Joseon|Districts]] of Chuncheon (''Chuncheon-bu;'' 춘천부; 春川府) in the west and Gangneung (''Gangneung-bu;'' 강릉부; 江陵府) in the east.  (Wonju later became part of [[Chungju]] District.)

In 1896, Korea was redivided into thirteen provinces, and the two districts were merged to re-form Gangwon-do Province.  Although Wonju rejoined Gangwon-do province, the provincial capital was moved to [[Chuncheon]] (춘천; 春川).

With the [[division of Korea]] in 1945, the subsequent establishment of separate North and South Korean governments in 1948, and the conclusion of the [[Korean War]] in 1953, Gangwon came to be divided into separate provinces once again:  [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)]] and [[Kangwon-do (North Korea)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17977">The '''geography of Bolivia''' is unique among the nations of South America. [[Bolivia]] is one of two [[landlocked]] countries on the continent (the other being [[Paraguay]]), and Bolivia is more urban (77%) than rural (23%). The main features of  Bolivia's geography include the [[Altiplano]], a highland [[plateau]] of the [[Andes]], and [[Lake Titicaca]], the highest navigable lake on [[Earth]], which is shared with [[Peru]].
 
The most prominent feature of the Altiplano is the large lake at its northern end, Lake Titicaca. At {{convert|3811|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, it is the highest commercially navigable body of water in the world. With a surface area of {{convert|9064|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, it is larger than [[Puerto Rico]] and is [[South America]]'s second largest lake by surface area. Lake Titicaca is also deep, about {{convert|370|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at its deepest, with an average depth of {{convert|215|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; its volume of water is large enough to maintain a constant temperature of {{convert|10|°C|°F}}. The lake actually moderates the climate for a considerable distance around it, making crops of [[maize]] and [[wheat]] possible in sheltered areas. 

Lake Titicaca drains southward through the slow-moving, [[Phragmites|reed]]-filled [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]] to [[Lake Poopó]]. In contrast to the [[freshwater]] Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó is salty and shallow, with depths seldom more than {{convert|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Colors of Altiplano Boliviano 4340m Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|Colors of Altiplano Boliviano.]]
The [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]] is a chain of dormant [[volcano]]es and [[solfatara]]s, [[volcanic vent]]s emitting [[sulfur]]ous gases. Bolivia's highest peak, the snowcapped [[Nevado Sajama]] {{convert|6542|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. The entire cordillera is of volcanic origin and an extension of the volcanic region found in southern Peru. Most of the northern part of this range has an elevation of about {{convert|4000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; the southern part is somewhat lower. Rainfall, although scanty everywhere, is greater in the northern half, where the land is covered with [[scrubland|scrub]] vegetation. The southern area receives almost no [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and the landscape consists mostly of barren rocks. All of the Cordillera Occidental region is sparsely populated, and the south is virtually uninhabited. 

The [[Altiplano]], the high [[plateau]] between the previous range and the [[Cordillera Oriental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Oriental]], comprises four major basins formed by mountainous spurs that jut eastward from the Cordillera Occidental about halfway to the [[Cordillera Oriental, Bolivia|Cordillera Oriental]]. Along the Altiplano's eastern side is a continuous flat area, which has served as Bolivia's principal north-south transport corridor since colonial times. The entire Altiplano was originally a deep [[rift]] between the cordilleras that gradually filled with highly porous [[sediment]]ary debris washed down from the peaks. This sedimentary origin explains its gradual slope from north to south; greater rainfall in the north has washed a larger quantity of debris onto the platform floor. 

Rainfall in the Altiplano decreases toward the south, and the scrub vegetation grows more sparse, eventually giving way to barren rocks and dry red clay. The land contains several [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s, the dried remnants of ancient lakes. The largest of these - and the world's largest salt concentration - is the [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]] Saltpan, which covers over 9,000 square kilometers. The salt is more than five meters deep in the centre of this flat. In the dry season, the lake bed can be traversed by heavy trucks. Near the Argentine border, the floor of the Altiplano rises again, creating hills and volcanoes that span the gap between the eastern and western cordilleras of the Andes. 

The much older [[Cordillera Oriental, Bolivia|Cordillera Oriental]] enters Bolivia on the north side of Lake Titicaca, extends southeastward to approximately 17 south latitude, then broadens and stretches south to the Argentine border. The northernmost part of the Cordillera Oriental, the [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera Real]], is an impressive snow-capped series of [[granite]] mountains. Some of these peaks exceed  {{convert|6000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and two - [[Illimani]]  {{convert|6424|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which overlooks the city of [[La Paz]], and [[Illampu]]  {{convert|6424|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} - have large [[glacier]]s on their upper slopes. South of 17 south latitude, the range changes character. Called the [[Cordillera Central, Bolivia|Cordillera Central]] here, the land is actually a large block of the Earth's crust that has been lifted and tilted eastward. The western edge of this block rises in a series of steep cliffs from the Altiplano. The backbone of the cordillera is a high, rolling plain, with elevations from  {{convert|4200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, interspersed with irregularly spaced high peaks. Too high to be exploited for large-scale commercial grazing, this area takes its name from the predominant [[vegetation type]], the [[puna grassland|puna]].

==Valleys==
The northeastern flank of the [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera Real]] is known as the [[Yungas]], from the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] word ''yunka'' meaning "warm valley."&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; The steep, almost inaccessible slopes and peaks of this mainly semitropical valley area northeast of [[La Paz]] offer some of the most spectacular scenery in Bolivia. Rainfall is heavy, and lush vegetation clings to the sides of narrow river valleys. The land is among the most fertile in Bolivia, but poor transport has hindered its agricultural development. The government attempted to build a railway through the Yungas in 1917 to connect La Paz with the eastern lowlands. The railway was abandoned, however, after completion of only 150 kilometres. 

The eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]] descend gradually in a series of complex north-south ranges and hills. Rivers, draining to the east, have cut long narrow valleys; these valleys and the basins between the ranges are favourable areas for crops and settlement. Rich alluvial soils fill the low areas, but erosion has followed the removal of vegetation in some places. The valley floors range from 2,000 to 3,000 metres above sea level, and this lower elevation means milder temperatures than those of the Altiplano. The cities of [[Sucre]], [[Tarija]] and [[Cochabamba]], are located in basins of this vast region.

==Lowlands==
[[File:Bolivia north.jpg|thumb|250px|The northernmost point of [[Bolivia]]]]

The eastern lowlands include all of Bolivia north and east of the Andes. Although comprising over two-thirds of the national territory, the region is sparsely populated and, until recently, has played a minor role in the [[Economy of Bolivia|economy]]. 

Differences in topography and climate separate the lowlands into three areas. The flat northern area, made up of [[Beni Department|Beni]] and [[Pando Department]]s and the northern part of [[Cochabamba Department]], consists of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|rainforest]]. Because much of the [[topsoil]] is underlain by [[claypan]], drainage is poor, and heavy rainfall periodically converts vast parts of the region to [[swamp]]. The central area, comprising the northern half of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], has gently rolling hills and a drier climate than the north. Forests alternate with [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|savanna]], and much of the land has been cleared for cultivation. Santa Cruz, the largest city in the lowlands, is located here, as are most of Bolivia's petroleum and natural gas reserves. The southeastern part of the lowlands is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. Virtually rainless for nine months of the year, this area becomes [[Flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded]] for the three months of heavy rains. The extreme variation in rainfall supports only thorny scrub vegetation and cattle grazing, although recent discoveries of natural gas and petroleum near the foothills of the Andes have attracted some settlers to the region. 

Most of Bolivia's important rivers are found in the water-rich northern parts of the lowlands, particularly in the Alto Beni (Upper Beni), where the land is suitable for crops such as [[coffee]] and [[Theobroma_cacao|cacao]]. The northern lowlands are drained by wide, slow-moving rivers, the three largest of which—the [[Mamoré River|Mamoré]], [[Beni River|Beni]], and [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]]—all flow northward into the [[Madeira River]] in [[Brazil]] and eventually into the [[Amazon River|River Amazon]]. Riverboats along the Beni and the Mamoré carry both passenger and freight traffic; rapids on the Madeira prevent river traffic farther into Brazil. Near the [[Paraguay]]an border, shallow sandy streams carry the seasonal runoff into the [[Pilcomayo River|Pilcomayo]] or [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]] rivers. Also, the [[Pantanal]], the world's largest wetland of any kind, has some of its area in Bolivia.

Despite the fact that eastern Bolivia is described a lowland in when seeing the general topography of the country there are mountains and mountain ranges well beyond the Andes. The most notable of these mountains are the forested [[Serranías Chiquitanas]] in eastern [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]].

== Climate ==
[[File:Bolivia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Bolivia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one ecoregion to the other, from the tropics in the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' to [[polar climate]]s in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, [[atmospheric pressure]] and evaporation, giving place to very different climates. When the climatological phenomenon known as'' [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf Fortalecimiento de las Capacidades locales para enfrentar El Fenómeno del Niño en Perú y Bolivia]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |title=Deja 56 muertos "El Niño" en Bolivia |access-date=2014-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708225400/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |archive-date=2009-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place, it provokes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows around the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more usual. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.

* ''Llanos''. A [[Humidity|humid]] [[tropical climate]] with an average temperature of 30° C (86° F). The wind coming from the [[Amazon rainforest]] causes significant rainfall. Starting in May, there is low precipitation because of dry winds, and most days have clear skies. Even so, winds from the south, called ''surazos'', can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days.
* ''[[Altiplano]]''. [[Desert climate|Desert]]-[[Polar climate|Polar]] climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from 15 to 20° C (59-68° F). At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above 0° C (32° F), while during the day, the weather is dry and [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] is high. [[Ground frost]]s occur every month, and [[snow]] is frequent.
* Valleys and ''Yungas''. [[Temperateness|Temperate]] climate. The humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains, making this region very humid and rainy. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Snow occurs at altitudes of 2000 meters.
* ''[[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]''. [[Subtropics|Subtropical]] [[Semi-arid climate|Semi-arid]] climate. Rain and humidity in January and the rest of the year, with warm days and cool nights.

[[Nepal]] measures about {{convert|800|km|mi|0|sp=us}} along its Himalayan axis by {{convert|150|to|250|km|mi|0|sp=us}} across. Nepal has an area of {{convert|147181|km2|mi2|0|sp=us}}.

Nepal is landlocked by India on three sides and [[China]]'s [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] to the north. [[West Bengal]]'s narrow ''[[Siliguri Corridor]]'' or Chicken's Neck separate Nepal and [[Bangladesh]]. To the east are [[India]] and [[Bhutan]]. Nepal depends on India for [[Freight transport|goods transport]] facilities and access to the sea, even for most goods imported from China.

== Landform Regions ==
For a small country, Nepal has tremendous geographic diversity. It rises from as low as  {{convert|59|m|ft|0}} elevation in the tropical Terai—the northern rim of the [[Gangetic Plain]], beyond the perpetual [[snow line]] to some 90 peaks over {{convert|7000|m|ft|0}} including Earth's highest {{convert|8848|m|ft|0}} [[Mount Everest]] or ''Sagarmatha''. In addition to the continuum from tropical warmth to cold comparable to polar regions, average annual precipitation varies from as little as {{convert|160|mm|in|1}} in the rainshadow north of the Himalaya to as much as {{convert|5500|mm|in|1}} on windward slopes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://150.217.73.85/wlfpdf/02_Dahal.pdf Dahal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along a south-to-north transect, Nepal can be divided into three belts: Terai, Pahad and Himal. In the other direction, it is divided into three major river systems, from east to west: ''[[Koshi River|Koshi]]'', ''[[Gandaki River|Gandaki/Narayani]]'' and ''[[Karnali River|Karnali]]'' (including the ''[[Mahakali River|Mahakali]]/Sarda'' along the western border), all tributaries of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]]. The Ganges-''[[Yarlung Zangbo River|Yarlung Zangbo]]/[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]'' watershed largely coincides with the Nepal-Tibet border, however several Ganges tributaries rise inside Tibet.

{{Anchor|Terai}}

{{Main|Terai|Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal}}
Terai is a low land region containing some hill ranges.The '''Terai''' (''also'' '''Tarai''') ''or'' '''[[Madhesh]]'''  region begins at the Indian border and includes the southernmost part of the flat, intensively farmed [[Gangetic Plain]] called the ''Outer Terai''.  By the 19th century, timber and other resources were being exported to India.  Industrialization based on agricultural products such as [[jute]] began in the 1930s and infrastructure such roadways, railways and electricity were extended across the border before it reached Nepal's pahad.

The Outer Terai is culturally more similar to adjacent parts of India's [[Bihari people|Bihar]] and [[Culture of Uttar Pradesh|Uttar Pradesh]] than to the Pahad  of Nepal. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is taught in schools and often spoken in government offices, however the local population mostly uses [[Maithil|Maithali]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] and [[Tharu languages|Tharu]] languages.

The Outer Terai ends at the base of the first range of foothills called the ''[[Sivalik Hills|Siwaliks]]'' or ''Churia''. This range has a densely forested skirt of coarse alluvium called the ''[[bhabar|bhabhar]]''. Below the bhabhar, finer, less permeable sediments force groundwater to the surface in a zone of springs and marshes. In Persian, ''terai'' refers to wet or marshy ground. Before the use of [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT]] this was dangerously [[malaria]]l. Nepal's rulers used this for a defensive frontier called the ''char kose jhadi'' (four ''kos'' forest, one kos equalling about three kilometers or two miles).

Above the bhabhar belt, the Siwaliks rise to about {{convert|700|m|ft|0}} with peaks as high as {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}}, steeper on their southern flanks because of faults known as the ''Main Frontal Thrust''. This range is composed of poorly consolidated, coarse sediments that do not retain water or support soil development so there is virtually no agricultural potential and sparse population.

In several places beyond the Siwaliks there are [[Doon Valley|''dūn'' valleys]] called [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|'''Inner Terai''']] .  These valleys have productive soil but were dangerously malarial except to [[Adivasi|indigenous]] ''[[Tharu people]]'' who had [[Thalassemia|genetic resistance]]. In the mid-1950s [[DDT]] came into use to [[DDT#Use against malaria|suppress mosquitos]] and the way was open to settlement from the land-poor hills, to the detriment of the Tharu.

The terai  ends and the Pahad begin at a higher range of foothills called the ''[[Mahabharat Lekh|Mahabharat Range]]''.

=== {{anchor|The Pahad|Pahad}} Pahad===
Pahad is a mountain region which doesn't generally contain snow.It is situated south of the Himal, the Pahad is mostly betw altitude. This region begins at the ''[[Mahabharat Range]]'' (Lesser Himalaya) where a fault system called the ''Main Boundary Thrust'' creates an escarpment {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|ft|-3}} high, to a crest between {{convert|1500|and|2700|m|ft|-3}}.

These steep southern slopes are nearly uninhabited, thus an effective buffer between languages and culture in the Terai and Pahad. [[Hindu]] [[Pahari people|''Paharis'']] mainly populate river and stream bottoms that enable [[Paddy field|rice cultivation]] and are warm enough for winter/spring crops of [[wheat]] and [[potato]].  The increasingly urbanized ''[[Kathmandu Valley|Kathmandu]]'' and ''[[Pokhara Valley|Pokhara]]'' valleys fall within the Hill region.  [[Newa people|''Newars'']] are an [[Adivasi|indigenous]] ethnic group with their own [[Tibeto-Burman]] [[Newar language|language]].  The Newar were originally indigenous to the Kathmandu valley but have spread into Pokhara and [[Newa people#Settlements|other towns]] alongside urbanized Pahari.

Other indigenous ''janajati'' ethnic groups -— natively speaking highly localized Tibeto-Burman languages and dialects -— populate hillsides up to about {{convert|2500|m|ft|-3}}.  This group includes ''[[Magar people|Magar]]'' and ''[[Kham Magar]]'' west of Pokhara, ''[[Gurung]]'' south of the ''Annapurnas'', ''[[Tamang]]'' around the periphery of [[Kathmandu Valley]] and ''[[Rai people|Rai]]'', ''[[Sunuwar|Koinch Sunuwar]]'' and ''[[Limbu people|Limbu]]'' further east. Temperate and subtropical fruits are grown as cash crops.  [[Cannabis (drug)|Marijuana]] was grown and processed into ''[[Charas]]'' ([[hashish]]) until international pressure persuaded the [[Kingdom of Nepal|government]] to outlaw it in 1976. There is increasing reliance on animal husbandry with elevation, using land above {{convert|2000|m|ft|-3}} for summer grazing and [[Transhumance|moving herds to lower elevations in winter]].  Grain production has not kept pace with population growth at elevations above {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2}} where colder temperatures inhibit double cropping.  Food deficits drive emigration out of the pahad in search of employment.

The Pahad ends where ridges begin substantially rising out of the [[temperate climate]] zone into [[subalpine zone]] above {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}}.

{{Anchor|Himalaya}}

=== {{anchor|Himal|Mount}}Himal===
[[Image:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Perspective (visual)|Perspective]] view of the Himalaya and Mount Everest as seen from space looking south-south-east from over the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. ([[:Image:himalaya annotated.jpg|annotated version]])]]
Himal is a mountain region containing snow.
The Mountain Region or ''Parbat'' begins where high ridges (Nepali: लेक; lekh) begin substantially rising above {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} into the [[Montane#Subalpine zone|subalpine]] and  [[Montane#Alpine grasslands and tundra|alpine zone]] which are mainly used for seasonal pasturage. A few tens kilometers further north the high Himalaya abruptly rise along the ''Main Central Thrust'' fault zone above the [[snow line]] at {{convert|5000|to|5500|m|ft|-2}}.  Some 90 of Nepal's peaks exceed {{convert|7000|m|ft|-2}} and eight exceed {{convert|8000|m|ft|0}} including [[Mount Everest]] at {{convert|8848|m|ft|0}} and [[Kanchenjunga]] at {{convert|8598|m|ft}}.

Unlike the ''Mahabharats'', the Himalaya are not continuous across Nepal. Instead there are some 20 subranges including the ''[[Kanchenjunga]]'' massif along the [[Sikkim]] border, ''[[Mahalangur Himal]]'' around Mt. Everest. ''[[Langtang]]'' north of Kathmandu, ''[[Annapurna]]'' and ''[[Manaslu]]'' north of Pokhara, then ''[[Dhaulagiri]]'' further west with ''[[Kanjiroba Himal|Kanjiroba]]'' north of ''[[Jumla district|Jumla]]'' and finally ''[[Gurans Himal]]'' in the far west.

=== Trans-Himalayan Region ===
The main watershed between the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] (called ''[[Yarlung Zangbo River|Yarlung Tsangpo]]'' in [[Tibet]]) and the [[Ganges]] system (including all of Nepal) actually lies north of the highest ranges.  Alpine, often semi-arid valleys—including ''[[Humla district|Humla]]'', ''[[Jumla district|Jumla]]'', ''[[Dolpo]]'', ''[[Mustang District|Mustang]]'', ''[[Manang]]'' and ''[[Khumbu]]''—cut between Himalayan subranges or lie north of them.

Some of these valleys historically were more accessible from [[Tibet]] than Nepal and are populated by people with [[Tibetan People|Tibetan]] affinities called ''[[Bhotiya]]'' or ''[[Bhutia]]'' including the famous [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] in Kumbu valley near Mount Everest. With [[Sinicization of Tibet|Chinese cultural hegemony]] in Tibet itself, these valleys have become repositories of traditional ways. Valleys with better access from the hill regions to the south are culturally linked to Nepal as well as Tibet, notably the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]] where [[Thakali people|Thakali]] culture shows influences in both directions.

Permanent villages in the mountain region stand as high as {{convert|4500|m|ft|-3}} with summer encampments even higher.  Bhotiyas graze [[yak]]s, grow cold-tolerant crops such as [[potato]]es, [[barley]], [[buckwheat]] and [[millet]].  They traditionally traded across the mountains, e.g., Tibetan salt for [[rice]] from lowlands in Nepal and India. Since trade was restricted in the 1950s they have found work as high altitude porters, guides, cooks and other accessories to tourism and alpinism.

The '''[[tropical climate|tropical]] zone''' below {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} experiences [[frost]] less than once per decade.  It can be subdivided into lower tropical (below 300 meters or 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft.) with 18% of the nation's land area) and upper (18% of land area) tropical zones.  The best [[mango]]es and well as [[papaya]] and [[banana]] are largely confined to the lower zone.  Other fruit such as [[litchee]], [[jackfruit]], [[citrus]] and mangoes of lower quality grow in the upper tropical zone as well.  Winter crops include grains and vegetables typically grown in temperate climates.  The Outer Terai is virtually all in the lower tropical zone.  Inner Terai valleys span both tropical zones.  The Sivalik Hills are mostly upper tropical.  Tropical climate zones extend far up river valleys across the Middle Hills and even into the Mountain regions.

The '''[[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate zone''' from {{convert|1000|to|2000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} occupies 22% of Nepal's land area and is the most prevalent climate of the Middle Hills above river valleys. It experiences frost up to 53 days per year, however this varies greatly with elevation, proximity to high mountains and terrain either draining or ponding cold air drainage.  Crops include rice, maize, millet, wheat, potato, stone fruits and citrus.

The great majority of Nepal's population occupies the tropical and subtropical climate zones.  In the Middle Hills, upper-caste Hindus are concentrated in tropical valleys which are well suited for rice cultivation while ''[[Adivasi|Janajati]]'' ethnic groups mostly live above in the subtropical zone and grow other grains more than rice.

The '''[[Temperate climate]] zone''' from {{convert|2000|to|3000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} occupies 12% of Nepal's land area and has up to 153 annual days of frost.  It is encountered in higher parts of the Middle Hills and throughout much of the Mountain region.  Crops include cold-tolerant rice, maize, wheat, barley, potato, apple, walnut, peach, various cole, amaranthus and buckwheat.

The '''[[Subalpine#Subalpine zone|Subalpine]] zone''' from {{convert|3000|to|4000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} occupies 9% of Nepal's land area, mainly in the Mountain and Himalayan regions.  It has permanent settlements in the Himalaya, but further south it is only seasonally occupied as pasture for sheep, goats, yak and hybrids in warmer months.  There are up to 229 annual days of frost here.  Crops include barley, potato, cabbage, cauliflower, amaranthus, buckwheat and apple.  Medicinal plants are gathered.

The '''[[Montane ecology#Alpine grasslands and tundra|Alpine]] zone''' from {{convert|4000|to|5000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} occupies 8% of the country's land area.  There are a few permanent settlements above 4,000 meters.  There is virtually no plant cultivation although medicinal herbs are gathered.  Sheep, goats, yaks and hybrids are pastured in warmer months.

Above 5,000 meters the climate becomes '''[[Snow line|Nival]]''' and there is no human habitation or even seasonal use.

Arid and semi-arid land in the rainshadow of high ranges have a '''[[Cold desert#Cold desert climates|Transhimalayan climate]]'''.  Population density is very low.  Cultivation and husbandry conform to subalpine and alpine patterns but depend on snowmelt and streams for irrigation.

Precipitation generally decreases from east to west with increasing distance from the [[Bay of Bengal]], source of the summer monsoon. Eastern Nepal gets about {{convert|2500|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} annually; the Kathmandu area about {{convert|1400|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} and western Nepal about {{convert|1000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}}. This pattern is modified by adiabatic effects as rising air masses cool and drop their moisture content on windward slopes, then warm up as they descend so relative humidity drops. Annual precipitation reaches {{convert|5500|mm|ft|0|abbr=on}} on windward slopes in the ''[[Annapurna]]'' Himalaya beyond a relatively low stretch of the ''[[Mahabharat Range]]''. In rainshadows beyond the high mountains, annual precipitation drops as low as {{convert|160|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.

===Seasons===
The year is divided into a wet season from June to September—as summer warmth over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean—and a dry season from October to June as cold temperatures in the vast interior creates a high pressure zone causing dry air to flow outward.  April and May are months of intense water stress when cumulative effects of the long dry season are exacerbated by temperatures rising over {{convert|40|°C|°F}} in the tropical climate belt. Seasonal drought further intensifies in the ''[[Siwaliks]]'' hills consisting of poorly consolidated, coarse, permeable sediments that do not retain water, so hillsides are often covered with drought-tolerant scrub forest. In fact much of Nepal's native vegetation adapted to withstand drought, but less so at higher elevations where cooler temperatures mean less water stress.

The summer monsoon may be preceded by a buildup of thunderstorm activity that provides water for rice seedbeds.  Sustained rain on average arrives in mid-June as rising temperatures over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean, but this can vary up to a month. Significant failure of monsoon rains historically meant drought and famine while above-normal rains still cause flooding and landslides with losses in human lives, farmland and buildings.

The monsoon also complicates transportation with roads and trails washing out while unpaved roads and airstrips may become unusable and cloud cover reduces safety margins for aviation. Rains diminish in September and generally end by mid-October, ushering in generally cool, clear, and dry weather, as well as the most relaxed and jovial period in Nepal. By this time, the harvest is completed and people are in a festive mood. The two biggest and most important Hindu festivals—''[[Dashain]]'' and ''[[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]]'' (''[[Diwali|Dipawali]]'')—arrive during this period, about one month apart. The post monsoon season lasts until about December.

After the post monsoon comes the winter monsoon, a strong north easterly flow marked by occasional, short rainfalls in the lowlands and plains and snowfalls in the high-altitude areas. In this season the Himalayas function as a barrier to cold air masses from Inner Asia, so southern Nepal and northern India have warmer winters than would otherwise be the case. April and May are dry and hot, especially below {{convert|1200|m|ft|-3|sp=us}} where afternoon temperatures may exceed {{convert|40|°C|°F}}.

==Environment==
The dramatic changes in elevation along this transect result in a variety of [[biome]]s, from [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savannas]] along the Indian border, to [[subtropical]] [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|broadleaf]] and [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|coniferous forests]] in the hills, to [[temperate]] [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|broadleaf]] and [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests on the slopes of the Himalaya, to [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], and finally rock and ice at the highest elevations.

This corresponds to the [[Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands]] ecoregion.

Subtropical forests dominate the lower elevations of the Hill Region. They form a mosaic running east-west across Nepal, with [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]] between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}} and [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]] between {{convert|1000|and|2000|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}. At higher elevations, to {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3|sp=us}}, are found temperate broadleaf forests: [[eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests]] to the east of the [[Gandaki River]] and [[western Himalayan broadleaf forests]] to the west.

The native forests of the Mountain Region change from east to west as precipitation decreases. They can be broadly classified by their relation to the Gandaki River. From {{convert|3000|to|4000|m|ft|-3|sp=us}} are the [[eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|eastern]] and [[western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]]. To {{convert|5500|m|ft|-3|sp=us}} are the [[eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows|eastern]] and [[western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]].

== River systems ==
{{see also|List of rivers of Nepal}}
Nepal has three categories of rivers.  The largest systems -— from east to west ''[[Koshi River|Koshi]]'', ''[[Gandaki River|Gandaki/Narayani]]'', ''[[Karnali River|Karnali/Goghra]]'' and ''[[Sarda River|Mahakali]]''—originate in multiple tributaries rising in or beyond the high Himalaya that maintain substantial flows from snowmelt through the hot, droughty spring before the summer monsoon.  These tributaries cross the highest mountains in deep gorges, flow south through the Middle Hills, then join in [[candelabra]]-like configuration before crossing the [[Mahabharat Lekh|Mahabharat Range]] and emerging onto the plains where they have deposited ''[[alluvial fan|megafans]]'' exceeding {{convert|10000|km2|mi2|-3|abbr=on}} area.

The Koshi is also called ''[[Sapta Koshi]]'' for its seven Himalayan tributaries in eastern Nepal: ''[[Indravati River, Nepal|Indrawati]]'', ''[[Sun Kosi|Sun Koshi]]'', ''Tama Koshi'', ''[[Dudh Kosi|Dudh Koshi]]'', ''Liku'', ''[[Arun River (Nepal)|Arun]]'', and ''[[Tamor River|Tamor]]''.  The Arun rises in Tibet some {{convert|150|km|mi|-2|sp=us}} beyond Nepal's northern border.  A tributary of the Sun Koshi, [[Bhote Koshi]] also rises in Tibet and is followed by the [[Arniko Rajmarg|Arniko Highway]] connecting [[Kathmandu]] and [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]].

The ''[[Gandaki River|Gandaki/Narayani]]'' has seven Himalayan tributaries in the center of the country: ''Daraudi'', ''[[Seti Gandaki River|Seti Gandaki]]'', ''Madi'', ''Kali'', ''[[Marsyandi]]'', ''Budhi'', and ''[[Trisuli River|Trisuli]]'' also called ''Sapta Gandaki''. The ''Kali Gandaki'' rises on the edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and flows through the semi-independent [[Mustang (kingdom)|Kingdom of Mustang]], then between the 8,000 meter ''[[Dhaulagiri]]'' and ''[[Annapurna]]'' ranges in the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge|world's deepest valley]].  The [[Trishuli River|Trisuli]] rises north of the international border inside Tibet.  After the seven upper tributaries join, the river becomes the ''Narayani'' inside Nepal and is joined by the ''(East) Rapti'' from [[Chitwan Valley]].  Crossing into [[India]], its name changes to ''Gandak''.

The ''[[Ghaghara River|Karnali]]'' drains western Nepal, with the ''[[Bheri River|Bheri]]'' and ''[[Seti River|Seti]]'' as major tributaries. The upper Bheri drains [[Dolpo]], a remote valley beyond the [[Dhaulagiri]] Himalaya with traditional Tibetan cultural affinities.  The upper Karnali rises inside Tibet near sacred ''[[Lake Manasarovar]]'' and ''[[Mount Kailash]]''.  The area around these features is the hydrographic nexus of [[South Asia]] since it holds the sources of the [[Indus River|Indus]] and its major tributary the ''[[Sutlej]]'', the Karnali—a [[Ganges Basin|Ganges tributary]]—and the ''[[Yarlung Zangbo River|Yarlung Tsangpo]]''/''[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]''.  It is the center of the universe according to [[Mount Meru (mythology)|traditional cosmography]].  The ''[[Sarda River|Mahakali]]'' or ''Kali'' along the Nepal-India border on the west joins the Karnali in India, where the river is known as ''Goghra'' or ''Ghaghara''.

'''Second category''' rivers rise in the Middle Hills and ''[[Mahabharat Range]]'', from east to west the ''[[Mechi River|Mechi]]'', ''[[Kankai River|Kankai]]'' and ''[[Kamala River|Kamala]]'' south of the Kosi; the ''[[Bagmati]]'' that drains [[Kathmandu Valley]] between the Kosi and Gandaki systems, then the ''[[West Rapti River|West Rapti]]'' and the ''Babai'' between the Gandaki and Karnali systems.  Without glacial sources, annual flow regimes in these rivers are more variable although limited flow persists through the dry season.

'''Third category''' rivers rise in the outermost ''[[Siwalik]]'' foothills and are mostly seasonal.

None of these river systems support significant commercial navigation.  Instead, deep gorges create obstacles to establishing transport and communication networks and de-fragmenting the economy. Foot-trails are still primary transportation routes in many hill districts.

[[Image:NepalOMC.png|thumb|500px|Nepal's towns, villages, rivers and peaks.]]

===River management===
Rivers in all three categories are capable of causing serious floods. Koshi River in the first category caused a major flood in [[2008 Bihar flood|August 2008]] in ''[[Bihar]]'' state, India after breaking through a poorly maintained embankment just inside Nepal. The West Rapti in the second category is called ''[[Gorakhpur]]'s Sorrow'' for its history of urban flooding. Third category Terai rivers are associated with flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;

Large [[reservoir]]s in the Middle Hills may be able to capture peak flows and mitigate downstream flooding, to store surplus monsoon flows for dry season irrigation and to generate [[hydroelectricity|electricity]]. Water for irrigation is especially compelling because the Indian Terai is suspected to have entered a ''food bubble'' where dry season crops are dependent on water from [[Tube well|tubewells]] that in the aggregate are unsustainably "mining" groundwater.

As Nepal builds barrages to divert more water for irrigation during the dry season preceding the summer monsoon, there is less for downstream users in [[Bangladesh]] and India's Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states. The best solution could be building large upstream reservoirs, to capture and store surplus flows during summer monsoon as well as providing flood control benefits to Bangladesh and India. Then water sharing agreements could allocate a portion of the stored water to be left to flow into India during the following dry season.

Nevertheless, building dams in Nepal is controversial for several reasons. First, the region is seismically active. Dam failures caused by earthquakes could cause tremendous death and destruction downstream, particularly on the densely populated Gangetic Plain.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Thapa |first=A.B. |date=January 2010

 |journal=Hydro Nepal |place=Kathmandu
 |publisher= |issue=6 |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, global warming has led to the formation of glacial lakes dammed by unstable [[moraine]]s. Sudden failures of these moraines can cause [[Glacial lake outburst flood|floods]] with cascading failures of manmade structures downstream.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=ICIMOD |year=2011 |title=Glacial Lakes and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods in Nepal

Third, sedimentation rates in the Himalaya are extremely high, leading to rapid loss of storage capacity as sediments accumulate behind dams.&lt;ref&gt;

Most of this [[forest cover]] is broadleaved closed and open forest, which covers 21,200 km2 or 14.4% of the geographical area.

Needleleaved open forest is the least common of the forest areas covering 8267&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (5.62%). Agriculture area is significant extending over 43,910&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (29.83%). As would be expected, the high mountain area is largely covered by snow and glaciers and barren land.

[[File:Agriculture land of Nepal.jpg|alt=Terrance agriculture land of Nepal|thumb|300px|Terraced farmland in Nepal.]]
The Hill region constitutes the largest portion of [[Nepal]], covering 29.5% of the geographical area, and has a large area (19,783&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of cultivated or managed lands, natural and semi natural vegetation (22,621&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and artificial surfaces (200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The Tarai region has more cultivated or managed land (14,104&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and comparatively less natural and semi natural vegetation (4280&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The Tarai has only 267&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of natural water bodies. The High mountain region has 12,062&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of natural water bodies, snow/glaciers and 13,105&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; barren areas.

=== Forests ===
25.4% of Nepal's land area, or about {{convert|36360|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} is covered with forest according to [[FAO]] figures from 2005. FAO estimates that around 9.6% of Nepal's forest cover consists of ''primary forest'' which is relatively intact. About 12.1% Nepal's forest is classified as ''protected'' while about 21.4% is ''conserved'' according to FAO. About 5.1% Nepal's forests are classified as ''production forest''. Between 2000 and 2005, Nepal lost about {{convert|2640|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of forest. Nepal's 2000–2005 total deforestation rate was about 1.4% per year meaning it lost an average of {{convert|530|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of forest annually. Nepal's total deforestation rate from 1990 to 2000 was {{convert|920|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} or 2.1% per year. The 2000–2005 true deforestation rate in Nepal, defined as the loss of primary forest, is -0.4% or {{convert|70|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} per year. Forest is not changing in the plan land of Nepal,  forest fragmenting on the Roof of the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The changing land cover and fragmenting forest on the Roof of the World: A case study in Nepal's Kailash Sacred Landscape|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204615000791|journal = Landscape and Urban Planning|date = September 2015|pages = 1–10|volume = 141|doi = 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.04.003|first = Kabir|last = Uddin|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Chaudhary|first3 = Nakul|last3 = Chettri|first4 = Rajan|last4 = Kotru|first5 = Manchiraju|last5 = Murthy|first6 = Ram Prasad|last6 = Chaudhary|first7 = Wu|last7 = Ning|first8 = Sahas Man|last8 = Shrestha|first9 = Shree Krishna|last9 = Gautam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development|ICIMOD]] figures from 2010, forest is the dominant form of land cover in Nepal covering 57,538&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a contribution of 39.09% to the total geographical area of the country.&lt;ref name="Uddin 82–90"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Development of 2010 national land cover database for the Nepal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479714004009|journal = Journal of Environmental Management|date = January 15, 2015|pages = 82–90|volume = 148|series = Land Cover/Land Use Change (LC/LUC) and Environmental Impacts in South Asia|doi = 10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.07.047|first = Kabir|last = Uddin|first2 = Him Lal|last2 = Shrestha|first3 = M.

Needleleaved open forest is the least common of the forest areas covering 8,267 km2 (5.62%). At national level 64.8% area is covered by core forests of &gt; 500 ha size and 23.8% forests belong to patch and edge category forests. The patch forest constituted 748&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at national level, out of which 494&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of patch forests are present in hill regions. Middle mountains, Siwaliks and Terai regions have more than 70% of the forest area under core forest category &gt; 500 ha size. The edge forests constituted around 30% of forest area of High Mountain and Hill regions.&lt;ref name="Uddin 82–90"/&gt;
Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) which was conducted between 2010 and 2014 by the Ministry of Forest and Soil conservation with the financial and technical help of Government of Finland shows that 40.36% land of Nepal is forested. And 4.40% land have Shrubs and bushes.
Deforestation is driven by multiple processes.&lt;ref&gt;

Virtually throughout the nation, over-harvest of [[firewood]] remains problematic.  Despite the availability of [[liquefied petroleum gas]] in towns and cities, firewood is sold more at energy-competitive prices because cutting and selling it is a fallback when better employment opportunities aren't forthcoming.  Firewood still supplies 80% of Nepal's energy for heating and cooking.  Harvesting construction timber and lopping branches for fodder for cattle and other farm animals are also deforestation/degradation drivers in all geographic zones.

[[Illegal logging]] is a problems in the Siwaliks, with sawlogs smuggled into India.&lt;ref&gt;

In the Middle Hills road construction, reservoirs, transmission lines and extractive manufacturing such as cement factories cause deforestation.  In the mountains building hotels, monasteries and trekking trails cause deforestation while timber-smuggling into the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and over-grazing cause degradation.

The '''geology of [[Suriname]]''' is predominantly formed by the Guyana Shield, which spans 90% of its land area. Coastal plains account for the remaining ten percent. Most rocks in Suriname date to the [[Precambrian]]. These crystalline basement rocks consists of [[granitoid]] and acid volcanic rocks with enclaves of predominantly low-grade metamorphic, geosynclinal rocks in the Marowijne area and of probably considerably older rocks in the Falawatra group of the Bakhuisgebirge and the Coronie area. There are also small, scattered bodies of [[gabbro]] and ultramafitite. These are about the same age as the granite and volcanics. It has been found that the construction of the basement was largely created during the final phase of the Trans-Amazonian Orogeny Cycle, about 1.9 billion years ago. This cycle has had a significant influence on the geology of Suriname, characterized by sedimentation, metamorphosis, corrugation and magmatism. &lt;ref&gt;Bruijning, C.F.A. en J. Voorhoeve (red.): ''Encyclopedie van Suriname''. Amsterdam en Brussel 1977, blz. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young sediments cover the northern 20% of the country. They exist from south to north and from old to young from the Coesewine, Coropina and Demarara formations. The older Onverdacht formation is only accessible at Moengo. In the coastal area, the three first mentioned formations are accessible in the savannah belt, the old coastal plain and the marshy young coastal plain. They show a slight, northward slope. The late [[Pleistocene]] [[Coropina Formation]] and the [[Holocene]] [[Demerara Formation]] consist of clay mud banks set up in a lagoon region with zigzagging complexes (beach walls) formed of sand and shells. The [[Coesewijne Formation]] in the savannah belt consists of coarse, unsorted sands with kaolinite clays. These are probably deposited by braided streams and possibly partly in alluvial delta's. The Coesewijne formation is of [[Pliocene]] age. The [[Onverdacht Formation]] consists of unsorted sands and kaolinite clays and is covered with bauxite on the surface at Moengo, with subordinate bauxites at Onverdacht. This formation forms old hills protected by the bauxite cover against erosion around which the younger formations have been deposited. &lt;ref&gt;Bruijning, C.F.A. en J. Voorhoeve (red.): ''Encyclopedie van Suriname''. Amsterdam en Brussel 1977, blz. 219 e.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early geological surveys==
The first known geological survey in Suriname dates back to 1720. Friederich Voltz carried out systematic geological research for the first time in 1853. This research was conducted along the lower reaches of the major rivers. In 1888, the first overview map of Suriname with geological data was published by Karl Martin. Until 1900 the interest was focused on gold. Until the 20th century, interest in the geology of the country usually had a more or less local and incidental character. In 1931 R. IJzerman collected all geological research from the period 1853 - 1930 in his dissertation, it gives a fairly complete picture of the geology of Suriname and is provided with a geological overview. &lt;ref&gt;Bruijning, C.F.A. en J. Voorhoeve (red.): ''Encyclopedie van Suriname''. Amsterdam en Brussel 1977, blz. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Geological distribution==
===Coastal Plain===

The fertile coastal plain consists of marine clay deposits, weathering products from the Andean mountain range that reached the coast of Suriname via the [[Amazon River]] and the Guiana Current. &lt;ref&gt;Mol, Arthur, e.a. (red.) (2004): ''Suriname schoon genoeg? Hulpbronnen gebruik en milieubescherming in een klein Amazoneland'', blz. 1, Uitgeverij Jan van Arkel&lt;/ref&gt; The coastline is mobile because land is washed away repeatedly under the influence of storms and currents. &lt;ref&gt;Helman, Albert (1982): ''Avonturen aan de wilde kust. De geschiedenis van Suriname met zijn buurlanden'',  blz. 13, Uitgeverij Vaco&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge of the geology of the Surinamese coastal plain has increased in the 20th cenutry. In 1931 IJzerman gave a general description of the sediments that occur in the foreland. He distinguished two layers of groups: the fluvio-marine deposits, in which clays and sands occur and the older continental alluvium, for a large part consisting of coarse white, sometimes [[humus]]-bearing sands. The fluvio-marine deposits lie in a belt immediately along the coast and the continental alluvium comes to the surface in a belt behind it, wedging against the rocks of the Guiana Shield. The geologist Jan Zonneveld, who worked at the Centraal Bureau Luchtkartering in [[Paramaribo]], around 1950, after studying the use of water level profiles, field research and the interpretation of aerial photographs, was of the opinion that on the surface not two, but three elements should be distinguished, namely from north to south. :

*A young coastal plain just above sea level
*An "old coastal plain", lying on a slightly higher level
*A slightly undulating plain, bordered to the south by the hill country and usually called the "Savannah belt" or "Zanderijbelt". &lt;ref&gt;Helman, Albert (1982): ''Avonturen aan de wilde kust. De geschiedenis van Suriname met zijn buurlanden'',  blz. 13, Uitgeverij Vaco&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities still distinguish a fourth element, namely "the domestic remaining highlands". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics-suriname.org/index.php/statistieken/downloads/category/34-milieu-publicatie-2012, Zesde milieustatistieken publicatie 2014, blz. 143]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountainous region of Suriname forms a 'central core' from which foothills radiate in different directions. In the northern part of the country, the Brownsberg, the Hok A Hingeberg, the Nassau mountain range and the Lely mountain range are striking elements. Outside the actual mountain ranges, the lowlands, there are various isolated mountains. Some of these are: the Tebu, the Roosevelt peak and the Voltzberg. Some of these mountains have flat shapes, for example Table Mountain in the Tafelberg Nature Reserve. Table Mountain consists of a plate of Roraima [[sandston]]e. The [[Roraima Formation]] only occurs on Table Mountain and in the Emmaketen. The Brownsberg, the Bakhuis, Hok A Hin-, Nassau and Lely Mountains are characterized by plateaus that consist of [[laterite]] and local bauxite crusts. &lt;ref&gt;Bruijning, C.F.A. en J. Voorhoeve (red.): ''Encyclopedie van Suriname'', Amsterdam en Brussel 1977, blz. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inland Lowlands===
The low terrains between the mountains show a "multi-convex" relief over large expanses, which consists of countless low bulging hills. The hills have a striking similarity in top height. The different top levels are arranged in a stepwise manner and can be followed along the river in an upstream direction. They are believed to be remnants of earlier flattening. This stepwise succession of plains must have been achieved because the interior has undergone a tectonic upheaval from time to time, which forced the rivers to cut downward, after which surface formation could occur again. A large part of the erosion material was deposited in the falling coastal area. The fragmentation of the stepped relief into a "multiconvex" hill landscape must have taken place during the last part of the Pleistocene. &lt;ref&gt;Bruijning, C.F.A. en J. Voorhoeve (red.): ''Encyclopedie van Suriname'', Amsterdam en Brussel 1977, blz. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Savanna in the interior===

In Suriname, savanna areas occur both in the northern lowlands and in the more hilly areas of the interior. The savannas of Suriname probably owe their origin to the savanna climate that dominated 10,000 years ago. The current ecosystem of the savanna changes through human activities such as sand excavations. &lt;ref&gt;Vakblad Bos en Natuur, no.5, 2013, ''De waarde van savanne ecosystemen'', Serano Ramcharan, blz. 12 en 13 https://web.archive.org/web/20170217061914/http://www.tropenbos.org/publications/quarterly%20specialist%20journal%20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three areas that are characterized by the presence of savannas:

*The almost east-west zone where the Coesewijne series connects part of the old coastal plain in the area of Moengo and Albina in the east. This belt extending across the whole of Suriname is also called the savanna belt
*A zone located to the south of the "savanna belt" between Kwakoegron and the Brokopondostuwmeer
*A large area in the upstream part of the Sipaliwini. These savannas continue in Brazil.

On sandstone, granite and laterite caps, there are smaller, more or less individually occurring savannahs here and there. 

The savannas cover about one percent of the Surinamese landscape. Approximately one fifth of the known plant species of Suriname occur in these areas. Savannas can be classified on the basis of the vegetation. There are bush and grass savannas and savanna forest, the latter is distinguished by the higher and denser vegetation. 
==Natural resource geology==
The Suriname Planatlas of 1988 mentions the following mineral resources:
*Primary gold, usually in quartz veins. The expectation is that reasonable possibilities exist for the discovery of primary gold in the rocks of the Marowijne group.
*Alluvial gold, residual for example in laterite caps as well as in gravel layers in creek and riverbeds
*Colluvial gold, residual for example in laterite caps
*Bauxite
*Oil
*Tin, [[tantalite]], [[amblygonite]] (a lithium mineral) and beryl
*Laterite iron ore, of which large reserves occur in Suriname, which for the time being cannot be profitably exploited due to processing problems and high transport costs.
*Chromium and manganese accumulations, extraction is not viable due to clay reserves and / or processing problems and high transport costs
*Copper, it is expected that larger occurrences in the rocks of the Marowijne group can be found
*Kyanite occurrences are being investigated
*Large reserves of kaolin among the bauxite layers
*White sand and feldspar, applicable in the glass industry
*Stone chips can be used for road paving and in the concrete industry
*Gravel and shredded sand finds application in house and road construction
*Granite has potential as an export product. &lt;ref&gt;Bron: https://web.archive.org/web/20150203171605/http://www.feweb.vu.nl/gis/publications/docs/Lassche_Molendijk_2013_GeologieSuriname.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


==Geological Mining Service==

In Suriname, research into the soil and geology is mainly conducted by the Geological Mining Service. Geological research is often not easy because a large part of the country is difficult to reach and is covered with dense forests. This service is also responsible for stimulating mining in general. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.sr/sr/ministerie-van-nh/over-nh.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Surinamese institutions in collaboration with Brazil worked on a mapping project at the southern border of the country in the Sipaliwini district. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/19489&lt;/ref&gt; The project will lead to the implementation of new topographic, hydrographic, geological, geophysical and structural maps. The new maps will be composed with the most modern tools that Brazil has. The project is being carried out by the Suriname Environmental and Mining Foundation together with the Geological Mining Service (GMD), the Anton de Kom University of Suriname and the Geological Service of Brazil. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.semif.net/milieuduurzaamheid&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Himalayas''', or '''Himalaya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|ə|,_|h|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə|j|ə}}), form a [[mountain range]] in [[Asia]], separating the plains of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

The Himalayan range has many of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, [[Mount Everest]].  The Himalayas include over [[List of highest mountains|fifty mountains]] exceeding {{Convert|7200|m|ft}} in elevation, including ten of the fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8,000-metre]] peaks.  By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia ([[Aconcagua]], in the [[Andes]]) is {{Convert|6961|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lifted by the [[subduction]] of the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]] under the [[Eurasian Plate]], the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc {{Convert|2400|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Wadia, D. N. (1931).  The syntaxis of the northwest Himalaya: its rocks, tectonics and orogeny. Record Geol. Survey of India 65(2): 189–220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its western anchor, [[Nanga Parbat]], lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river.  Its eastern anchor, [[Namcha Barwa]], is just west of the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]] (upper stream of the [[Brahmaputra River]]).  The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the [[Karakoram]] and the [[Hindu Kush]] ranges, to the north, the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a {{Convert|50-60|km|mi}} wide tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture.&lt;ref&gt;Valdiya, K.

The Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7 million people&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"&gt;Apollo, M. (2017).

Publisher: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and are spread across [[Himalayan states|five countries]]: [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]] and [[Pakistan]].  Some of the world's major [[river]]s — the [[Indus River|Indus]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]]-[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] — rise in the Himalayas, and their combined [[drainage basin]] is home to roughly 600 million people.  The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the region, helping to keep the monsoon rains on the Indian plain and limiting rainfall on the Tibetan plateau.  The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of the [[Indian subcontinent]]; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
The name of the range derives from the [[Sanskrit]] ''Himā-laya'' ({{lang|sa|{{linktext|हिमालय}}}}, "Abode of Snow"), from ''himá'' ({{lang|sa|{{linktext|हिम}}}}, "snow") and ''ā-laya'' ({{lang|sa|{{linktext|आलय}}}}, "receptacle, dwelling").&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0378930#m_en_gb0378930|title=Definition of Himalayas|website=Oxford Dictionaries Online|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now known as the "{{nowrap|Himalaya Mountains}}", usually shortened to the "Himalayas". Formerly, they were described in the singular as the "''Himalaya''". This was also previously transcribed "'''Himmaleh'''", as in [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dickinson |first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Dickinson |title=''"The Himmaleh was known to stoop"'' |title-link=:s:The Himmaleh was known to stoop }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thoreau |first=Henry David |authorlink=Henry David Thoreau |title=A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers |date=1849 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountains are known as the ''Himālaya'' in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (both written {{lang|hi|{{linktext|हिमालय}}}}), the ''Himalaya'' ({{lang|bo|ཧི་མ་ལ་ཡ་}}) or 'The Land of Snow' ({{lang|bo|གངས་ཅན་ལྗོངས་}}) in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], the ''Hamaleh'' Mountain Range ({{lang|ur|سلسلہ کوہ ہمالیہ}}) in [[Urdu]] and the ''Ximalaya'' Mountain Range {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|喜馬拉雅{{linktext|山脈}}}},}} {{nowrap|&gt; ''Xǐmǎlāyǎ Shānmài'')}} in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

==Geography and key features==
{{see also|List of Himalayan peaks and passes}}
In the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the 8000m peaks of [[Dhaulagiri]] and [[Annapurna]] in [[Nepal]], separated by the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]]. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically – the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki, the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2. To the east of Annapurna are the 8000&amp;nbsp;m peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China – the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing through the range to the east of Makalu.

In the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly 8000&amp;nbsp;m summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.

Going west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Garwhal Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at [[Gangotri]] and the Yamuna at [[Yamunotri]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]]. 
{{wide image|Langtang range (64).JPG|560px|Panoramic view of Langtang Range in [[Nepal]]|65%|right}}

The next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian State of [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]]. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over 7000&amp;nbsp;m in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas cross the [[Line of Control]] into [[Pakistan]] and reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&amp;nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over 7000&amp;nbsp;m above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&amp;nbsp;m summits.

==Geology==
[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|The 6,000-kilometre-plus journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;]]
{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}
The Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.

During the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]&lt;/ref&gt;) was moving at about 15&amp;nbsp;cm per year. About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest - Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg. ThoughtCo Updated 17 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap3-Plate-Margins/Convergent/Continental-Collision|title=Plate Tectonics -The Himalayas |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Geological Society |access-date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian plate is still moving at 67&amp;nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500&amp;nbsp;km into Asia. About 20&amp;nbsp; mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&amp;nbsp; mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.

During the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.&lt;ref name=Kuhle2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of {{convert|1000|-|2000|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Kuhle2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhle1987/&gt; While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most {{convert|20|to|32|km|mi}} in length, several of the main valley glaciers were {{convert|60|to|112|km}} long during the ice age.&lt;ref name=Kuhle2011/&gt; The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and [[Ablation#Glaciology|ablation]] of a glacier are balanced) was about {{convert|1400|-|1660|m|ft|}} lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least {{convert|7.0|to|8.3|C-change|F-change}} colder than it is today.&lt;ref name=Kuhle2005/&gt;

==Hydrology==
[[File:13-10-08 217 CONFLUENCE OF INDUS RIVER N.jpg|thumb|Confluence of [[Indus River]] and [[Zanskar River]] in the Himalayas]]
[[File:yumthangnorth.jpg|thumb|The Himalayan range at Yumesongdong in [[Sikkim]], in the [[Yumthang]] River valley]]

Despite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major watershed, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:
* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].
* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].&lt;ref name=gits4u/&gt;

The northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the ''circum-Himalayan rivers''.&lt;ref name=circum/&gt;

[[File:0I7A6623-Pano (26003549095).jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Glacier]]

===Glaciers===

The great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after [[Antarctica]] and the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name=pbs_nature/&gt; The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (3,000 cubic miles) of fresh water.&lt;ref name=IPPC2007/&gt; Its glaciers include the [[Gangotri Glacier|Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and [[Khumbu Glacier|Khumbu]] glaciers ([[Mount Everest]] region), [[Langtang]] glacier ([[Langtang]] region) and [[Zemu Glacier|Zemu]] ([[Sikkim]]).

Owing to the mountains' latitude near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the permanent [[snow line]] is among the highest in the world at typically around {{convert|5500|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shi |first1=Yafeng |last2=Xie |first2=Zizhu |last3=Zheng |first3=Benxing |last4=Li |first4=Qichun |url=http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CwdX03t7?url=https://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2012 |title=Distribution, Feature and Variations of Glaciers in China |journal=World Glacier Inventory |year=1978 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, equatorial mountains in [[New Guinea]], the [[Rwenzoris]] and [[Colombia]] have a snow line some {{convert|900|m|ft|-1}} lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson-Sellers|first1=Ann|last2=McGuffie|first2=Kendal|title=The Future of the World's Climate: A Modelling Perspective|pages=199–201|isbn=9780123869173|date=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large [[perennial stream|perennial rivers]].

In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] across the region as a result of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-nepal-climate-glaciers-dc/vanishing-himalayan-glaciers-threaten-a-billion-idUSDEL18761020070604|title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion|date=4 June 2007|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html|title=Glaciers melting at alarming speed|date=24 July 2007|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lakes===
[[File:Tilicho Lake.jpg|thumb|Tilicho lake in [[Manang]], Nepal]]
The Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most of the larger lakes are on the northern side of the main range. The most famous is the sacred freshwater [[Lake Manasarovar]], near to [[Mount Kailas]] with an area of 410&amp;nbsp;km² and an altitude of 4590m. It drains into the nearby [[Lake Rakshastal]]  with an area of 250&amp;nbsp;km² and slightly lower at 4575m.  [[Pangong Tso]], which is spread across the border between India and China, at far western end of Tibet, and [[Yamdrok Tso]], located in south central Tibet, are among the largest with surface areas of 700&amp;nbsp;km², and 638&amp;nbsp;km², respectively. [[Lake Puma Yumco]] is one of the highest of the larger lakes at an elevation of 5030m.

South of the main range, the lakes are smaller. [[Tilicho Lake]] in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world. Other notable lakes include [[Rara Lake]] in western Nepal, [[Phoksundo Lake|She-Phoksundo Lake]] in the [[Shey Phoksundo National Park]] of Nepal, [[Gurudongmar Lake]], in [[North Sikkim]], [[Gokyo Lakes]] in [[Solukhumbu]] district of [[Nepal]] and [[Lake Tsongmo]], near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.

Some of the lakes present a danger of a [[glacial lake outburst flood]]. The [[Tsho Rolpa]] glacier lake in the [[Rolwaling Himal|Rowaling Valley]], in the [[Dolakha District]] of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of {{convert|4580|m|ft|}} has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rolwaling.tripod.com/glof/ Photograph of Tsho Rolpa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Glacial lake outburst flood#Monitoring|Tsho Rolpa]]&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain lakes are known to geographers as ''[[tarn (lake)|tarns]]'' if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html|title=Highest Lake in the World|first=Carl|last=Drews|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

The vast size, huge altitude range and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills to cold, dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range.

For much of Himalayas – that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism – the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.

Using the [[Köppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as '''Cwa''', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate ('''Cwb''')]].

In the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|in|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.

The northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.

Local impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every 1000m rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from nearly tropical in the foothills to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around 300mm, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall (3,900mm/year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.

The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin–Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
{{main|Ecology of the Himalayas}}
[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|Captive snow leopard]]The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor [[extremophile]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=C. Michael|last=Hogan|year=2010|url=https://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/Extremophiles|title=Extremophile|editor1-first=E.|editor1-last=Monosson |website=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hemitragus jemlahicus Jharal.jpg|thumb|Male Himalayan Tahr in Nepal]]
[[file:RedPandaFullBody.JPG|thumb|Red Panda]] At high altitudes, the elusive and previously endangered [[snow leopard]] is the main predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep. The [[Himalayan musk deer]] is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the [[Himalayan tahr]], the [[takin]], the [[Himalayan serow]], and the [[Himalayan goral]]. The critically endangered [[Himalayan brown bear|Himalayan]] subspecies of the [[brown bear]] is found sporadically across the range as is the [[Asian black bear]]. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, [[Red panda]] feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered [[Gee's golden langur]] and the [[Kashmir gray langur]], with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas respectively.

The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. ''[[Hydrangea hirta]]'' is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], apple and ''[[Myrica esculenta|box myrtle]]''. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is ''[[Juniperus tibetica]]'' located at {{convert|4900|m|ft|-1}} in Southeastern Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|title=Highest Treeline in the Northern Hemisphere Found in Southern Tibet|first1=Georg|last1=Miehe|first2=Sabine|last2=Miehe|first3=Jonas|last3=Vogel|first4=Sonam|last4=Co|first5=La|last5=Duo|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2007|pages=169–173|doi=10.1659/mrd.0792|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103046/http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups, who throughout history have systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those migrating cultures – Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), Islamic (Afghanistan–Iran) and Animist (Burmese and south-eastern Asian) – without any doubt have created here their own individual and unique place.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl" /&gt; Their current arrangement, though with a few exceptions, is linked to specific geographical regions, and the relative altitude at which they occur.

There are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. In [[Jainism]], Mount Ashtapad in Himalayas is a sacred place where the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]] attained [[moksha]]. It is believed that after [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]] attained [[nirvana]], his son emperor [[Bharata Chakravartin]] had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 [[Tirthankaras]] with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it ''Sinhnishdha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=y4aVRLGhf-8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA273&amp;dq=mount+Kailash+jainism#v=onepage&amp;q=mount%20Kailash%20jainism&amp;f=false | title=Faith &amp; Philosophy of Jainism| isbn=9788178357232| last1=Jain| first1=Arun Kumar| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/spiritual-destinations/29739255_1_manasarovar-water-moon |title=To heaven and back – Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2012-01-11 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=y4aVRLGhf-8C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=ashtapad+jainism#v=onepage&amp;q=ashtapad%20jainism&amp;f=false | title=Faith &amp; Philosophy of Jainism| isbn=9788178357232| last1=Jain| first1=Arun Kumar| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. The Mountain Kailash is a sacred peak to the Hindus and is where the Lord Shiva is believed to live.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams.&lt;ref name=JEE/&gt;
[[File:Jains at Kailash.jpg|thumb|[[Jain]] seekers paying obeisance to Tirthankar [[Rishabhdev]] near Mount Kailash.]]
The Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the mountains of the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimberly-cantor/paro-bhutan-the-tigers-ne_b_10982104.html|title=Paro, Bhutan: The Tiger's Nest|last=Cantor|first=Kimberly|date=2016-07-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or ''mahasiddhas''. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zurick|first1=David|last2=Julsun|first2=Pacheco|last3=Basanta|first3=Raj Shrestha|last4=Birendra|first4=Bajracharya|title=Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya|location=Lexington|publisher=U of Kentucky|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Himalayan people’s diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The shapes and materials of the people’s homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewellery. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewellery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Religions of the region==
[[File:Taktshang.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Paro Taktsang|Taktsang]] Monastery, [[Bhutan]], also known as the "Tiger's Nest"]]

Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. A notable example of a religious site is [[Paro Taktsang]], where [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.&lt;ref name="Pommaret"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pommaret, Francoise|title=Bhutan Himalayan Mountains Kingdom|edition=5th|publisher=Odyssey Books and Guides|year=2006|pages=136–7|isbn=978-9622178106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padmasambhava is also worshipped as the [[patron saint]] of [[Sikkim]]. There are also [[Muslim]] and Hindhu Shaivite [[Kashmiri Pandit]] in the area of [[Kashmir]].

In Hinduism, the Himalayas have been personified as the king of all Mountain – "Giriraj [[Himavat]]", father of [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] and [[Parvati]] (form of [[Adi Shakti]] [[Durga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|isbn=978-0-500-51088-9|first=Anna|last=Dallapiccola|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhist]] sites are situated in the Himalayas, in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and in the Indian regions of [[Ladakh]], Sikkim, [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] and [[Darjeeling]]. There were over 6,000 [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries]] in Tibet, including the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan, Sikkim and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries. The [[Tibetan Muslims]] have their own mosques in [[Lhasa]] and [[Shigatse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.people.cn/200510/27/eng20051027_217176.html | title = Mosques in Lhasa, Tibet|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=27 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
The Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites.&lt;ref name = JEE&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ecological status and traditional knowledge of medicinal plants in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary of Garhwal Himalaya, India

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Different parts of the plants – root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark – are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an ''abies pindrow'' tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an ''arachne cordifolia'' is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a ''callicarpa arborea'' is used for skin ailments.&lt;ref name=JEE /&gt; Nearly a fifth of the [[gymnosperm]]s, [[Flowering plants|angiosperms]] and [[pteridophyte]]s in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.&lt;ref name=JEE/&gt;

Most of the population in some Asian and African countries depend on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Pankaj|last2=Sharma|first2=Vijay Kumar|title=Healing Traditions of the Northwestern Himalayas|year=2014|publisher=Springer Briefs in Environmental Science|isbn=978-8132219255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Himalayan Forests Disappearing|journal=Earth Island Journal|volume=21|issue=4|year=2006|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the number of medicinal plants is declining and that some of them might become rarer or, in some cases, go extinct.

Although locals are clearing out portions of the forests in the Himalayas, there is still a large amount of greenery ranging from the tropical forests to the Alpine forests. These forests provide wood for fuel and other raw materials for use by industries. There are also many pastures for animals to graze upon.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The many varieties of animals that live in these mountains do so based on the elevation. For example, elephants and rhinoceros live in the lower elevations of the Himalayas, also called the Terai region. Also, found in these mountains are the Kashmiri stag, black bears, musk deer, langur, and snow leopards. The Tibetan yak are also found on these mountains and are often used by the people for transportation. However, the populations of many of these animals and still others are declining and are on the verge of going extinct.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Himalayas are also a source of many minerals and precious stones. Amongst the tertiary rocks, are vast potentials of mineral oil. There is coal located in Kashmir, and precious stones located in the Himalayas. There is also gold, silver, copper, zinc, and many other such minerals and metals located in at least 100 different places in these mountains.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''Josef Jüttner''' (12 September 1775, [[Bernartice (Jeseník District)|Bernartice]]&lt;ref name="matrika"&gt;[http://vademecum.archives.cz/vademecum/permalink?xid=be89b34c-f13c-102f-8255-0050568c0263&amp;scan=167 Matriční záznam o&amp;nbsp;narození a&amp;nbsp;křtu]&lt;/ref&gt; – 27 April 1848, [[Prague]]) was a [[Cartography|cartographer]] and Austrian army general, author of the first exact map of [[Prague]] based on [[Geodesy|geodetic]] measurement.

== Life ==
[[File:Juttneruv plan Prahy.jpg|thumb|left|Jüttner's map of Prague]]

Jüttner studied at the ''gymnasium'' (secondary school) in [[Bílá Voda]] near [[Javorník (Jeseník District)|Javorník]]. In 1793 he entered the Austrian army, and between 1794–95 fought against France. He spent the years 1799–1800 as an [[artillery]] soldier in [[Ingolstadt]], where he had&lt;!-- gave or attended? --&gt; lectures on mathematics and physics at the Jesuit University .

Starting in 1801 Jüttner taught in Prague.

The [[etching]] for the map was done by Prague's graphic master {{ILL|Josef Alois Drda|cs}}; the [[lettering]] by Alois Mussil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=5|title=Jüttner’s map of Prague of 1816: Research, cartometric analysis and visualization |date= 10 September 2008|publisher=ICA Commission on the History of Cartography, International Cartographic Association (ICA-ACI)|author1=Jiří Krejčí |author2= Eva Chodějovská |language= English| url=http://history.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Krejci.pdf |work=Symposium on “Shifting Boundaries: Cartography in the 19th and 20th centuries”, Portsmouth University, Portsmouth, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818  [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky]] issued a number of good quality copies of the map under the title ''Grundriß der königlichen Hauptstadt Prag'' at a scale of 500 Viennese lots (60 lots = 1 finger).

[[File:Mt Robson South Face.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Robson]] in [[British Columbia]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|peak]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[topographic prominence|most prominent]] summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''31 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]]'''.  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diplomatic missions of Nauru.png|thumb|right|450px|Diplomatic missions of Nauru]]
This is a '''list of diplomatic missions of Nauru''', not including its honorary consulates in [[Agana]], [[Auckland]], [[London]], [[Honolulu]], [[Pago Pago]] and [[New Delhi]]. [[Nauru]] is the smallest republic in the world.  It was previously quite wealthy, thanks to [[royalties]] collected from [[phosphate]] mining.  This allowed the country of 12,000 to expand its public service workforce to 1,600.

Economic mismanagement has forced the Nauruan government to cut back on its overseas presence.  With mounting debts it was forced to relinquish [[Nauru House]] in [[Melbourne]], a 52 story building owned by the Nauru government which housed its [[consulate-general]]. In a bid to stay solvent a covertly funded Nauran embassy was planned to be opened in [[Beijing]] as a transit point for defecting North Korean scientists ([[Operation Weasel]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

}}
As the capital of the United States, [[Washington, D.C.]] has 51 roadways which are named after each state and the territory of [[Puerto Rico]]. Many of these roadways are major avenues that serve as the city's principal traffic arteries. Every state lends its name to an avenue except for California Street and Ohio Drive.

While streets in Washington are generally laid out in a grid pattern, the state-named avenues often form diagonal connections between the city's many traffic circles and squares as envisioned in the [[L'Enfant Plan]] for the city. However, avenues named for Arizona, Hawaii, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Puerto Rico connect to no other state-named roadways. Avenues named for Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin continue into neighboring Maryland, often as state highways, but none of the state-named avenues continue into Virginia. Most avenues exist in one or two quadrants, except for Massachusetts and Virginia Avenues, which travel through three of the four quadrants (it is geometrically impossible for a straight street to exist in all four quadrants), though they exist in multiple sections.

'''Natural capital''' is the world's stock of [[natural resource]]s, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called [[ecosystem services]]. Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is natural capital?|url=http://naturalcapitalforum.com/about/|website=naturalcapitalforum.com|publisher=World Forum on Natural Capital|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Natural Capital|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org/why-natural-capital/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org|publisher=Natural Capital Coalition|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an extension of the economic notion of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Natural_capital|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=www.eoearth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, called 'natural capital asset checks', help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact on human well-being and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK NEAFO Work Package 1: Natural capital asset check – Annex 4: Case studies|url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dNp%2bvIjmXi4%3d&amp;tabid=82|website=uknea.unep-wcmc.org|publisher=UK National Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=31 December 2015|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
Natural capital is one approach to [[ecosystem valuation]] which revolves around the idea, in contrast to traditional economics, that non-human life produces essential resources. Thus, ecological health is essential to the sustainability of the economy. In ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hawken|first=Paul |author2=Amory Lovins |author3=Hunter Lovins |title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author claims that the global economy is within a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services that sustain us. In order to continue to reap the benefits of our natural environment, we need to recognize the importance of natural capital within the economy. According to the authors, the "next industrial revolution" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: "the conservation of resources through more effective [[manufacturing]] processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining [[natural resources]]."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/print.cgi?sfArticleId=164 Book Review: Natural Capitalism] from [http://www.socialRoth2014funds.com/ Socialfunds.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as "land" distinct from traditional "capital". The historical distinction between "land" and "capital" defined “land” as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas “capital”, as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., [[Georgism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp2.htm] - ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' by [[Henry George]], Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/def2.htm|title=Economic Definitions|website=www.henrygeorge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It is however, misleading to view "land" as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see [[Tragedy of the Commons]]). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

The term 'natural capital' was first used in 1973 by [[E.F. Schumacher]] in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schumacher|first=E.F |title=Small is Beautiful:  A Study of Economics As If People Mattered|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely identified with [[Herman Daly]], [[Robert Costanza]], the [[Biosphere 2]] project, and the [[Natural Capitalism]] economic model of [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]], and [[Hunter Lovins]]. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its [[Natural Capital Committee]] and the London Health Observatory. All users of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme's [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is “natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production” and is “generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.”

Within the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. [[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full-cost accounting]], triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an "ecological deficit" or "natural deficit" alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Natural capital declaration==
In June 2012 a 'natural capital declaration' (NCD) was launched at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] to 'integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.' They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Declaration|url=http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/the-declaration/|website=www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, its four key aims are to:
*Increase understanding of business dependency on natural capital assets;
*Support development of tools to integrate natural capital considerations into the decision-making process of all financial products and services;
*Help build a global consensus on integrating natural capital into private sector accounting and decision-making;
*Encourage a consensus on [[integrated reporting]] to include natural capital as one of the key components of an organisation's success.

==Natural Capital Protocol==
In July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/wp-admin/|title=Log In ‹ Natural Capital Coalition — WordPress|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; released the Natural Capital Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.

The Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/development/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol Development|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.

==Internationally agreed standard==
Environmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies, including, but not limited to, [[green economy]]/[[green growth]], [[natural resource management]] and [[sustainable development]]. The '''System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)''' contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries' specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and on-going work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.

==Criticism==
Whilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conniff|first1=Richard|title=What’s Wrong with Putting a Price on Nature?|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/ecosystem_services_whats_wrong_with_putting_a_price_on_nature/2583/|website=e360.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=5 January 2016|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the UK, [[The Guardian|Guardian]] columnist, [[George Monbiot]], has been critical of the work of the government's [[Natural Capital Committee]] and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free [[ecosystem services]] they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of £700m, he derided attempts 'to compare things which cannot be directly compared'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Put a price on nature? We must stop this neoliberal road to ruin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/jul/24/price-nature-neoliberal-capital-road-ruin|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say:
{{Quote|text=These figures, ladies and gentlemen, are marmalade. They are finely shredded, boiled to a pulp, heavily sweetened ... and still indigestible. In other words they are total gibberish.|author=G. Monbiot}}
Others have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that 'valuation' of those assets is not the same as [[monetisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paddison|first1=Laura|title=Is natural capital a 'neoliberal road to ruin'?- experts discuss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-neoliberal-road-ruin-george-monbiot-experts-debate|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital (Does putting a value on natural capital mean it will be 'sold off'?)|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org|publisher=Natural Capital Committee|accessdate=5 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113030316/http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|archivedate=13 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic setting==

===Basin formation===

The offshore Indus basin is a rift and passive margin basin which developed following the separation of the [[Indian Plate]] from Africa in the late [[Jurassic]].&lt;ref name=Gombos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gombos|first1=A.M.|last2=Powell|first2=W.G.|last3=Norton|first3=I.O|title=The tectonic evolution of western India and its impact on hydrocarbon occurrences: an overview|journal=Sedimentary Geology|date=1995|volume=96|pages=119–129|doi=10.1016/0037-0738(94)00129-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=R.A|last2=Minshull|first2=T.A.|last3=White|first3=R.S.|title=Extension across the Indian-Arabian plate boundary: the Murray Ridge|journal=Geophysical Journal International|date=2000|volume=142|pages=461–477|doi=10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00163.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaedicke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaedicke|first1=C.|last2=Schlüter|first2=U.H.|last3=Roeser|first3=H.A.|title=Origin of the northern Indus Fan and Murray Ridge, Northern Arabian Sea: interpretation from seismic and magnetic imaging|journal=Tectonophysics|date=2002|volume=355|pages=127–143|doi=10.1016/s0040-1951(02)00137-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Late Cretaceous]], the separation of Madagascar from India occurred and was followed by rapid northward movement of the Indian plate. In the early [[Paleocene]], the Indian plate passed over the [[Reunion hotspot]]. This event also led to the extrusion of large volcanic rocks, known as the [[Deccan Traps]].&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt; During the [[Eocene]], the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, uplifting the [[Himalayas]]. Presence of the Middle Eocene sandstones in the distal Indus fan, which contain feldspar grains with an origin in or north of the Indus suture zone, is an evidence to the occurrence of this event.&lt;ref name="Clift 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clift|first1=P.D.|last2=Shimizu|first2=N.|last3=Layne|first3=G.|last4=Gaedicke|first4=C.|last5=Schlüter|first5=H.U.|last6=Clark|first6=M.|last7=Amjad|first7=S.|title=Development of the Indus Fan and its significance for the erosional history of the western Himalaya and Karakoram|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|date=2001|volume=113|pages=1039–1051|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113&lt;1039:dotifa&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian plate continues to collide with the Eurasian plate as shown by earthquakes in and around the Himalayas.&lt;ref name=Jackson,McKenzie&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=J.|last2=McKenzie|first2=D.|last3=Priestley|first3=K.|last4=Emmerson|first4=B.|title=New views on the structure and rheology of the lithosphere|journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London|volume=165|pages=453–465|doi=10.1144/0016-76492007-109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seismic data in the offshore Indus basin show evidence of an early rift geometry below the Deccan volcanics. Imaging is hampered by the presence of volcanics, which partly infill the rifts and by the thick overlying Indus Fan section of [[Oligocene]] to Recent age. The precise age of the rifts is unknown but is interpreted as most likely a mid-[[Cretaceous]] to Paleocene age and associated with the break up of the Madagascar/Seychelles/Indo-Pakistan plate.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

During the early post-rift phase, attached carbonate platforms of Paleocene and early Eocene age formed along the continental margin and detached platforms on volcanic seamounts within the basin. Between the carbonate banks, coeval pelagic sediment was deposited in the intervening structural lows.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt; As the Indian plate drifted northwards away from the Reunion mantle hotspot, the basin subsided rapidly. This was accompanied by major clastic influx from the Indus river and leading to deposition of up to 9&amp;nbsp;km of Oligocene to Recent sediments.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

===Crustal structure and tectonic elements===

Seismic and gravity data suggest that the underlying crust in the offshore Indus basin is of three types: continental, transitional and oceanic. Continental crust is interpreted for the area below the shelf and upper slope based on the presence of deep rift geometries on seismic lines. Transitional crust occurs on the slope in water depths of 1500–3000 m and is characterized by a prominent gravity low and a northeast-southwest-trending chain of seamounts of Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age. Crust in this region is interpreted to represent thinned continental crust which has been subsequently thickened by the intrusion of thick volcanic rocks by the process of igneous underplating. Further basinwards, the transitional crust is replaced by the oceanic crust characterized by a prominent gravity high and a well-imaged Moho reflection on seismic lines.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

The northwest of the Murray ridge is a major plate boundary transform fault which formed in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene in response to plate reorganization following the opening of the [[Gulf of Aden]].&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt; Onlap of the Miocene and younger stratigraphy on the southeast side of the ridge confirms the age of the ridge and resultant hanging wall uplift. Motion along the Murray ridge bounding fault has resulted in the development of northwest-southeast-trending faults, folds and shale diapirs in the hanging wall. The Makran accretionary wedge, north of the Murray ridge, developed in response to the subduction of the [[Gulf of Oman]] oceanic crust beneath Eurasia from about 14 Ma onwards.&lt;ref name=Harms&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harms|first1=J.C.|last2=Cappel|first2=H.N.|last3=Francis|first3=D.C.|title=Geology and petroleum potential of the Makran Coast, Pakistan|journal=Offshore South East Asia 82 Conference, Singapore|date=1982|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern boundary of the offshore Indus basin is marked by the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] Arch. It is a volcanic high which extends eastwards into onshore India, coinciding with large outcrop of Deccan volcanics. In the offshore, the arch is cut by steep vertical faults interpreted as extensional faults associated with strike-slip movement along an east-west-trending transform fault marking the northern edge of the Arabian Sea oceanic crust.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt; Two other features have been identified southeast of the Saurashtra Arch, the Laxmi Ridge and the Laxmi Basin. The Laxmi Ridge is interpreted as continental fragment and the Laxmi Basin is considered to be an area of extended continental crust respectively.&lt;ref name=Naini&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naini|first1=B.R.|last2=Talwani|first2=M.|title=Structural framework and the evolutionary history of the continental margin of western India|journal=Studies in Continental Margin Geology.

===Stratigraphy and sedimentation===

====Basin stratigraphy====
[[File:Stratigraphy of the Offshore Indus.jpg|thumb|Stratigraphy of the Offshore Indus]]
Wells drilled on the continental shelf of the offshore Indus basin have been drilled down to Cretaceous rocks. The oldest formation penetrated is the Sembar Formation of Early Cretaceous. It is composed of [[Shale|shales]]. Onshore Sembar Formation is the major source rock, responsible for charging the sands of the Goru Formation. Sembar is overlain by Goru Formation. Goru is subdivided into Lower and Upper Goru. Lower Goru is sandy onshore and a proven reservoir. Offshore, however, it shales out. Upper Goru is a massive shale and was deposited during Late Cretaceous. It is overlain by Parh Limestone, Mughalkot (limestone interbedded with shale) and Pab Sandstone Formations, deposited during Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=Shuaib /&gt;
Deccan volcanics of the Paleocene overlie the Cretaceous Pab Sandstone. These are overlain by Ranikot Formation (majorly sandstone), also Paleocene in age. [[Eocene]] carbonates, [[Ghazijahan|Ghazij]]/[[Kirthar Mountains|Kirthar]] lie on top of the Paleocene Ranikot Formation. Nari ([[Oligocene]] in age), Gaj (Miocene) and recent sediments, were brought down by the Indus river after the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] uplift and deposited over the Eocene carbonates.&lt;ref name=Shuaib /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

====The Indus fan and its channel-levee systems====
[[File:Indus Fan.jpg|thumb|The Indus Fan]]
One of the most significant depositional feature of the offshore Indus basin is the Indus fan. It is the second largest fan system in the world after the Bengal fan between India, [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman Islands]].&lt;ref name=Deptuck&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deptuck|first1=M.E.|last2=Steffens|first2=G.S.|last3=Barton|first3=M.|last4=Pirmez|first4=C.|title=Architecture and evolution of upper fan channel-belts on the NIger Delta slope and in the Arabian Sea|journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]]|date=2003|volume=20|pages=649–676|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2003.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus fan was deposited in an unconfined setting on the continental slope, rise and basin floor, covering much of the [[Arabian Sea]]. The entire fan extends over an area of 110,000 square kilometers with greater than 9&amp;nbsp;km of sediment accumulating near the toe-of-slope.&lt;ref name="Clift 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolla&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolla|first1=V.|last2=Coumes|first2=F.|title=Morphology, internal structure, seismic stratigraphy, and sedimentation of Indus Fan|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin|date=1987|volume=71|pages=650–677|doi=10.1306/94887889-1704-11d7-8645000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan sedimentation is estimated to have begun at the end of the Oligocene or beginning of the [[Miocene]], during a period of faster Himalayan exhumation, possibly linked to [[Monsoon]] intensification.&lt;ref name="Clift 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolla /&gt;&lt;ref name=McHargue&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHargue|first1=T.R.|title=Seismic facies, processes, and evolution of Miocene inner fan channels, Indus submarine fan. in Weimer, P. and Link, M. H. (eds.), Seismic facies and sedimentary processes of submarine fans and turbidite systems|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, NY|pages=403–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cartoon sketch of a deep sea fan channel-levee system (CLS).jpg|thumb|Cartoon sketch of a deep sea fan channel-levee system (CLS)]]
The upper Indus Fan, both ancient and recent, consists some of the largest [[Channel levee systems|channel-levee systems]] (CLS).&lt;ref name=Deptuck /&gt; These channel-levee systems act as conduits for carrying and depositing sediments into the deeper part of the basin. The coarser grained sediments are deposited in the channel belts whereas the finer grained silts and clays are deposited along the levees. This arrangement of sediments is ideal for [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] plays and that's why these channel-levee systems are of utmost importance to the petroleum industry.&lt;ref name=Deptuck /&gt;

===Hydrocarbon potential===
The offshore Indus basin is significantly under-explored. To-date only 12 wells have been drilled in the offshore Indus basin, out of which only 3 were drilled in the deep sea.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt; All of these have been unsuccessful attempts. Some of these wells encountered high pressures in the Miocene section. Gas shows and non-commercial gas quantities were also reported in the Miocene strata of most wells.&lt;ref name=PPIS&gt;{{cite web|title=PPISONLINE|url=http://www.ppisonline.com/PEPC2013/Downloads/InvestmentBrochure2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as the [[petroleum]] system is concerned, presence and effectiveness of the reservoir and trap are of low risk. The channel and sheet sandstones of Miocene and [[Plio-Pleistocene]] are good potential reservoirs. Oligocene clastic rocks can also act as [[Reservoir rock|reservoir rocks]] in distal fan facies. Four types of traps have been identified in offshore Indus: an extensional rollover anticline trend in the upper slope, drape structures over the Eocene carbonate banks and seamounts, stratigraphic traps formed by sands pinching out against the Murray Ridge and folds associated with the Murray Ridge shear faults and shale diapirs.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

Presence of seal may be an issue in some areas due to erosional channels. The source rock is questionable, as Sembar Formation, which is a proven source onshore, is too deep offshore and most likely overmature to charge the reservoirs. Paleocene-Eocene carbonates can be the potential source rocks in the offshore Indus basin. However, this needs to be proved in terms of both quality and quantity.&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;

'''[[Olfactory]] navigation''' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of [[pigeons]], in particular the [[homing pigeon]].

There are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.

==Background==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar.  There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a [[compass]] sense (a sense of direction) and a [[map]] sense (a sense of location).  It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information.  It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. [[Homing (biology)#Magnetic orientation|Magnetic orientation]] as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences de St. Pétersbourg |series=Series VI |volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier |first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal=Rev. phil. France Etranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=W.|author2=Wiltschko, R.|year=1996|title=Magnetic orientation in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=29–38 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/1/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = G | year = 1959 | title = Recent experiments on bird orientation | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02396.x | journal = Ibis | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 399–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that [[anosmic]] pigeons (''Columbia livia'') were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;  On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.

==Olfactory map==
Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F.|year=1990|title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=26|pages=301–305|doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallraff’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans G. Wallraff|title=Das Navigationssystem der Vögel: ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7w1AAAAMAAJ|date=January 1974|publisher=R. Oldenbourg |location=München, Wien|isbn=978-3-486-39631-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘gradient’ model.  Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental [[odours]], within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.&lt;ref name=good01&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=J.|year=2001|title=Perspectives on Animal Behaviour|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site.  An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities.  It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights.  This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours.  Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues,&lt;ref name=hudson03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=M.|year=2003|title=What evidence is there to support pigeons (''Columbia livia'') use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home?|publisher=Sussex University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Papi (1990),&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.

Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means.  It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients.  The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity.  Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft.  This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration.  However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.  Meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;Becker &amp; van Raden (1986). cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R | year = 1996 | title = The Function of Olfactory Input in Pigeon Orientation: Does it Provide Navigational Information or Play Another Role? | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 113–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.

==Empirical evidence==
The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the [[Dovecote|home loft]] with the directions from which they are carried by winds.  Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants.  The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.

Such an experiment was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;Papi F, Ioalé P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187–193&lt;/ref&gt; where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical [[Aviary|aviaries]] composed of bamboo.  Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine.  This was reversed for group two.  The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil.  Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south.  Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.

However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures.&lt;ref name=able96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Able|first=K.P.|year=1996|title=The debate over olfactory navigation by homing pigeons |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, further experiments&lt;ref&gt;Baldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages.

J Comp Physiol 128:297–301&lt;/ref&gt; applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°.  Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours.  Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’.  The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.

In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced,&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=J.|year=1979 |title=Pigeon homing: deprivation of olfactory information does not affect the deflector effect |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–22 |doi=10.1007/BF00293240}}&lt;/ref&gt; though when [[anosmic]] pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed.  Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect.  Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Researchers support these suggestions&lt;ref&gt;Bang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational&lt;/ref&gt; by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons.  It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.

Conflicting evidence, however, was produced&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of [[benzaldehyde]].  When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented.  Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.

A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected.&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.

==Other sensory cues==
The Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface&lt;ref name=walcott96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walcott|first=C.|year=1996|title=Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton]] (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W. T. | year = 1971 | title = Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 102–106 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | pmid=5276278 | pmc=391171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ioalé (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalé |first=P. |year=1984 |title=Magnets and pigeon orientation |journal=Monitore Zoologico Italiano |volume=18 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.1080/00269786.1984.10736466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt; did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast.  This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = R. P. | year = 1974 | title = Orientation of homing pigeons altered by a change in the direction of the applied magnetic field | url = | journal = Science | volume = 184 | issue = | pages = 180–182 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4133.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Visalberghi | first1 = E. | last2 = Alleva | first2 = E. | year = 1979 | title = Magnetic influences on pigeon homing | url = | journal = Biologica Bulletino | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 246–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated [[magnetic coil|coils]].  Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current.  Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  In [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.&lt;ref name=walcott96/&gt;

The predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass.  This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock.&lt;ref name=hudson03/&gt;  Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory [[European Starling|European starling]], indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt-Koenig |first=K. |year=1958 |title=Experimentelle Einflußnahme auf die 24-Stunden-Periodik bei Brieftauben und deren Auswirkung unterbesonderer Berücksichtigung des Heimfindevermögens |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=15 |pages=301–331 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1958.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive evidence==
The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’  Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons |year=2006 |first1=A. |last1=Gagliardo |first2=P. |last2=Ioale |first3=M.

[[File:Veale Gardens.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Veale Gardens]] in Adelaide, Australia]]
[[File:Slovakia Bratislava 947.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Sad Janka Kráľa]] park in [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia)]]
A '''park''' is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and [[recreation]] or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of [[grass]]y areas, [[rocks]], [[soil types|soil]] and [[tree]]s, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as [[monument]]s, [[fountain]]s or [[playground]] structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as [[association football]], [[baseball]] and [[football]], and paved areas for games such as [[basketball]]. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less and is ideally within a [[10-Minute Walk]] of its residents. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain [[picnic table]]s and [[barbecue]] grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called "[[dog park]]s", permit dogs to run off-leash.

The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of seventy meters (thousands of square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill. Amusement parks are the largest types of park in the world. In many large parks, [[camping]] in [[tent]]s is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g., rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a [[park ranger]] or a [[park warden]]. Large parks may have areas for [[canoeing]] and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, [[cross-country skiing]] and [[snowshoeing]] in colder months.

==History==
[[File:Medieval Hunting Park.JPG|thumb|upright|upright=0.7|Depiction of a medieval hunting park from a 15th-century manuscript]]
The first parks were [[Deer park (England)|English deer parks]],{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} land set aside for hunting by royalty and the [[aristocracy]] in [[medieval]] times. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.

These game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around [[mansion]]s and [[country house]]s from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these [[stately home]] parks where the [[natural landscape]] was enhanced by [[landscape architect]]s such as [[Capability Brown]]. As cities became crowded, the private hunting grounds became places for the public.

With the [[Industrial revolution]] parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as [[national park]]s to prevent their being spoiled by uncontrolled development.

==Design==
Park design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a [[playground]]. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.

The design of a park may determine who is willing to use it. Walkers may feel unsafe on a [[mixed-use path]] that is dominated by fast-moving cyclists or horses. Different landscaping and infrastructure may even affect children's rates of use of parks according to sex. Redesigns of two parks in Vienna suggested that the creation of multiple semi-enclosed play areas in a park could encourage equal use by boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;Foran, Clare (September 16, 2013)  [http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/09/how-design-city-women/6739/ "How to Design a City for Women"]  ''The Atlantic Cities.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks are part of the urban infrastructure: for physical activity, for families and communities to gather and socialize, or for a simple respite. Research reveals that people who exercise outdoors in green-space derive greater mental health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Kaplan, S. 1989. ''The Experience of Nature: A Psychological Perspective. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing activities for all ages, abilities and income levels is important for the physical and mental well-being of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, D. Dannenberg, A. Frumkin, H.

Issue Brief: Creating Safe Park Environments to Enhance Community Wellness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks can also benefit pollinators, and some parks (such as Saltdean Oval) have been redesigned to accommodate them better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2014/09/for-bee-friendly-parks-head-for-the-great-unmown/380831/|title=For Bee-Friendly Parks, Head For the Great Unmown|website=citylab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations, such as [[Xerces Society]] are also promoting this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/pollinator_friendly_parks_21ed_xerces_society.pdf|title=Pollinator-friendly parks|website=xerces.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in city revitalization===
City parks play a role in improving cities and improving the futures for residents and visitors - for example, Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/awards/2008/08winners/441.html|title=ASLA 2008 Professional Awards|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Mill River Park and Green way in Stamford, CT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2015awards/95842.html|title=2015 ASLA PROFESSIONAL AWARDS|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One group that is a strong proponent of parks for cities is The American Society of Landscape Architects . They argue that parks are important to the fabric of the community on an individual scale and broader scales such as entire neighborhoods, city districts or city park systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/sustainablelandscapes/Vid_Parks.html|title=Designing Our Future: Sustainable Landscapes|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for safety===
[[File:Example of night photography at The Garden of Five Senses, New Delhi.JPG|thumb|A well-lit path in Dehli's [[Garden of Five Senses]]]]
Parks need to feel safe for people to use them. Research shows that perception of safety can be more significant in influencing human behavior than actual crime statistics.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} If citizens perceive a park as unsafe, they might not make use of it at all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A study done in four cities; Albuquerque, NM, Chapel Hill/Durham, NC, Columbus, OH, and Philadelphia, PA, with 3815 survey participants who lived within a half mile of a park indicated that in addition to safety that park facilities also played a significant role in park utilization and that increasing facilities instead of creating an image of a safe park would increase utilization of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapham|first=Sandra C.|last2=Cohen|first2=Deborah A.|last3=Han|first3=Bing|last4=Williamson|first4=Stephanie|last5=Evenson|first5=Kelly R.|last6=McKenzie|first6=Thomas L.|last7=Hillier|first7=Amy|last8=Ward|first8=Phillip|date=2016-09-01|title=How important is perception of safety to park use? A four-city survey|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/content/53/12/2624|journal=Urban Studies|language=en|volume=53|issue=12|pages=2624–2636|doi=10.1177/0042098015592822|issn=0042-0980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of features that contribute to whether or not a park feels safe. Elements in the physical design of a park, such as an open and welcoming entry, good visibility (sight lines), and appropriate lighting and signage can all make a difference. Regular park maintenance, as well as programming and community involvement can also contribute to a feeling of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/torontosafety2/|title=Key Factors in Planning, Designing and Maintaining Safer Parks - Project for Public Spaces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Crime prevention through environmental design|Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design]] (CPTED) has been widely used in facility design, use of CPTED in parks has not been.  Iqbal and Ceccato performed a study in [[Stockholm|Stockholm, Sweden]] to determine if it would be useful to apply to parks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iqbal|first=Asifa|last2=Ceccato|first2=Vania|date=2016-06-01|title=Is CPTED Useful to Guide the Inventory of Safety in Parks? A Study Case in Stockholm, Sweden|url=http://icj.sagepub.com/content/26/2/150|journal=International Criminal Justice Review|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=150–168|doi=10.1177/1057567716639353|issn=1057-5677}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their study indicated that while CPTED could be useful, due to the nature of a park, increasing the look of safety can also have [[unintended consequences]] on the aesthetics of the park.  Creating secure areas with bars and locks and lower the beauty of the park, as well as the nature of who is in charge of observing the public space and the feeling of being observed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women as a measure of safety===
{{Globalize/US|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--consider using https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819178/ to help globalize--&gt;

In the United States, the standard for safety in parks is increasingly measured by whether women feel safe in that particular location.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Paumgarten, Nick |title=Girl-Counter Counting visitors in Bryant Park |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally identified by the urban sociologist [[William H.

And if women don't see other women, they tend to leave."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Whether or not a woman feels safe can determine how much physical activity she has and if it will reach the recommended level for good health and disease prevention.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Harrison RA, Gemmell I, Heller RF |title=The population effect of crime and neighborhood on physical activity: an analysis of 15,461 adults |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |date=2007 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=34–39 |pmid=17183012 |pmc=2465585 |doi=10.1136/jech.2006.048389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Park designers and planners can take several steps to increase safety from assault, including providing sufficient lighting, having patrols by police officers or other safety officials, and providing emergency buttons for summoning assistance.

==Active and passive recreation areas==
[[File:Portlandskate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Burnside Skatepark in [[Portland, Oregon]] is one of the world's most recognizable skateparks.]]
Parks can be divided into active and passive [[recreation]] areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including [[playground]]s, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and [[skateparks]]. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called "low intensity recreation" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.

Many smaller ''neighborhood parks'' are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from [[urban decay]] and government neglect.

Passive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure. Many ski resorts combine active recreation facilities (ski lifts, gondolas, terrain parks, downhill runs, and lodges) with passive recreation facilities (cross-country ski trails).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Parks owned or operated by government==

===National parks===
[[File:Zackenberg.4.jpg|thumb|Northeast Greenland National Park, the world's largest national park]]
{{Main|National park}}
A national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national [[government]], protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a [[protected area]] of [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] [[IUCN protected area categories|Category II]]. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.

While this type of [http://parksfamilyfarm.co/ national park] had been proposed previously, the United States established the first "public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people", [[Yellowstone National Park]], in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=amrvl&amp;fileName=vl002//amrvlvl002.db&amp;recNum=1&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvl+vl002))&amp;linkText=0|title=Evolution of the Conservation Movement, 1850-1920|website=memory.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park. The first officially designated national park was [[Mackinac National Park|Mackinac Island]], gazetted in 1875. [[Australia]]'s [[Royal National Park]], established in 1879, was the world's second officially established national park.&lt;ref name=StevensBertram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=105893|title=National parks|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=31 July 2007|work=Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts|publisher=[[Australian Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest national park in the world is the [[Northeast Greenland National Park]], which was established in 1974 and currently protects {{convert|972001|km2|mi2|-3|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Greenland, [http://www.stat.gl/LinkClick.aspx?link=Intranet%2fGIF_2009_WEB.pdf&amp;tabid=57&amp;mid=473&amp;language=en-US ''Greenland in Figures, 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenland.com/en/about-greenland/natur-klima/nationalparken.aspx | title=The National Park | publisher=Greenland.com | accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-national parks===
{{Main|State park|Provincial park}}
In some [[Federation|Federal systems]], many parks are managed by the sub-national levels of government. In [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], and some states in [[Mexico]], as well as in [[Victoria (Australia)|the Australian state of Victoria]], these are known as state parks, whereas in [[Argentina]], [[Canada]] and [[South Korea]], they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual [[County (United States)|counties]] to run parks, these are known as '''county parks'''.

===Urban parks===
[[File:Yoyogi Park from Hyatt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Yoyogi Park]] is a large urban park in [[Tokyo]].]]
{{Main|Urban park}}
A park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble [[savanna]]s or open [[woodland]]s, the types of [[landscape]] that human beings find most relaxing. [[Grass]] is typically kept short to discourage [[insect]] pests and to allow for the enjoyment of [[picnic]]s and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]].

Some early parks include the [[La Alameda, Seville|la Alameda de Hércules]], in [[Seville]], a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]], in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthyány family and was later made public.

An early purpose built public park was [[Derby Arboretum]] which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by [[Princes Park, Liverpool|Princes Park]] in the [[Liverpool]] suburb of [[Toxteth]], laid out to the designs of [[Joseph Paxton]] from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for £50,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] at [[Regent's Park]], and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodeling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself.

The form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for [[Birkenhead Park]]. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857.

Another early public park is the [[Peel Park, Salford]], England opened on August 22, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm Salford City Council: Parks in Broughton and Blackfriars] Retrieved on September 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopaedia of Greater Manchester: The Campaign for City Parks in Manchester and Salford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922182525/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html |date=September 22, 2007 }} Retrieved on September 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buhu.salford.ac.uk/virtualtours/index.php University of Salford: Peel Park] Retrieved on September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible claimant for status as the world's first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).

===Linear parks===
A [[linear park]] is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a [[rail trail]] or [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a [[greenbelt]].

===Country parks===
{{Main|Country park}}
In some countries, especially the United Kingdom, ''country parks'' are areas designated for recreation, and managed by [[local authority|local authorities]]. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.

==Private parks==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Private parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.

''Hunting parks'' were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt&amp;nbsp;– see [[medieval deer park]]. These were known for instance, as ''deer parks'' (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many [[country house]]s in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a ''country house's park'' and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.

'''Poictesme''' (pronounced "pwa-tem") is a fictional country or province which forms the setting of the fantasy works of [[James Branch Cabell]], known collectively as ''[[Biography of the Life of Manuel]]''. Poictesme is ruled by the Count Dom Manuel.

It was the author's intention to situate Poictesme roughly in the south of [[France]]. The name suggests the two real French cities of [[Poitiers]] (medieval Poictiers) and [[Angoulême]] (medieval Angoulesme). Poictesme is a fief of [[Ferdinand III of Castile|King Ferdinand of Castile and Leon]], who installs Manuel as count in the year 1234. Cabell's fictional history of the country extends as far as the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Doren |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Van Doren |title=The Two Heroes of Poictesme: A Study of 'Jurgen' and 'Figures of Earth' |url=https://www.unz.com/print/Century-1924nov-00129 |journal=[[The Century Magazine]] |issue=November 1924 |pages=129-134 |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of Cabell's popularity in the 1920s, Cabell's publishers sold framed 
wall-maps of Poictesme. &lt;ref&gt;[[Darrell Schweitzer]], "Cabell, James Branch", in  ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]], London, 
St. James Press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}}, (p. 91-93).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] undergraduate literary journal is named ''Poictesme'' after the fictional province.

The Drift of Sea Ice. Springer-Verlag, New York, 266 p.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''pressure ridge''' develops in an ice cover as a result of a stress regime established within the plane of the ice. Within [[sea ice]] expanses, pressure ridges originate from the interaction between floes,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A ''floe'' is any individual piece of sea ice larger than {{convert|20|m|ft}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as they collide with each other.&lt;ref name="NSIDC"&gt;http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EC Glossary"&gt;http://www.ec.gc.ca/glaces-ice/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=501D72C1-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/volume1.php?lang1=0&amp;lang2=1&amp;arrange=1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks" &gt;Weeks, W. F. (2010) ''On sea ice''. University of Alaska Press, Fairbanks, 664 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Currents and winds are the main driving forces, but the latter are particularly effective when they have a predominant direction.&lt;ref name=" Strub-Klein"/&gt; Pressure ridges are made up of angular ice blocks of various sizes that pile up on the floes. The part of the ridge that is above the water surface is known as the ''sail''; that below it as the ''keel''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These terms also apply for any floating ice feature, such as [[iceberg]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure ridges are the thickest sea ice features and account for about one-half of the total sea ice volume.&lt;ref name="Lepp"/&gt; [[Stamukha|Stamukhi]] are pressure ridges that are grounded and that result from the interaction between [[fast ice]] and the drifting pack ice.&lt;ref name="Barnes&amp;al78"&gt;Barnes, P.W., D., McDowell &amp; Reimnitz, E. (1978). Ice gouging characteristics: Their changing patterns from 1975-1977, Beaufort Sea, Alaska. United States Department of the Interior, Geological Survey Open File Report&amp;nbsp;78-730, Menlo Park, U.S.A., 42&amp;nbsp;p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O&amp;A2010"&gt;Ogorodov, S.A. &amp; Arkhipov, V.V. (2010) Caspian Sea bottom scouring by hummocky ice floes. Doklady Earth Sciences, 432, 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;703-707.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal structure ==
The blocks making up pressure ridges are mostly from the thinner ice floe involved in the interaction, but it can also include pieces from the other floe if it is not too thick.&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; In the summer, the ridge can undergo a significant amount of weathering, which turns it into a smooth hill. During this process, the ice loses its salinity (as a result of [[Sea ice growth processes|brine drainage]]). This is known as an ''aged ridge''.&lt;ref name="NSIDC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EC Glossary" /&gt; A ''consolidated ridge'' is one whose base has undergone complete freezing.&lt;ref name="NSIDC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EC Glossary"/&gt; The term ''consolidated layer'' is used to designate freezing up of the rubble just below the water line.&lt;ref name=" Strub-Klein"/&gt; The existence of a ''consolidated layer'' depends on air temperature — in this layer, the water between individual blocks is frozen, with a resulting reduction in porosity and an increase in mechanical strength. A keel's depth of an ice ridge is much higher than its sail's height - typically about four times. The keel is also 2-3 times wider than the sail.&lt;ref name="Wadhams2" /&gt;

== Thickness ==
One of the largest pressure ridges on record had a sail extending {{convert|12|m|ft}} above the water surface, and a keel depth of {{convert|45|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; The total thickness for a multiyear ridge was reported to be {{convert|40|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M., Masterson, D. &amp; Wright, B. (2009). Multi-year ice thickness: knowns and unknowns. Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Arctic Conditions (POAC), Luleå, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, total thickness ranges between {{convert|5|m|ft}} and {{convert|30|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="Lepp" /&gt; with a mean sail height that remains below {{convert|2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Strub-Klein" &gt;Strub-Klein, L. &amp; Sudom, D. (2012). A comprehensive analysis of the morphology of first-year sea ice ridges. Cold Regions Science and Technology, 82, pp. 94-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization methods ==
The physical characterization of pressure ridges can be done using the following methods:&lt;ref name=" Strub-Klein" /&gt; 
* Mechanical drilling, whereby augers designed for ice are driven through the ridge, and the core retrieved for analysis.
* Surveying, whereby a level, [[theodolite]] or a [[differential GPS]] system is used to determine sail geometry.
* Thermal drilling – drilling involving melting of the ice.
* Observation of the ice canopy by [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]].
* [[Upward looking sonar]]s.   
* A series of [[thermistor]]s, to monitor temperature changes. 
* [[Electromagnetic induction]], from the ice surface or from an aircraft.

== Interest for pressure ridges ==
From an offshore engineering and naval perspective, there are three reasons why pressure ridges are a subject of investigation.&lt;ref name="Lepp"/&gt; Firstly, because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features. Secondly, when pressure ridges drift into shallower areas, their keel may come into contact with the seabed, thereby representing a risk for [[submarine pipeline|subsea pipelines]] (see [[Seabed gouging by ice]]) and other seabed installations. Thirdly, they have a significant impact on navigation. In the Arctic, ridged ice makes up about 40% of the overall mass of sea ice.&lt;ref name="Wadhams2"&gt;Wadhams, P. (2000). Ice in the Ocean. Gordon and Breach Science Publ., London, 351 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''provinces of Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|области на България}} Oblasti na Bǎlgarija) are the first level administrative subdivisions of the country.

Since 1999, [[Bulgaria]] has been divided into 28 provinces ({{lang-bg|области}} – ''oblasti;'' singular: област – ''[[oblast]]''; also translated as "regions") which correspond approximately to the 28 districts (in Bulgarian: окръг – ''[[okrug|okrag]]s'', plural: окръзи – ''okrǎzi''), that existed before 1987.
{{Bulgaria Provinces}}

The provinces are further subdivided into 265 municipalities (singular: община – ''[[obshtina]]'', plural: общини – ''obshtini'').
[[File:NUTS BG Level 1 and 2.png|thumbnail|400px|Distribution of provinces by [[NUTS of Bulgaria|NUTS]]: Level 1 (regions): Northern and South-Eastern, South-Western and South-Central; Level 2 (planning regions)]]

[[Sofia]] – the capital city of Bulgaria and the largest settlement in the country, is the administrative centre of both [[Sofia Province]] and [[Sofia City Province]] (Sofia-[[Grad (toponymy)|grad]]). The capital is included (together with 3 other cities plus 34 villages) in [[Sofia Capital Municipality]] (over 90% of whose population lives in Sofia), which is the sole municipality comprising Sofia City province.

== Terminology ==
The provinces do not have official names – legally (in the President's decree on their constitution), they are not named but only described as "oblast with administrative centre [Noun]" - together with a list of the constituting municipalities. In Bulgaria they are usually called "[Adjective] Oblast"; occasionally they are referred to as "Oblast [Noun]" and rarely as "oblast with administrative centre [Noun]".

The Bulgarian term "област" (''oblast'') is preferably translated into English as "province", in order to avoid disambiguation and distinguish from the former unit called "окръг" (''okrag'', translated as "district") and the term "регион" (always translated as "region"). At any rate, "district" and "region" are sometimes still used to name these contemporary 28 units.
* "region": "28 '''regions''' (en) / région (fr) / oblast (bg)" – in ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-3 (2011-12-13, corrected 2011-12-15)
* "district": "The territory of the South Central Region encompasses five '''districts''' – Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Smolyan, Haskovo, and Kyrdzhali." – in a website of the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/regional-innovation/monitor/base-profile/yugozapadna-i-yuzhna-tsentralna-bulgaria/south-central-planning-region |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013075738/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/regional-innovation/monitor/base-profile/yugozapadna-i-yuzhna-tsentralna-bulgaria/south-central-planning-region |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oblasti 1987-1998 by Plamen Tsvetkov.png|thumb|right|300px|Provinces of Bulgaria from 1987 to 1998]]
In 1987, the then-existing 28 districts were transformed into 9 large units (in Bulgarian called [[oblast]]s - ''provinces''), which survived until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/47.htm|title=Bulgaria - GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9 large provinces are listed below, along with the pre-1987 districts (post-1999 small provinces) comprising them.
{| class="wikitable"
! 1987-1998&lt;br/&gt;oblasts !! Comprising former districts (future provinces)&lt;/tr&gt;

| Lovech  || Gabrovo, Lovech, Pleven, Veliko Tarnovo&lt;/tr&gt;
| Montana || Montana, Vidin, Vratsa&lt;/tr&gt;

| Varna   || Dobrich, Shumen, Varna&lt;/tr&gt;
|}

On 1 January 1999, the old districts were restored, but the designation ("oblast") "province" was kept.

[[Image:Un rincón frente a la pesquera.JPG|thumb|right|Small meadow, called a rincón by the  photographer]]
A '''rincón''' is a grass meadow.  The term is in wide use in English in the [[southwest United States]], where it refers specifically to a sloping (usually steep) meadow on the south facing upper slopes of a forested mountain.  These characteristic high meadows are formed by the repeated freezing and thawing of snow accumulations on south facing slopes, creating a habitat not conducive to forest.  They are further maintained by a high frequency of low-intensity [[wildfire]].  A notable example of a wildfire begun in a rincon, with catastrophic consequences, was the 2000 [[Cerro Grande Fire]] in [[New Mexico, United States]].

'''Roderick Frazier Nash''' is a professor emeritus of history and environmental studies at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]].  He was the first person to descend the [[Tuolumne River]] (using a raft).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Scholarly biography ==
Nash received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1960 and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://aapra.org/pugsley-bios/roderick-frazier-nash&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of several books and many essays. His [[dissertation]], "Wilderness and the American Mind," done under the supervision of [[Merle Curti]], became what has come to be seen as one of the foundational texts of the field of [[environmental history]]. After teaching for two years at [[Dartmouth College]], he was called to the growing History Department at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] where he joined distinguished historians such as [[Wilbur Jacobs]], [[Robert O. Collins]], [[Frank J. Frost]], [[C. Warren Hollister]], [[Leonard Marsak]], and [[Joachim Remak]]. After witnessing a massive oil spill in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1969 he and a number of other faculty members became active within the University and founded an environmental studies program there in 1970.  Since the initial 12 graduates in 1972, there have been 4,000 graduates within 300 separate majors.  Nash is a firm believer in environmental education and is also an avid [[white water rafting|white-water river rafter]].

== ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' ==

Nash's study in this book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PJZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=20oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4335,743719&amp;dq=roderick-nash+raft&amp;hl=en|title=Parks Subject of New Special|date=March 7, 1981|work=[[Waycross Journal-Herald]]|page=P5|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the attitude of Americans' toward the idea of wilderness. He discusses the different attitudes that American's have had toward nature since colonization and the changing uses and definitions of 'wilderness'in that context. Specifically, Nash describes the evolution of American wilderness conception through Transcendentalism, Primitivism, Preservationism, to Conservationism.&lt;ref name="Wilderness and the American Mind, Nash 1973" /&gt; Nash states that if wilderness is to survive, we must, paradoxically, manage wilderness – at the very least, our behavior towards the wilderness must be managed.

== Personal Philosophy ==

Nash presents America's anthropocentric view as the main enemy to all wilderness preservation.  He argues that an ecocentric view is ideal and may work in the long run, but perhaps the preservation of nature and wilderness for the sake of holding resources out for the preservation of our own species would be more salient. Yet, even this strategy is hard for people to grasp, because it requires us to reach outside the present and look to the future. Still, Nash suggests that maybe the simple preservation of the environment for the sake of our own generation's recreation and health (oxygen sinks, etc.) could provide the impetus to slow some profiteering.

Nash also talks of how wilderness teaches us the value of humility. The problem is that humanity does not want to be humbled.  Humans are a proud species who will do anything to avoid being humbled.  To this end, we have ripped the wildness from the wilderness and removed all that causes any threat to our existence.

Nash believes that humankind has two choices in the next 1,000 years. We can "trash the planet into a wasteland" or adopt a plan to distill the world's population in 500 "islands" while allowing wilderness to flourish around us.

The '''Samara bend''' ({{Lang-ru|Самарская Лука}}) is a large hairpin bend of the middle [[Volga River]] at the confluence of the [[Samara River]] ({{Coord|53|07|N|50|04|E|display=inline,title}}). It is situated in [[Samara Oblast]], [[Volga Federal District]] of [[Russia]].

As the Volga enters its middle course it reaches the [[Zhiguli Mountains]], and the Samara Bend is formed as the river circles these mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://int.rgo.ru/news/samara-bend/|title=Samara Bend|date=10 May 2011|publisher=Russian Geographical Society|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">{{About|the Maoist political concept|the Western political concept|Three-World Model}}

{{Maoism sidebar|expanded=Basic}}

In the field of [[international relations]], the '''Three Worlds Theory''' ({{zh|s=三个世界的理论|t=三個世界的理論|p=Sān gè Shìjiè de Lǐlùn}}), by [[Mao Zedong]], proposes three politico-economic worlds: the '''First world''' consisting of [[superpower]]s, the '''Second world''' of  developing powers, and the '''Third world''' of exploited nations.&lt;ref name="http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/theory-3-worlds/section1.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman Mao's Theory of the Differentiation of the Three Worlds is a Major Contribution to Marxism-Leninism|work=People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First world comprises the US and the USSR, the superpower countries engaged in [[imperialism]] and in [[social imperialism]]. The Second world comprises Japan and Canada, Europe and the countries of the global [[North–South divide]]. The Third world comprises the countries of Africa, Latin America, and continental Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intercultural Communication and Diplomacy|editor1-first=Hannah|editor1-last=Slavik|publisher=Diplo Foundation|year=2004|first=Sandra|last=Gillespie|chapter=Diplomacy on a South-South Dimension|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Vice-Premier of the PRC, [[Deng Xiaoping]], explained the Three Worlds Theory at the [[special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the problems of raw materials and development]], about the PRC's cooperation with non-communist countries.&lt;ref name=NYT41274&gt;{{cite news|author1=Teng Hsiao-ping|authorlink1=Deng Xiaoping|title=Excerpts From Chinese Address to U. N. Session on Raw Materials; Plundering, Bullying' High-Handed Measures' Independent Development|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E1D6113CEF34BC4A52DFB266838F669EDE|accessdate=February 21, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 12, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[political science]], the Three Worlds Theory is a [[Maoism|Maoist]] interpretation of international relations different from the [[Three-World Model]], created by the demographer [[Alfred Sauvy]], wherein the First World comprises the US, Great Britain, and their allies; the Second World comprises the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and their allies; and the Third World comprises the economically underdeveloped countries and the countries of the [[Nonaligned movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998) Graham Evan and Jeffrey Newnham, Eds., pp. 314–15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.jpg|thumb|300px|The Communist leaders of China and Albania, Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha in 1956, before the Sino–Albanian (1972–78).]]
In the [[Communist Bloc]], Mao Zedong's Three Worlds Theory provoked opposition from [[anti-revisionist]] Marxist political parties, such as the [[Party of Labour of Albania]]  (1945–91), led by [[Enver Hoxha]], who proposed an alternative ideology of [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] that contradicted the [[Stalinist]] worldview of Mao and the Peaceful Co-existence worldview of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Such ideological disputes culminated in the [[Sino-Albanian split]] (1972–78), between the People's Republic of China and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] (1946–92).

Moreover, the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]], in France, and the [[Maoist Internationalist Movement]], in the U.S., sought to establish a Communist International based upon [[Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]], without the ideologic limitations of the Russian and Chinese interpretations of Marxism, and excluded the Three Worlds Theory from their programs, considering it part of [[Maoism]].

This is a '''list of countries by [[urbanization]]'''. 

== Methodology ==
There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. 

The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time.

== Countries ==
The data is taken from the CIA World Factbook with estimates from 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=World Factbook Urbanization|work=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why I Am A Hindu''''' is a 2018 book by Indian politician [[Shashi Tharoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scroll.in/article/868932/shashi-tharoors-why-i-am-a-hindu-is-a-timely-reminder-of-why-hinduism-must-retain-its-pluralism |title=Shashi Tharoor’s ‘Why I Am A Hindu’ is a timely reminder of why Hinduism must retain its pluralism |last=Chanda-Vaz |first=Urmi |date=2018-02-18 |website=Scroll.in |access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Tharoor writes about the history of [[Hinduism]] and its core tenets, as well as socio-cultural developments in India that relate to the religion, while elucidating his own religious convictions.

Tharoor intended the book to be a repudiation of Hindu nationalism, and its rise in Indian society, which relied upon an interpretation of the religion which was markedly different from the one with which he had grown up, and was familiar with. In seeking to address this concern, he wanted to position the debate as one within the Hindu faith, and therefore wrote about his own personal identification with the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scroll.in/article/868126/i-want-to-resist-the-hijacking-of-hinduism-by-hindutva-the-shashi-tharoor-interview |title=I want to resist the hijacking of Hinduism by Hindutva: The Shashi Tharoor interview |last=Daniyal |first=Shoaib |date=2018-02-11 |website=Scroll.in |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book is segmented into two parts. In the first part, Tharoor offers a brief history of Hinduism, and the development of his own personal faith. In the second part, he traces the rise of modern Hindu nationalism in the form of the [[Hindutva]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/why-i-am-a-hindu-review-the-power-of-politics-as-religion/article22783777.ece |title=Why I Am A Hindu review: The power of politics as religion |last=Chandhoke |first=Neera |date=2018-02-17 |website=The Hindu |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
