'''Albert Nerenberg''' (born October 13, 1962) is a Canadian independent filmmaker, actor, journalist, hypnotist and laughologist. His films include ''Stupidity'' (2003), ''Escape to Canada'' (2005), ''[[Let's All Hate Toronto]]'' (2007), ''[[Laughology]]'' (2009) and ''Boredom'' (2013). Both ''Stupidity'' and ''Laughology'' are the first feature-length documentaries to discuss the topics of stupidity and laughter.

==Early life==
Born in London, Ontario in 1962, Nerenberg studied English Drama at [[McGill University]] in Montreal during the 1980s, where he formed Theatre Shmeatre, an improvisational theatrical company, and served as editor in chief of the ''[[McGill Daily]]''.

Formerly a newspaper reporter with the ''Montreal Gazette'' and talk radio host at CKGM, Nerenberg told the Montreal newspaper, ''La Presse'', that he became a filmmaker after he smuggled a video camera through army lines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fT8XnaWIzs|title=Behind the lines at Oka: How two journalists managed to get a camera  behind army lines|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1990 [[Oka Crisis]] – a standoff between armed Mohawk Warriors and the Canadian military. The footage was later turned into his first documentary, entitled ''Okanada''.

==Film career==
Among his early films was ''1949'', so-named because it cost only $19.49 to make, taking advantage of the sophistication of Hi-8 video equipment at that time.

Nerenberg was recognized by the [[Cinémathèque Québécoise]] as a film innovator for having had a role in some of the developments in contemporary filmmaking; including the hand-held revolution, the Truvie where fictional films are shot in real situations, and in creating the format of fictional movie trailers. In 2001 Nerenberg was the subject of a retrospective at the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in Montreal.

Nerenberg is the founder of [[Trailervision]]. Trailervision is the idea that movie trailers are their own artistic medium.  CNN has profiled Trailervision, calling it an "international cult phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trailervision.com/trailer.php?id=45|title=Website is under construction|website=Trailervision.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerenberg has directed over 70 Trailervision trailers and over a dozen TV documentaries.

In 2005, Nerenberg directed ''Escape to Canada'', a documentary about how Canada has unintentionally usurped America's place as the Land of the Free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=113&amp;csid2=946&amp;fid1=26517 Exclaim Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209225501/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=113&amp;csid2=946&amp;fid1=26517 |date=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007's ''[[Let's All Hate Toronto]]'', Mr. Toronto (Nerenberg's eye-patched co-director Rob Spence) embarks on a coast-to-coast Canadian tour to promote "the centre of the universe" by waving a banner that reads "Toronto Appreciation Day."

In 2003 he founded "The World Stupidity Awards", an annual satirical awards show which was sponsored by the [[Just for Laughs]] festival from 2004 to 2007, honouring the "Stupidest Statement of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stupidityawards.com/News.html|title=Stupidityawards.com|website=Stupidityawards.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerenberg is also known for a widely publicized prank performed at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival. The director orchestrated the red carpet entry of a group of Trailervision actors as major movie stars to a major premiere. This was done by placing actors in the paparazzi who screamed the names of these fictional stars as they arrived by limo. The paparazzi responded by flashing their cameras frantically. The fake stars were rushed into the green room along with the real stars, "where they got drunk like showbiz kings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trailervision.com/article.php?id=9|title=Website is under construction|website=Trailervision.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prank is described in the online [[Museum of Hoaxes]] as The Toronto Film Festival Hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/trailer.html|title=The Toronto Film Festival Hoax|website=Museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an actor, Nerenberg is known for his portrayal of the Modeman character, a mentally disabled janitor, who can speak "modem" and
create web pages with his mouth. He also plays a sermonizing priest in the popular Trailervision web trailer, ''Kung Fu Jesus''.

==Laughing Championships==
Nerenberg said that he got the idea for competitive laughter after attending a UFC fight were two fighters unintentionally started laughing during a stare down. "What I was seeing was a re-enactment of the greatest revolution that ever took place on the planet," he said in the Canal D documentary Extreme Laughter. "The discovery of play."  Nerenberg organized the first ever Montreal Laughing Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG-nTWZdPk|title=Laughologist Cracks up CBC's As It Happens|first=|last=Laughologist|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where using stare-downs and laughing fits,12 competitors would compete to see who was the champion. The laughers would be judged for their contagiousness effect on the audience. After that event, laughing championships would be organized in Japan, France, The Czech Republic and in Slovenia. The first American Laughing Championships would take place in April 2013 in San Diego at the Westin Hotel Ballroom and opened by then Mayor Bob Filner.

"Punching people in the face is a sport. Poking people with sticks is a sport. Why not have a sport about the pursuit of joy?" Nerenberg told The Pacific Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/inside-the-world-of-competitive-laughing-6b763c8f6763|title=Inside the World of Competitive Laughing|website=Psmag.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypnosis==
At IdeaCity in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6_1irwyCew|title=Shocking - Hypnotist Demonstrates That Drugs And Alcohol Are All In The Mind|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nerenberg made a controversial presentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disinfo.com/2014/07/drugs-and-alcohol-are-all-in-the-mind/|title=Drugs and Alcohol Are (All?) In The Mind - disinformation|date=18 July 2014|website=Disinfo.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that all [[psychoactive drug|drug]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] states can be replicated with [[hypnosis]]. He demonstrated by inviting volunteers from the audience. Under hypnosis he made one volunteer apparently drunk, while another on cocaine and two others on ecstasy. To conclude he asked the audience to invent a drug on the spot, which volunteers might experience. One audience member suggested "Ludicron" a drug which causes people to laugh and "think the audience is naked." When the drug state was implemented a volunteer laughed and screamed and claimed she could see hundreds of naked people.  Nerenberg launched a project called The Hypnotic Bar, a kind of temporary night club where people are hypnotized to be drunk while drinking only water. Nerenberg said he got the idea of the Hypnotic Bar after coming across a statistician stating that more people are currently dying of drug and alcohol overdoses than at any other time in human history.

Nerenberg has been an advocate for better public understanding of Hypnosis. In a speech at TEDX Queens, Nerenberg challenged the audience to take standard tests of hypnotizability. Many audience members appears to go to sleep and some acting as if they were chickens. Nerenberg stated that hypnotic chicken behaviour is actually quite profound, revealing as key aspect of human nature, that we believe our dreams.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Current projects==
Nerenberg's most recent documentary entitled ''[[Laughology]]'' premiered at [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/171_films_heading_to_16th_hot_docs/|title=171 Films Heading To 16th Hot Docs|first=Peter|last=Knegt|date=24 March 2009|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary makes the case that laughter is the original peace signal and the human ability to share and transmit laughter may have been key to the rise of human civilization. The film chronicles unusual laughter phenomena such as Holy Laughter, Laughter Parties and the Tanzanian Laughter Epidemic. Screenings of the film have been notable as fits of uncontrollable laughter have broken out following the film. Gabor Pertic writing in A&amp;E Vibe described a packed screening at HotDocs International Film Festival in Toronto Canada. "The screening had some of the loudest collective laughs I have ever heard in a movie theatre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressplus1.com/film-reviews/hot-docs-2009-laughology.html]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerenberg frequently tours and speaks as a "Stupidity Expert" and more recently as a Laughologist, an expert on laughter. After traveling to India and studying the benefits of [[Laughter Yoga]] with Dr. Madan Kataria, Nerenberg invented Laughercize, a system of joy-inducing exercise that works off natural human contagious laughter. This technique has been used in a number of Canadian alcohol and drug rehab centres. He also invented the Laughter Party, which creates the same atmosphere as a wild party, without the need of drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughterparty.net/LaughterPartyNetwork/How_it_Works.html Laughter Party] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006034332/http://laughterparty.net/LaughterPartyNetwork/How_it_Works.html |date=2009-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerenberg also worked as a newspaper columnist for [[The Montreal Gazette.]] His most recent work is a 10 column series about the benefits and importance of positivity in today's world. In 2013 he completed the feature documentary Boredom. He is currently working on a new film about The Hypnotic Bar and a documentary titled ''You Are What You Act''. You Are What You Act won the Jury Prize at the Illuminate Film Festival in Sedona, Arizona, in June 2018.

The '''All-Union First Programme''' ({{lang-ru| Первая общесоюзная программа, Pervaya obshesoyuznaya programma}})  was a radio channel in the [[Soviet Union]]. It had a political focus and discussed events in the [[Soviet Union]]. Since 1991 it was a small commercial radio station broadcasting with the name "Radio-1". "Radio-1" ceased broadcasting on 21 June 2010.

== History ==

The [[All-Union Radio]] was established in 1924 in the Soviet Union. It broadcast from Moscow. 

The channel was changed to the ''All Union First Programme'' in 1945 with a political focus.

The All Union First Programme transmitted its program set over [[mediumwave]] and [[VHF]].

In connection with the dissolution of the USSR, the All Union First Programme ceased its transmission in December 1991. In Russia, Radio-1 began broadcasting on the former frequencies of the All Union First Programme. The other open frequencies of the All Union First Programme were taken over by the state radio channels of the newly independent republics.

'''''All for Gold, or Jumping the Claim''''' is a 1911 Australian [[silent film]] directed by [[Franklyn Barrett]]. Only a few frames of the film survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=no;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Id%3A764518;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 ''All for Gold, or Jumping the Claim''] at [[National Film and Sound Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also known as ''Quest for Gold''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article176321051 |title=WEST'S PICTURES. |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Brisbane)|The Telegraph]] |location=Brisbane |date=8 November 1911 |accessdate=17 May 2015 |page=8|edition=SECOND EDITION|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Englishman Jack Cardigan (Herbert J. Bentley) strikes gold and writes a letter to his girlfriend, Nora (Lilian Teece), to tell her of the news. He gives the letter to a friend, Ralph Blackstone (Hilliard Vox) who poisons Cardigan's drink, throws his body in the river and takes over his claim.

However, when in Sydney, he accidentally allows the letter to come into Nora's possession and she decides to investigate. While Blackstone goes back to the mine by train, she tries to beat him there by taking a speedboat across [[Sydney harbour]], then driving a fast car. She arrives to find Cardigan still alive and recovering. Cardigan gets his claim back and is reunited with Nora.

==Cast==
*Herbert J. Bentley as Jack Cardigan
*Hilliard Vox as Ralph Blackstone
*Lilian Teece as Nora Fraser
*Ronald McLeod as Bert Fraser
*E. Melville as warden
*Walter Bastin as Jim Carey

==Production==
In 1911, the newly established [[West's Pictures]] wanted to get into feature production. They offered a £25 prize for a story about Australian life best suited for screen adaptation; bushranging themes were barred.&lt;ref name="shirley"&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 39&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 entries were received and the winner was stage comedian W.S. Percy for this script.&lt;ref name="Pike"&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The car chase scene was shot near [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]] in the Blue Mountains. Lilian Teece had to drive a car alongside the passing of a fast train. The train arrived an hour earlier than scheduled and Teece had to chase after it. "Passengers craned their heads through the windows and urged the driver of the train not to be beaten by a woman",  said a contemporary newspaper report. Teece got in front of the train just before the train disappeared in a cutting. "If I had not passed him before I passed the camera I would have followed him to Bathurst", said Teece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5315063 |title=GENERAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=22 September 1911 |access-date=9 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie featured an early example of split-screen technology, with one scene showing Nora making a phone call, a boatman receiving the call, and Sydney harbour in between.&lt;ref name="Pike"/&gt;

'''''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''''' is a 2010 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-brotherhood-review/ |title=Assassin's Creed  Brotherhood Review |first=Tyler |last=Wilde |date=28 March 2011 |work=PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2010/11/16/assassins-creed-brotherhood-review |title=Assassin's Creed  Brotherhood Review |first=Cam |last=Shea |date=16 November 2010 |newspaper=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third major installment in the [[Assassin's Creed|''Assassin's Creed'' series]], a direct sequel to 2009's ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', and the second chapter in the 'Ezio trilogy'. The game was first released on the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in November and December 2010, and was later made available on [[Microsoft Windows]] in March and June 2011.

The plot follows the centuries-old struggle between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. The main story takes place immediately after the plot of ''Assassin's Creed II'', featuring Assassin [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] in 16th century Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the [[House of Borgia|Borgia family]].

''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' is set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] with a primary focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio is able to freely explore 16th-century [[Rome]] to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a [[Knights Templar|Templar]] training program.

The game received critical acclaim with critics praising its setting of Rome, content, gameplay improvements over its predecessor and the addition of a multiplayer mode; the story received a mostly positive response, although several critics found it to be inferior to ''Assassin's Creed II'''s. It also won multiple awards including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]] award for Best Action Game. It was followed in November 2011 by ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'', a direct sequel that served as a conclusion to Ezio's story and continued the story of Desmond Miles.

A remastered version, along with ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'', was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on November 15, 2016 as part of ''The Ezio Collection''.

==Gameplay==
''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' is an action-adventure video game with main emphasis on nonlinear, sandbox style gameplay, parkour movements, crowd-blending stealth, assassinations and melee fighting system. The combat system features several improvements and for the first time in the series, the game offers a [[multiplayer]] mode alongside 15+ hours of single-player gameplay.&lt;ref name="cvg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=260729 |title=Gamescom 2010: 13 killer Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood facts |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames|date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game introduces a new management system: the player can recruit new members by destroying any of twelve "Borgia towers" around Rome where papal troops are stationed and then rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from being harassed by guards. The player, as Ezio, can then send them to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied). Tasking the novice Assassins makes them gain experience, and the player is able to customize their appearance, skills, and weapon training to some degree by spending the skill points they have earned. Assassins can die on missions, from which they will not return. Ezio masters new gadgets, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s parachute, which can be used when jumping from tall buildings,&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt; along with poison darts, a faster acting poison, a crossbow, and the ability to hold and throw heavier weapons like axes.

[[File:Assassinscreedbrotherhood BAM.jpg|thumb|left|Ezio using the BAM system (Brotherhood Assist Move).]]
The primary setting is Rome, which has fallen into ruin due to the corrupt rule of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] papacy and the Templars over the [[Papal States]] and concentrating all the wealth in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Just like the town of [[Monteriggioni]] in ''Assassin's Creed II'', the player is able to invest in the city, witness its development, and unlock rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskill |first=Jake |url=http://g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/63731/assassins-creed-brotherhood/articles/71844/Gamescom-2010-Assassins-Creed-Brotherhood-Single-Player-Preview/ |title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood for Xbox 360 - Preview |publisher=G4tv.com |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player has to conquer and destroy Borgia towers to free city zones from the family's influence.&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt; Completing this unlocks new missions and opportunities. Rome is larger than any of the cities in the first two installments (Rome is three times bigger than Florence from ''Assassin's Creed II''&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt;) and includes five districts: [[Vatican City|Vatican]] (''Vaticano''), Central (''Centro''), Trans-Tiber (''Trastevere''), Country (''Campagna'') and Antique (''Antico''). Unlike the previous installments, travel between different cities or regions is no longer present, as most of the action in the game takes place around the city of Rome. Instead, a series of tunnel networks throughout the city allow the player to travel to different sectors of the city with ease. However players will be able to explore the entire city of Rome, visit the harbour of [[Naples]], a part of [[Navarre]], [[Spain]], Valnerina, Lake of Nevi and present day Monteriggioni.

The combat system has been modified. Striking first and offensive actions are more deadly in ''Brotherhood'' than previous games where counter-attacks were the most efficient. Before, this made the player wait until the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] struck, which slowed down the pace of fighting. The AI in this game is thus more aggressive and enemies can attack simultaneously. To dispatch them, Ezio can use melee and ranged weapons at the same time, as well as introducing the hidden pistol in combat. After killing one enemy the player can start an execution streak to dispatch multiple enemies quickly.  Ezio can throw heavy weapons (axes, spears, and swords) at his enemies. There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those seen in ''Assassin's Creed II'' such as [[Cavalry|horsemen]], [[arquebusiers]], [[Swiss Guard|papal guards]] and others.

Horses play a larger role in ''Brotherhood'', not only used as a means of transport (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. ''Brotherhood'' also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in ''Assassin's Creed II'' to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3180977 |title=AC: Brotherhood Preview for PC, 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous installments, Desmond can leave the Animus at almost any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.

Like ''Assassin's Creed'', characters based on historical figures are present in the game, including [[Rodrigo Borgia]], [[Cesare Borgia]], [[Niccolo Machiavelli]], [[Caterina Sforza]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/12/the-real-life-characters-of-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=The Real Life Characters of Assassin’s Creed |first=Matt |last=Miller |date=12 October 2010 |access-date=24 September 2018 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations in the game include the [[Colosseum]] and [[the Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/what-are-the-best-settings-in-the-assassins-creed-franchise |title=What Are The Best Settings in the Assassin's Creed Franchise? |first=Mike |last=Williams |date=25 October 2017 |access-date=25 September 2018 |magazine=[[US Gamer]] |publisher=[[Gamer Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' is the first game in the main series to feature a multiplayer mode. The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi (plural for animus) seen at the beginning of ''Assassin's Creed II'' to access memories of old Templars and to acquire their skills using the "bleeding effect". There are eight game modes (Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort and Assassinate) and different maps, including the areas from the second and the third game like Florence, as well as new maps like Rome, Castel Gandolfo, Siena and Mont Saint-Michel.&lt;ref name="acb-gamespot-beta-preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/assassinscreedbrotherhood/news.html?sid=6279718&amp;mode=previews |title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood: Multiplayer Beta Hands-On |author=Mike Walton|date=September 27, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay in multiplayer mode is similar to the core gameplay of the series, as players are required to use their assassination and stealth skills. The players must hunt down targets while being hunted themselves. Players earn points by performing assassinations, defending against pursuers, attaining bonuses or completing mode-specific objectives. It also contains a variety of characters, most of which must be unlocked.

The multiplayer mode also includes a leveling system, which allows players to unlock rewards by earning experience points during the matches and gaining new levels. Players can then unlock abilities, perks and streaks. Abilities are active skills, which can be used again only after a cool down time. Perks are passive skills, which can be equipped before the match and they are active all the time. Streaks are bonuses awarded for reaching certain number of successful or failed contracts.&lt;ref name="acb-gamespot-beta-preview" /&gt; The multiplayer beta, exclusive to PlayStation 3 users, was announced at [[E3 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3179897 |title=E3 2010: Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Beta Coming Only to PS3 |publisher=1up.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began on October 4, 2010, with early access for [[PlayStation Plus]] subscribers from September 27,&lt;ref name="acb-gamespot-beta-preview" /&gt; and ended on October 18, 2010. Three maps were playable in the beta: Rome, [[Castel Gandolfo]] and [[Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/57168/Assassins-Creed-Brotherhood-Multiplayer-Beta-Is-PS3-Pre-Order-Perk |title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Multiplayer Beta Is PS3 Pre-Order Perk - Voodoo Extreme |publisher=Ve3d.ign.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920143053/http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/57168/Assassins-Creed-Brotherhood-Multiplayer-Beta-Is-PS3-Pre-Order-Perk| archivedate= September 20, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="computerandvideogames.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=263774 |title=News: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood beta detailed |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100911020628/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=263774| archivedate= September 11, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Game modes====
;Free-For-All
In ''Wanted'', at least six players are on a map where they must find and assassinate each other. Each player is given another player as a target. The goal is to find and kill a target without being seen or killed by the player's own pursuer or pursuers. Players are indistinguishable from some of the [[Non-player character|NPC]]'s throughout the maps. If the player kills an NPC by mistake or otherwise breaks cover, they are more easily spotted by pursuer or target alike, sometimes resulting in a chase. The player with the highest score at the end of the session wins. Players will lose their contract if they kill an NPC, are stunned by their target or their target is killed by another player. A player cannot kill another player who is not the target, but they can stun their hunter. ''Advanced Wanted'' mode is a variant of ''Wanted'' mode, with differences including an increased amount of NPCs on the map to make it difficult to pick out targets and a less accurate compass. There is generally more stealth involved in this mode than in basic ''Wanted''.&lt;ref name="IGNpreview"&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/113/1133270p1.html |title=Assassin's Creed: Mass Murder - PlayStation 3 Preview |publisher=IGN |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Assassinate'' mode is similar to ''Wanted'', but instead of target contracts being assigned to players, all players are fair game. Players must identify other player characters and lock on before assassinating. Because two players can kill each other, whoever locks on first becomes the hunter and the other becomes the target. The standard compass found in ''Wanted'' is replaced by directional arrows based on proximity, that grow to become arcs around the perimeter of the compass as other players near, and will eventually create a full circle when other players are very close. As in other modes, the player with the highest score at the end of the session is the winner.

;Team
In ''Alliance'', there are three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. The point of this mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one specific team (not the team chasing them, but they will be able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously.&lt;ref name="acb-gamespot-beta-preview" /&gt; The ''Advanced Alliance'' mode is a variant of ''Alliance'' mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the ''Advanced Wanted'' mode.

In ''Manhunt'' there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, the other is the hunted. Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and remaining hidden. The team with the highest score wins.&lt;ref name="IGNpreview"/&gt; In ''Chest Capture'' there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, and the other is the hunted who need to steal chests by standing close to them. Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and stealing chests. The team with the highest score wins. The ''Escort'' mode sees one team of four players protecting a wandering NPC while the other team of four tries to assassinate him. There are two NPCs to protect at a time and they walk through a series of checkpoints, which are visible to both teams. When an escorted NPC is killed, another is synchronized. This mode has two rounds with each team playing once as an escort and once as assassins.

====Characters====
Players are able to choose one of the 21 available characters, including: [[Courtesan]], [[Barber]], [[Priest]], [[Nobility|Noble]], Prowler, [[Executioner]], [[Physician|Doctor]], [[Blacksmith]], Captain, Smuggler, [[Engineer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/assassinscreed?v=app_4949752878 |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up-qR9qSHRQ&amp;feature=sub |title=Assassin's Creed Brotherhood - Beta Trailer [Europe&amp;#93; |publisher=YouTube |date=September 27, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footpad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk-jyIn0MeA |title=Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Reveals: The Footpad [North America&amp;#93; |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronictheatre.co.uk/index.php/articles/5422-new-assassins-creed-brotherhood-characters-revealed |title=New Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Characters Revealed |publisher=Electronictheatre.co.uk |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101009090046/http://electronictheatre.co.uk/index.php/articles/5422-new-assassins-creed-brotherhood-characters-revealed| archivedate= October 9, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thief]], [[Hellequin]] (a female [[Harlequin]], which is available through uPlay) and [[Mercenary]].

The pack contains 4 new characters, Dama Rossa, Knight, Marquis, and Pariah. Each character has unique assassination moves and a signature weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JC Fletcher on |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/23/kill-some-time-with-assassins-creed-brotherhood-multiplayer-fo/ |title=Kill some time with Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood multiplayer footage |publisher=Joystiq |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters can be customized as the player levels up. These customization options include changing the color of the outfit, and equipping different gear.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
[[File:Cesareborgia.jpg|150px|thumb|A portrait of [[Cesare Borgia]] by [[Altobello Melone]]]]
Desmond's story continues where it left off, in 2012. After escaping the [[Knights Templar|Templars]]' attack at the end of ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', Desmond Miles, [[Lucy Stillman]], Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings flee to Monteriggioni, establishing a new hideout in the ruins of the [[Villa Auditore]]. After restoring the electricity in the old tunnels under the villa, the player once again takes control of Ezio Auditore through Desmond's [[Genetic memory (parapsychology)|genetic memory]], using the Animus 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). Their mission is to find the Apple of Eden, an important and mysterious artifact that could prevent the [[2012 phenomenon|impending disaster]] that is coming in that same year, believed to be perpetrated by the Templars.

Ezio's story continues in 1499, where he exits the Vault, confused by what he saw inside. He escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario Auditore, and returns to Monteriggioni. Once home, Ezio is comforted by the prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (now [[Pope Alexander VI]]) alive. The following morning - New Year's Day - Monteriggioni is besieged by [[Cesare Borgia]], son of Rodrigo. Mario is killed at the hands of Cesare himself, and the Apple lost to Cesare and the Templars. Ezio escapes with his family and travels once more to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, once again seeking vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassins are failing in their fight against corruption. Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars and his new nemesis, Cesare.

Over the next four years, Ezio executes various tasks meant to cripple the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]]' hold in the capital, sabotaging Cesare's resources and assassinating key people close to and/or working with him in the process, and slowly restoring Rome to its former glory. After returning the Roman Assassins to full strength, Ezio is given the rank of ''Il Mentore'' (Italian for "The Mentor"), and made de facto leader of the Assassins in Italy. During this time, Ezio's sister Claudia is also made an Assassin.

Cesare, learning of Ezio's actions, confronts his suspicious father and desperately asks for more money, and the Apple itself. Rodrigo refuses, cautious of provoking the Assassins, and attempts to poison his son, realizing that Cesare's lust for power can't be held at bay. Cesare, however, turns the tables on his father and kills him instead. Ezio witnesses this and, after learning of the Apple's location, retrieves it from within [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]]. Ezio uses it to overwhelm Cesare's forces and gradually withdraw the backing of his supporters; Cesare is finally arrested by [[Pope Julius II]]'s Papal Army after Ezio and the Assassins confront him and kill his remaining followers.

Sometime later, Ezio uses the Apple once more to check on Cesare, who has broken out of prison and, after gaining the support of his new patron, [[John III of Navarre]], laid siege to the city of [[Viana, Spain|Viana]], in [[Navarre]]. Ezio encounters Cesare on the battlements of a crumbling castle and fights him. Cesare claims that he cannot be killed by the hand of a mortal man, thus inciting Ezio to "leave [him] in the hands of fate" by dropping him off the battlements to his death. Ezio then takes the Apple and hides it in a First Civilization Temple built underneath the [[Roman Colosseum]].

Using the coordinates taken from Ezio's memories, Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca travel to the Temple, intending to use the Apple to locate the remaining Temples and keep the other Pieces of Eden out of the Templars' hands. As Desmond makes his way into the Temple, he is confronted with holographic apparitions of a being called [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], who appears to be of the same race as [[Minerva]]; however, she is neither audible nor visible to Lucy, Shaun, or Rebecca. Most of her comments center on humanity's lack of knowledge. She states that humanity is "innocent and ignorant;" that people were not built to be wise, having been given only five of the six senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, but lacking knowledge. Her careful cadence then drops, as she suddenly becomes angry, yelling, "We should have left you as you were!"

As Desmond approaches the Apple and touches it, time freezes around him, though he can still move and speak. Juno cryptically states that Desmond is descended from her race, and is their enemy; she also says there is a woman who would accompany him through "the gate," but must not be allowed to. She takes control of Desmond's body and forces him to stab Lucy in the [[abdomen]]. Both fall to the ground, with Lucy dead and Desmond entering a [[coma]]. As the credits roll, two men are heard discussing whether to put Desmond back in the Animus.

==Development==
''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' was developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]]. Montreal also worked on both of the other main ''Assassin's Creed'' games in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new ''Assassin's Creed'' episode featuring multiplayer was announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood-+-update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood - Update |author=Mike Fahey |date=May 5, 2010 |work= |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brotherhood'' has not been numbered unlike ''Assassin's Creed II'' because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while this is only the continuation of Ezio's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEOWmJzayM |title=Assassins Creed Brotherhood ComDev Conversation - Ubisoft E3 2010 [Europe] |author=[[Ubisoft]] |date=June 16, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=July 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100821010859/https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=ZIEOWmJzayM| archivedate= August 21, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was developed primarily by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] in [[Canada]]. Production was aided in part by four other Ubisoft developers: Annecy, Singapore, Bucharest and Québec City. The multiplayer mode is mainly developed by Ubisoft Annecy, the studio responsible for creating multiplayer mode in ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nz.playstation.com/ps3/news/articles/detail/item279057/Assassins-Creed%C2%AE-Brotherhood-announced/ |title=PlayStation 3 News Articles: - Assassin's Creed Brotherhood announced |publisher=Nz.playstation.com |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34795/Five-studio-rapid-coalition-for-new-Assassins-Creed |title=Five-studio brotherhood for new Assassin's Creed |author=Rob Crossley |date=May 11, 2010 |work= |publisher=develop |accessdate=July 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725161336/http://www.develop-online.net/news/34795/Five-studio-rapid-coalition-for-new-Assassins-Creed| archivedate= July 25, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft also announced plans for [[downloadable content]] (DLC) after the game's launch. Two sets of free DLC have already been released under the names "Animus Project Update 1.0" and "Animus Project Update 2.0". The first includes the new map ''Mont Saint-Michel'' and one new mode, ''Advanced Alliance''. The "Animus Project Update 2.0" was released in January 2011, was also free, and included another map, mode and the introduction of a player grading system.&lt;ref name="cvg"/&gt; From the perspective of performance, Ubisoft have commented that they hope the gaps between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will be even smaller with Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingunion.net/news/assassins-creed-brotherhood-ps3-performance-should-match-xbox-360--3179.html |title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood PS3 Performance Should Match Xbox 360 |publisher=GamingUnion.net |date=November 2, 2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105124620/http://www.gamingunion.net/news/assassins-creed-brotherhood-ps3-performance-should-match-xbox-360--3179.html| archivedate= November 5, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players have access to several new missions featuring the famous Renaissance astronomer Copernicus. Extra content includes courier, assassination and protection missions&amp;nbsp;— Ezio will be tasked with foiling the conspiracy against Copernicus and defending his philosophy. The PC version of ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' was released by [[Akella]] in [[Russia]] in exclusive Collector's Edition featuring 6 metal figurines of multiplayer characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ru.akella.com/Game.aspx?id=2459|title= Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood|author= Akella|date=|work= |publisher= Akella|accessdate=March 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110422165954/http://ru.akella.com/Game.aspx?id=2459| archivedate= April 22, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downloadable content==

===Uplay content===
Ubisoft's [[Uplay]] system enables further in-game enhancements which can be redeemed by points that are given when playing the game. The available awards are a ''Brotherhood'' theme or wallpaper for PC and PlayStation 3, Florentine Noble Attire, Armor of Altaïr, Altaïr's Robes, Gun Capacity Upgrade and Hellequin character.

===''Copernicus Conspiracy''===
''Copernicus Conspiracy'' is a free downloadable content pack for ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', initially released exclusively for the PlayStation 3 on the game's release, later receiving official support on the PC via a patch on 23 May 2017 on both Steam and Uplay and later being automatically being available in the Ezio Trilogy Collection on the PS4 and Xbox One. It focuses on the famed astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who gets into trouble with the Vatican, who do not want Copernicus educating the public about astronomy. The pack consists of eight optional missions, ranging from courier, assassination and protection objectives.

===''Animus Project Update 1.0''===
The ''Animus Project Update 1.0'' included a new game mode and a new map. The game mode, ''Advanced Alliance'', is a version of the ''Alliance'' mode, with target identification and engagement more difficult than in the original, thus providing a more challenging experience for players. With three teams of two players each, ''Advanced Alliance'' is a tougher test for players and rewards teams that work together. The new map, [[Mont Saint-Michel]], is located on a rocky tidal island of [[Normandy]] in [[France]]. Its particular topography of narrow streets, high-perched bell-tower, and multi-leveled architecture is perfect for hunters and predators alike to surge from out of nowhere to execute their prey. To survive, recruits need to use free-running and narrow roads to their advantage.

===''Animus Project Update 2.0''===
The ''Animus Project Update 2.0'' included a new game mode and map. The [[Pienza]] Map provides a free-running playground with wide-open plaza areas, where predators and targets can quickly blend and disappear, surrounded by narrow alleys and multi-story buildings for extra verticality. In the new ''Chest Capture'' multiplayer mode, two teams composed of three players compete as Hunters and Protectors; partnered with fellow [[Knights Templar|Templars]], Hunters will attempt to steal the contents of the chests scattered around the map as protectors attempt to prevent this. Also included in the update is a Templar Score feature to reward diligent work by Abstergo recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polygamia.pl/Polygamia/1,107162,8531855,W_Assassin_s_Creed__Brotherhood_spotkamy_Kopernika.html |title=W Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood spotkamy Kopernika |author=Gnyp, Piotr |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=October 27, 2010 |language=Polish |trans-title=We will meet Copernicus in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020225059/http://polygamia.pl/Polygamia/1%2C107162%2C8531855%2CW_Assassin_s_Creed__Brotherhood_spotkamy_Kopernika.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Advanced Alliance'' is also packaged with the new DLC, while the Mont Saint-Michel map is not. Only one DLC can be activated at a time, so players will either be missing the new map from the 1.0 update or the new mode, new map and Templar Scoring from the 2.0 update.

===''The Da Vinci Disappearance''===
''The Da Vinci Disappearance'', on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, features new content for both single player and multiplayer modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/11268/assassins-creed-brotherhoods-da-vinci-dlc-out-next-week|title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood's Da Vinci DLC out next week|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the single player game, this downloadable content includes 8 new missions, 2 new locations, and 10 trophies/achievements. The multiplayer content includes two new game modes, new map and four new characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/289564/news/assassins-creed-brotherhood-single-player-dlc-announced/ |title=News: Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood - Single-player DLC announced |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version includes DLC for free (it must be activated through Uplay) along with both Animus Project Updates. In March, the "Da Vinci Edition" of ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', was released for consoles. This version includes ''The Da Vinci Disappearance'' DLC.

The story revolves around Leonardo da Vinci's mysterious disappearance in the year 1506. Ezio arrives at Leonardo's workshop with his assistant [[Salaì]] and finds him missing. It is soon revealed that Leonardo found a secret vault and his plans were discovered by the [[Hermeticism|Hermetics]], members of the Cult of Hermes. Ezio finds writing on the floor that implies he should seek out five of Leonardo's paintings once owned by Ezio at Monteriggioni but now missing. The majority of this sequence focuses on the search for and retrieval of these paintings by Ezio. After finding these paintings, Ezio identifies the location of a new subterranean location in Roma and proceeds there, to find Da Vinci imprisoned by Hermetics. After freeing Leonardo, the two of them find another vault, in which they are revealed the numbers 43 39 19 N and 75 27 42 W. Ezio comments on these numbers "It is not intended for us". At the end of the sequence, two male voices (one is the Assassin, William) are heard commenting that Desmond has fallen into a coma. They also comment "we have a location for the temple" and "then what are you waiting for, let's go." This DLC doubles as the technical ''Animus Project Update 3.0'', with the addition of the preorder multiplayer characters, the Harlequin and Officer, as well as the preorder-only special Drachen Armor for Ezio.

[[Eurogamer]] praised everything about ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', giving it a 10/10, and particularly noted the maturity of the story: "One mission sees Ezio disrupting an assassination attempt in the ruins of the Roman Colosseum during a play about the death of Jesus Christ. It demands a developer of poise and compassion to wield such thorny concepts deftly, and it's a measure of Ubisoft Montreal's maturity that it is more than equal to the challenge...Brotherhood builds an intriguing mystery around compelling characters, surrounds them with collectibles and secrets, and encourages play&amp;nbsp;– and nothing feels out of place." &lt;ref name="eg_rev"/&gt; In December 2015, ''Game Informer'' ranked the game as the best game in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/12/04/ranking-the-entire-assassin-s-creed-series.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|title=Ranking The Entire Assassin's Creed Series|last=Juba|first=Joe|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Da Vinci Disappearance'' add-on was also met with favorable reviews, and holds a [[Metacritic]] score of 75/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/assassins-creed-brotherhood---the-da-vinci-disappearance|title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood - The Da Vinci Disappearance for Xbox 360 Reviews - Metacritic|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the delayed PC version questioned the reason behind the delayed release date as the game was virtually unchanged from the console version albeit with better graphical enhancements and minor bonus content. However most praised [[Ubisoft]]'s move to remove the DRM that marred the PC version of ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' as well as include all DLC free of charge.

===Sales===
The game passed the one million sales mark in less than a week after its release. ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' has become Ubisoft's fastest-selling European title ever. It also had the best Ubisoft's launch in Europe and is the best-selling launch title ever as of November 2010. As of May 2011, Ubisoft announced the game had shipped 8 million copies&lt;ref name="sales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ubisoftgroup.com/index.php?p=59&amp;art_id=60&amp;vars=Y29tX2lkPTgzMiZzZW5kZXI9SE9NRSZzZW5kZXJfdXJsPWluZGV4LnBocCUzRnNpdF9pZCUzRDImZmlsdGVyX3R5cGU9JmZpbHRlcl9tb250aD0mZmlsdGVyX3llYXI9 | title=UBISOFT REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER 2010-11 SALES | accessdate=February 14, 2011 | date=February 14, 2011 | publisher=Ubisoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped the entire ''Assassin's Creed'' series to achieve over 28 million units sold.&lt;ref name="cvg-sales-ac2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=277962 |title='Big Assassin's Creed game' confirmed for 2011 |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
On May 5, 2011, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'' was revealed to be the next major installment in the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise. It was released on November 15, 2011. The game is the second to have three playable characters (Altaïr, Ezio and Desmond) after ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', which focused on Ezio and Desmond while Altaïr made a brief playable cameo. It is set in [[Constantinople]], at the peak of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. ''Revelations'' brought back the multiplayer experience first introduced in ''Assassin's Creed Brotherhood'' with "more modes, more maps, and more characters" according to the official announcement. It is also the last game featuring Ezio.'&lt;ref name="Ubisoft Officially Reveals Assassin's Creed Revelations"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eykemans|first=Peter|title=Ubisoft Officially Reveals Assassin's Creed Revelations|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/116/1166213p1.html|work=IGN|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article outlines, in chronological order, the various scandals surrounding or involving the [[BBC]] that have occurred.

==Early years==

===1926 General Strike===
The BBC was established as the privately controlled British Broadcasting Company in 1922. In 1926 the unions called for a General Strike and the Conservative Government feared the outbreak of revolution, as had happened in Russia in 1917. Labour Party politicians such as [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]] criticised the BBC for being pro-Government and anti-Unions; however, throughout the strike, Reith insisted that the news bulletins report all sides of the dispute without comment.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120220030515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/bbcandgov/pdf/generalstrike.pdf ''Governing the BBC'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Reith's attempts to broadcast statements by the Labour Party and TUC leaders were blocked by the Government;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; in partial response, he personally vetoed a statement that [[Randall Davidson]], Archbishop of Canterbury, wished to make, in the belief that allowing such a statement would give [[Winston Churchill]] both motive and opportunity to take over the BBC—something which Churchill had continually advocated since the beginning of the Strike. Reith admitted to his staff that he would have preferred to allow the Labour and TUC leaders to broadcast directly. A post-strike analysis carried out by the BBC's Programme Correspondence Department reported that of those polled, 3,696 commended the BBC's coverage, whilst 176 were critical.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Between the wars===
Since 1927, there have been arguments over impartiality at the BBC. In 1927, under a Royal Charter, the BBC became a public entity for the first time – with requirements including the need for impartiality and for staff not to express opinions on controversial subject matters.

Prior to World War II, [[Sir John Reith]] excluded Winston Churchill from the BBC airwaves.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Nick Robinson, '[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9606384/Nick-Robinson-Winston-Churchills-bitter-battle-with-the-BBC.html Winston Churchill's bitter battle with the BBC]', ''The Daily Telegraph'' (14 October 2012). Retrieved on 24 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938, Churchill "complained that he had been very badly treated...and that he was always muzzled by the BBC".&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

===1930s to Cold War: MI5 vetting===

From the late 1930s until the end of the [[Cold War]], [[MI5]] had an officer at the BBC vetting editorial applicants. During World War II 'subversives', particularly suspected communists such as the folk singer [[Ewan MacColl]], were banned from the BBC. The personnel records of anyone suspicious were stamped with a distinctively shaped green tag, or "Christmas tree;" only a handful of BBC personnel staff knew what the 'Christmas trees' meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith| first = David | title = BBC banned communists in purge |work=The Observer | date = 5 March 2006| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1723776,00.html | accessdate =28 December 2008| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s: Commercial radio controversy===

Because the BBC had become both a monopoly and a non-commercial entity, it soon faced controversial competition from British subjects who were operating leased transmitters on the continent of Europe before World War II, to blast commercial radio programmes into the United Kingdom. [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] who had been given powers to dictate the cultural output of the BBC retaliated by leading the opposition to these commercial stations. Controversy spilled over into the press when the British government attempted to censor the printing of their programme information. The pressure was created by the success of these stations. By 1938 it was reported that on Sundays 80% of the British audience was tuning into commercial radio, rather than the non-commercial BBC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Post-war==

===1950s: Claimed involvement in Operation Ajax===

A BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2005 claimed that it had evidence that a radio newsreader inserted the word "exactly" into a midnight timecheck one summer night in 1953, a code word to the [[Shah]] of Iran that Britain supported his plans for a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup]]. The shah had selected the word, the documentary said, and the BBC broadcast the word at the request of the government. Officially, the BBC has never acknowledged the code word plot. The BBC spokesman declined to comment on a possible connection.&lt;ref name="BBCRadio4Document"&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/document/document_20050822.shtml|date=22 August 2005 |title=A Very British Coup |series=Document |network=BBC |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |accessdate=25 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090222142305/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/document/document_20050822.shtml| archivedate= 22 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iran.bbc.persian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/21/iran.bbc.persian/|title=Iran declares BBC Persian TV illegal|accessdate=25 March 2009 |publisher=CNN | date=21 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161607/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/21/iran.bbc.persian/| archivedate= 18 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s: Independent television controversy===

Winston Churchill's government passed the [[Television Act 1954]] that permitted the creation of the first commercial television network in Britain, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. This was criticised in the House of Lords by, among others, Lord Reith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1954/jul/01/television-bill HL Deb 01 July 1954 vol 188 cc316-415]&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill explained to his doctor, [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]]: "I am against the monopoly enjoyed by the BBC. For eleven years they kept me off the air. They prevented me from expressing views which have proved to be right. Their behaviour has been tyrannical. They are honeycombed with Socialists&amp;mdash;probably with Communists".&lt;ref&gt;Lord Moran, ''Winston Churchill: The Struggle for Survival, 1940-1965'' (London: Sphere, 1968), p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Hubert Wilson|title=Pressure group: the campaign for commercial television in England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIY1AQAAIAAJ|year=1961|publisher=Rutgers University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965: ''The War Game''===
''[[The War Game]]'' is a drama documentary recounting the fictional dropping of Soviet nuclear weapons on Britain, centring on projected events in Kent. Using then current scientific knowledge of the effects of such a development, the film was directed by [[Peter Watkins]]. Intended for the twentieth anniversary on 6 August 1965 of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima]], ''The War Game'' was dropped from the BBC programme schedule before transmission on the grounds that it was too horrifying to be shown. Although given a limited cinema release by the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI), and awarded an Oscar as Best Documentary, it was not screened by the BBC until 1985.

[[John Pilger]] in 2012 argued that the BBC's power to prevent "the truth" being broadcast, as represented by Watkins' film, has made "the state broadcaster [into] a cornerstone of Britain’s ruling elite".&lt;ref name="Pilger1"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Pilger|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/world-affairs/2012/11/gaza-savaged-again-understanding-bbcs-role-requires-more-sentim|title=As Gaza is savaged again, understanding the BBC’s role requires more than sentiment|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and beyond: Taste and decency===
[[Mary Whitehouse]] launched her 'Clean Up TV campaign' in April 1964. In her view [[Hugh Greene]] as BBC Director General was "more than anybody else ... responsible for the moral collapse in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dennis Barker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Mary Whitehouse: Self-appointed campaigner against the permissive society on television |publisher=The Guardian |date=24 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign of Whitehouse and her supporters soon became the [[Mediawatch-uk|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]]; Mrs Whitehouse was opposed to the policies of liberalisation pursued by Greene and largely sustained by his successors at the Corporation. Whitehouse's campaign focused much more on the BBC than on ITV, and she had a high public profile for several decades. The tabloid press also criticised the BBC for what it perceived as lapses in programming quality.

===1971: ''Yesterday's Men''===
''[[Yesterday's Men (documentary)|Yesterday's Men]]'' is a BBC documentary first broadcast in June 1971&lt;ref&gt;Sources vary as to whether the programme was transmitted on 16 or 17 June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; about the former ministers of [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government who were now experiencing opposition.&lt;ref name="Wilby"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Wilby |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/bbcandgov/pdf/yesterday.pdf |title=Yesterday's Men 1971 |publisher=BBC |date=2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154506/http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/bbcandgov/pdf/yesterday.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the programme makers, who included reporter [[David Dimbleby]], angered Wilson and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] who saw it as displaying explicit Conservative bias. According to the official History of the BBC web page on the incident, the Labour politicians were "effectively tricked into taking part in a programme that would ridicule them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/bbcandgov/yesterdays_men.shtml ''Yesterday's Men'' (1971)], History of the BBC&lt;/ref&gt; During his own interview Wilson was asked by Dimbleby, in an untransmitted section of their encounter, about the money he had made from his memoirs, a question which led to a furious exchange between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=John|title=Unreliable Sources: How the 20th Century was Reported|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zypBsOadOx8C&amp;pg=PA441|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4050-5005-0|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wanted the programme shelved, but it was broadcast with minor changes.&lt;ref name="Wilby"/&gt;

===1979: ''Panorama''===

In November 1979 ''Panorama'' showed masked IRA men manning a roadblock in [[Carrickmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal 1966-1995 and the Search for Peace'' (London: Arrow, 1996), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] withdrew their cooperation immediately and the Unionist leader [[James Molyneaux]] claimed that the filming was "at least a treasonable activity".&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC governors issued a statement which blamed the ''Panorama'' team and admitted that the filming of the IRA roadblock "would appear to be a clear breach of standing instructions in relation to filming in Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pp. 369-370.&lt;/ref&gt; In the House of Commons the Conservative MP [[Tim Eggar]] requested that the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], "contact the governors of the BBC to express extreme concern about the way in which the "Panorama" team seems to have encouraged the IRA to break the law in Northern Ireland".&lt;ref name="Hansard8Nov" &gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1979/nov/08/prime-minister-engagements HC Deb 08 November 1979 vol 973 cc606-13]&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher replied that the government contacted the BBC about the programme: "My hon. Friend will know that this is not the first time that we have had occasion to raise similar matters with the BBC. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I think that it is time that the BBC put its house in order".&lt;ref name="Hansard8Nov" /&gt;

==1980–1990==

===1982: Falklands War===

During the [[Falklands War]], the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and some Conservative MPs believed that the BBC was excessively even-handed between Britain and Argentina, referring to "the British" and "the Argentines" instead of "our forces" and "the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 156, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansard6May"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1982/may/06/engagements HC Deb 06 May 1982 vol 23 cc278-82]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May during a report for ''[[Newsnight]]'', [[Peter Snow]] remarked: "Until the British are demonstrated either to be deceiving us or to be concealing losses, we can only tend to give a lot more credence to the British version of events".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Carter and C. Kay Weaver, ''Violence And The Media'' (Buckingham: Open University Press, 2003), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative MP [[John Page (British politician)|John Page]] complained that the programme was "totally offensive and almost treasonable".&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Adams, ''The Media and the Falklands Campaign'' (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1986), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Answering a question from Page on 6 May, Thatcher said that "many people are very concerned indeed that the case for our British forces is not being put over fully and effectively. I understand that there are times when it seems that we and the Argentines are being treated almost as equals and almost on a neutral basis. I understand that there are occasions when some commentators will say that the Argentines did something and then "the British" did something. I can only say that if this is so it gives offence and causes great emotion among many people".&lt;ref name="Hansard6May" /&gt; ''The Sun'' newspaper published an editorial on 7 May titled "Dare Call it Treason: There are Traitors in Our Midst" which criticised Snow.&lt;ref&gt;Carter and Weaver, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' came to Snow's defence in an editorial titled 'The Harlot of Fleet Street', calling ''The Sun'' "coarse and demented" and that it had "fallen from the gutter to the sewer...The Sun today is to journalism what Dr Joseph Goebbels was to truth".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade, '[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/25/pressandpublishing.falklands A new Britain, a new kind of newspaper]', ''The Guardian'' (25 February 2002), retrieved 3 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10 May edition of ''Panorama'' (titled "Can We Avoid War?") also provoked outrage.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Philo (ed.), ''The Glasgow Media Group Reader, Vol. II: Industry, Economy, War and Politics'' (London: Routledge, 1995), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC.co.uk, '[http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/research/culture/bbc-and-gov/falklands The Falklands Conflict 1982]'. Retrieved on 24 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The day after it was broadcast, the Conservative MP [[Sally Oppenheim]] asked Thatcher in the Commons: "Is she aware that for the most part, but not all, it was an odious, subversive, travesty in which [[Michael Cockerell]] and other BBC reporters dishonoured the right to freedom of speech in this country?"&lt;ref name="Hansard11May"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1982/may/11/engagements HC Deb 11 May 1982 vol 23 cc596-602]&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher responded: "I share the deep concern that has been expressed on many sides, particularly about the content of yesterday evening's "Panorama" programme. I know how strongly many people feel that the case for our country is not being put with sufficient vigour on certain—I do not say all—BBC programmes. The chairman of the BBC has assured us, and has said in vigorous terms, that the BBC is not neutral on this point, and I hope that his words will be heeded by the many who have responsibilities for standing up for our task force, our boys, our people and the cause of democracy".&lt;ref name="Hansard11May" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the commander of the British Naval Task Force, [[Sandy Woodward]], while the British were preparing to land on [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] the BBC World Service broadcast that the Battle Group and Amphibious Group of the Task Force had joined up. Woodward later wrote: "I had hoped that this particular rendezvous at least could have remained a military secret until after the actual landing, but as ever the British media were more interested in the truth than in the consequences for our own people. We were infuriated".&lt;ref&gt;Admiral Sandy Woodward, ''One Hundred Days'' (London: HarperPress, 2012), pp. 341-342.&lt;/ref&gt; Some on the Task Force said that "if we got hit on the way and lost a lot of men, the Director General of the BBC should be charged with treason".&lt;ref name="Woodward, p. 342"&gt;Woodward, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the [[Battle of Goose Green|attack on Goose Green]], the BBC broadcast that an attack was imminent and that the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2 Para regiment]] were within five miles of [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]]. According to Woodward, there "are still some who believe that BBC report was directly responsible for the Argentinian 'ambush' in which [[H. Jones|Colonel Jones]] and many others died. Standing in the Ops Room of ''[[HMS Hermes (R12)|Hermes]]'' on the day the BBC effectively informed the Args of our position and bearing, I am sure we all felt the same".&lt;ref name="Woodward, p. 342"/&gt; Thatcher later wrote: "Many of the public (including us) did not like the attitude [of the media] particularly the BBC...My concern was always the safety of our forces.

===1984: "Maggie's Militant Tendency" controversy===

In January 1984 the BBC programme ''Panorama'' broadcast "Maggie's Militant Tendency" which claimed that three [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs ([[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]], [[Harvey Proctor]] and [[Gerald Howarth]]) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy over the editing of the programme: it juxtaposed shots of Howarth wearing a train driver's uniform at a steam railway enthusiasts' rally with the claim that he had attended a fascist meeting in Italy, implying that the uniform he was wearing was a fascist one.&lt;ref name="Moore, Volume Two, p. 533"&gt;Moore, ''Volume Two'', p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Hamilton and Howarth sued the BBC. The Director-General, [[Alasdair Milne]], told the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|governors]] that the BBC's defence was "fire-proof" but in late 1986 the acting chairman, [[Joel Barnett|Lord Barnett]], realised that the programme would not withstand legal scrutiny. Hamilton and Howarth received around a million pounds in libel [[damages]].&lt;ref name="Moore, Volume Two, p. 533"/&gt;

Footage of the so-called "Battle of Orgreave" on 18 June 1984 had been filmed by a crew from the BBC.

===1986: Libyan raid controversy===

The ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' reporting of the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|American bombing raid on Libya]] outraged Thatcher and Conservative Party Chairman [[Norman Tebbit]] because they believed it accepted the Libyan government's propaganda about civilian casualties and because it gave no airtime to American or British spokesmen to explain their government's stance.&lt;ref name="Moore, Volume Two, p. 533"/&gt; Tebbit ordered [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]] to compile a dossier on the BBC's reporting and then to hand it to the lawyer [[Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman|Lord Goodman]] for a critique. Goodman's critique largely agreed with the dossier's findings and on 30 October Tebbit submitted it to Lord Barnett, saying that the BBC's coverage was "a mixture of news, views, speculations, error and uncritical carriage of Libyan propaganda which does serious damage to the reputation of the BBC".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Volume Two'', pp. 533-534.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC rejected its findings.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Volume Two'', p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1986: ''Secret Society'' controversy===

{{Main|Zircon affair}}

In 1986 BBC journalists went on strike to protest against police raids in search of evidence that a BBC television series in production, ''Secret Society'', had endangered national security. The police searched the BBC studios in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the London home of investigative journalist [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]], and the ''[[New Statesman]]'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/pressure/zircon.shtml |title=The BBC under pressure – The Zircon Affair 1986-7 |publisher=BBC}}{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 1985, the controller of [[BBC Two|BBC2]], [[Graeme MacDonald]], was offered a series of documentaries by the BBC studios in Scotland in conjunction with an offer to them by Duncan Campbell whose work had previously appeared in the ''New Statesman'' magazine. The programmes were six half-hour films by Duncan Campbell (researched and presented by Campbell and produced according to BBC standards), which illuminated "hidden truths of major public concern". The six programmes were:
* One: ''The Secret Constitution'' about a small, secret Cabinet committee that was in reality the Establishment that ruled the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Two: ''In Time of Crisis'' about secret preparations for war that began in 1982 within every [[NATO]] country. This programme revealed what Britain would do.
* Three: ''A Gap In Our Defences'' about bungling defence manufacturers and incompetent military planners who have botched every new [[radar]] system that Britain has installed since World War II.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Four: ''We're All Data Now'' about the [[Data Protection Act 1984]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Five: Unfinished - about the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] and how government policy and actions are determined in the fields of law and order.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Six: Unfinished - about communications with particular reference to satellites.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Work began on the series. In April 1986 Alan Protheroe, acting on behalf of BBC Director General [[Alasdair Milne]] was asked for permission to ''[[Covert listening device|bug]]'' a private detective who said he could access a [[Criminal Records Office]] computer. Permission was granted and filming took place. The police were informed and the man was subsequently charged under Section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The sixth programme would have revealed details of a top secret spy satellite and Alisdair Milne had already decided to cut it from the line-up when ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper broke the story on 18 January 1987 with the headline: "BBC gag on £500M defence secret". Combined with this story was a report that the [[Home Office]] intended to restrict the [[television licence|broadcast receiver licence]] fee, the implication being that the government had decided to censor BBC investigative journalism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Soon afterwards, a series of programmes on BBC Radio Four called ''My Country Right or Wrong'' was banned by the government because it might have revealed sensitive secrets. The series was censored only a few hours before it was due to start because it dealt with similar issues to the television series concerning the British "secret state".  However, it was eventually broadcast uncut, after the government decided that it did not breach any laws or interfere with national security.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===1987: Sacked director general controversy===

On 29 January 1987 [[Alasdair Milne]] was sacked by the newly appointed chairman of the BBC Board of Governors, [[Marmaduke Hussey]]. He was replaced by a senior BBC accountant, [[Michael Checkland]]. Milne later wrote his account of this affair in ''The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milne|first=Alasdair|title=DG: The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-GPHAAACAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Coronet|isbn=978-0-340-49750-0}} – History of the Zircon spy satellite affair, written by a former Director General of the BBC. A series of BBC TV programmes called ''The Secret Society''  led to a raid by police in both England and Scotland to seize documents as part of a government censorship campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1994: Sinn Féin broadcast ban===
{{main|1988–94 British broadcasting voice restrictions}}

On 19 October 1988, Conservative [[Home Secretary]] [[Douglas Hurd]] under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] issued a notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the [[Broadcasting Act 1981]] to the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] prohibiting the broadcast of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish political and military organisations.&lt;ref name="glasgow48"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=48|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Debate and the Role of the Media: The Fragility of Free Speech|at=p 91 footnote 14|publisher=[[European Audiovisual Observatory]]|isbn=978-92-871-5675-4|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPXw-8wmitQC&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban lasted until 1994, and denied the UK news media the right to broadcast the voices, though not the words, of all [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] and loyalist paramilitaries, while the ban was targeted primarily at [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'broadcast ban' on Sinn Féin|publisher=BBC News|first=Francis|last=Welch|date=5 April 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4409447.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government intimidation and laws before the ban had already resulted in forms of [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name="glasgow48"/&gt; An [[Irish National Liberation Army|INLA]] interview in July 1979 on BBC's ''Tonight'' caused a controversy involving Prime Minister Thatcher and was the last time such an interview was heard on British television.&lt;ref name="glasgow47"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=47|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 ''Panorama'' film of the IRA on patrol in [[Carrickmore]] was seized by police under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] following an outcry in parliament and the press.&lt;ref name="glasgow4748"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|pages=47–48|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 an edition of BBC's ''Real Lives'' series ("At the Edge of the Union") was temporarily withdrawn under government pressure. BBC governors found themselves in conflict with management and the corporation's journalists went on strike for a day. The programme was later transmitted with minor changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/research/culture/bbc-and-gov/real-lives |title=Real Lives 1985: At the Edge of the Union |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only heard or seen on television 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and 172 with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants.&lt;ref name="glasgow56"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=56|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and republican viewpoints, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often lead to coverage and films being dropped entirely.&lt;ref name="glasgow5657"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|pages=56–57|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To allow the continuation of news reporting on the subject, during a time when '[[The Troubles]]' in Northern Ireland were a matter of great importance and interest, the BBC used actors to speak Adams' words. The net effect of the ban was to increase publicity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===October 1998: Richard Bacon cocaine controversy===

On 18 October 1998, a presenter of the children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'', [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon,]] was in the headlines when it emerged he had taken [[cocaine]].

==2000–2010==

===2003: Death of Dr David Kelly===

In May 2003, the defence correspondent of the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Today programme|''Today'' programme]], [[Andrew Gilligan]], quoted a government official who stated that the British government had "sexed up" a dossier concerning [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq, against the wishes of the intelligence services. A newspaper report claimed that [[Alastair Campbell]] (the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy), was responsible. The government strongly denied the claims and this prompted an investigation by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

A [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] scientist, [[Dr David Kelly]], was named as the alleged source of the news item, which led to official sources suggesting that Dr Kelly was not a credible source. The subsequent suicide of Dr Kelly resulted in an escalation of the conflict between the government and the BBC, during which both sides received severe criticism for their roles in the matter.

===2004: Hutton Report===

{{Main|Hutton Inquiry}}
The publication in January 2004 of the ''Hutton Report'' into Dr Kelly's death was extremely critical of Andrew Gilligan, and of the corporation's management processes and standards of journalism. In the aftermath, both the chairman of the BBC [[Gavyn Davies]] and the Director-General [[Greg Dyke]] resigned, followed by Gilligan himself. [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]] was accused of failing to take account of the imperfections inherent in journalism, while giving the government the benefit of the doubt over its own conduct. Large parts of the media branded it a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/01/29/hutton.press/ |title=UK press mauls Hutton 'whitewash' |publisher=CNN |date=29 January 2004 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004: Butler Report===

{{Main|Butler Review}}
A second inquiry by [[Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell|Lord Butler of Brockwell]] did review the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction and the production of the dossier. Amongst other things, the ''Butler Report'' concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the fact that the reference [to the 45 minute claim] in the classified assessment was repeated in the dossier later led to suspicions that it had been included because of its eye-catching character."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Andrew Gilligan claims that the ''Butler Report'' vindicated his original story that the dossier had been "''sexed up''".{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===2004–2007: Balen Report===
{{Main|The Balen Report}}
The BBC fought to overturn a ruling by the Information Tribunal that the BBC was wrong to refuse to release to a member of the public under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] of 2000 (FOI) the Balen report on its Middle East coverage. The report examines the BBC's coverage of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1575543.ece BBC asks court to block Israel report] by Michael Herman (''Times'') 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece |title=BBC fights to suppress internal report into allegations of bias against Israel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013035628/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece |archive-date=13 October 2008 |author=Andy McSmith |publisher=The Independent |date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corporation was reported to have spent £200,000 on fighting the case and was accused by commentators of wasting licence fee payers' money. Critics called the BBC's blocking an FOI request "shameful hypocrisy" in light of the corporation's previous extensive use of FOI requests in its journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=444074&amp;in_page_id=1770 BBC pays £200,000 to 'cover up report on anti-Israel bias'] by Paul Revoir (''Daily Mail'') 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday 27 April 2007 the High Court rejected Steven Sugar's challenge to the Information Commissioner's decision. However, on 11 February 2009 the House of Lords (the UK's highest court) reinstated the Information Tribunal's decision to allow Mr Sugar's appeal against the Information Commissioner's decision. The matter goes back to the High Court for determination of the BBC's further appeal on a point of law against the Tribunal's decision.

The BBC's press release following the High Court judgement included the following statement:

"The BBC's action in this case had nothing to do with the fact that the Balen report was about the Middle East – the same approach would have been taken whatever area of news output was covered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/04_april/27/balen.shtml|title=Balen report: BBC successful in High Court challenge|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Sugar was reported after his success in the House of Lords as saying:

"It is sad that the BBC felt it necessary to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money fighting for three years to try to load the system against those requesting information from it. I am very pleased that the House of Lords has ruled that such obvious unfairness is not the result of the Act."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/11/lawyer-hails-lords-bbc-middle-east Lawyer hails Lords BBC Middle East report ruling as a victory] ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2011: Siemens outsourcing===
In 2004 the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Governors]] approved a deal to [[outsourcing|outsource]] the BBC's IT, [[telephony]] and [[Broadcast engineering|broadcast technology]] (which had previously been run by the corporation's internal BBC technology division) to the German engineering and electronics company [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services]] (SIS).

In 2006 the BBC launched a free educational website for children, [[BBC Jam]], which cost £150&amp;nbsp;million.

===July 2007: ''A Year with the Queen''===

In early 2007 the BBC commissioned RDF Media to make a behind-the-scenes film about the monarchy, titled ''[[Monarchy: The Royal Family at Work]]'', for BBC One. A 60-second trailer was shown at the BBC1 autumn launch in London on 11 July. The trailer showed two clips of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]; one in which she tells photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] that she will not remove her crown to make the scene look "less dressy", and another in which the Queen says "I'm not changing anything.

The shots in the trailer were edited out of sequence, making it appear as if the Queen had abruptly left the photo shoot, when in fact, the second shot showed her ''entering'' the shoot. BBC 1 Controller [[Peter Fincham]] told journalists at the launch that it showed the monarch "losing it a bit and walking out in a huff".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7030158.stm How the Queen clip drama unfolded] (BBC News) 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the BBC released the report of its investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that nobody at the BBC "consciously set out to defame or misrepresent the Queen" and that there was never a possibility "that the misleading sequence could have been included in the finished documentary to be broadcast by the BBC" but that nonetheless "the incident reveal[ed] misjudgements, poor practice and ineffective systems as well, of course, as the usual helping of bad luck that often accompanies such sorry affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/05/investigation.pdf|title=Investigation into  "A Year with the Queen"|publisher=BBC News|format=PDF|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2007: The ''Blue Peter'' cat===
When the children's programme ''Blue Peter'' acquired a pet cat in January 2007, it held an internet vote to choose a name for the animal. In September of that year, it was revealed that viewers had selected the name [[Cookie]], but producers changed the result to [[Socks (Blue Peter cat)|Socks]] instead, leading to accusations of breach of audience trust. An apology to viewers was subsequently made on the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row}}
In a show recorded on 16 October 2008 and broadcast two days later, Brand made several phone calls, along with guest [[Jonathan Ross]], to the home of actor [[Andrew Sachs]], claiming that Brand had sexual relations with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, along with further apparently lewd suggestions. Later coverage in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper led to number of complaints, and ultimately Ross left the broadcaster.

===2009: Gaza DEC Appeal 2009 ''refusal to broadcast''===
On 22 January 2009, the BBC declined a request from the [[Disasters Emergency Committee]]&lt;ref name = DEC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.org.uk|title=DEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DEC) to screen an aid appeal intended to raise money to aid the relief effort following then [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|recent hostilities]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. Explanations cited by [[Mark Thompson (media executive)|Mark Thompson]], the BBC's then Director General raised doubts about the possibility of delivering aid in a volatile situation and highlighted the need to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in the context of an ongoing news story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7846150.stm|title=BBC defends Gaza appeal decision|date=2009|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a lack of consensus among UK broadcasters, with [[British Sky Broadcasting]] announcing it would follow the BBC's view, TV channels in the UK initially decided not to broadcast the appeal.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/26/bbc-gaza-appeal-row-timeline|title=BBC Gaza appeal row: timeline |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A public demonstration occurred outside Broadcasting House on 24 January with former [[cabinet minister]] [[Tony Benn]] attacking the decision in an interview on [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] during which he read out the appeal address, and alleging that the Israeli government was preventing the appeal from being broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E21MdXe3BOQ|title=Tony Benn to BBC 'If you won't broadcast the Gaza appeal then I will myself'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' reported that the BBC faced a revolt from its journalists over the issue, and that they had been threatened with dismissal if they spoke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/26/bbc-staff-protest-over-gaza-aid-appeal|title=BBC staff protest over decision not to show Gaza aid appeal|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|date=26 January 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the paper described the refusal to broadcast the appeal as 'taking a partisan stance' and an [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/27/bbc-gaza error of judgement].

Four days after the BBC refusal, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] broadcast the appeal intact on 26 January. The BBC also broadcast substantial extracts from the appeal in its TV news programmes.

The BBC's decision came in for criticism across the political spectrum including from senior politicians such as [[Nick Clegg]], [[Douglas Alexander]] and [[Hazel Blears]] and public figures like the Archbishops of York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7849554.stm|title=Reaction in BBC Gaza appeal row |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canterbury,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/25/bbc-gaza-charity-appeal|title=Archbishop of Canterbury joins criticism of BBC refusal to air Gaza plea|last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=25 January 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 October 2017|last2=Thorpe|first2=Vanessa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Hinsliff|first3=Gaby}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was supported by a few commentators such as [[Dominic Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-when-charities-turn-political-the-bbc-is-right-to-tread-warily-1516810.html|title=Dominic Lawson: When charities turn political, the BBC is right to|date=27 January 2009|work=The Independent|access-date=10 October 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2009, then Secretary of State for International Development [[Douglas Alexander]] supported the appeal telling Sky News: "My appeal is a much more straight forward one. People are suffering right now, many hundreds of thousands of people are without the basic necessities of life. That for me is a very straight forward case and I sincerely hope that the British people respond with characteristic generosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1126863/Stars-vow-shun-BBC-refusing-broadcast-Gaza-appeal.html|title=Stars attack BBC for refusing to broadcast Gaza appeal but Sky won't show it either|work=Mail Online|access-date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MP [[Richard Burden]] put forward an [[early day motion]] calling on the BBC to screen the appeal which received the support of 112 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7850407.stm|title=MPs call on BBC to air Gaza film |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardburden.com/2009/01/dec-gaza-crisis-appeal/|title=DEC Gaza Crisis Appeal  {{!}} Richard Burden|website=richardburden.com|language=en-US|access-date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, another Labour MP, [[Gerald Kaufman]], complained about "nasty pressure" on the BBC from Israeli lobbyists.

After the appeal was broadcast on Channel 4 on 26 January 2009, [[Niaz Alam]] resigned as an external member of the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/charityappeals/about/appeals-advisory-committee BBC's Appeals Advisory Committee] in protest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/bbc-advisory-panel-member-resigns-protest-gaza-appeal/communications/article/879730|title=BBC Advisory Panel member resigns protest gaza appeal|last=|first=|date=|work=Third Sector|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the BBC's explanation of its refusal to broadcast the appeal, after news coverage gave the impression the whole of this committee had been party to the decision.

A version of his resignation letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muradqureshi.com/resignation-from-bbc-appeals-advisory-committee-over-gaza-appeal/#comments|title=RESIGNATION FROM BBC APPEALS ADVISORY COMMITTEE OVER GAZA APPEAL {{!}} Murad Qureshi|website=muradqureshi.com|language=en-GB|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in [[Private Eye]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tradingaswdr.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/eye-eye.html|title=Eye eye|website=tradingaswdr.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  defending the impartiality of the [[Disasters Emergency Committee]]'s recommendation and criticising the BBC's refusal to broadcast the appeal. The letter also disputed the logic of the justification to block the appeal on grounds of impartiality by pointing out that 'the ultimate logic of a policy of avoiding appeals arising out of politically controversial conflicts would be for the BBC to ignore major humanitarian crises.'

Journalist and broadcaster [[Peter Oborne]]  wrote and presented an edition of Channel 4's ''Dispatches'' titled "Inside Britain's Israel Lobby, " in which this controversy was featured as one small part towards the end, when he discussed the BBC's refusal to broadcast the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal with Niaz Alam.

The BBC Trust reported in its 'Decision of the BBC Trust' document on the appeal that, 'the BBC Executive had received about 40,000 complaints about the Director General's decision'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/complaints_and_appeals/dec_gaza/appeal_findings.html|title=Decision of the BBC Trust: Determination of an appeal against the decision of the Director General of the BBC not to broadcast the DEC Gaza Crisis Appeal|last=|first=|date=February 2009|website=|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's chief operating officer, [[Caroline Thomson]], affirmed the need to broadcast "without affecting and impinging on the audience's perception of our impartiality" and that in this case, it was a "real issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest over BBC Gaza appeal veto|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7848614.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 January 2009|date=24 January 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129080741/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7848614.stm|archivedate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Gaza appeal is the only occasion on which the BBC is known to have refused an appeal broadcast request from the DEC.

It is reported the 2009 DEC Gaza appeal screened only by Channel 4 and ITV raised £8.3m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/appeals-archive|title=Appeals Archive|date=26 November 2014|work=Disasters Emergency Committee|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2014 the BBC broadcast a new DEC aid appeal for people in Gaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28686516|title=BBC to broadcast DEC Gaza appeal|date=7 August 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; without similar controversy, which raised £16m over two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/gaza-crisis-appeal|title=Gaza Crisis Appeal|date=8 August 2014|work=Disasters Emergency Committee|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the improved performance of the [[British National Party]] in the 2009 European elections, the BBC controversially changed its stance on the appearance of the BNP on the flagship current affairs talk show, ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', and invited party leader [[Nick Griffin]] to appear on its edition of 22 October 2009. The BBC was also obliged to transmit party political broadcasts by the BNP.

===2008–2013: Digital Media Initiative===
{{Main|Digital Media Initiative}}
In 2008 the BBC launched the Digital Media Initiative (DMI), a technology programme intended to streamline broadcast operations by moving to a fully digital, [[tapeless]] production workflow at a cost of £81.7 million. It was forecast to deliver cost savings to the BBC of around £18 million. DMI was contracted out to the technology services provider [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services|Siemens]] with consulting by [[Deloitte]].

Costs of the project rose after a number of technical problems and delays, and in 2009 the BBC terminated the contract with Siemens.&lt;ref name="broadcast-dmi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=BBC ditches Siemens from £80m DMI scheme|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc-ditches-siemens-from-80m-dmi-scheme/5008953.article|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=Broadcast|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC losses were estimated to be £38.2m,&lt;ref name="ITProPortal-dmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Loses £38 Million in Failed Digital Media Initiative |url=http://www.itproportal.com/2011/04/07/bbc-loses-38-million-failed-digital-media-initiative/|work=ITProPortal|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; partially offset by a £27.5m settlement paid by Siemens, leaving a loss of £10.7m to the BBC. The BBC was criticised by the UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] in 2011 for its handling of the project.&lt;ref name="guardian-dmi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=BBC IT project criticised by audit office|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/01/bbc-it-audit-office|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the BBC brought the DMI project in-house and started work on a digital system to be known as ''Fabric''.&lt;ref name="bbc-dmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Media Initiative|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Lord Hall]], the BBC's Director General, announced in late May 2013 that the project was to be abandoned after costs reached £98 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22651126 "BBC abandons £100m digital project"], BBC News, 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tara Conlan [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/24/bbc-technology-project-digital-media-initiative "BBC axes £98m technology project to avoid 'throwing good money after bad'"], guardian.co.uk, 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2012: Denis Avey Claims===

On 29 November 2009 BBC News Channel broadcast claims by [[Denis Avey]] that he smuggled himself into [[Monowitz]] concentration camp in 1944.  These claims were presented as fact on the BBC website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8382457.stm | work=BBC News | title=The man who smuggled himself into Auschwitz | date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the subject of the best-selling book ''[[The Man who Broke into Auschwitz]]'' co-authored by Avey and BBC journalist Rob Broomby.

===2009–2014: Women in panel shows===
In 2009, the actress and comedian [[Victoria Wood]] stated that BBC [[panel show]]s were too male-dominated, and involved "a lot of men topping each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan |first=Urmee |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5478241/TV-panel-shows-are-too-male-dominated-claims-Victoria-Wood.html |title=TV panel shows are too 'male dominated', claims Victoria Wood |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the television executive [[Danny Cohen (television executive)|Danny Cohen]] said that there would no longer be any all male comedy panel shows on the BBC and all shows must contain a woman.

Journalist [[Deborah Orr]], although she also considered it "tokenistic", wrote in favour of the plan: "The issue of gender representation on panel games is comparatively trivial. But the fact is this: if comparatively trivial contemporary manifestations of long-standing disadvantage cannot be seen for what they are, and dealt with, but instead become bemired in trenchant opposition, what hope is there in tackling the vast, brutal and comprehensive ones."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Orr [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/28/lack-of-women-panel-shows-matters "A lack of women on TV panel shows may not be the worst injustice, but it matters"], ''The Guardian'', 28 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC was accused of ageism and sexism when news presenter [[Moira Stuart]] (55) – the first black female television newsreader – was sacked in April 2007 after more than two decades of presenting, despite many male presenters in similar situations being allowed to continue in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;

===2010–2011: ''QI'' and Tsutomu Yamaguchi===

In December 2010, the BBC broadcast an episode of its TV quiz show ''[[QI]]'' in which panellists made jokes during a discussion about [[Tsutomu Yamaguchi]], who survived both [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945.&lt;ref name="BBC QI Tsutomu Yamaguchi"/&gt; Yamaguchi had died only earlier that year.&lt;ref name="BBC QI Tsutomu Yamaguchi"/&gt; The Japanese embassy in London wrote a letter of complaint to the BBC about the content of its quiz show after being alerted to the offensive content when viewers in Japan contacted diplomatic staff.&lt;ref name="BBC QI Tsutomu Yamaguchi"/&gt; Yamaguchi's daughter also made known how upset she was as a result of the comments broadcast on the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/stephen-frys-japan-visit-cancelled-over-qi-row-20110204-1afu0.html "Stephen Fry's Japan visit cancelled over QI row"].

In January 2011, the BBC issued an apology for "any offence caused" to Japan by the incident, recognising "the sensitivity of the subject matter for Japanese viewers".&lt;ref name="BBC QI Tsutomu Yamaguchi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12260577 |title=BBC apologises for Japanese atomic bomb jokes on QI |publisher=BBC News |date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the BBC blamed a "strength of feeling" in Japan following its atomic bomb joke broadcast for the cancellation of the filming of part of its ''[[Planet Word]]'' documentary in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12361873 "Stephen Fry Japan trip scrapped after A-bomb joke"].

===2011: ''Top Gear'' comments on Mexico===

On 30 January 2011, the BBC broadcast an episode of its motoring TV show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' during which presenters referred to Mexicans as both "lazy" and "feckless" and Mexican food as "refried sick".&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"/&gt; The broadcast caused many complaints in Mexico, including in newspapers and websites, while a motion of censure was considered in the Mexican senate and the BBC Spanish-language website [[BBC Mundo]] received protests.&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"/&gt; [[Richard Hammond]], one of the presenters, expressed doubt that there would be any complaints against them as, he alleged, the Mexican ambassador would be asleep.&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"/&gt;

British MPs described the comments as "ignorant, derogatory and racist" and called on the BBC to say it was sorry.&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"/&gt; Mexico's ambassador in London also requested that the BBC say it was sorry for the "offensive, xenophobic and humiliating" comments.&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, James.

''The Guardian''. 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC then offered an apology, though it claimed there was no "vindictiveness" in the remarks and that they were just part of the stereotype-based comedy the organisation espoused, such as when it "make[s] jokes about the Italians being disorganised and over dramatic, the French being arrogant and the Germans being over-organised".&lt;ref name="BBC Top Gear Mexico"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12361790 "BBC offers apology for Top Gear comments on Mexico"].

===Fake child labour footage in Bangalore===

The BBC's 50-year-old flagship weekly current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' had aired a documentary claiming that Bangalore-based suppliers of [[Primark]], a hugely successful retailer with 220 stores across Europe, were using child labour in their production in 2008. The claim has been found to be untrue and the BBC apologised to Primark admitting its mistake. Responding to Primark's protest, the BBC conceded in a 49-page report that footage of three boys engaged in completing garments for Primark was "more likely than not" to have been "not genuine" after a three-year internal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-18/india/29674068_1_footage-of-three-boys-child-labour-primark BBC sorry to Bangalore-based supplier for fake child labour footage], Ashis Ray, TNN, 18 June 2011, 03.56&amp;nbsp;am IST, LONDON&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fake "dog sentenced to stoning" story===

The BBC News website featured a story claiming that a dog had been sentenced to death by stoning by an Israeli court. It later transpired that the story was untrue. The story had been sourced from AFP and had originated from Israel's [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]] newspaper as a hoax story.&lt;ref name="dog-stoning2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerusalem court denies dog condemned to stoning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13838347|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dog-stoning3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel dog stoning reports strongly denied|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8588536/Israel-dog-stoning-reports-strongly-denied.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 March 2012|location=London|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The One Show'' Jordan Shelley dog training controversy===
On 15 September 2011 ''[[The One Show]]'' presenters introduced a "new member of the One Show family", the dog trainer Jordan Shelley. The following day, Shelley was shown treating a problem of food guarding in a Jack Russell terrier called Roxy. Only confrontational methods were used, and at the end of the segment [[Alex Jones (Welsh presenter)|Alex Jones]] remarked that "some people out there might argue that some of your techniques were a little aggressive". According to an article in the ''Daily Mail'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2039782/BBCs-The-One-Show-embroiled-animal-cruelty-row-trainer-bullies-Jack-Russell.html 'One Show embroiled in animal cruelty row after trainer bullies Jack Russell'] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC quickly received over 400 complaints about the methods used by Shelley.

The ''Daily Mail'' article was followed by an article on the ''Daily Telegraph'' website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterwedderburn/100106472/the-bbcs-new-dog-trainer-is-a-disgrace-his-unsafe-methods-belong-to-the-last-century/ 'The BBC's new dog trainer is a disgrace'] ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; saying "Jordan Shelley doesn't seem to have any formal training or qualifications, and I've been unable to track down any evidence of his experience. High profile television programmes have a responsibility to ensure that advice given out is consistent with current best practice: ''The One Show''’s dog training segment certainly does not do this".  The Kennel Club published a statement criticising the training methods used in the programme on its website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/3943/23/5/3 'Kennel Club Statement about dog training techniques used on The One Show'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925064310/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/3943/23/5/3 |date=25 September 2011 }} ''Kennel Club'' 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[Dogs Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/pr11jordanshelleystatement.aspx 'THE ONE SHOW AND JORDAN SHELLEY'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011841/http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/pr11jordanshelleystatement.aspx |date=28 September 2011 }} ''Dogs Trust'' 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the show on 21 September, the BBC press office released a statement; "''The One Show'' has thanked viewers for all their comments and criticisms which were taken very seriously. Last night the show featured various differing opinions plus advice from The One Show's vet on the subject of dog training and care. There are currently no plans for this feature to return."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2042203/One-Show-axes-bully-dog-trainer-Jordan-Shelley-faces-RSPCA.html 'Daily Mail'] 'The One Show axes bully dog trainer who faces RSPCA investigation over unorthodox techniques'] ''Daily Mail'' 27 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2012: Use of wrong photo to illustrate massacre===

On 27 May 2012 the BBC News website used a photograph taken in Iraq in 2003 to illustrate a massacre which was reported as having taken place in Syria in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=BBC News uses 'Iraq photo to illustrate Syrian massacre'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9293620/BBC-News-uses-Iraq-photo-to-illustrate-Syrian-massacre.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 May 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine===
During the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] football tournament in Poland and Ukraine, the [[BBC]] [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' aired ''Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate'', which discussed racism in the sport. It included recent footage of supporters chanting various xenophobic slogans and displays of [[White nationalism#White power|white power]] symbols and banners in Poland, as well as Nazi salutes and the beating of a few South Asians in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18192375 | title=Sol Campbell warns fans to stay away from Euro 2012 |publisher=BBC News  | date=28 May 2012 | accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was widely commented in the British press, but later criticised for being one-sided, sensationalist and unethical. The critics included other British media outlets, Polish anti-racism campaigners and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland. Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists, British fans visiting Poland and Ukraine and [[Gary Lineker]] also voiced similar concerns about the broadcast.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/06/ugly-spectre | work=The Economist | title=Euro 2012 is overshadowed by accusations of racism and anti-Semitism | date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/06/poland-and-bbc | work=The Economist | title=Stitch up unstitched—updated (again) | date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news/Football/Unfair-say-organisers/Article1-863192.aspx |title='Unfair' say organisers |work=Hindustan Times |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201153444/http://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news/Football/Unfair-say-organisers/Article1-863192.aspx |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/matt-laws-euro-2012-diary-946599|title=Matt Law's Euro 2012 diary: My highs and lows of the tournament in Poland and Ukraine|author=Matt Law|work=mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive director of the Jewish Community Centre of [[Kraków]], [[Jonathan Ornstein]], a Jewish source used in the film said: "I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience – the British people – by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: "Other sources have come forward to say that an interview with a Jewish Israeli player was also cut from the programme because he failed to confirm Panorama's "anti-semitism" thesis. The BBC interviewed midfielder [[Aviram Baruchyan|Aviram Baruchian]], who plays for the Polish team [[Polonia Warsaw]]. One source who was present said the Panorama journalists had complained afterwards that the interview was "useless". Panorama strongly denies this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/13/ukraine-bbc-euro-2012-panorama?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Luke | last1=Harding | first2=Kamil | last2=Tchorek | title=Ukraine attacks BBC Panorama documentary as 'provocation' | date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2012: Diamond Jubilee coverage===

The BBC's live television coverage of the [[Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant|Queen's Diamond Jubilee River Thames Pageant]] on 3 June 2012 attracted some criticism in the media, and the corporation reportedly received over 4500 complaints from members of the public about the broadcast.&lt;ref name="guardian-8-jun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=BBC's diamond jubilee coverage draws 4,500 complaints|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/08/bbc-diamond-jubilee-coverage-complaints|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism centred on the "informal" style of presentation which was perceived by some commentators to be too [[Low culture|lowbrow]] for a royal occasion. Some reviewers thought that the BBC presenters had concentrated too much on interviewing [[celebrity|celebrities]] and that they were insufficiently prepared to add depth to the TV commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC receives more than 2,400 complaints about the Jubilee coverage as it tries to shrug off stiff 'Aunty' image but gets it spectacularly wrong|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154927/BBC-receives-2-000-complaints-coverage-Queens-Diamond-Jubilee.html|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=5 June 2012|author=Katherine Faulkner|author2=Inderdeep Bains|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh|first=Kevin|title=Pageant Lament|url=http://storycurve.blogspot.co.uk/|work="Story Curve" blog|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 2012: Lord McAlpine falsely implicated in child abuse scandal===
In the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal, ''Newsnight'' investigated the [[North Wales child abuse scandal]]. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on ''Newsnight'' claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 03 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sawyer |first=Patrick |title=Call for new investigation into north Wales abuse scandal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9652824/BBCs-Newsnight-airs-claims-of-child-abuse-against-leading-Tory-politician.html |accessdate=6 November 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=3 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BxoUn5qU?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9652824/BBCs-Newsnight-airs-claims-of-child-abuse-against-leading-Tory-politician.html |archivedate=6 November 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour was spread by users of [[Twitter]] and other social media which identified the politician.

The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, as soon as he saw a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.

However McAlpine about whom the claims were made, began legal proceedings against the broadcasters who made allegations about him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20269114|title="Mistaken identity" led to top Tory abuse claim |publisher=BBC News |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually settling for £185,000 from the [[BBC]] and £125,000 from [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Swinford|first=Steven|title=Lord McAlpine settles with ITV for £125,000|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9696080/Lord-McAlpine-settles-with-ITV-for-125000.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=22 November 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent libel case, [[Sally Bercow]], wife of [[John Bercow]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], was prosecuted for libel regarding her Twitter posting which named McAlpine.

The decision to broadcast the ''Newsnight'' report without contacting its subject led to further criticism of the BBC, and the resignation of its Director-General, George Entwistle on 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20286198 |title=BBC needs 'radical overhaul', says Lord Patten |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that Entwistle's severance package was in excess of £1.3 million.

=== January 2013: Tweenies Jimmy Savile controversy ===
On 21 January 2013, the BBC News website ran a story that reveled that the BBC had received 216 complaints for their children's channel [[CBeebies]] having shown a repeat of a cancelled children's programme called ''[[Tweenies]]'' the previous day, that showed a character known as "Max" impersonating Jimmy Savile; the character had on a blonde wig (not usually part of "his" wardrobe), and used Savile's accent and catchphrase "Now then, guys and gals". "Max" is an adult character on this show which is set in a day care centre; he looks after pre-school-aged characters. 

Government media regulation body [[Ofcom]] said it had received "tens" of complaints as well.

The BBC responded with the following:

"This morning CBeebies broadcast a repeat of an episode of the Tweenies, originally made in 2001, featuring a character dressed as a DJ impersonating Jimmy Savile. This programme will not be repeated and we are very sorry for any offence caused."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21108337|title=BBC gets 216 Savile spoof complaints|date=2013|work=BBC News|access-date=21 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June 2013: Staff gagging orders ===
In June 2013, it was reported that the BBC had spent a total of £28 million to include 'silencing clauses' in staff contracts, effective during, and following the end of, the contract periods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10128702/BBC-spent-28m-of-licence-fee-payers-money-gagging-500-staff.html Steven Swinford and Neil Midgley, "BBC spent £28m of licence-fee payers' money gagging 500 staff", Daily Telegraph, 18 July 2013].

===July 2013: Executive payoffs===
The large [[severance payment]]s given to departing BBC executives came to widespread media attention in 2013 when the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] conducted an investigation into BBC senior management pay. The practice had been going on for a number of years. Senior executives whose payments were criticised included: chief operating officer [[Caroline Thomson]], who received a total of £680,400 on her departure in 2011; Deputy Director-General [[Mark Byford]] who also left the BBC in 2011, taking £949,000; CEO of [[BBC Worldwide]] [[John Smith (BBC executive)|John Smith]] who was paid a total of £1,031,000 in 2011 (he later returned £205,000); [[George Entwistle]] who left the Director-General job after only 54 days following the Savile crisis, and received a payment of £511,500; and [[Roly Keating]], the head of [[BBC Archives]], who received a £375,000 severance payment in 2012 (which he later repaid in full). [[Margaret Hodge]], chair of the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]], criticised the practice, calling it an "outrageous waste of licence fee payers' money." Following his appointment as Director General, Lord Hall introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC accused of 'corporate fraud and cronyism' over payouts for rule-breaking executives|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/bbc-accused-of-corporate-fraud-and-cronyism-over-payouts-for-rulebreaking-executives-8700962.html|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 July 2013|location=London|first=Adam|last=Sherwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] stated to the PAC that the payments had been fully approved by the BBC Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Thompson insists BBC Trust was informed about head of news Mark Byford's £1m pay-off|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/mark-thomson-insists-bbc-trust-was-informed-about-head-news-mark-byfords-%C2%A31m-pay|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=Press Gazette|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Criticism of the BBC#Scottish independence referendum, 2014}}
Throughout the campaign preceding the [[Scottish independence referendum 2014|Scottish independence referendum]] held on 18 September 2014, there were accusations claiming that the [[BBC]] was neither neutral nor impartial.

On 14 September 2014 thousands of protesters demonstrated outside BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow accusing the corporation and its political editor [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] of broadcasting “lies” and of being “biased” against the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Chris|title=BBC Scotland protests: Scottish independence referendum coverage 'institutionally biased', Salmond claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-scotland-protests-scottish-independence-referendum-coverage-institutionally-biased-salmond-claims-9732095.html|website=The Independent|date=14 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators demanded that Robinson be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Riley-Smith [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11095752/Scottish-independence-Nationalists-demand-Nick-Robinson-sacking-in-vocal-anti-BBC-protest.html "Scottish independence: Nationalists demand Nick Robinson sacking in vocal anti-BBC protest"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 14 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Yes' campaign was not itself involved in the demonstration. The protestors also later complained that coverage about the demonstration was not broadcast by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Frankie Boyle, "Who doesn't want to see Jeremy Corbyn elected?

[[Alex Salmond]], Scotland's First Minister and leader of the [[Scottish National Party]], agreed with the view that the BBC was biased in favour of retaining the union. However, in an interview given after his clash with Robinson, he said he believed it was the fault of the BBC's London-based staff rather than [[BBC Scotland]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/is-the-bbcs-coverage-biased-yes-absolutely-dont-get-me-wrong-i-like-these-f.25322002 "'Is the BBC's coverage biased?

Professor John Robertson and a team at the [[University of the West of Scotland]] monitored news broadcasts of the BBC and ITV until September 2013 for their study ''Fairness in the First Year''. The report found that the BBC was biased against the 'Yes' campaign in matters of airtime, sequencing of news items, prevalence of "bad news" items, and misleading presentation of sources as impartial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/repository/FairnessInTheFirstYear.pdf |title=Fairness in the First Year?

Following a dispute over the name the BBC was using to refer to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], Director-General [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Tony Hall]] told MPs in a letter that the name a group of terrorists had chosen for itself must be used by the BBC because of the latter's duty to remain "impartial", regardless of the fact that the UK was at the time bombing the terrorist group{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}{{clarify|date=January 2016}}:

===January 2016: co-ordinated on-air resignation===
In January 2016, the team behind the BBC's ''Daily Politics'' show co-ordinated the on-air resignation of Labour politician [[Stephen Doughty]] shortly before the start of Prime Minister's Questions. The show's output editor Andrew Alexander wrote a (later deleted) blog post for the BBC website explaining how this had come about. Alexander wrote: "We knew his resignation just before PMQs would be a dramatic moment with big political impact". The timing of the announcement ensured Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] was caught off guard. BBC News political editor [[Laura Kuenssberg]] "sealed the deal" with Doughty before filming, even though it appeared to viewers that the resignation had been unplanned. A camera crew even filmed Doughty and Kuenssberg arriving at the studio together in advance of the announcement, this to televise later on news bulletins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linning |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3389675/BBC-fire-orchestrating-resignation-shadow-minister-live-air-producer-s-blog-deleted-revealed-stage-managed.html |title=BBC under fire for orchestrating resignation of shadow minister live on air after now deleted editor's blog revealed how it was stage-managed |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}}

In July 2017, in response to a demand from the UK government as a condition of its new [[BBC Charter|royal charter]], the BBC published a list of all employees who earned more than £150,000.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPay"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40661179 BBC pay: Male stars earn more than female talent], BBC News (19 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The list included only compensation paid directly from BBC's [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|license fees]]; payments from [[BBC Worldwide]] and payments made through independent production firms were not included.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"&gt;Graham Ruddick, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/19/bbc-pay-key-questions-behind-the-disclosure BBC pay: key questions behind the disclosures], ''The Guardian'' (19 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPay"/&gt;}} Of the 96 BBC employees making over this threshold, 62 were men and 34 were women, and of the seven highest earners, all were men.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos"&gt;Amanda Proença Santos, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/bbc-s-list-top-paid-stars-sparks-controversy-over-pay-n784511 BBC's List of Top-Paid Stars Sparks Controversy Over Pay Gap, Lack of Diversity], NBC News (19 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The disclosure prompted criticism of the BBC over the [[gender pay gap]]; other critics also criticised a lack of ethnic diversity among the highest-earning BBC personalities.&lt;ref name="BBCPay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Clarke, [https://variety.com/2017/tv/global/bbc-reveals-stars-salaries-controversy-pay-gender-women-1202499715/ BBC Reveals Stars' Salaries Amid Controversy Over Pay for Women], ''Variety''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in January 2018, it was announced that [[Carrie Gracie]], the BBC's China editor, had resigned from the role because of the salary gender disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42598775|title=BBC China editor Carrie Gracie quits post in equal pay row|work=BBC News|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pre-broadcast conversation between ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' presenter [[John Humphrys]] and [[Jon Sopel]], the BBC's North America editor, was leaked a few days later. Humphrys was recorded joking about the disparity. BBC management itself was said to be "deeply unimpressed" with Humphrys' comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Batchelor|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/john-humphrys-bbc-pay-gap-carrie-gracie-radio-4-today-jon-sopel-leaked-recording-gender-equality-a8154771.html|title=John Humphrys joked about gender pay gap after BBC China editor Carrie Gracie resigned, leaked tape reveals|work=The Independent|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became known on 26 January that some of the BBC's leading male presenters would take a pay cut. According to the BBC's media editor [[Amol Rajan]], [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]], [[Jeremy Vine]], and John Humphrys were among those to have agreed to a salary reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Some BBC male presenters agree pay cut|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42827333|work= BBC News|date=26 January 2018|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle Dome''''' was a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] American television series that aired from September 1999 to April 2001. It combined elements of ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' – inspired athletic competition with scripted antics more reminiscent of [[professional wrestling]]. Recurring character-athletes known as "Warriors" competed against weekly contestants in a variety of physically demanding (and sometimes dangerous) events.  The series was filmed at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]].

The entire first and second season of ''Battle Dome'' is available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon Video]].

==Overview==
A Warrior typically entered the show's arena accompanied by his own bombastic theme music and-in several cases-a comely female sidekick; in later episodes, weekly contestants were also allotted female companions, courtesy of ''[[Perfect 10 (magazine)|Perfect 10]]'' magazine.

The announcer for the show was [[Steve Albert]] (brother of [[Marv Albert|Marv]] and the uncle of [[Kenny Albert|Kenny]]); [[Scott Ferrall]] provided [[color commentary]]. [[Seth Stockton]] served as referee for the entire run. [[Downtown Julie Brown]] appeared in early episodes, as a sideline correspondent but was replaced by [[Kathleen McClellan]] for the run of the show. The "Chairman", whose [[List of unseen characters|face remained off camera]], oversaw the proceedings. Halfway through the show's run, Ferrall and Brown were replaced by [[Ed Lover]] and [[Brien Blakely]], respectively, and "The chairman" was dropped from the show.

''Battle Dome'' was also broadcast in the UK, on the [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] and [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] networks, as well as on Channel 5, now "Five." It was also broadcast in Ireland on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]].

Three male contestants competed in a series of four or five events, which varied in intensity and danger factor. After the fourth or fifth event, the two highest scoring competitors advanced to the Battle Dome final. In addition to facing the contestants, the Battle Dome Warriors were in a show-long competition against each other for the Battle Dome Warriors Championship belt. The Warriors were ranked before the competition started and could move up or down the list depending on either how well they performed during the show or how well they politicked with the chairman or his on-camera assistant, Bobbie Haven (played by model [[Bobbie Brown]], who prior to this was best known for her appearance in the video for [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]").

If the second and third place players were tied, the tie was broken in a rather novel way. Both players would stand on platforms on two separate metal discs, with the discs being pulled back and rammed together at high rates of speed. The intensity of the hit grew until one player fell off, at which point they would be going home. This also would help determine the Warriors champion if the championship was in question at the end of a show.

After all ties and championships between the Warriors and contestants were settled, the two remaining players moved into the Battle Dome for the final round, in which the two competitors wrestled each other in an attempt to throw the opponent off an elevated platform. Doing so won the match, a cash prize, and a Battle Dome championship ring. The winner would also advance in the Battle Dome tournament, with the winner getting a large cash prize, a motorcycle, and a [[Battle Dome Championship]] belt at the end of the season.

===Second season changes===
*The Battle Dome Warriors Championship and Warrior Championship Belt were removed.
*In addition to the male competitors, season two added a female special where five women competed against each other with the warriors acting as "Coaches".
*The Battle Dome Cage event changed significantly. Wrestling was no longer permitted with the emphasis put much more onto martial arts style fighting, in particular kickboxing. The aim was to remove your opponent from the platform. if both men fell, the battle would restart. this final event had no time limit.
*Most of the Battle Dome Warriors' valets (among those who had them) were replaced by the ''Perfect 10'' models that the contestants were accompanied by. With the exception of T-Money, who kept "The Possee".

===World Championship Wrestling===
In fall of 2000, the stars of ''Battle Dome'' and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) began a brief cross-promotional [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]]. It kicked off when WCW wrestlers disrupted a ''Battle Dome'' taping. In retaliation, on the November 6 edition of ''[[Monday Nitro]]'', [[Terry Crews|T-Money]], Cuda, [[Michael O'Hearn|Mike O'Dell]] (husband of WCW star [[Melinda O'Hearn|Midajah]]), [[Chad Bannon|D.O.A.]], and Bubba King began heckling in the audience as [[Diamond Dallas Page]] spoke to the Chicago crowd. [[Rick Steiner]], [[Ernest Miller]], and [[Buff Bagwell]] came to Page's aid before security ended the physical dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_7/ai_66686873 ``BATTLE DOME'' Warriors Shock ``Monday Nitro''; Live Broadcast Interrupted by Five Warriors Issuing Challenge to WCW] ''Business Wire'' (November 7, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between these men continued as far as November 20,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_21/ai_67223910 ADVISORY/Photo of "Battle Dome" 'Warriors' Bubba King, Cuda, D.O.A. and T-Money is available on BW PhotoWire/AP PhotoExpress, NewsCom, PressLink and Business Wire's Web Site] ''Business Wire'' (November 21, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; mere months before the buyout of WCW by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

==Events==

All events were overseen by Referee [[Seth Stockton]]. His actual level of authority is unclear although he did ban a few warriors from competing for bad behaviour.

'''Battle Wheel'''

Two warriors competed.  The event took place on a large, rotating platform which resembled a right circular [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] with its outside edge and apex flattened.  The contenders had 60 seconds to force both warriors to touch the bottom ring of the wheel with any part of their body. The warriors were allowed to do essentially anything necessary to keep this from occurring. The contenders had to dispatch of the first warrior on the lower portion of the wheel (usually Jake Fury) before taking on the warrior at the top of the wheel (usually Cuda). 25 points were earned for removing the lower warrior from the wheel, and an additional 25 points were earned for getting the 2nd warrior off the wheel.

*Jake Fury suffered a nasty ankle injury on the Battle Wheel towards the end of Season 1. Fury's ankle was "blown out" and facing the incorrect direction. He only competed sparingly on the show afterwards.
*Scott Anthony, a contestant, also had his ankle broken/twisted (similar to Jake Fury's) under virtually the same circumstances in episode four of season 1.
*In Season 2, the Battle Wheel was significantly changed as the Wheel was lowered and wider, making it difficult for a contestant to defeat a warrior and so the ankle blow-out injury never happened again.

'''Take Down'''

A football type event. The contender was placed in the center of an enclosed area with 2 warriors on each end (Michael O'Dell participated in this event most often). Behind each warrior were 4 different lights with actuators beneath them. In the 1st season, a light was lit up behind the warrior (Steve and Scott typically noted that the warriors did not know which light was lit). On the referee's whistle, the contender tried to hit the actuator to turn the light off. Each light turned off was worth 25 points. The contender was only allowed one attempt per light; no "second effort" was allowed. After each attempt, the contender returned to the center and repeated against the other warrior. This would continue for 60 seconds. In the 2nd season, all 8 lights (4 at each end) were lit up. The contender chose which light to go after and the warrior would have to stop them. Otherwise, the rules remained the same from season 1.

'''Rollercage of Fire (1st Season), Rollercage (2nd Season)'''

Contenders were raised up into a revolving [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] cage with holes built into it. In the 1st season, a ring of fire was set outside the cage at each end, mainly to set the atmosphere. The fire ring was removed in season two, as well as the reference to it in the event's title. Contenders had 60 seconds to force the warrior (Almost always T-Money, with 1 or 2 appearances by DOA in the later part of the 1st season) through one of the holes while avoiding the same fate. Forcing the warrior out earned 25 points (later 50). Draws originally scored nothing, but were later increased to a 25-point score.

'''Aerial Kickboxing'''

Contenders and opposing warriors hung from an undulating metal grid roughly 10 feet off the ground. The contender attempted to kick the warrior (most often Bubba King) off the grid within 60 seconds without being removed from the grid themselves. Kicks to the head were technically against the rules and would result in DQ's. At least 1 contender was DQ'd because of head shots. If the contender kicked the warrior off the grid, the contender scored 50 points. Draws scored 25 points. Most contenders were lucky to score short of a DQ of the warrior. Bubba King and Sleepwalker were almost impossible to beat, but O'Dell actually was impossible to defeat, as he never lost a match and rarely surrendered a draw.

*On one occasion, a contestant kicked Bubba King in the head. Bubba was stunned, but he still won.
After the match, the "reporter" had Bubba talk about the match. Bubba was angry, and complained about the contestant breaking the rules (by kicking him in the head), and Bubba said half his body went numb from the head kick.

'''G-Force'''

A central rotating tower had three arms extending from the top of the central tower.  Each of the contenders hung onto a handle at the end of each arm.  A warrior stood on a platform above this tower, throwing balls at the contenders as the tower spun.  The tower's speed increased steadily as the event progressed.  The last contender/s standing earned 25 points, and a bonus 25 points was earned for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Bridge'''

A large bridge spun quickly in mid-air. The contender and the warrior were each given a large padded club to use to knock the other off the bridge as it spun. Contenders scored 50 points for successfully knocking the warrior off the bridge, or 25 points for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Field'''

This event was similar to [[List of American Gladiators events|Powerball]] on [[American Gladiators]]. Unlike Powerball, contenders competed one-on-one against a single warrior, who defended a single scoring bin. The scoring bin was located in the center of the playing field atop an approximately {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pyramid. The warrior wore boxing gloves and could freely attack the contender as much as they wanted to keep them from scoring. Each ball scored was worth 25 points.

'''Battle Hoop'''

Contenders began in the center of a circular field. A large hanging hoop moved around the outside perimeter of the field, with its opening always facing the center of the field. A warrior stood on the outside perimeter of the field to block the contender from jumping through the hoop. Contenders had 60 seconds to try to jump through the hoop as many times as they could, returning to the center after each attempt. Each successful pass through the hoop earned 25 points.

'''Battle Wall'''

Contenders had to get over three walls defended by the Battle Dome warriors. A warrior stood on the opposite side of each wall. Each wall was around 3 feet in height. The walls became narrower as the event went on making it harder to get by the warriors. Each wall that a contender was successful in climbing was worth 25 points.

'''Evader'''

A contender had to light targets while avoiding medicine balls being launched by two warriors. Contenders had 60 seconds to light up all the targets on the two towers (one at a time).  Originally, the warriors only had to hit the contenders 3 times to end the match, but it was later increased to 5 times.  Lighting up all the targets on a tower (this may not have ever been done) was worth 25 points and lighting up all the targets was worth 50.  This event was considered to be Jake Fury's signature event.

'''Anti-Gravity'''

This event, along with Interceptor, was always played last because of the point opportunities. Contenders had to light strips by hitting buttons on a grid while moving along handles placed on the grid. Every strip lit was worth 25 points, for a possible 150. The contenders were also chased by a Battle Dome Warrior, which was almost always The Commander, and could lose the game in one of two ways: either losing their grip, which would result in the contender floating away, or having the Warrior rip their harness off and send them to the floor.

'''Interceptor'''

Called a game of cat and mouse, a contender had to fly around the Interceptor grid lighting targets worth 25 points each until caught by the warrior (again, almost always The Commander) or time ran out. Each target was worth 25 points.  There was a maximum of 175 points available to the contenders.

'''Ultimate Body Slam'''

This was a tiebreaker, usually between the warriors for the right to hold the warrior belt. If the top warrior had been less than stellar and a fellow warrior close in the rankings had performed well, but not well enough to win the belt outright, the two warriors would compete in Ultimate Body Slam. This game was simply a test of endurance; each player stood on a platform behind a metal disk. The disks were then pulled back and slammed into each other at increasing speed until one of the two fell off and lost.

==Warriors==
During the first season, the warriors maintained distinct personalities, similar to [[professional wrestling]] characters. The warriors competed for the Battledome Belt. After each event the warriors were "ranked", according to how well they did in the competition. At the end of that days competition the top ranked warrior received the Battledome Belt. The "ranking" was done by the mysterious chairman. The chairman supposedly owned the Battledome. He was only seen in silhouette wearing a large [[cowboy hat]]. What little else was known about him is that he was supposedly an older man. Karen Ko was supposed to be his [[trophy wife]], and Bobbie Haven his secretary. It was Bobbie he would deliver the messages from The chairman to the other warriors and the fans. At the start of the second season The chairman, standings board and the Battledome Belt were dropped from the competition.

'''First season warriors'''

The original series had 9 warriors. Some competed every week with some making only a few appearances.

* Bubba King ([[Timothy Elwell]])
The "king" of aerial kickboxing. Had very few defeats and proved almost invincible with most challengers lasting a maximum of 30 seconds. Did not play any other event during the shows run.

* The Commander ([[Christian Boeving]])
Speciality event appeared to be Anti-Gravity with Interceptor a close second. One of the smaller warriors proved very speedy and powerful against challengers.

* Cuda ([[Randolph Jones]])
The largest warrior during season 1. Dominated Battle Wheel. Always appeared in the top position on this event. Did make fleeting appearances on other events.

* D.O.A. ([[Chad Bannon]])
Made few appearances in Season one but became much more prolific in Season 2. Speciality event appeared to be Rollercage.

* Jake Fury, ([[Gary Kasper]])
The wild and unpredictable Fury appeared in several games. Particularly able at games G- force and Evader. Suffered a severe ankle injury during season one while participating in Battle Wheel. Thankfully he recovered and did return for season 2.

* Michael O'Dell ([[Michael O'Hearn]])
The poster boy of Battledome. Handsome, toned and tanned. One of the most all round warriors. Played most games with Aerial Kickboxing and Takedown proving specialities.

* Payne ([[John Sperandeo]])
Appeared fleeting during season 1. Mainly as cover for injured warriors.  Entered arena wearing a straitjacket and howling. Difficult to tell what he was good at as he didn't participate in many events.

* Sleepwalker ([[Woon Young Park]])
Another warrior who seemed to be cover for fellow injured warriors. Did participate in Anti-Gravity and aerial kickboxing but suffered a shoulder injury in the event. Seemed very capable in events he participated in.

* T-Money ([[Terry Crews]])
Smug, arrogant and always accompanied by "The Posse". Blinged up with jewellery and a dollar sign chain around his neck. Very good at several games but Rollercage was his speciality. Did not take losing very well!

'''Second season warriors'''

'Returning Warriors:
* Bubba King
* The Commander
* Cuda
* D.O.A.

Did not appear until later in the season then became a regular. Played several games. Takedown and Battle Hoop clearly his best.

* Snake ([[Jesse "Justice" Smith, Jr.]])
An all-rounder who participated in lots of games. No real stand out performances but very capable on events he played in.

'''Beer pong''', also known as '''Beirut''', is a [[drinking game]] in which players throw a [[ping pong]] ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of [[beer]] on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side.&lt;ref name="Shott"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shott |first=Chris |title=The Pong Arm of the Law |work=The Washington City Paper |date=October 7, 2005 |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215656/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last=Banjo|first=Shelly|title=Thwock, Gulp, Kaching!

==Origin and name==
[[File:Throw Pong at Bucknell University.png|thumb|Members of [[Delta Upsilon]] playing Throw Pong at [[Bucknell University]] during the House Party weekend of 1980&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"/&gt;]]
The game was originally believed to have evolved from the original [[Beer pong (paddles)|beer pong played with paddles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D12FB3455127B93C1AB178FD85F468785F9 | work=The New York Times | title=About Beer-Pong | date=1972-04-23 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | first=Ted | last=Lippman }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of [[Dartmouth College]] in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual [[ping pong]] game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names ''Beer Pong'' and ''Beirut'' were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |title=l1 |publisher=Wesleyan.edu |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919095836/http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |archivedate=2006-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |title=" + artTitle.replace("-","") + " - " + "The Heights" + " - " + "Features" + " |publisher=Bcheights.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817094217/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bucknell University]]'s student-run newspaper, ''The Bucknellian'', claims [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity members at Bucknell created "Throw Pong", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucknell celebrates its part in the invention of Beer Pong|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B2ydPXnP9gA0NTRhMTVkMTctMjhlMS00YzZlLTgyYmEtMjU4Yzk1YjcxNjlk&amp;hl=en_US|accessdate=12 September 2011|newspaper=The Bucknellian|date=9 September 2011|author=Michelle Joline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bucknellian.net/10510/arts-campus-life/beer-pong-article/&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Throw Pong" was then brought to [[Lehigh University]] by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian" /&gt;

In some places, ''Beer Pong'' refers to the version of the game with paddles, and ''Beirut'' to the version without. However, according to a [[CollegeHumor]] survey, ''beer pong'' is the more common term than ''Beirut'' for the paddle-less game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |title=Beer Pong vs. Beirut: What is the game called? |work=[[CollegeHumor]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070718001013/http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |archivedate = 2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name "Beirut" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the ''[[Daily Princetonian]],'' the student newspaper at [[Princeton University]], suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. [[Beirut]], the capital of [[Lebanon]], was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire.&lt;ref name="DailyPrincetonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup==
[[File:Beerpong.png|thumb|A standard set up for a game of Beer Pong.]]

===Teams===
Beer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt;

===Playing field===
Although the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a [[plywood]] board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advice on building Beirut Tables |work=Terrapin Tables |url=http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022037/http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430061301/http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=34385 "Table of dreams"], April 18, 2008, ''The Daily Athenaeum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html "The ultimate beer pong table"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201010251/http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html |date=2010-02-01 }}, ''Maxim'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSHxBUrzJqQ "America's Nightly Scoreboard"], [[Fox Business Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game can be played on any flat surface.

===Equipment===
The most common cups used are {{convert|18|USfloz|ml|adj=on }} [[disposable]] [[plastic cup]]s (such as red [[Solo Cup|Solo cups]]) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Games typically use ten cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.
[[File:Red_Plastic_Cups.jpg|thumb|191x191px|Red plastic cups are sometimes associated with drinking games]]

===Alcohol===
An inexpensive [[pale lager]] or [[light beer]] of 3.2–5% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]] is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Westen |first=Brandon |title=College Connoiseur Talks About Beer |work=The Collegian |location=[[South Dakota State University]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202201232/http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at [[Utah State University]], where alcohol is not allowed on campus; [[root beer]] is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story.aspx?content_id=d7521600-7f40-4602-91b2-c1bcac65c86f|title=Students At Utah State Play 'Drinking Game' With Root Beer Instead|publisher=''KUTV-TV''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113215146/http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story/Students-At-Utah-State-Play-Drinking-Game-With/ABZS10B_AkaRssG8rGXIbw.cspx|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.

==Game play==
[[File:beerpong reracks.png|thumb|upright|Possible beer pong re-racks]]

Traditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth "official" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of "house rules" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. "West Coast rules") or may vary on a "house-by-house" basis.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080730002708/http://www.beerpong.com/beerpong_rules.htm Beer pong rules], Beerpong.com&lt;/ref&gt; Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.

The order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525113235/http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archivedate=2008-05-25 |title=Beer Pong Rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for "''re-racking''" (also known as "''reforming''", "''rearranging''", "''consolidation''", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to "re-rack" the cups into a single triangle formation.&lt;ref name="nbpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbpl.net/rulesno.html |title=Rules without paddles |publisher= National Beer Pong League |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong#VD |title=World Series of Beer Pong rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101223141420/http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong| archivedate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.

Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria"&gt;Clay Travis, [https://archive.is/20130119014923/http://www.cbssports.com/spin/story/9981066 "The essence of beer pong bacteria"] ''CBS Sportsline''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria"&gt;Nour Hammour, [http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com "Beer pong bacteria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042131/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''[[GW Hatchet|The GW Hatchet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.

===Shot techniques===
[[File:beerpong shots.png|300px|thumb|The typical path for the different kinds of shots]]

There are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or "laser, snipe, kamikaze"), and the bounce shot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

Some players throw "fastball" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt; A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.

A bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

===Winning the game===
If a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, Matt [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023217/http://media.www.uwmleader.com/media/storage/paper980/news/2006/01/25/Sports/Road-To.Glory-1987477.shtml "Road to Glory"], '''UWM Leader''', Jan. 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.

Another 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a [[shutout]]. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going [[streaking]] (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.

Also depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.

==Health effects==
The game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken]] or even intoxicated enough to suffer [[alcohol poisoning]]. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water "dunk" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria" /&gt;

Some writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to "out of control" college drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granwehr |first=Meredith Austin |title=College Drinking: Out of Control |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=December 1, 2007 |url=http://articles.courant.com/2004-10-10/news/0410100754_1_party-school-emergency-room-bigger-hospital |accessdate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Bob (January 8, 2008).

==Legal restrictions==

Some municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages [[binge drinking]] (see Health Effects above). In [[Oxford, Ohio]], where [[Miami University]] is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strader |first=Sean |title=Council vote freezes beer pong ban |work=The Oxford Press |url=http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218070505/http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archivedate=2009-02-18 |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arlington, Virginia]]&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; and [[Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602123140/http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/05/30/several_campus_bars_punished_for "Several campus bars punished for infractions"], ''The News-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments.

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] ran an article on July 31, 2008 called "The War Against Beer Pong", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong"&gt;Haire, Meaghan.

In many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Tournaments and leagues==
Beer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.

The [[World Series of Beer Pong]] (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hennessey |first= Kathleen |title=Vegas beer pong competition gets (almost) serious | work = USATODAY.COM | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-01-05-beerpong_N.htm | date=January 5, 2009 | accessdate=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/shore/blogs/updates/index.ssf/2009/06/beer_pong_for_money_not_just_g.html "Beer pong for money, not just getting drunk"], June 10, 2009, ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaelson |first=Elex |title=Big Industry Flows From Beer Pong |work=San Diego Channel 6 News |date=November 11, 2008 |url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=387f95e1-101c-4e99-8d56-932dc1fe55b1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218180800/http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=387f95e1-101c-4e99-8d56-932dc1fe55b1 |archivedate=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] with the "[[Isla Vista]] Beer Pong League",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ashley Nikole |title=Students Create I.V.

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Haire, Meaghan. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1830420,00.html?iid=redirect-beerpong "Beer Pong's Big Splash"], ''Time'', August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinevegas.bside.com/2008/films/lastcuproadtotheworldseriesofbeerpong_cinevegas2008 |title=CineVegas description |publisher=Cinevegas.bside.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708101724/http://cinevegas.bside.com/2008/films/lastcuproadtotheworldseriesofbeerpong_cinevegas2008 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary which follows some competitive players as they prepare for the WSOBP II and ultimately compete against one another for the $20,000 grand prize. This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the [[CineVegas]] film festival on June 13, 2008. [[Rick Reilly]] wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for ''ESPN The Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916 |title=Beer Pong: The next great american pastime |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202230908/http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916| archivedate= 2 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080711133153/http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/07/drinking.game.deaths.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview " Drinking games pose serious threat"], ''Associated Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and posted a video on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/video/?bcpid=1214055407&amp;bctid=1717896427 VIDEO], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to [[billiards]] and [[darts]].

The game has been a recurring segment on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as [[Betty White]], [[Serena Williams]], [[Anna Kournikova]], [[Charlize Theron]] and [[Jessica Alba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129051458/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/06/12/betty-white-takes-on-jimmy-fallons-beer-pong-challenge/ "Betty White Takes on Fallon's Beer Pong Challenge"], MTV News&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Colbert Report]]'' featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/220488/march-03-2009/beer-pong-herpes-outbreak |title=Herpes through Beer Pong |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/fox_friends_spreads_herpesbeer.php "Fox &amp; Friends Spreads Herpes-Beer Pong Hoax"], ''Columbia Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Road Trip: Beer Pong]]'', a sequel to the 2000 comedy ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', featured the game prominently. [[Agnes Scott College]], where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105167198 "Lowbrow Comedy Meets Higher Education"], ''National Public Radio''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing===
On August 29, 2009, [[Chronicle Books]] published ''The Book of Beer Pong'', a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Beer Pong |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |isbn=978-0-8118-6632-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bud pong===
Bud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] said involved the drinking of water, not [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing "bud pong" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Gettleman |first=Jeffrey |title=As Young Adults Drink to Win, Marketers Join In |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064233/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |archivedate=February 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' quoted a bartender at a club near [[Clemson University]] as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had "never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong."&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Some expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], said: "Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,"&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; while advertising news site Adjab opined that "someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the [[rolling paper]] he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Adam |title=Beer Pong promotions not so good |work=Ad-Jab |date=October 18, 2005 |url=http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814001648/http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |archivedate=14 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.

===Video games===
[[File:Beer_Pong_Machine.jpg|thumb|219x219px|A beer pong arcade machine.]]
In July 2008, [[JV Games]] Inc. released a downloadable video game for the [[Wii]] console called ''Frat Party Games: Beer Pong''. After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed ''[[Frat Party Games: Pong Toss]]'' and all references to alcohol were removed.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,377421,00.html |title='Beer Pong' Video Game Has Controversy Brewing |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing''' is an [[United States|American]] award for excellence in [[comic book]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger.shtml | title = New Writing Achievement Award to Honor Bill Finger | | publisher = [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] | date = 2005 | archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20050509051331/http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_finger.shtml | archivedate = May 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards committee, chaired by [[Mark Evanier]], is charged each year with selecting two recipients, one living and one deceased. The award, along with the [[Eisner Award|Eisner Awards]], is presented in July of each year at the annual [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. It was established by [[Bill Finger]]'s colleague and fellow writer [[Jerry Robinson]].

Evanier in 2003 said the premise of the award was "to recognize writers for a body of work that has not received its rightful reward and/or recognition. That was what Jerry Robinson intended as his way of remembering his friend, Bill Finger. Bill is still kind of the industry poster boy for writers not receiving proper reward or recognition."&lt;ref name="2013winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/bill-finger-award-recipients-announced |title= Bill Finger Award Recipients Announced|date=May 17, 2013 |publisher=San Diego Comic-Con International|archivedate=March 4, 2016| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090754/http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/bill-finger-award-recipients-announced|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christmas, His Masque,''''' also called '''''Christmas His Show,''''' was a [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era [[masque]], written by [[Ben Jonson]] and performed at the English royal court at Christmas of [[1616 in literature|1616]]. Jonson's masque displays the traditional folklore and iconography of Christmas at an early-modern and pre-commercial stage of its development.

== The masque ==
The masque opens with the entrance of a personified Christmas and his attendants, one of whom leads the way in, beating a drum. Christmas is dressed in a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and hose (color unspecified) and a "high-crowned hat;" he has a "long thin beard" and white shoes. Christmas is soon followed by his ten children, who are led in, on a string, by [[Cupid]] (who is dressed like a London apprentice, with his wings at his shoulders).  The "Sons and Daughters" of Christmas are [[Christmas carol|Carol]], [[Misrule]], Gambol, Offering, [[Wassail]], [[Mumming]], New-Year's-Gift, [[Post and Pair]],&lt;ref&gt;"Post and pair" was a card game.&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Mince pie|Minced-Pie]] and Baby-Cake. Each has his or her own fantastic get-up. Carol, for instance, wears a tawny coat and a red cap, and has a flute in his belt. Mince-Pie is attired "like a fine cook's wife, drest neat," while Gambol is dressed "like a tumbler, with a hoop and bells." Each of the ten is followed by a torchbearer-attendant, carrying marchpanes, cakes, bottles of wine, and other holiday gear. (The specific details of the costumes and furnishings, like "an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it," participate in a dense web of folklore connections. Baby-Cake comes last in the procession of children, for example, because miniature "twelvetide" cakes were associated with [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], the last day of the Christmas holiday season.)

Cupid is soon joined by his mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], who like her son is dressed down in contemporary London garb: the goddess appears as a "deaf tire-woman"&lt;ref&gt;A "tire-woman" was one who attended gentlewomen's elaborate wig-and-hair arrangements, rather comparable to a modern hairdresser.&lt;/ref&gt; who lives in [[Pudding Lane]]. The speeches of Venus and the other characters are rich in contemporary allusions and references; Venus, for example, mentions [[Richard Burbage]] and [[John Heminges]], prominent actors with the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The masque proceeds to singing and dancing, with the stated intent to present "A right Christmas, as of old it was."

==Publication==
''Christmas, His Masque'' was produced too late to be included in the [[Ben Jonson folios|first folio collection of Jonson's works]] in 1616; it was the first masque in the second folio of [[1641 in literature|1641]].  It also exists in manuscripts.

== Critical significance ==
Early commentators tended to dismiss Jonson's masque as a piece of holiday fluff, often noting that the work is less a true masque and more of a [[Mummers play|mummers' show]]. Modern critics have looked beneath its surface to detect serious political, social, and cultural implications. Jonson's text, in promoting a traditional Christmas, was taking a position favored by King [[James I of England|James I]] and opposed to the contemporary culture of the merchants of the [[City of London]] and especially that of the [[Puritan]]s, who were overtly hostile to the traditional holiday. The text of the masque shows an abundant and rather biting satire aimed at the anti-Christmas forces in Jacobean society.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, pp. 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

King James had made an important speech before the [[Star Chamber]] earlier in 1616, in an attempt to promote traditional country life and pastimes, which were plainly in decline in  an era of ever-greater urbanization and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; James would soon issue his proclamation known as the ''[[Book of Sports]]'' (1618), another attempt to support and reinforce the traditional country life in the face of rapid social change.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's masque is one element in this larger cultural debate.

The '''Delaware Children's Theatre''' ('''DCT''') is a community theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], United States.  The theatre company occupies the historic '''New Century Club''' building.

==Theatre company==
Originally named the Children's Repertory Theatre of Wilmington, the organization began in 1973 with their first production of ''[[Pinocchio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dechildrenstheatre.org/aboutdct/history.html|title=History
|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Delaware Children's Theatre|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization relies on volunteers for all acting and nearly all support positions as a community theater.  To cover operating expenses, DCT sells tickets and receives state support through the Delaware Division of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdel.org/grants/grantawards2010.pdf|title=Delaware Division of the Arts Grant Awards: FY2010|last=|first=|year=2010|publisher=Delaware Division of the Arts|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Award]] winner [[John Gallagher, Jr.]] initially played Tom Sawyer as a child actor at the theatre before going on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.delawareonline.com/pulpculture/2009/09/29/leaving-the-nest-for-birdie/|title=Leaving the nest for 'Birdie'

==New Century Club==&lt;!--This section is linked from other articles--&gt;
The Theatre occupies the historic New Century Club building. The organization constructed the building in 1893 and occupied it until 1975. The Delaware Dinner Theatre and Delaware Ballet Company then used the building until 1982 when DCT moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83001336}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form|last=Briggs|first=Robert|date=January 1983|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minerva Parker Nichols]] of Philadelphia, an early female architect, designed the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building with [[Palladian window]]s and a [[gambrel]] roof.  While serving partly as a clubhouse, it also held a theatre which was used for traveling shows as well as civic speakers, including future president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and birth control advocate [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2294&amp;dat=19540124&amp;id=tswmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bgIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1366,563399|title=New Century Club Celebrates Sixty-Fifth Anniversary|last=Ruston|first=Muriel|date=1954-01-24|publisher=Wilmington Sunday Star|accessdate=2010-01-31|at=Section 3, Page 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Duke Nukem Advance''''' is a portable [[video game]] in the ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' series. Although it is a [[first-person shooter]] and many of the graphics and sounds have been ported from  ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', the game has an original storyline and levels.

Four difficulty levels can be selected at the beginning of the game. Multiplayer games are possible, with up to four players requiring a copy. An option to [[Saved game|save]] ones progress appears at the completion of each level, with five save game slots to choose from.

==Storyline==

Duke Nukem, working for General Graves, is asked to investigate Area 51, after reports indicate the hostile infiltration of an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] species. After getting rid of much of the alien threat there, Duke learns about how the aliens require "environmental regulators" to exist, and follows them to the [[Precinct of Amon-Re|Temple of Amun]] in Egypt.

While in Egypt, Duke Nukem discovers a vast collection of alien hybrid creatures in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]], apparently an army meant to take over the world. A nearby power source detected by General Graves seems to supply their environmental regulators, so Duke is sent to shut it down. Subsequently, he learns that activating an override pump will drain the hibernation tanks, killing the entire alien hybrid army.

Nukem also manages to destroy the controller alien overseeing the stasis area, but it turns out that the alien activated a [[self-destruct]] sequence just before his death. Duke manages to narrowly escape the collapsing temple, using one of the alien [[Teleportation|transporter]]s to get away.

Having re-establishing contact with the general, Duke Nukem discovers he has materialized in [[Sydney]], Australia. Graves tells him to find one of the agency's undercover agents, who has sent out a distress call from a nearby [[nightclub]].

After rescuing the agent, Duke locates a [[Doomsday device|doomsday]] weapon being created by the aliens. The controller alien in Egypt had mentioned it to be able to wipe out Earth's [[atmosphere]], so Nukem is quickly sent to destroy the device. Once successful, he transports on board the orbiting alien spaceship.

Once Duke establishes his signal with General Graves, he learns that he must [[Hack (technology slang)|hack]] into the spaceship's system to find a weakness. After transmitting all the data from the ship he can find, Graves tells him they have detected four human females on board which Duke must once again rescue. He finds the first one and teleports her back to Earth, and after analysis, the general learns that she is in fact a [[Cloning|clone]]d version of their undercover agent, Jenny. Duke deducts that the aliens are using the clones to help propagate their species.

By the time Duke has rescued the Jennys one by one, his General friend informs him that he can destroy the ship by shutting down its engine's [[coolant]] system. He does just that, then teleports "Jenny 5" back to Earth. The General's teleportation system is unable to beam out Duke Nukem too, however, requiring him to wade through more alien assailants in order to transport out using their teleporters. The ship subsequently blows up, and Duke Nukem arrives safely back on Earth.

==Controls==
Since the [[Game Boy Advance]] has a limited number of controls, the game offers four different control setups. These set the buttons for shooting, jumping, strafing, weapon selection and looking up and down. When pausing the game, the player can also view the level's map. The player can pan around the map, as well as zoom in or out. Some of the level's secrets can also be discovered simply by looking at the map.

'''Eugen Paul Hadamovsky''' (14 December 1904 &amp;ndash; 1 March 1945) was a politician and [[radio]] production director in [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 to 1942.

==Early years==
Hadamovsky was born and raised in [[Berlin]]; he already joined the paramilitary ''[[Black Reichswehr]]'' forces when still being a secondary school student. When the ''[[Freikorps]]'' units were dissolved in 1921, he began an unstable life working as a locksmith and mechanic at varying places. Back in Berlin from 1928, he was an early [[Nazism|Nazi]] supporter, who helped organize Nazi radio listeners and handled the technical details at many of Hitler's mass rallies. Hadamovsky joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1930; the party's [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] leader [[Joseph Goebbels]] commissioned him to build up the right-wing ''Reichsverband Deutscher Rundfunkteilnehmer'' ("[[German Reich|Reich]] association of German broadcasting participants").

==Hitler's Rise to Power as Career Booster==
Shortly after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933, Hadamovsky served as the National Programming Director for the German ''[[Deutschlandsender]]'' broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/hadamovsky-bio.htm Eugen Hadamovsky. German Propaganda Archive. Calvin College]&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, he was appointed Reich production director and head of the nationalized ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'', whereby he played a vital role in the Nazi ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' of the incorporated regional broadcasters. In 1935 he initiated the launch of the ''[[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow]]'' TV station. Hadamovsky also served as vice-president of the broadcasting department in the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' organization and in a variety of other posts during [[World War II]]. He was head of the radio department in the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] from 1940, however, Minister Goebbels was not entirely pleased with him, as is evident by many references in Goebbels' diaries. In 1942 Hadamovsky was replaced and took over the position as chief of staff in the Nazi Party's Central Propaganda Office (''Reichspropagandaleitung'') in Berlin.

==Author==
Hadamovsky authored seven propaganda books, the most significant of which was "Propaganda and National Power" (1933), the only book treating the general principles of propaganda published during the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uF24AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=eugen+hadamovsky&amp;dq=eugen+hadamovsky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqiNGEkbvQAhXJ54MKHeokAyoQ6AEIIzAB "Propaganda and National Power" on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/hadamovsky.htm "Propaganda and National Power" German Propaganda Archive. Calvin College]&lt;/ref&gt; Other books include "World History on the March", which was published just before the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]], and applauded Nazi Germany in general and the return of the [[Memel Territory]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s last negotiated territorial gain, previously lost to [[Lithuania]] after [[World War I]]. Hadamovsky was also author of ''Blitzmarsch nach Warschau: Frontberichte eines politischen Soldaten'' (Lightning March to Warsaw: Front Reports of a Political Soldier), an eyewitness account of the [[Invasion of Poland]] (1939).

==Military Service and Death==
In 1943, Hadamovsky volunteered for the [[Wehrmacht]] armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhm.de/lemo/biografie/eugen-hadamovsky Eugen Hadamovsky. Deutsches Historisches Museum (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of World War II, he joined the [[4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division]] and died in combat, shot through the heart, in the rank of an ''[[Obersturmführer]]'' (first lieutenant), fighting at the head of his company on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] early in March 1945 at [[Kołtki|Hölkewiese]] near [[Miastko|Rummelsburg]] in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]]. After his death, Goebbels wrote of him as one of the best comrades, an energetic and loyal companion and an old friend.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Goebbels. Tagebücher. Ralph Georg Reuth, editor.

In his astute, academic article on the subject, "Chicano Third Cinema", Flores explains why this is important: "Chicano filmmakers endorsed these revolutionary concepts and dedicated themselves to fight for fundamental changes in the power and organizational structures of the film industry... [but] this political stance and call for autonomy from Hollywood was abandoned as Chicano filmmakers became less concerned with independent filmmaking and focused more on trying to penetrate commercial mainstream venues; in particular, television." &lt;ref&gt;"Towards a Rasquache Cinema: Chicano 3rd Cinema", CineSource Magazine, 4/24/2014 http://cinesourcemagazine.com/index.php?/site/comments/towards_a_rasquache_cinema_chicano_third_cinema_in_the_first_world/#.U4ARRIVl-RA&lt;/ref&gt;

! [[Problems of Form and Content in Revolutionary Cinema]]
| [[Jorge Sanjinés]]
| In this Third Cinema manifesto, Sanjinés challenges Hollywood's [[auteur]] cinema and instead suggests a different style of filmmaking, using a collective protagonist instead of an individual. This new style of Cinema is referred to as a way of spreading revolutionary ideas by giving voice to those who typically are under-represented: "The peasants used the filming to break the silence of oppression and speak openly". A [[Marxist]], Sanjinés repeatedly makes clear the importance of taking this revolutionary stance on cinema.

'''Film title design''' is a term describing the craft and design of [[motion picture]] [[title sequence]]s. Since the beginning of the film form, it has been an essential part of any motion picture. Originally a motionless piece of artwork called ''title art'', it slowly evolved into an artform of its own.

In the beginning, main title design consisted of the movie studio's name and/or logo and the presentation of the main characters along with the actor’s names, generally using that same artwork presented on [[title card]]s. Most independent or major studio had their own title art logo used as the background for their screen credits and they used it almost exclusively on every movie that they produced.

Then, early in the 1930s, the more progressive motion picture studios started to change their approach in presenting their screen credits. The major studios took on the challenge of improving the way they introduced their movies. They made the decision to present a more complete list of credits to go with a higher quality of artwork to be used in their screen credits.

A '''main title designer''' is the designer of the movie title. The manner in which title of a movie is displayed on screen is widely considered an art form. It's often been classified as motion graphics, title [[Graphic design|design]], [[title sequence]]s and animated [[Motion picture credits|credits]]. The title sequence is often presented through [[Animation|animated]] visuals and [[Kinetic art|kinetic]] type while the credits are introduced on screen.

From the mid-1930s through the late-1940s the major film studios led the way in Film Title Art by employing artists like [[Al Hirschfeld]], [[George Petty]], Ted Ireland (Vencentini), William Galraith Crawford, Symeon Shimin, [[Alvan "Hap" Hadley]], and Jacques Kapralik.

Quality artists met this challenge by designing their artwork to "set a mood" and "capture the audience" before the movie started. An overall 10% jump in box-office receipts was proof that this was a profitable improvement to the introduction of their motion pictures.

One famous example of the form is the work of [[Saul Bass]] in the 1950s and 1960s. His modish title sequences for the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] were key in setting the style and mood of the movie even before the action began, and contributed to Hitchcock's "house style" that was a key element in his approach to marketing.  Another well known designer is [[Maurice Binder]], who designed the often erotic titles for many of the [[James Bond films]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.  After his death, [[Daniel Kleinman]] has done several of the titles.

However, the leader in the industry in the 1990s - 2000 was [[Cinema Research Corporation]], with over 400 movie titles to its credit in that time period alone, and almost 700 titles in total from the 1950s to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinema Research Titles (1990s) |url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0058110/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern technology has enabled a much more fantastical way of presenting them through use of programs such as [[Adobe After Effects]] and Maxon [[Cinema4D]]. Although a form of editing, it's considered a different role and art form rather than of a traditional [[film editor]].

[[File:William Hill in Chapel Road - geograph.org.uk - 1719496.jpg|thumb|Poster (on left) advertising fixed-odds betting terminals at a [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] shop in [[Worthing]].]]

A '''fixed odds betting terminal''' (FOBT) is a type of electronic [[slot machine]] normally found in [[betting shop]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and introduced in 2001. The terminals allow players to bet on the outcome of various games and events which have fixed odds, with the theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) being displayed on the machine by law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/Compliance/Sector-specific-compliance/Arcades-and-machines/Gaming-machine-categories/B2-gaming-machines.aspx|&lt;/ref&gt; Like all [[casino]] games, the "house" (i.e. the betting shop) has [[Mathematics of bookmaking|a built-in advantage]]. Typically, slot machine FOBTs have an RTP of 90% to 94% depending on the chosen stake, and standard roulette FOBTs have a long-term average RTP of 97%.

The most commonly played game is [[roulette]]. The minimum amount wagered per spin is [[Pound sterling|£]]1 and the maximum is £100. The largest single payout cannot exceed £500 and this can limit the wager size e.g. the maximum wager on a single number on roulette at odds of 35:1 is £14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There are plans to reduce the maximum outlay to £2 per game because the terminals encourage addictive [[problem gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/maximum-stake-for-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-cut-to-2 Maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals cut to £2] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machines==
FOBTs typically include a [[touchscreen]] and a slot for depositing cash. The major hardware manufacturers for the UK market are [[Scientific Games Corporation]] and Inspired Gaming.&lt;ref&gt;FOI request to Gambling Commission https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/fixed_odds_betting_terminals_2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Slot machine#United Kingdom}}

Under current UK legislation, these machines are allowed to offer content classed as Category B2, Category B3 as well as Category C content. The main article tabulates the legal maximum stakes and payouts.

Shops are allowed up to four terminals, although this number also includes traditional slot machines. Most shops favour the new FOBTs over the traditional slot machines. The [[Gambling Commission]] reports that there were 33,319 FOBTs in Britain's betting offices between October 2011 and September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Gambling industry statistics April 2009 to September 2012 http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/pdf/Industry%20Statistics%20-%20June%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FOBTs have been criticised due to the potential for addiction when playing the machines. They have been dubbed the "[[crack cocaine]]" of gambling by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/just-one-town-stakes-72m-1241638|title=Rochdale stakes £72m on gambling machines |first=Simon| last=Coyle| date=25 January 2013 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Roulette machines: the crack cocaine of gambling}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this criticism, in 2014 bookmakers represented by the [[Association of British Bookmakers]] introduced the facility for customers to set time and money limits when using FOBTs.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26378026&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] began studying the possibility of reducing the £100 maximum bet limit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41811989|title=Bookies brace for possible sales hit| first1=Joshua |last1=Cheetham|first2=Daniele|last2=Palumbo|date=31 October 2017| publisher=| accessdate=1 November 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decision was made in May 2018 to limit the maximum bet to £2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44148285| title=Betting machine stakes cut to £2| date=17 May 2018|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new maximum bet limit will not come into effect until April 2019, with bookmakers stating they are likely to close many shops after its introduction.

====Scotland====
As a result of the Scottish Referendum on Independence on 18 September 2014, The Smith Commission convened, led by Lord Smith of Kelvin KT. On 27 November 2014 the Report of the Smith Commission for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith-commission.scot/smith-commission-report |title=The Smith Commission| website=The Smith Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page 22 under the heading "Betting, Gaming and Lotteries" states "The Scottish Parliament will have the power to prevent the proliferation of Fixed-Odds Betting Terminals". All five main parties (SNP, Greens, Conservative, Labour, Liberal) agreed the terms of the report. Devolution of this power to the Scottish Parliament will be enacted through the UK parliament in due course. Page 11 of the report states: "The UK government has undertaken to produce draft clauses implementing" ... this and ... "will publish these clauses by 25th Jan 2015".

====Northern Ireland====
There are over 900 FOBTs in operation in [[Northern Ireland]], but campaign group [[Fairer Gambling]] argues that they may not be legal under [[Northern Irish law]], as the [[Gambling Act 2005]] only applies in England, Wales and Scotland. In 2015 the [[Department for Social Development]] said that only a judge could rule on their legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/ni-business-news/only-judge-can-decide-on-legality-of-raft-of-ni-betting-machines-1-6594737|title=Only judge can decide on legality of raft of NI betting machines |website=www.newsletter.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
A 2008 betting review in  [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] ruled that the machines should not be introduced in Irish betting shops but would be allowed in [[casino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=9 November 2009
|title=Gambling committee chief opposes betting machines
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Money laundering==
It is claimed FOBTs are used for [[money laundering]] by paying cash into the terminal, making low-risk bets which involve a small relative loss, and withdrawing most of the proceeds as a voucher which is exchanged for cash at the shop counter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 November 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/gambling-machines-drug-money-laundering-bookies The gambling machines helping drug dealers 'turn dirty money clean']&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the UKGC regulators code have sought to eradicate the potential for money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/pdf/Latest-LCCP-and-Extracts/Licence-conditions-and-codes-of-practice.pdf UKGC: Licence conditions and codes of practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frets on Fire''''' ('''''FoF''''') is a [[Freeware|free]], [[Open-source video game|open-source]] [[Finland|Finnish]] [[music video game]] created by [[Unreal Voodoo]]. Players use the keyboard to play along with markers which appear on screen, with the aim to score points, achieve a high point multiplier, and complete a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Development ==
The game is written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language, and is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]], although the game incorporates other [[free and open-source]] code under other [[Software license|licenses]]. The game's included song files and some internal fonts are [[Proprietary software|proprietary]], and their redistribution is not permitted outside of the Frets On Fire executable.&lt;ref name="license"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fretsonfire.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fretsonfire/trunk/copying.txt?view=markup | title = Frets on Fire license | accessdate = 2007-04-20 | work = Frets on Fire Subversion repository | publisher = [[SourceForge.net]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there has not been an updated stable release of the original Frets on Fire since 2010, many former users have begun using Phase Shift, as it supports the use of song files originally created for Frets on Fire and offers more current support.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Clone Hero had also released in 2017, and grew a large fanbase.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Frets on fire man.svg|thumb|left|150px|The "Frets on Fire" mascot "Jurgen". Described by the developers as an "[[Elvis Costello]] look-a-like posing with keyboard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/documentation/modding/graphics/|title=Frets on Fire graphics guide|quote=pose.svg - Elvis Costello look-a-like posing with keyboard.|publisher=sourceforge.net| accessdate = 2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Frets on Fire'' is a music playing video game. It is playable on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux|GNU/Linux]]. The player presses buttons in time to coloured markers, which appear on-screen, the markers are matched with the rhythm of the music. ''Frets on Fire'' can be played by using a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] by pressing the [[fret]] buttons and pick buttons, although there is support for [[joystick]]s, meaning that with the appropriate adapter and/or software, various guitar-type controllers can be used as well.&lt;ref name="joysupport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/about/|title=Frets on Fire "about" page| accessdate = 2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloured square-shaped markers appear on the player's screen, [[synchronization|synchronized]] with the song and are played by holding the fret buttons that correspond with the correct colour and pressing one of the pick button at the correct moment. Every ten correct hits increase the [[score (video games)|score]] multiplier, which multiplies the points for every hit by up to four times. The multiplier is reset when the player misses a note or strums at the wrong time.

==Features==
Frets on Fire includes a built-in song editor (or "fretting" tool) that allows editing and creation of songs.  This allows users to customise their own tracks.  Other programs include ''EOF'' (EditorOnFire), ''dB'' (Feedback), and ''Freetar'' editors. MIDI sequences created in programs such as ''[[FL Studio]]'' and ''[[REAPER]]'' can also be used. The Frets on Fire Wiki has an extensive&lt;ref name="custom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/custom-songs|title=Frets On Fire Wiki: Custom Songs|publisher=wikidot.com|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; resource of custom song frets. There are also many other sites that have been created to provide songs and other resources for the game. Frets on Fire also allows users to import songs from other guitar games.  These include ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]''.&lt;ref name="exportsongs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fretsonfire.wikidot.com/importing-guitar-hero-songs-into-frets-on-fire|title=Frets On Fire Wiki: Importing Guitar Hero songs into Frets on Fire|publisher=wikidot.com|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features a tutorial, which lets users unfamiliar with the gameplay get accustomed to the game. While the game contains a keyboard play mode, USB Joysticks can also be used.  This allows regular joysticks and [[Guitar Hero (series)|guitar controllers]]&lt;ref name="joysupport" /&gt; to be controllers for the game as well, helping to replicate the same feel that commercial guitar games provide.

Since version 1.2.438, the game features ''[[hammer-on]] and [[pull-off]]'' notes, commonly abbreviated to ''HOPO'', although the game refers to them as "tappable notes".  These notes allows the player to press only its fret button to play if the previous note was played correctly, emulating the feature of the Guitar Hero series. [[Software bug|Bugs]] were found in the new gameplay element, and version 1.2.451 fixed them; this version also added an option to disable HOPO notes. Frets On Fire lacks the ability to allow players to use the [[Tremolo arm|whammy bar]], while FoFiX has basic support for modulating the pitch of a track. This is referred to as either "Killswitch" or "Pitchbend." This was added in the 3.100 update for FoFiX.&lt;ref name="whammy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/fofix/issues/detail?id=419 |title=code.google.com :: FoFix code page |date = 2009-01-24|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like console guitar-style games, Frets on Fire comes with ''World Charts'', an official online high score list.  However, since the entire system is open source, players have the ability to host their own server as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=697622|title=Charts Server source code released |publisher=SourceForge.net |accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latest versions of the game (1.2.512 and 1.3.110) are affected by major bugs and it may be hard or impossible to use them; a comfortable solution is to download a previous version, such as [https://sourceforge.net/projects/fretsonfire/files/fretsonfire/1.2.451/ 1.2.451].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fretsonfire.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=7404|title="Read me first" post on FOF forum|accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate versions==
[[File:Fofixmegalight.png|thumb|right|A song being played in Frets on Fire X (using the Megalight Rock Band Style Theme)]]
One popular version of the game is ''Frets on Fire X'' (commonly abbreviated ''FoFiX''), a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] developed from a series of [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]] of version 1.2.451 of Frets on Fire. As well as having support for four players,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccgr.org/reviews-mainmenu-31/13-computer/5016-f|title=Frets on Fire X (FoFiX) - PC|author=ccgr|date=13 February 2009|work=Christian Centered Gamer |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; this fork supports custom graphical themes (which enables users to create a ''Guitar Hero'' or ''[[Rock Band]]'' look-alike), bass and drum tracks and preliminary support for lyrics.  The latest stable version of FoFiX is 3.121 released on December 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/fofix/downloads/list?can=2&amp;q=release:Full |title=Frets on Fire X (FoFiX) |author=various |accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently in development for version 4.000 is the inclusion of Online-Multiplayer, Video Background Support, and support for both Guitar Hero and Rock Band styles of play&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/fofix/issues/list|title=Frets on Fire X (FoFiX) |author=various |accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many others.

==Reception and impact==
Frets on Fire has received generally positive reviews in a variety of publications.  Released for competition at [http://www.assembly.org Assembly], it won first place among its competition.&lt;ref name="demoparty" /&gt;  As a [[free and open source]] game, it has not received as much attention from mainstream review sites, but many niche game sites as well as open source game review sites have discussed it, averaging between 7 and 8 out of 10.  [[GameSpot]]'s user ratings give the game an 8.1 as of November 2008;&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/puzzle/fretsonfire/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsbottomnav&amp;tag=quicklinks;reviews|title=Frets on Fire for PC Reviews |publisher=[[gamespot.com]] |accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sites such as [[Download.com]] average lower, around 3.5/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.download.com/Frets-on-Fire/3000-7551_4-10661367.html |title=Frets on Fire - Free software downloads and reviews - CNET Download.com |publisher=download.com |accessdate=2008-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104123012/http://www.download.com/Frets-on-Fire/3000-7551_4-10661367.html |archivedate=2008-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[cross-platform]] nature of the game, it has garnered fans from both [[Linux]]&lt;ref name="linux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/60024|title=Linux.com :: Review: Frets on Fire |publisher=[[linux.com]]| first = Nathan| last = Williss | date = 2007-02-13 |accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mac&lt;ref name="insidemacgames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=789|title=Inside Mac Games Review: Frets on Fire |publisher=insidemacgames.com| first = Michael| last = Wuerthele| date = 2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaming communities as well. Frets On Fire was included on the television show "[[Click (TV series)|Click]]".

The [[University of Nevada]] developed a modified version of Frets on Fire called Blind Hero&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090706092235/http://eelke.com/research.html Blind Hero] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a [[haptic glove]] to make this game accessible to players who are [[visually impaired]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090906094011/http://eelke.com/blindhero.html blindhero] on eelke.com&lt;/ref&gt; A similar game has been developed as [[Wii homebrew|homebrew]] for the [[Wii]] named Guitars On Fire, which uses Frets on Fire songs, and incorporates the use of the guitar controller. A British developer designed a program based on Frets on Fire called [http://dwsk.co.uk Phase Shift] which offers expanded compatibility for guitar peripherals, and includes capabilities for the use of real guitars as well as keyboards.

Frets on Fire became a very popular [[Freeware]] game; the game was downloaded between 2007 and May 2017 alone over [[Sourceforge.net]] over 14 million times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/fretsonfire/files/stats/timeline?dates=2000-05-12+to+2017-05-18 stats 2000-05-12+to+2017-05-18] on [[sourceforge.net]] (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7468">The '''Haydn Quartet''', later known as the '''Hayden Quartet''', was one of the most popular recording [[close harmony]] quartets in the early twentieth century. It was originally formed in 1896 as the '''Edison Quartet''' to record for [[Edison Records]]; it took its new name when recording for other companies.  The name was a homage to [[Joseph Haydn]], the classical composer; the spelling was later revised to Hayden, which reflects the way it was pronounced.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/6483/  Library of Congress: Haydn Quartet]. Retrieved 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The group disbanded in 1914.

==Formation and membership==
The Edison Quartet formed in 1896, with a membership of [[John Bieling]] ([[tenor]]), Jere Mahoney (tenor), Samuel Holland Rous (who performed under the name [[S. H. Dudley (singer)|S. H. Dudley]], [[baritone]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainspringpress.com/macdonough.html Allan Sutton, ''Harry Macdonough: Victor's Singing Executive]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William F. Hooley]] ([[bass (voice)|bass]]). Mahoney was soon replaced by John Scantlebury Macdonald, who used the [[pseudonym]] [[Harry Macdonough]].&lt;ref name=vhof&gt;[http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/american_quartet.html Vocal Hall of Fame: The American Quartet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017141955/http://www.vocalhalloffame.com/inductees/american_quartet.html |date=2013-10-17 }}. Retrieved 22 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  They recorded as the Edison Quartet (or Edison Male Quartet), before taking the name Haydn Quartet in order to record for companies other than Edison.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;
[[File:Edison Quartet, 1896.jpg|thumb|Founding members of the Edison Quartet, 1896]]
In 1901 they signed a contract with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], and in 1902 also traveled to [[England]] to record for [[the Gramophone Company]], which was Victor's affiliate.&lt;ref name=averill&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4N6Q7dYV2FoC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=haydn+quartet+hayden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3SOfUaThCdH30gXT7oHYBw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=haydn%20quartet%20hayden&amp;f=false  Gage Averill, ''Four Parts, No Waiting : A Social History of American Barbershop Quartet'', Oxford University Press, 2003, pp.72-75]&lt;/ref&gt; The group had great success over the next decade as one of the premier recording groups of the time, on a par with the [[Peerless Quartet]].  The Haydn Quartet often sang material at a slower tempo and in a statelier fashion than other groups.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The Haydn Quartet's biggest commercial successes for Victor included "[[In the Good Old Summer Time]]" (1903), "Bedelia" (1904), "[[Sweet Adeline (song)|Sweet Adeline (You're the Flower of My Heart)]]" (1904), "How'd You Like To Spoon With Me" (with [[Corinne Morgan]], 1906), "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" (with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], 1908), "Sunbonnet Sue" (1908), "Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet" (1909), and "[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (song)|By the Light of the Silv'ry Moon]]" (with Murray, 1910).&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 201–203| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other influential recordings include their 1901 version of "[[My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/MyBonnieLiesOverTheOceanByTheHaydnQuartet1901  My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean by The Haydn Quartet (1901)].

(1906), and "My Wild Irish Rose" (1907).&lt;ref name=averill/&gt; The ensemble also performed [[vaudeville]] and [[minstrel show]] songs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meloware.com/recinfo/haydn.htm Meloware's Antique Phonograph Record Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818034938/http://www.meloware.com/recinfo/haydn.htm |date=2004-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which, "The Camp Meeting Jubilee", released in 1904 as Victor no. 4003, includes a very early recorded use of the phrase "rockin' and rollin'", albeit used with a spiritual rather than secular connotation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F2lKOl2R8FcC&amp;pg=PA1840&amp;lpg=PA1840&amp;dq=haydn+victor+%22camp+meeting+jubilee%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2pYJZvYpUA&amp;sig=LeRKHAftMRePNNl9Kq1EvV3U6Uw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jTSfUeqwEcaH0AXay4CYDg&amp;ved=0CIABEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=haydn%20victor%20%22camp%20meeting%20jubilee%22&amp;f=false Larry Birnbaum, ''Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock 'n' Roll'', Scarecrow Press, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings credited to the Haydn Quartet began to be phased out in 1908.&lt;ref name=averill/&gt;  After that time, Billy Murray frequently sang lead with the group, and S. H. Dudley was often replaced by [[Reinald Werrenrath]].&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt; Following the successful collaborations between Murray and the Haydn Quartet, Victor organized a new group, the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]], in 1910, with Murray, Bieling and Hooley from the Haydn Quartet, and baritone [[Steve Porter (singer)|Steve Porter]].  The group's name was spelled Hayden after 1910. The quartet disbanded in 1914.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  As well as members participating in the American Quartet, Macdonough and Hooley, together with Reinald Werranrath and tenor Lambert Murphy, also formed the Orpheus Quartet, who recorded successfully until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, ''Pop Memories 1890-1954'', p.344&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Pop Memories 1890-1954'', music archivist and statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] assessed a variety of sources such as ''[[Talking Machine World]]'' 's lists of top-selling recordings, and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 's [[sheet music]] and vaudeville charts, to estimate the most successful recordings of the period.  He concluded that the Haydn Quartet had 62 "[[top 40|top ten]]" hits in all between 1898 and 1914, and in the decade 1900-1909 had more successful recordings than any other group, behind only Macdonough and Murray, who recorded as solo artists in addition to their group performances.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  Although Whitburn's methods of assessment have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timbrooks.net/review-whitburn-pop-memories-1987/  Tim Brooks, ''A Discographic Deception: Joel Whitburn’s Pop Memories, 1890‑1954'', review for ''Antique Phonograph Monthly'', 1987]. Retrieved 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; this confirms that the group were one of the most popular of their era.

'''Kirtan''' or '''Kirtana''' ({{lang-sa|कीर्तन}}; {{IAST3|Kīrtana}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "narrating, reciting, telling, describing" of an idea or story.&lt;ref name="Lal2009p423"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda Lal|title=Theatres of India: A Concise Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goELAQAAMAAJ |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-569917-3 |pages=423–424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonell, A. A. (2004). A practical Sanskrit Dictionary. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pages 15, 382-383&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to a genre of religious performance arts, connoting a musical form of narration or shared recitation, particularly of spiritual or religious ideas.&lt;ref name="Lal2009p423"/&gt;

With roots in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] ''anukirtana'' tradition, a ''kirtan'' is a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] style song or [[chant]], set to music, wherein multiple singers recite or describe a legend, or express loving devotion to a deity, or discuss spiritual ideas.&lt;ref name="Lal2009p422"/&gt; It may include dancing or direct expression of ''bhavas'' (emotive states) by the singer.&lt;ref name="Lal2009p422" &gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda Lal|title=Theatres of India: A Concise Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goELAQAAMAAJ |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-569917-3 |pages=422–424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''kirtan'' performances are structured to engage the audience where they either repeat the chant,&lt;ref name="Sara Brown 2012 pages 25-26"&gt;Sara Brown (2012), ''Every Word Is a Song, Every Step Is a Dance'', PhD Thesis, Florida State University (Advisor: Michael Bakan), pages 25-26, 87-88, 277&lt;/ref&gt; or reply to the call of the singer.&lt;ref name="Alanna Kaivalya 2014 3–17, 34–35"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alanna Kaivalya|title=Sacred Sound: Discovering the Myth and Meaning of Mantra and Kirtan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PkhAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=New World|isbn=978-1-60868-244-7|pages=3–17, 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lavezzoli371&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC |year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9 |pages=371–372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sara Black Brown | title=Krishna, Christians, and Colors: The Socially Binding Influence of Kirtan Singing at a Utah Hare Krishna Festival | journal=Ethnomusicology | publisher=University of Illinois Press | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=2014 | pages=454–480 | doi=10.5406/ethnomusicology.58.3.0454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''kirtan'' ({{lang-sa|कीर्तन}}) has Vedic roots and it means "telling, narrating, describing, enumerating, reporting".&lt;ref name="Lal2009p423"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laIPgMQF_XsC&amp;pg=PA69| year=1924| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2000-5 |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is found as ''Anukirtan'' (or ''Anukrti'', ''Anukarana'', literally a "re-telling")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sukumar Chattopadhyay|author2=Kapila Vatsyayan|title=Kalātattvakośa: Appearance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRhQAQAAMAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3286-2 |pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of [[Yajna]], wherein team recitations of dialogue-style and question-answer riddle hymns were part of the ritual or celebratory dramatic performance.&lt;ref name="Lal2009p423"/&gt; The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (~800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.&lt;ref&gt;ML Varadpande (1990), History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, Abhinav, {{ISBN|978-8170172789}}, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of ''kirtan'' is ''kirt'' ({{lang-sa|कीर्त्}}).&lt;ref name="Rigopoulos1993p275"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=The Life And Teachings Of Sai Baba Of Shirdi |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TNohSoS0CzUC&amp;pg=PA275 |year=1993| publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-1267-1 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The root is found in the [[Samhita]]s, the [[Brahmanas]] and other Vedic literature, as well as the [[Vedanga]] and [[Sutra]]s literature. ''Kirt'', according to Monier-Williams contextually means, "to mention, make mention of, tell, name, call, recite, repeat, relate, declare, communicate, commemorate, celebrate, praise, glorify".&lt;ref&gt;Monier William (1899), [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0318.html kīrt], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 2nd Ed., Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirtan were popularized by the [[Bhakti movement]] of medieval era Hinduism, starting with the South Indian Alvars (Vaishnavism) and Nayanars (Shaivism) around the 6th century, which spread in central, northern, western and eastern India particularly after the 12th century, as a social and congregational response to Hindu-Muslim conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L.

''Kirtan'' relates to the bhakti marga tradition of Hinduism. References to ''Kirtan'' as a musical recitation are also found in the [[Bhagavata Purana]], an important Vaishnava text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L.

Kirtan is often practiced as a kind of theatrical folk song with call-and-response chanting or [[antiphon]]. The ancient sage [[Narada]] revered as a musical genius, is called a ''kirtankar'' (singer of kirtan) in the [[Padma Purana]].&lt;ref name=novetzke222&gt;Christian Lee Novetzke (2003), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/375037 Divining an Author: The Idea of Authorship in an Indian Religious Tradition], History of Religions, Vol. 42, No. 3, page 222&lt;/ref&gt; The famous story of [[Prahlada]] in the ''Avatara Katha'' mentions kirtan as one of nine forms of worship, called the ''nava vidha bhakti''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kelkar | first1 = M. | last2 = Mahabal | first2 = K. | title = Keertanrang (Marathi: कीर्तनरंग) | publisher = Akhil Bharatiya Keertan Sanstha | location = Dadar, Mumbai, India | year = 2007 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with ''shravanam'' (listening), ''smaranam'' (remembrance), ''pada sevanam'' (service), ''archanam'' (offering), ''vandanam'' (obeisance), ''dasyam'' (servitude), ''sakhyam'' (friendship) and ''atmanivedanam'' (surrender). The so-called ''Naradiya Kirtan'' divides kirtan into five parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Koparkar | first = G.

===Vaishnavism===
[[File:Chaitanya sankirtan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Some Vaishnavism sub-traditions believe in public ''kirtan'' performance, with songs and dance. A painting of a 19th-century performance by Chaitanya group in [[Bengal]].]]

''Kirtan'' as a genre of religious music has been a major part of the Vaishnavism tradition, particularly starting with the [[Alvars]] of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] sub-tradition between the 7th to 10th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

===Carnatic traditions===
In Andhra Pradesh,the compositions of [[Tallapaka Annamacharya]], a 14th-century mystic, represent the earliest known music called ''sankirtana''. He wrote in praise of [[Lord Venkateswara]], the deity of Seven Hills in [[Tirumala]], where unbroken worship has been offered for over twelve centuries at the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]].

Annamcharya is believed to be the incarnation of Lord Venkateswara's sword.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svasa.org/annamacharya1.html SVSA]-2008/07/21&lt;/ref&gt; During his long and prolific career, he reputedly composed and sang 32,000 Sankirtanas and 12 Shatakas (sets of hundred verses). His works were in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Sanskrit]].

===Bhajan versus Kirtan===

A ''Kirtan'' and a ''[[Bhajan]]'' are closely related, with both sharing common aims, subjects, musical themes and being devotional performance arts. A ''Bhajan'' is more free form, can be singular melody that is performed by a single singer with or without one and more musical instruments. ''Kirtan'', in contrast, differs in being a more structured team performance, typically with a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas, and it includes two or more musical instruments,&lt;ref name="lavezzoli371"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; with roots in the [[Sanskrit prosody|prosody]] principles of the Vedic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alanna Kaivalya|title=Sacred Sound: Discovering the Myth and Meaning of Mantra and Kirtan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PkhAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=New World |isbn=978-1-60868-244-7 |pages=117–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ''Kirtan'' are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn or a devotional theme such as from [[Vaishnavism]], the audience then responds back by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs.&lt;ref name="Alanna Kaivalya 2014 3–17, 34–35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sara Brown 2012 pages 25-26"/&gt;

{{For|giant animals in science and history|Megafauna}}
[[Image:Hydra 04.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. The 16th-century German illustration.]]
A '''giant animal''' in [[mythology]] is unusually large, either for their species or in relation to humans. The term ''giant'' carries some ambiguity, however in mythology definitions of what constitutes 'large' vary, with definitions ranging from 40&amp;nbsp;kg to 250&amp;nbsp;kg. At the upper, they may be further subdivided into small (250–500&amp;nbsp;kg), medium (500–1,000&amp;nbsp;kg) and large (over 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg). Megafauna often form one of the [[mytheme]]s of a story. The narrative may revolve around a real animal or a [[primordialism|primordial]] [[archetype]] of a gigantic [[Animal|creature]], such as a [[dragon]] or the [[Jörmungandr|Midgard snake]].

'''''Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World''''' is a 2005 film starring and directed by [[Albert Brooks]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/movies/sometimes-politics-simply-wont-do.html|title=Sometimes Politics Simply Won't Do|authorlink=A. O. Scott|author=Scott, A. O.|date=January 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown at the [[Dubai International Film Festival]].

==Synopsis==
[[Albert Brooks]], a [[Jewish-American]] [[comedian]], is asked by the [[United States]] government to travel to [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] to find out "what makes [[Muslim]]s laugh."  References are made to Brooks's earlier films, including ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Lost In America]]'' and ''[[Defending Your Life]]'', along with his earlier stand-up comedy material.

Upon reaching India, Brooks begins interviewing [[Indian people|Indians]] and gathering material for the 500-page essay expected of him from the government. He is aided by two agents (who actually help very little) and an Indian woman named Maya ([[Sheetal Sheth]]), who was hired as his assistant.

Brooks' interviews and a failed stand-up performance begin to attract the attention of the Indian government, who fear he is a spy of some sort. Unable to get a visa, Brooks illegally enters Pakistan for four hours to interview several fledgling Pakistani comedians, the Indian government becomes even more paranoid, increasing border control. This action causes alarm to Pakistan, who responds with security measures of their own.

As tension between the countries grows, the American government orders Brooks to leave the country and return to America. It is later said that the tension between Pakistan and India is resolved after they learn that everything was Brooks' fault. It is also revealed that Maya sent what was written of the report to Washington, but it received no recognition.

==Cast==
* [[Albert Brooks]] as Himself
* [[Amy Ryan]] as Emily
* [[Sheetal Sheth]] as Maya
* [[Fred Dalton Thompson]] as Himself
* [[Penny Marshall]] as Herself

==Reception==

According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it received 42% positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looking_for_comedy_in_the_muslim_world/ Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in [[limited release]] (in only 161 theatres).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433116/business Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World (2005) - Box office / business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term 'mean field' is inspired by [[mean field theory]] in physics which considers the behaviour of systems of large numbers of particles where individual particles have negligible impact upon the system.

In continuous time a mean field game is typically composed by a [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] that describes the [[optimal control]] problem of an individual and a [[Fokker–Planck equation]] that describes the dynamics of the aggregate distribution of agents. Under fairly general assumptions it can be proved that a class of mean field games is the limit as &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; of a ''N-player'' [[Nash equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cardaliaguet/MFG20130420.pdf|title=Notes on Mean Field Games|last=Cardaliaguet|first=Pierre|date=September 27, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean-field-type control theory==
A related concept to that of mean-field games is "mean-field-type control". In this case a [[social planner]] controls a distribution of states and chooses a control strategy. The solution to a mean-field-type control problem can typically be expressed as dual Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation coupled with Kolmogorov equation. Mean-field-type game theory is the multi-agent generalization of mean-field-type control.

"'''Mickey'''" is a 1981 song recorded by American singer and choreographer [[Toni Basil]] on her debut album ''[[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|Word of Mouth]]''. Written by [[Mike Chapman]] and [[Nicky Chinn]] as "'''Kitty'''", it was first recorded by UK music group [[Racey]] during 1979 appearing on their debut album ''Smash and Grab''. Toni Basil changed the name from Kitty to Mickey to make the song about a man.

==Release==
Toni Basil's version of the song was initially issued as a single in the UK in May 1981, but did not chart at that time. Reissued in January 1982, "Mickey" quickly became a substantial UK hit, reaching number 2. It was issued in Australia by April, where over the Northern summer (Southern winter) it rose to number 1.

Finally issued in North America in August 1982, "Mickey" became a number 1 hit in the US and Canada in late 1982, a year and a half after its original release.

==Background==
The original Racey song did not include the famous "Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind" chant, which Basil added.

For years, it had been rumored that the name was changed to Mickey because Basil had a crush on [[The Monkees|Monkees]]' drummer and lead vocalist [[Micky Dolenz]] after meeting him on the set of their movie ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'' for which she was the choreographer; however, this claim has been denied by Basil, who said she didn't know Dolenz that well.&lt;ref&gt; name="Vulture"&gt;{{cite web|first= Adrienne |last= Day |url= http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |title= Vulture Investigates: Is Toni Basil's 'Mickey' Really About...Well, You Know? |publisher= [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] |date= 17 August 2012 |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different [[music video]]s for the song were recorded, one featuring Basil with a backing band, and another featuring costuming and choreography inspired by [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] dance routines. Filmed in 1981, the Cheerleader video is considered the very first choreographed dance video, and the opening stunt, where a cheerleader jumps through the center of a human pyramid, is now illegal in competition.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] commented on the obscene content of the lyric "So come on and give it to me / Any way you can / Any way you want to do it / I'll take it like a man". Christgau wrote in a review at the time that Basil "was the only woman ever to offer to [[anal sex|take it up the ass]] on Top 40 radio." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Adrienne |last= Day |title= Vulture Investigates: Is Toni Basil's 'Mickey' Really About...Well, You Know? |website= [[Vulture.com]] |date= August 17, 2012 |accessdate= September 18, 2018 |url= http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180917093627/http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |archivedate= September 17, 2018 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single scored number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for one week and number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was Basil's only Top 40 success.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Huey |title= Toni Basil – Artist Biography |publisher= [[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/toni-basil-mn0000517797/biography |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named #5 on VH1's 100 Greatest [[one-hit wonder|One Hit Wonder]]s of All Time, #16 on ''20 to 1'''s Top 20 One Hit Wonders Countdown and #57 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of the '80s''. It has also appeared on multiple ''greatest'' or ''best'' lists and countdowns.

'''Micro Machines: The Original Scale Miniatures''', also called '''Micro Machines''' or simply '''The Micros''', are a line of toys originally made by [[Galoob]] (now part of [[Hasbro]]) in the mid-1980s and throughout the 1990s. Galoob licensed the idea behind Micro Machines from Clemens V. Hedeen, an American toy inventor from Wisconsin. Micro Machines were tiny scale component style "playsets" and vehicles that were slightly larger than [[N scale]].  Early Micro Machines television commercials were famous for featuring actor [[John Moschitta Jr.]], who was (at the time) listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the world's fastest talker.

==The toys==
[[Image:LaFranceFireEngine.jpg|thumb|right|[[American LaFrance]] ladder truck with movable outriggers, ladder and opening doors]]
Many different styles of Micros were made including all the popular [[automobile|car]]s and [[truck]]s of the times, [[train]]s, [[emergency vehicle]]s, [[tank]]s, [[boat]]s, [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, and [[motorcycle]]s. The Tuff Trax series contained many of the popular TNT Motorsports [[Monster Truck]]s, including the influential [[Grave Digger (truck)|Grave Digger]] truck. [[Star Trek]] and [[Star Wars]] models were also made, as were models from other [[science fiction]] [[Media franchise|franchise]]s including [[Babylon 5]], [[Power Rangers]] and [[Men in Black (series)|MIB]]. They even immortalized [[James Bond]] and [[Indiana Jones]] in micro scale. After the Hasbro buyout, they came out with Winner's Circle [[NASCAR]] and [[G.I. Joe]] themed cars and playsets.

While the Micro Machines collection was known primarily for sizing down automobiles, it also featured several playsets including 1991's fold-out Super Van City.  Licensed character products would often be fold-open heads including miniature characters and vehicles interactive with their playset environment. Micro Machines also utilized several diverse features such as color-changing cars and "Private Eyes" vehicles that even allowed one to peek inside and view an illustration of the contents.

One of the many Micro Machines product lines was the Insiders series. Incredibly popular in the late 80s and early 90s, the Insiders series featured a small vehicle inside the standard size Micro Machine. The body and chassis of the larger vehicle connected via a hinge. Opening the larger revealed the smaller, which was a different model of car.

Micro Machines released a special Presidential Limousine series, which used President [[Harry Truman]]'s 1950 [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] Bubble top limousine. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Lincoln Continental]] or the X-100 convertible limousine, and President [[James Earl Carter]]'s 1977 [[Lincoln Town Car]] was featured in series done in 1989.

For 3 to 4 years Micro Machines was the largest selling toy car line in the US with total dollar sales exceeding the combined sales of the next top selling lines: [[Hot Wheels]], [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and [[Majorette (toy manufacturer)|Majorette]].

Micro Machines had a well-known advertising campaign in the 1980s involving fast-talker [[John Moschitta Jr.]]. The commercials featured pitches in his trademark speedy style and ended with the slogan "If it doesn't say Micro Machines, it's not the real thing!".

In the 1990s, transforming playsets were released. Some could transform from one playset to another, such as a factory to a test track. Others could transform from giant vehicles to playsets, such as a 6x6 to a jungle. Earlier ones included one that could transform from a toolbox to a city. Another innovative release was a line of special boats in the 1990s. While past boats had merely sunk and were not intended for water use, these new sets could actually float.

When sold to Hasbro, the basic line was largely discontinued, and new packaging of the toys didn't catch on as well as hoped, though some imitators continue to be sold in toy stores. In 2006, the brand name was visible only in the detail panel of the Star Wars and Transformers Titanium series die cast vehicles and figures.

==Collectors==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

Interest in collecting Micro Machines has not reached the level of interest in collecting [[Hot Wheels]]. One possible reason is that toys are too new; not enough time has passed for collectors to develop an interest. Another reason is that one had to buy a pack at a time and typically only one would be a new model in any given year. Most sets are worth less than the $5 retail, though some like [[American Civil War|Civil War]] can command over $10, and the ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' set of three are on eBay stores for $50. The rare US version of the action fleet Aliens dropship has been asking over $70. Some rare Star Trek sets and ships are being sold for $100 to $370 online. Some of the hardest to find packages of cars have commanded prices around $100. Those packages often contain prototypes never released to the public. Often large lots can be had for pennies per vehicle.

Micro Machines kept sealed in the package take up a lot of space, so many collectors store them in other containers. Some collectors use one of the original showcases for Micro Machines while other store their collections in fishing tackle boxes.

Some individual cars such as the SVO Mustang have changed hands for over $25 in the early 2000s, though with the appearance of traders who have nearly every vehicle for sale all the time, it is uncommon to see values over $5 for any one vehicle. However, there are some rare models that continue to trade at high values, such as the collector #CE3R Corvette from 1999. Some military vehicles are remarkably valuable models: those made with accurate markings or Soviet equipment such as the T-80BV. Rarer collections such as Star Trek or Star Wars are also valuable. A solid gold Star Trek model that was a grand prize in a drawing sold for over $5,000.

Cars can be identified by the name Galoob on the undercarriage.

==Popular culture==

Micro Machines were featured in the 1990 Christmas movie ''[[Home Alone]]'', starring Macaulay Culkin. In the movie, Culkin's character sets dozens of Micro Machines at the bottom of a flight of stairs as a hazard for a pair of bungling burglars. This trap was also featured in [[Home Alone (video game)|the Sega Genesis game]], though it's referred to generically as "Toys".

==Revivals==
===First revival===
The Micro Machines brand was revived for a few years in response to the popularity of the similar [[Speedeez]] brand. Hasbro also opted to use many fantasy castings in the revival. The revival only lasted a couple years.

The brand 'Micro Machines' has also been incorporated into the packaging of the popular '[[Star Wars: Titanium Series]]' 3-inch vehicle range.

The Micro Mayhem is a stop-motion animation, in which the characters are played by Micro Machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://totalcarmagazine.com/features/2013/05/09/micro_mayhem/ Micro Mayhem: Crazy car chase on the sand table]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second revival===
With the release of the movie ''[[Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'', Hasbro released a new set of themed Micro Machines. This second revival lasted only a year; no more sets were released after [[Rogue One]].

==  History ==
The idea for Micro Machines was conceived by Clemens V. Hedeen, Jr in his toy shop of Fun City USA in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin shortly after they got into the toy business. The inventor talked with someone from Galoob at Toy Fair who said they wanted to develop a new, reasonably priced car line. Work was done with their model maker/designer, to prepare 24 micro cars and packaging.

The first and only company that Clemens sent prototypes to was Galoob. They loved it and wanted to go to contract immediately.  Saul Jodell and David Galoob were the masterminds behind marketing Micro Machines. Their vision at Galoob drove Micro Machines to become best-selling toys.

Micro Machines thrived for years until Hasbro bought Galoob and Micro Machines for their Star Wars line and eventually put the line on the shelf.  Micro Machines have been released periodically since then, but have had limited success since that time.

The inventor, Clemens, and his wife, Kay Hedeen, are still inventing at Fun City Toys in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.

Not to be confused with MotoGP 09(mobile)

'''''MotoGP 09/10''''' is a racing video game, part of the ''[[MotoGP]]'' series. It is available on [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].

==Gameplay==

===Career mode===
''MotoGP 09/10'' features 4 modes with the first of them being Career Mode. Players take control of their career on and off of the track competing in races and hiring engineers, team managers and press officers to help further their career as a pro and ultimately win the MotoGP World Championship. Demonstrating your riding skills on the track through overtaking, slip-streaming and showboating will be rewarded with Rider Reputation points. Pushing too hard can be detrimental as collisions and crashes will reduce the reputation bonus at the end of each race. The more rider reputation points you earn, the more attractive you become to other manufacturers, sponsors, and employees. Your team will also research upgrades for your existing bike to increase its performance. As you start off at the 125cc you can upgrade your team into the Moto2 series and then ultimately into the MotoGP series. Career Mode has a limitless number of years allowing you to continue career mode indefinitely.

===Championship mode===
Players can race in 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP championships from the 2009 and 2010 seasons as it unfolds. The realistic AI will emulate true racing pack with different riding styles and pace making this a challenging mode for all GP fans.

===Arcade===
Players must show off their skill to stay in the race as they compete to finish a whole season in 125, 250 or MotoGP class before running out of time. Each lap, clean section, overtake and top speed reached will reward players with more time but crashing off the track or getting overtaken will cause time to be deducted from the player's total and the chances of living the MotoGP dream will be over.

===Online===
Compete against other riders across the globe, in online multiplayer mode.  There can be up to 20 bikes in a race.

===Soundtrack===
The game has an impressive soundtrack, featuring contemporary break-beat, dub-step and drum-and-bass producers, and also rock artists (provided by Platinum Sound Publishing{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}):&lt;br /&gt;

[[Image:Myfirstsonymic.jpg|thumb|400px|right|My First Sony microphone]]
'''My First Sony''' was a series of smaller-scale electronics made by [[Sony]] in the mid-late 1980s intended for use by children. They were made of brightly colored plastic, usually red, and large colorful buttons with simplified controls. My First Sony products included a [[Walkman]], amplified microphone with [[tape deck]], recording [[tape deck]], [[Boom box]], alarm clock, electronic sketch pad, and headset [[walkie talkie]]s.  New York-based voiceover artist [[Chuck McKibben]] was the network TV spokesman, accompanied by children singing a jingle that went "I like pizza pie, I like macaroni, but what I love is My First Sony!"

In the Spanish translation, the jingle said: "Me gusta cantar, andar en un pony, pero prefiero "Mi primer Sony" (I like to sing, to ride a pony, but I prefer My First Sony"

'''Myrtle Watkins''' (23 June 1908 – 10 November 1968) was an [[United States|America]]n-born [[Mexican people|Mexican]] dancer, [[jazz]] and [[Latin American music]] singer, and actress, who came to be known in the United States and Mexico as '''''Paquita Zarate'''''.

==Early life==

'''Myrtle Watkins''', born, Myrtle Dillard in Birmingham, Alabama in June 1908 as the 5th child of Betty S. and Jasper L. Dillard. A 1910 Alabama Census confirms this information. Her father ran a grocery store (J.L. Dillard's Fish Co) in Birmingham. Myrtle appears in [[Baltimore]] mid-1925, 17 years old as a dancer with her partner Yank Brunson. The Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper described her as a local entertainer. Eventually, in late 1925, she joins Eddie Lemon's Stock Company, appearing at the Regent Theater's revue "Who Dat?". Early 1926, after Eddie Lemon left for Philadelphia, she remained at the Regent as part of the cast of ''Lew Peyton's Brownskin Vamps'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XRomAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v_0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4407%2C3188541|title=Regent|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she appeared in her own solo number dancing the Charleston. During this time, Myrtle met and married local mechanic, Cephus Watkins; however, the marriage ended shortly afterwards. The following month, she was entertaining at the 'all-white' Folly Cabaret&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YhomAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v_0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2820%2C4105440|title=Entertained at Folly|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt; in East Baltimore, her Charleston had caught on immensely with its patrons. Weeks later, she departed for Boston with the ''Rarin' to Go'' revue. In 1928, she toured around the Boston area with the Bostonian Harmony Lads singing light blues, where she wrote in the Afro-American that she missed Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0zQmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z_4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4446%2C4412843|title=Myrtle Watkins Writes|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Arrival in Europe===

During the winter of 1928, she joined the cast of the 2nd version of Lew Leslie's ''Blackbirds'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sampson|first=Henry|title=Blacks in Blackface: A Sourcebook on Early Black Musical Shows|year=2014|publisher=The Scarcrow Press,Inc.|location=United Kingdom|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Boston auditions. She eventually met Eddie Thompson, one of the show's leading dancers and part of the duo Worthy &amp; Thompson. Myrtle and Eddie returned briefly to [[New York (state)|New York]] (Feb.4 1929) to marry, another brief marriage. Blackbirds continued touring the Eastern US until May 31, when the troupe boarded the SS Ile de France for [[France]]. There they played three months the [[Moulin Rouge]], before the French director renovated the Moulin into a cinema. The show opened on June 7 and was a sensation. Some of France's top stars attended, including [[Mistinguett]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. [[Adelaide Hall]] was the star attraction, and replacing Bill ''Bojangles'' Robinson in this version were, John Worthy and Ed Thompson. Blackbirds returned to New York to briefly tour the East Coast again in September, but its return coincided with the famous Wall-Street Crash and there was no work. According to a 1930 New York Census, while living on 7th Avenue with her husband, Myrtle Dillard-Thompson confirms again her parents as being from Alabama.

Myrtle returned to France late April 1930, with Gene Newton's ''Chocolate Revue'' and opened at the Comedy Nightclub. She began working at the famous supper club, Chez Florence with Elisabeth Welch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutton|first=E.P.|title=France|year=2009|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Company, 1945|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; They danced in long orange satin gowns designed by Jean Patou and lifting their skirts to reveal their long legs. The following month, she appeared in the chorus of the Embassy cabaret floor-show ''Hot-Stuff'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shack|first=William|title=Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars|year=2001|publisher=University of California|location=United Kingdom|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was advertised as, ''Harlem aux Champs-Elysees''. Directed by S.H. Dudley Jr., the show included Louis Cole, El Brown, comic Snow Fisher and much of the remaining cast of Blackbirds. The show ran for a successful month. At one point, she was briefly the dance partners with the [[Senegalese]] Folies-Bergere star, [[Feral Benga]]. A while later, she appeared again at the Embassy with the show ''Ebony Follies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shack|first=William|title=Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars|year=2001|publisher=University of California|location=United Kingdom|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1930, Most of the cast at the Embassy had already returned to Harlem, Myrtle left for the Champs-Elysees Nightclub, but eventually soon made her way southwest for [[Spain]].

===Spain (1930-1933)===

Early 1931, Myrtle appeared in [[Madrid]]'s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000962792&amp;page=6&amp;search=Myrtle+Watkins&amp;lang=en|title=Lido|publisher=Heraldo de Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lido Cabaret with Red Hot Coals Jazz Orchestra. She might have been invited by famous Spanish author and lyricist, [[Alvaro Retana]], who was known to introduce black jazz musicians into [[Spain]]. Retana mentioned that Mytle performed semi-nude, imitating the Spanish dancer [[Carmen Tortola Valencia]], under the name ''Perla de Oriente''. In April, the show stopped as the Spanish monarchy came an end. [[King Alfonso XIII]] had abdicated his throne peacefully and boarded a train to Paris for exile, celebrations filled the streets across Spain. Her appearances were a large success and instead of returning to Paris, signed a contract in June for the Ideal-Rosales Cabaret a few blocks away. It can be occasionally difficult to find where she was performing, as her name was constantly misspelled. Appearing with her at the cabaret was Argentine singer-guitarist Alfredo Marino and his partner, Hector Morel. During the summer, the trio packed up for a tour of northern Spain. While in [[San Sebastián]], the director took the cast of the show down to the beach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003443983&amp;page=21&amp;search=Myrtle+Watkins&amp;lang=en|title=Helioterapia|publisher=Estampa Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; where reporters remarked seeing Myrtle as a black Venus emerging from the waters. Upon returning to Madrid, she appeared at the Alcazar-Dancing in a large variety show, with Morel &amp; Morino, occasionally joining Harry Flemming and his band in the Jardin Retiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003443983&amp;page=21&amp;search=Myrtle+Watkins&amp;lang=en|title=Por Si Destine|publisher=Estampa Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later moved onto the Casanova En Stambul and the Teatro-[[Circo Price]]. Late October, she left for [[Barcelona]] to appear at the Eden Concert, Circo Barcelones and Buena Sombra music hall for the winter. While there, she worked closely with the [[Afro-Uruguayan]] singer ''Caruso Negro'' (Oscar Rorra). She also recorded several songs with the Barcelona Compañía del Gramófono.

In the spring of 1932, after a brief appearance in [[Valencia]], she returned to Madrid to join Louis Douglas and his revue at the Lido de Madrid. At the same time, she also appeared with Spanish revue-star Perlita Greco at the [[Teatro Fuencarral]]. The revue was revised and re-opened in the summer with the title ''Modern Melodies'' at the [[Teatro Avenida]] with Myrtle dancing in front of the band in a costume with red feathers swinging on her backside. One visiting journalist for the Afro-American described her as the [[Josephine Baker]] of Spain: "Miss Watkins is a very good dancer, with plenty of pep, and a pretty shapely figure. She is making conquests in high society and on her string is the marquis of one of Spain's bluest blue bloods. She lives at the Hotel Florida, one of the best hotels in the city, has a fine roadster, records for Spanish gramophone and radio, and entertains at one of the leading cabarets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hYk9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2985%2C6544216|title=Louis Douglass Takes Madrid By Storm|author=Ralph Matthews|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, after the revue closed, Myrtle appeared at the Florida Bar in [[Zaragoza]] and the Cine Odeon in [[Huesca]] with Cuban saxophonist, El Negro Aquilino and his troupe. Returning to Madrid in October, Myrtle appeared in a show that might have been filmed, ''Movietone 1933'' with Perlita Greco and Scrappy Jones (from Douglas's revue). Shortly after, Myrtle joined Louis Douglas on a tour of [[Italy]]. Myrtle soon left the tour in March to appear in [[Seville]] , Spain. In June 1933, she was in [[Belgium]] with the bandleader Robert de Kers. While there, she recorded a new song, ''Lonely Brown Rose'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kbr.be/collections/musique/acquisitions/fr142/f2014zzzbb.html|title=Avril-juin 2014|publisher=Bibliographie de Belgique.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on the front of Belgian magazines alongside [[Josephine Baker]]. In September, while in Barcelona, she appeared at the Teatro Romea, ''Jazz-Show'' organized by Italian Impresario Max Guido. The show was a huge success and Myrtle was recognized as Spain's latest vedette. In November, she moved over to the Pompeya Musichall where she danced all evening, and then after midnight would climb downstairs and sing at the Hollywood nightclub which would be broadcast over the radio. In the winter she appeared at the exclusive Casa Llibre Tea Rooms singing for some of Spain's elite. That winter, Myrtle accompanied by pianist Tommy 'Puss' Chase and his band for a tour of the southern coast of France. "Myrtle was a very enterprising, always had some kind of band with her, and was a very good looking and talented singer and dancer." They travelled to [[Cannes]], [[Nice]] and ended in [[Monaco]] during the Rallye Monte Carlo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coda, Volume 9, Issues 1-6|year=1969|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Tour (1934-1936)===

During the spring of 1934, Bricktop postponed the opening of her new club until Myrtle arrived, advertised as The world's most fascinating entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shack|first=William|title=Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars|year=2001|publisher=University of California|location=United Kingdom|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; She brought success and large crowds to Bricktop's-Monico, but decided to move on to the Basque Bar in June with Afro-British entertainer Evelyn Dove. While in Paris, Myrtle arranged to travel to London at the Granada Theatre in an 'all-colored' revue, ''Black Scandals''. On July 2, 1934, the show ran for a successful week. The films shown that week on the manager's weekly report states that both films were rather weak, and had it not been for the stage show, the takings would have been down. The revue was advertised as 'The Greatest Colored stage show in all of Europe.' She returned home to Spain at the end of the month, before continuing her tour that August, in [[The Hague]] dancing at the Palais de Danse cabaret and in [[London]] that October at the Cafe Anglais.

Early 1935, she returned to Paris at the Cuban-themed Melody-Bar with the Afro-American tenor, Opal Cooper. While there, she learned her estranged husband Eddie was ill with stomach cancer and had to halt his career while recovering in hospital. In March, she left for [[Berlin]] to appear in a film before returning in May, appearing at the Boeuf Sur Le Toit with Leon Abbey's orchestra. While touring Belgium again during the late summer, Leon Abbey arranged for Myrtle to appear with his orchestra for six months in [[Bombay]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tajmahalfoxtrot.com/?p=1395|title=Paquita Singh, International Woman of Mystery|publisher=Naresh Fernandes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After boarding a ship in Venice, they arrived in Bombay early October, where it was quickly realized they didn't have the proper work permits. Later joined by Opal Cooper, the group appeared at the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Hotel]] and Green's Ballroom next door with much success. By December, however, Myrtle was laid low by a terrible bout of [[malaria]]. During her stay, she was introduced to a handsome Malaysian cricket player, [[Lall Singh]], who was smitten with this new popular jazz artist in India. By the spring of 1936, Lall took a short break from cricket and returned to Europe with Myrtle, now working as her theatrical agent. Soon after, the couple quickly wed and Myrtle began wearing a sari and practicing [[Hinduism]] alongside her new husband. Around this time, her former husband in Harlem died of Stomach Cancer. During the following months, Myrtle appeared in [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Yugoslavia]] and finally ended the tour in [[Budapest, Hungary]] in a revue at the famous Arizona cabaret.

===Transition into Paquita (1937-1940)===

Unable to return home to Spain, due to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], she instead traveled back to Paris the spring of 1937 in time for the Exposition Internationale, appearing at Le Grand Jeu Cabaret and the George V Restaurant where she held live-radio broadcasts and performed for every visiting dignitary and royalty at the Exposition. She was soon accompanied by Samuel Bonifacio Zarate, a [[Mexicans|Mexican]] violinist popular among French audiences for his virtuoso violin skills. He worked with Carlos Chávez's Sinfónica de Mexico at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]] and graduated from the Mexican National Conservatory, where he was a disciple of Luis G. Saloma. He earned a scholarship from the Mexican government and studied in Paris at the l'Ecole Normale Superieur (1932-1937). Earlier in the spring, he won the first prize at the International Violin Competition. To make ends meet, he entertained whenever possible, often with the Mexican-American Vedette, Reva Reyes. On one occasion, he was hired to entertain royalty at the George V restaurant. There he met Myrtle, who soon took on the name Paquita, and quickly became a musical team. In September, they moved over to the Pavillon-Elysees and spent the winter at the Villa d'Este cabaret. In June 1938, Adelaide Hall left for London, leaving behind her cabaret, the Big Apple Club. Myrtle became the club's main attraction while Bricktop ran the finances of the club. But Bricktop was no good in keeping the accounts straight, her temper was even worse, and soon the cabaret shut down that winter. Before the club fell apart, Myrtle returned to the Villa d'Este in September. In December, she appeared in ''Harlem au Coliseum'' at the Paris-Coliseum alongside other artists, such as her new partner Samuel Zarate and [[Zaidee Jackson]]. She later opened at the new Park-Lane Club with Louis Armstrong &amp; his Cuban American orchestra. During the summer of 1939, while Myrtle and Zarate toured the [[Baltic coast]], where her German films did so well, when the atmosphere suddenly grew dark in Europe. Posters appeared across everywhere "Because of the aggressive attitude of the German government, France and the United Kingdom has declared a general mobilization." In August, she was in [[Poland]] appearing on Radio-Warsaw. A few weeks later, Polish musician, Stanley Laudan invited Myrtle to, La Bagatelle, his club in [[Katowice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laudan|first=Stanley|title=The white batons|year=1957|publisher=A. Wingate, 1957|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, World War II started as Nazi troops quickly seized Poland. As Poland underwent military mobilization to defend itself, she was able to get documents to flee back to Paris. Upon arriving, Lall decided to renew his cricket contract and return to Malaysia and at some point couple probably decided to divorce in November. Soon as danger was at her doorstep again as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940.

===India (1941-1943)===

Danger was again at their doorstep as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940, Paquita and Zarate departed for a Middle Eastern tour, travelling across Egypt and [[Iraq]] during the early years of the war. By the summer of 1941, they made their way into India, with major success in [[Lahore]]'s {{proper name|Stiffle}} Hotel as well as [[Bombay]]'s Taj Mahal and Green's Hotels. This attracted the attention from [[Calcutta]]'s Grand Hotel which housed the popular American jazz musician, Teddy Weatherford, whom she met briefly in 1937 and who had just arrived from [[Ceylon]] and was now the music director of the hotel's ballroom. In November, the Grand Ballroom floor-show featured Myrtle dancing and singing Latin American numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tajmahalfoxtrot.com/?p=1395|title=Paquita Singh, International Woman of Mystery|publisher=Naresh Fernandes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was soon broadcast over Indian radio and Myrtle recorded the numbers from the show with the Indian Columbia records, so the audience could enjoy her performance at home. In January 1942, Japanese troops occupied [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Lall Singh was seized and placed in a work camp with his brother, BS Gill (who eventually died) until the country was liberated in August 1945. Starting in Calcutta, the [[Quit India movement]] swept across the country, with protesters demanding independence from British rule. Myrtle obtained an American passport during the summer with plans of leaving the country before things got too bad. Soon the bliss of India was gone when Japanese planes were bombing Calcutta in early 1943, which was followed with a large famine all across India. Dead animals littered the street, starving children begged for food, half bombed buildings. The Grand Hotel became flooded with soldiers, and her shows were used to boost troop morale.

===Mexico &amp; Return to the United States (1944-1949)===

Decided it might be time to move on, Paquita and Zarate now newly engaged, boarded the USS Hermitage, accompanied with Polish refugees, for [[California]], arriving in San Pedro in during the summer of 1943. California was stirring with chaos as the [[Zoot Suit Riots]] broke out across the West Coast. Arriving in [[Los Angeles]], the couple traveled south to [[Mexico]] to Zarate's hometown, [[El Oro de Hidalgo]] to spend times with his numerous relatives. After a while in Mexico, they returned to Los Angeles, because it offered more opportunities in the entertainment field. ''Paquita'' also began informing everyone that she was an Indian princess of the [[Brahman caste]] sent by her parents to study in Europe, a story probably developed to prevent racial issues she would have faced as an African-American artist. On January 6, 1944, the couple married quietly in [[Seattle]]. 'Zarate &amp; Paquita' took their show across the Western &amp; Southwestern United States, [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]] and Mexico. They played with big names across the US, including [[Liberace]]. They were regular entertainers around [[Reno]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qR1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1687%2C6584350|title=Zarate and Paquita|publisher=The Eugene Register-Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon purchased a home in [[Evanston, Wyoming]] along Interstate-80 near Salt Lake City, with access to Utah, Nevada and California. During the summer of 1947, they performed at the [[Bastille Day]] celebrations in Reno for the French Consul. Their concerts usually began with Zarate playing classical violin and viola numbers in the first half and in the second half when Paquita would join Zarate on drums, dancing in a frenzy dressed in elegant gowns and singing songs from around the world in five different languages. With such a hectic touring schedule, it seems they bothered to take too many breaks. Despite Zarate often returning home to Mexico to visit relatives, it doesn't seem as if Paquita returned to Alabama to see any family; or even visit Detroit to attend her father's funeral in 1946.

===Later Career and Death (1952-1968)===

In 1952, Zarate filed for American neutrality so could establish himself more in the United States. Zarate also took up contracts from numerous recording companies, particularly Northwestern. Zarate and Paquita's records sold well across the Western United States. Later on, Zarate opened his own music recording company, ZARPAC, based in their Los Angeles home, which also contained a recording studio. They recorded more than before, nearly a dozen recordings a year and appeared on American radio and television. They became known in performing foreign songs and also experimented in different genres, such as [[Calypso music|Calypso]], which had become popular during the early-1950s. Sometime around 1953, while performing in [[Chicago]], a strong wind damaged their home in [[Evanston, Wyoming]]. Cancelling their appearance, they traveled to California and bought a house in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]], confining their travels to the West Coast. In 1958, they released a religious album, each song dedicated to different religions across the world such as [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|year=1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OiEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=Zarate+and+Paquita+1958&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qn4OZ1G0nI&amp;sig=Z9TG5GW2UEYsoMbyOzMfw55g83c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5n5qCx_fNAhUJ7CYKHVNtC8YQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Zarate&amp;f=false|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, they performed in a year-long spectacle at the Lamplighter Lounge in [[Corvallis, Oregon]].

By 1957, they began frequently touring the central Oregon coast under contract to one of the largest nightclubs in Portland. The owner of a new motel and lounge complex in [[Depoe Bay, Oregon]] wanted them to entertain there on a part-time basis. On their first visit, Zarate saw a 'For-Sale' sign on two concrete oxen standing outside a small green house called ''Trails End'' on six acres of brushland between Lincoln City and Depoe Bay. He suggested they buy it, but Paquita suggested otherwise, "Yes, here in the middle of nowhere." The sign was still there upon their second visit and Zarate and Paquita bought the property in 1959. They built a new house and had the oxen separated and placed on either end of the driveway that loops off Highway 101. They built a studio, so Zarate could teach violin, guitar, piano, flute and organ - instruments he had mastered over the years. Paquita gave lessons in dance and numerous languages. There was also an adjoining restaurant, The Gingerbread House, providing traditional Mexican and Indian cuisine; children were permitted without charge to encourage more students and guests. A number of students enrolled at the Happy Village Cultural Center.

But the institution wasn't profitable, especially as Paquita became too involved with the children and it hurt her health, which was already debilitated by [[diabetes]] according to Zarate. To continue running things, they made numerous appearances over the years at the popular Amato's Supper Club and at the King Surf Beach Resort's Pagan Hut restaurant. Zarate performed at weddings across Oregon and they both entertained at gatherings hosted by the elite of the west coast. This helped bring money to continue running things back at their small estate. During the spring of 1962, in Wecoma Beach (now Lincoln City) they appeared in an International Music Recital where they presented their varied repertoires of dances and songs in numerous languages and instruments. Their stage appearances became very minimal for many years afterwards, except for the annual appearances in Mexico during the spring and winter. After 1965, they also began appearing annually at the Salishan Bar &amp; Grill. Paquita watched as cars went faster and faster by their home, and it troubled her to think that people were in such a hurry. She wanted to give them a place where they could pull over for a few minutes and "give their souls a chance to catch up with them." Zarate wanted to wait until her health improved, so they could build it together. Myrtle 'Paquita' Zarate died on November 10, 1968 of diabetic complications. Zarate immediately built a small white chapel on the property among the pines he planted in her honor, and hardly left except to visit relatives in Mexico during the winter. The Fine Arts School continued running, but doesn't seem to have drawn many students as they had before her death. Samuel Zarate continued performing across the Oregon and Mexico until his death in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10502">The '''New York City Cabaret Law''' was a [[dancing ban]] originally enacted in 1926, during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of 1926 Cabaret Law As enacted|url=http://zortmusic.com/CabaretLaw/Resources/December%2026%201926%20Cabaret%20Law%20As%20Enacted.pdf|website=Zort Music|publisher=Zort Music|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repealed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Correal|first1=Annie|title=After 91 Years, New York Will Let Its People Boogie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/new-york-cabaret-law-repeal.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to the prohibition of dancing in all [[New York City]] spaces open to the public selling food and/or drink unless they had obtained a cabaret license. It prohibited "musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement" without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/about/cabarets_catering_law_rules.pdf|title=NYC Cabaret Law text|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argued that the license was expensive and difficult to obtain and that enforcement was arbitrary and weaponized against [[marginalized groups]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/nyc-law-prevents-dancing/|title=Historically Racist NYC Law That Prevents Dancing In Bars Is Being Petitioned|last=Pickens|first=Ashley|date=2017-04-03|work=Vibe|access-date=2017-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but proponents insisted that the law minimized noise complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metro.us/new-york/ninety-years-and-counting-for-new-york-city-s-outdated-cabaret-law/zsJpcu---RqCu3QF0D5HQQ/|title=Ninety years and counting for New York City's outdated cabaret law|last=krawitz|first=alan|date=2016-03-22|work=Metro|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Cabaret License is required for any business that sells food and / or beverages to the public and allows patron dancing in a room, place, or space.&lt;ref name="Chevigny"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/description/cabaret-license|title=Cabaret License - NYC Business|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
The New York City Cabaret Law was passed in 1926, during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. An attorney and professor challenging the cabaret law wrote that the law originally targeted [[jazz club]]s in [[Harlem]] and the social mixing of races,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gigs-jazz-and-the-cabaret-laws-in-new-york-city/oclc/809084872&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Gigs: jazz and the cabaret laws in New York City|last=Chevigny|first=Paul|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415648004|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a historian of the period rejects the view and said there is "little evidence" for that to be the case.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=Michael A.|title=Dry Manhattan Prohibition in New York City|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Chapter 6|isbn=9780674030572|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674030572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In proposing the law, the Committee on Local Laws argued that "there has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgement of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check-rein applied a little bit."&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of Bd. of Aldermen Mun. Assembly of City of New York, Recommendation No. 10, Dec. 7, 1926, at 572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/nyregion/cabaret-law-decades-old-faces-repeal.html|title=Cabaret Law, Decades Old, Faces Repeal|date=20 November 2003|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In referring to "running wild," the 1926 Committee may have been alluding to the popular 1920s song "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runnin%27_Wild_(1922_song)|Runnin' Wild]]", which popularized the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] dance.

From 1940 to 1967, the [[New York Police Department]] issued regulations requiring musicians and other employees in cabarets to obtain a [[New York City Cabaret Card]], and musicians such as [[Chet Baker]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Billie Holiday]] had their right to perform suspended.&lt;ref name="Chevigny" /&gt;{{rp|p.57–68}}

In 1971, the Cabaret Law was modified to exempt musical performance "by not more than three persons playing piano, organ, accordion or guitar or any stringed instrument," which disproportionately affected jazz since drums, reeds, and horns were not allowed, as was stated in the ''Chiasson I'' case&lt;ref name="Chiasson 1" /&gt;{{rp|p.643}} and the Chevigny book.&lt;ref name="Chevigny" /&gt;{{rp|p.14}} The so-called three-musician rule was not found in the original 1926 text of the bill.

Throughout its history, the law was selectively enforced with its most notable enforcer, former mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], resurrecting the dormant rule as part of his implementation of [[broken windows theory|broken windows policing]] to fine and shut down perceived nuisance bars in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/features/license.html|title=NEW YORK VOICES: License To Dance {{!}} Thirteen / WNET New York|website=www.thirteen.org|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cabaret licensing ==
All applicants for a cabaret license had to be [[fingerprinting|fingerprinted]]; to provide extensive financial records; to meet specific zoning, surveillance, physical security, fire, building, electrical, health, and record keeping requirements; and to pay the fees associated with each compliance.

In 2016, the [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs]] claimed there were then 118 cabaret licenses in a city of 25,100 licensed food service establishments.&lt;ref name="Muchmore Decision 1" /&gt;

== Criticism and challenges ==
The law was heavily criticized both by the general public and from within city government.

The limits on types of instruments were ruled unconstitutional in ''Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs'', 132 Misc.2d 640 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1986),&lt;ref name="Chiasson 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 132 Misc.2d 640 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1986)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6267750996742241757&amp;q=Chiasson+New+York&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33|website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the three-musician limit was found to be unconstitutional in a later decision in the same case in ''Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs'', 138 Misc.2d 394 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1988).&lt;ref name="Chiasson 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Warren Chiasson v. New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, 138 Misc.2d 394 (N.Y. County Sup. Ct., 1988)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6267750996742241757&amp;q=Chiasson+New+York&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33|website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the code was change to reflect the ruling as to types of instrument, the text to reflect the elimination of he three-musician limit was not corrected in the text of the Administrative Code.

A broader challenge to the Cabaret Law and New York City's Zoning Resolution under the New York State Constitution was rejected in ''John Festa v. New York City Department of Consumer Affair,'' 12 Misc. 3d 466 (Sup. Ct. NY County 2006),&lt;ref name="Festa"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Festa v. New York City Department of Consumer Affair, 12 Misc. 3d 466 (Sup. Ct. NY County 2006)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9600101090696953720&amp;q=festa+new+york+city+consumer+affairs&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33|website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the court urged legislative review of the law and concluded, "Surely, the Big Apple is big enough to find a way to let people dance."

In 2015, [[Brooklyn]] attorney and bar owner Andrew Muchmore filed a still-ongoing case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the law, claiming it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Muchmore Decision 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=MUCHMORE'S CAFE, LLC V. CITY OF NEW YORK, Memorandum and Order, (EDNY 14-cv-05668, Doc. 27, September 29, 2016)|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-nyed-1_14-cv-05668/pdf/USCOURTS-nyed-1_14-cv-05668-0.pdf GPO|location=GPO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/life_is_a_cabaret_old_chum_but_first_you_need_a_license|title=NYC lawyer and bar owner sues over cabaret licensing requirement|work=ABA Journal|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muchmore case challenged the Cabaret Law but not New York City's Zoning Resolution.

==Repeal==
In June 2017, [[New York City Council]]member [[Rafael Espinal]] introduced a bill for the full repeal of the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3086319&amp;GUID=6FDA3305-06B3-47B3-9DF6-21B605C5A8EE&amp;Options=&amp;Search= |title=The New York City Council Int. No. 1652 |last=|first= |date=|website=|archive-url= |archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed 44-1 by the City Council on October 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Action Details Int 1652-2017 |url= http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3086319&amp;GUID=6FDA3305-06B3-47B3-9DF6-21B605C5A8EE&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=cabaret+law |website= Legistar|publisher=New York City Council|date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a venue can still be fined or closed by the city, as the law still requires the venue to be located in a [[zoning|zone]] that allows dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citylimits.org/2017/12/08/nighttime-nyc-laws-repeal-alone-wont-end-citys-dance-drought/|title=Nighttime NYC: Law's Repeal Alone Won't End City's Dance Drought|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Project CARS 2''''' is a [[motorsport]] [[racing simulator]] [[video game]] developed by [[Slightly Mad Studios]] and published and distributed by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]. It was released worldwide on 22 September 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blake |first=Vikki |date=8 June 2017 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/08/project-cars-2-release-date-announced |title=Project Cars 2 Release Date Announced |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Chris |date=21 September 2017 |url=http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/project-cars-2-latest-rumours-release-date-gameplay-trailer-3654448/ |title=Project Cars 2 release date revealed via new gameplay trailer |publisher=[[TechAdvisor]] |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Soon after the success of ''[[Project CARS]]'' after the May 2015 release, funding began to open for ''Project CARS 2'' on 23 June 2015.  World of Mass Development and Slightly Mad Studios opened donations through the "''Project CARS 2'' official forum".  Forum members and visitors choosing to donate had the option to using membership through the forums.  In exchange, donors could gain access to development builds and voicing thoughts, opinions, and suggestions critical to the progress of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=22 June 2015 |url=http://www.wmdportal.com/projectnews/announcing-project-cars-2-sign-up-now/ |title=Announcing Project CARS 2 – Sign Up Now! |publisher=WMD Portal |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2017, Project CARS 2 was officially announced as a game coming late 2017. Slightly Mad Studios soon revealed that the game was going to compose of 182 cars from 38 manufacturers and a variety of car and race car classes, new additions including the [[Honda Civic]], [[Jaguar XJ220]], [[Toyota GT-86]] and [[Nissan R89C]]. The game also has a larger track roster, with 46 tracks (containing 121 layouts), the majority being [[laser scanned]] circuits, and new additions including [[Fuji Speedway]], [[Knockhill]], [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Long Beach]] and the [[Dirtfish]] rallycross track. A new time and weather system have also been included in-game which can allow multiple different changing weather conditions and changes within a given season (winter, spring, summer, autumn). A new game physics engine called LiveTrack 3.0 has also been included, bringing realistic track conditions throughout a race weekend.

Online mode has also been developed with a focus on E-sports, bringing an online ranking system, online championships, and better functionality in matchmaking.

[[File:WRX 2015 France 007.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The game now features off-road driving, including [[rallycross]] tracks and cars, such as the 600hp [[Volkswagen Polo]] RX]]
Through the months leading up to a release, Slightly Mad Studios have worked closely with auto manufacturers, auto industry companies, and race car drivers to help them in making an accurate simulation. As a result, cars have specific performance characteristics and represents its real-life counterpart accurately. The tyre physics have also been built from the ground up, with more advanced tyre movements and actions.

In addition, ''Project CARS 2'' supports [[virtual reality]] (VR), up to 12K resolution, and triple screen support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectcarsgame.com/info.html |title=Info |publisher=Project CARS |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Red Bull]], when asked whether the game will arrive for [[Nintendo Switch]], creative director [[Andy Tudor]] replied that despite being a big fan of Nintendo's platforms, there are no plans to release the game for Nintendo Switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.redbull.com/int-en/project-cars-2-interview-red-bull-games | title=Under the hood of Project CARS 2 | publisher=[[Red Bull]] | first1=Adam | last1=Cook | first2=Jon | last2=Partridge  | date=8 February 2017 | accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There will be new manufacturers in the game, including: [[Porsche]] (they used [[Ruf Automobile|Ruf]] in the first game), [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Honda]], [[Acura]] and [[Nissan]].

They also developed a partnership with [[IndyCar]], which includes all the lineup of the 2016 season, the official logo and the [[Indy 500]].
In 2019, Project Cars 3 has rims, an exhaust, a livery maker and engine swap
after body kits transmissions.

''Project CARS 2'' received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

"''Project Cars 2'' may do a great many things exceptionally well, but it's hard to look past the mountain of gaffes that quickly pile up on and off the track. Racing, after all, is about results, not potential." was Josh Harmon's conclusion on [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] with a score of 6/10.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt;

Matthew Kato from [[Game Informer]] gave the game a score of 7.75/10 saying that "With all its customization options, racing demands, and copious track configurations (140-plus at over 60 locations), ''Project Cars 2'' has a lot to dive into. However, it's more than just a scattershot of content – it's a title that rewards players for exploring all of its nooks and crannies. It could still use a good coat of polish, but it has a charm and daring that is often missing in the sub-genre."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; ''Hobby Consolas'' also praised the breadth of content.&lt;ref name="hcr" /&gt;

Richard Wakeling of [[GameSpot]] awarded it 7/10 stating that "When it all works as intended, ''Project Cars 2'' is a brilliant simulation racer provided you're playing with a wheel. It's ambitious in scope and depth, and the sheer breadth of available motorsports almost guarantees there's something for everyone to sink their teeth into. It's a shame, then, that there's always this nagging feeling in the back of your mind that a bug or moment of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] madness will disrupt the whole thing and more often than not, it will. These issues may be ironed out in the coming weeks and months, but with potentially stiff competition on the very-near horizon, Slightly Mad Studios might not have enough time to capture the hearts and minds of video game racing fans before they move on to pastures new."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Eurogamer also mentioned the bugs.&lt;ref name="eurr" /&gt;

9.2/10 was Luke Reilly's score on [[IGN]] and said "With its refined new handling and piles of race options, ''Project CARS 2'' is about as good as real racing gets right now."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''Edge'' agreed, saying that "no racer offers such a breadth of choice, or seems so willing to let the player set the rules of the road.".&lt;ref name="edgr" /&gt;

''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Phil Iwaniuk scored the game an 89/100 with the consensus "Serious racing for serious racers. Extraordinarily convincing at each of the disciplines on offer."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; [[Evo (magazine)|Evo]] said it had "excellent graphics and thundering, all-encompassing sounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Antony|date=12 August 2017|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/reviews/19803/project-cars-2-preview-hands-on-with-stunning-new-racing-game|title=Project Cars 2 preview - Hands-on with stunning new racing game|publisher=[[Evo (magazine)|Evo]]|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metro summed it up with "It was always crazy for such a small team to create such an ambitious game, but despite a few potholes this succeeds better than it has any right to. It is certainly a better game than the original and while it can’t compete with the mega budgets of ''[[Forza 7|Forza]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' , in terms of the amount of content, and a palpable love of motor racing, this is at least their equal."&lt;ref name="metrr" /&gt; Driving.co.uk said it was "Very tricky to master, which will put off the arcade racer crowd, but impressive attention to detail, realistic handling, speedy, atmospheric menus and a mouth-watering array of cars and tracks continue to make Project Cars one of the best racing games available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dron|first=Will|date=18 September 2017|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/back-track-project-cars-2-game-review/|title=Back on track: Project Cars 2 game review|website=driving.co.uk|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was nominated for "Best Racing Game" and "Best VR Experience" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Racing_Game |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Racing Game |publisher=IGN |date=20 December 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_VR_Experience |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best VR Experience |publisher=IGN |date=20 December 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff==
In February 2018 an investigation by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper found that [[Oxfam]] allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning [[sexual exploitation]], the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A confidential report produced by Oxfam in 2011 found that there had been “a culture of impunity” among some staff in [[Haiti]] and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. According to the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, [[Barbara Stocking|Dame Barbara Stocking]], offered Hauwermeiren “a phased and dignified exit” because of concern that sacking him risked “potentially serious implications” for the charity’s work and reputation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-oxfam-staff-paid-haiti-quake-survivors-for-sex-mhm6mpmgw|title=Minister orders Oxfam to hand over files on Haiti prostitute scandal|last=Chief&amp;nbsp;Reporter|first=Sean O’Neill|date=2018-02-09|work=The Times|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after ''The Times'' published its revelations, it emerged that Oxfam had been aware of allegations that, while serving as director of the organisation's relief operation in [[Chad]] in 2006, Van Hauwermeiren and other staff had repeatedly made use of prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/oxfam-faces-allegations-staff-paid-prostitutes-in-chad|work=[[The Observer]]|title=Oxfam: fresh claims that staff used prostitutes in Chad|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Ben|last2=Quinn|date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43027631|work=BBC News|title=Oxfam: Deputy resigns over sex claims amid crisis talks|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of these revelations, Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that "(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Smout, Alistair. (13 February 2018). "UK's Oxfam hit by new report of sex abuse by aid workers." [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-oxfam/uks-oxfam-hit-by-new-report-of-sex-abuse-by-aid-workers-idUSKBN1FX10V Reuters website] Retrieved 13 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV==
Like many [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, [[HIV]] is a problem in Chad. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHAD – Humanitarian and HIV Overview|url=http://hivinemergencies.org/?page_id=485|website=HIV in Emergencies|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of understanding of the infection,&lt;ref name="irin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex workers ill-informed about HIV|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/89609/chad-sex-workers-ill-informed-about-hiv|website=[[IRIN]]|accessdate=9 March 2018|language=en|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; low usage of [[condom]]s and poor access to healthcare&lt;ref name="unpf"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV AND SRHR LINKAGES INFOGRAPHIC SNAPSHOT CHAD 2016|url=http://wcaro.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/chad.en_.pdf|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; contribute to a HIV prevalence rate of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is likely to be higher in the [[Lake Chad]] area.&lt;ref name="irin" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Chad}}
Chad is a source, transit, and destination country for children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. The country’s trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves children being entrusted to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or moneey. Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to [[child sex trafficking]] or are abused in domestic servitude; child sex trafficking is also a concern among refugees and IDPs in Chad. [[NGO]]s report that the [[Nigeria]]n terrorist groups [[Boko Haram]] and its offshoot Islamic State-West Africa are involved in child trafficking. In the Lake Chad area, since May 2015, attacks by Boko Haram and concurrent government military operations increased the number of IDPs, a population vulnerable to trafficking, to 76,225.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chad 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271163.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=9 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, authorities arrested the police commissioner of the city of [[Kélo, Chad|Kelo]] on suspicion of involvement in child trafficking; however, after initial investigation for kidnapping, officials released the suspect from custody and, while the case remained open, it was unknown whether officials continued to actively investigate the charge. In 2016, the Chadian National Police Child Protective Services (Brigade des Mineurs) continued to investigate child abuse and exploitation, including trafficking. NGOs reported of some local officials’ complicity in trafficking during 2016.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Chad as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]" country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">The '''Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2''', commonly known as the '''Rio Agreement''', is an international treaty that defines standards for [[AM band]] (mediumwave) radio stations in the western hemisphere. Covering North America, South America, and the Caribbean, it was signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on {{date|19 December 1981}}&lt;ref name="twenty-five"&gt;[http://handle.itu.int/11.1004/020.1000/4.103.57.en.100 "Twenty-five Countries Sign Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2"] (pdf), ''Telecommunication Journal'', Vol. 49, no 2 (1982), page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and took effect on {{date|1 July 1983}} at 08:00 [[UTC]].

A major feature of the Agreement was the division of stations into three main classifications: Class A, normally limited to 100 kilowatts (kW) daytime and 50 kW at night; Class B, limited to 50 kW, and Class C, limited to a nighttime power of 1 kW. Individual nations can make further refinements for their particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Regional Administrative MF Broadcasting Conference (Region 2), Rio de Janeiro, 1981 | url = http://www.tzsawyer.com/pdf/rj81.pdf | isbn = 92-61-01311-2 | accessdate = 2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Júpiter y Tetis, por Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Ancient Roman [[sky deity]], and [[Thetis]]]]

In [[comparative mythology]], '''sky father''' is a term for a recurring concept of a [[Sky deity|sky god]] who is addressed as a "father", often the father of a [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The concept of "sky father" may also be taken to include [[solar deity|Sun gods]] with similar characteristics. The concept is complementary to an "[[earth mother]]".

"Sky Father" is a direct translation of the Vedic ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'', etymologically descended from the same [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] deity name as the Greek ''[[Zeus|Zeû Pater]]'' and Roman ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'', all of which are reflexes of the same [[Proto-Indo-European]] deity's name, ''[[Dyeus|*Dyēus Ph₂tḗr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''dyaus'' in Vedic still retained the meaning "sky", while the Greek Zeus had become a proper name exclusively.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are numerous parallels adduced from outside of [[Indo-European mythology]], there are exceptions (e.g. In Egyptian mythology, [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] is the sky mother and [[Geb]] is the earth father).

==In historical mythology==
*In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], [[Anu|An]] or [[Anu]], (AN, 𒀭𒀭{{Script|Xsux|𒀭 }}[[Sumerian language|) Sumerian]] for "heaven, sky", is the father [[deity]] of the [[Sumerian pantheon|Sumerian]] and [[Assyro-Babylonian pantheon]] and is also the earliest attested Sky Father deity.
*[[Indo-European mythology]]
**In the early [[Vedic pantheon]], [[Dyaus Pita]] "Sky Father" appears already in a marginal position, but in comparative mythology is often reconstructed as having stood alongside  [[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]] "Earth Mother" in prehistoric times.
**In [[Ancient Rome]], the sky father, or sky god, was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ([[Zeus]], ''Ζεύς'', in [[Ancient Greece]]), often depicted by birds, usually the [[eagle]] or [[hawk]], and [[clouds]] or other sky phenomena. Nicknames included "Sky God" and "Cloud Gatherer".
**[[Uranus (mythology)]] was the primordial greek god of the sky
*[[Ukko]] in [[Finnish mythology]]
*In [[Māori mythology]], [[Rangi and Papa|Ranginui]] was the sky father. In this story, the sky father and [[earth mother]] Papatūānuku, embraced and had divine children.
*[[Wākea]] is a sky father in [[Hawaiian mythology]].
*In [[Native American mythology]] and [[Native American religion]], the sky father is a common character in [[creation myths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*In [[China]], in [[Daoism]], 天 (''tian''), meaning sky, is associated with light, the positive, male, etc., whereas 地 (''di'') meaning [[earth]] or land, is associated with dark, the negative, female, etc.
**''[[Shangdi]]'' 上帝 ([[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''shàng dì'') (literally "King Above") was a supreme God worshipped in ancient [[China]]. It is also used to refer to the Christian God in the [[Standard Chinese]] Union Version of the [[Bible]].
*''Zhu, Tian Zhu'' 主,天主 (lit. "Lord" or "Lord in Heaven") is translated from the English word, "Lord", which is a formal title of the Christian God in Mainland China's Christian churches.
**''[[Tian]]'' 天 (lit. "sky" or "heaven") is used to refer to the sky as well as a personification of it. Whether it possesses sentience in the embodiment of an omnipotent, omniscient being is a difficult question for linguists and philosophers.
*[[Tengri]] "sky", chief god of the early religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic peoples]].
*In [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Horus]] was ruler of the sky. He was shown as a male humanoid with the head of a [[falcon]]. It is not uncommon for birds to represent the sky in ancient religions, due to their ability to fly. However, in Egyptian mythology the sky was perceived as the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].
*In what is now [[Colombia]], the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] ([[Muisca mythology]]) used to worship [[Bochica]] as the sky father.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Herrmann, Michael Bullock (1954). Conquest by Man. Harper &amp; Brothers. pp. 186. OCLC 41501509.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Taevaisa" (Taevas = sky, isa = father) is the word by which adherents in [[Estonia]] of the  [[Maausk]] (faith of the land) and the [[Taara]] native beliefs refer to God. Although both branches of the original Estonian religion - which are largely just different ways of approaching what is in essence the same thing, to the extent that it remains extant - are pantheistic, heaven has a definite and important place in the ancient pre-Christian Estonian belief system. All things are sacred for those of the faith of the land, but the idea of a sky father - among other "sacrednesses" - is something all Estonians are well aware of. In newer history, after the arrival of Christianity, the ideas of a sky father and "a father who art in heaven" have become somewhat conflated. One way or another, the phrase "taevaisa" remains in common use in Estonia.
*The ''Liber Sancti Iacobi'' by Aymericus Picaudus tells that the [[Basques]] called God ''[[Urtzi|Urcia]]'', a word found in compounds for the names of some week days and meteorological phenomena.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' (1997) [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barandiaran&gt;Jose M. de Barandiaran ''Mitologia Vasca'' (1996) Txertoa {{ISBN|84-7148-117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current usage is ''Jaungoikoa'', that can be interpreted as "the lord of above". The imperfect grammaticality of the word leads some to conjecture that it is a [[folk etymology]] applied to ''jainkoa'', now considered a shorter synonym.

=="Nomadic" hypothesis==
In late-19th-century opinions on [[comparative religion]], in a line of thinking that begins with [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], and which received major literary promotion in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by  [[James G. Frazer]], it was believed that worship of a sky father was characteristic of [[nomad]]ic peoples, and that worship of an earth mother similarly characterised [[agriculture|farming]] peoples.

This view was stylized as reflecting not only a conflict of nomadism vs. agriculturalism but of "[[patriarchy]]" vs. "[[matriarchy]]", and has blossomed into a late ideological in certain currents of [[feminist spirituality]] and [[feminist archaeology]] in the 1970s.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}

== Reception in modern culture ==
The theory about earth goddesses, sky father, and patriarchal invaders was a stirring tale that fired various imaginations.  The story was important in literature, and was referred to in various ways by important poets and novelists, including [[T. S. Eliot]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], and most influentially, [[Robert Graves]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:STRAI350b.jpg|right|285px|thumb|''Straitjacket Press Photograph'', members Ian Todd and Tom Bennett]] --&gt;

'''Straitjacket''' were a [[comedy]] duo from [[North East England]], who wrote original [[sketch show|comedy sketches]]. A lot of their material was transferred to the screen by the original three members: Tom Bennett, Keith Dickinson and Ian Todd. Keith left the group in July 2007, leaving Tom and Ian to continue as a duo until October 8 when they split to pursue solo ventures.

The original three were reunited after a long period apart and decided to do their own brand of comedy with a blend of darkness, randomness and the [[surreal humour|surreal]]. This original blend of comedy helped establish them as regular contributors to [[BBC Radio 1]] show [[The Milk Run]].

They contributed to a sketch show on [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] called 'Dog Face' and produced sketch shows for the screen which were regularly seen in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] area and at comedy festivals across the [[United Kingdom]]. North East music talent also contributed their material to Straitjacket, establishing a unique [[soundtrack]] for the sketch shows.

Straitjacket attracted praise from press both locally and nationally. In 2006 the group was discovered by [[Naomi Odenkirk]] who introduced them to her husband [[Bob Odenkirk]] who championed their comedy in America, entering their work into festivals and screenings. 

Straitjacket had their work screened at the [[Just for laughs|Montreal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival]] in 2007 introduced by Bob Odenkirk and [[David Cross]] and in September 2007 they won [[Channel 4|Channel4’s 4Talent Award]] designed to find the “UK's most exciting young creative talent.”

In 2008, Straitjacket finished developing a TV pilot with [[Bob Odenkirk]], titled ‘Straitjacket: Reel Life.’

Tom Bennett is currently developing sitcoms and recording voiceovers.

'''The Fitzrovia Radio Hour''' are a group of British comedy writer/performers, formed in 2008 and consisting of Jon Edgley Bond, Alix Dunmore, Alex Ratcliffe, Phil Mulryne, Tom Mallaburn and Martin Pengelly.

==Concept==
The Fitzrovia Radio Hour conceive, write and perform theatrical radio plays in the 1940s style. The plays are performed in evening dress, behind period microphones and with sound effects produced live. An hour-long show usually contains three stories – typically in genres such as horror, adventure, science fiction and romance – interspersed with advertisements for products such as whisky, cigarettes and stout. Popular characters include Leinigen, a fearless explorer; Squadron Leader Edward Templar, an intrepid [[RAF]] pilot; Professor Quested, an investigator of the unusual; and Frank Maskill, a Leeds [[lathe]] worker who should have known his place. 

==History==
The Fitzrovia Radio Hour formed in January 2008. The founding members were Jon Edgley Bond, Alix Dunmore, Alex Ratcliffe and Callum Coates. Phil Mulryne and Tom Mallaburn also appeared in the first series of shows. 

The Fitzrovia Radio Hour has featured a number of guest actors, including Fiona Sheehan, [[Laura Carmichael]], Esther Biddle, Nick Atkinson, Asa Joel, Chris Gilling, [[David Oakes]] and [[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5989">[[Image:Montague Brothers.jpg|thumb|right|The Montague Brothers c.1906]]
'''The Montague Brothers''' was a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] act of the early twentieth century made up of the three Woollaston brothers, Edwin John Woollaston (1876-1918), Alfred Montague Woollaston ([[Monte Saldo]]), and Frank Harold Woollaston ([[Frank Saldo]]). In the act the Brothers displayed acts of strength including supporting a heavy motor car complete with passengers and  'The Sculptor's Dream'.

Taking its name from the middle name of the act's founder, Alfred Montague Woollaston ([[Monte Saldo]]), 'The Montague Brothers' grew out of the [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] act 'Ronco &amp; Monte' - both of whom had served apprenticeships with famed strongman and [[bodybuilder]] [[Eugen Sandow]]. On 'Ronco &amp; Monte' breaking up Monte Saldo then teamed up with his younger brother [[Frank Saldo|Frank Woollaston]], and the new strongman act opened at the [[Hippodrome, London|Hippodrome]] in London, followed by a European tour. During the tour the brothers appeared in Amsterdam, Dresden, Hamburg, Saxony, Prague and Paris, at the latter city regularly working out in the gymnasium of [[Edmond Desbonnet]]. On their return they appeared for a season at the [[London Pavilion]].&lt;ref name=Saldo&gt;[http://www.maxalding.co.uk/Tyrrell/monte-trainer/mt01.htm Biography of Saldo on the Max Alding website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Monte Saldo added a new routine to the act which was designed to draw in large audiences, during which he supported a heavy motor car in the "Tomb of Hercules" position. Having prepared and rehearsed carefully, on stage a [[Darracq and Company London|Darracq]] full of passengers was driven up a ramp and onto a bridge, where the ramp and supports were removed leaving Saldo supporting the entire weight of the vehicle and its contents on a section of the bridge. Later, the act was refined, with Saldo supporting the car on top of a ten foot high revolving platform. This act was taken on another international tour, for which Saldo received the largest salary ever paid to a one-man strongman act.&lt;ref name=Saldo/&gt;

==The Sculptor's Dream==
In 1906 Monte Saldo refined the act even further, teaming up again with his brother Frank Woollaston (now known as [[Frank Saldo]]) and older brother Edwin, the three of them billing themselves as "The Montague Brothers", and performing a new routine called "The Sculptor's Dream". 
[[Image:Saldo Sculptors Dream.jpg|thumb|right|A theatrical poster for 'The Sculptor's Dream' (1906)]]
The act was described by Alexander Zass thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... a real strongman, and a clever weightlifter to boot was Monte Saldo, whose stage showmanship was best displayed, perhaps, in a turn which he presented with his brother Frank, entitled "the Sculptor's Dream," certainly of the most artistic and impressive of any ever given. 
&lt;br&gt;
The curtain rose disclosing a sculptor's studio, with the sculptor at work on a reproduction of a well known classical statue. The figure was Monte himself, painted and garbed in an excellent imitation of marble, and behind him was a mirror, in which the statue could be seen reproduced. After working a while, the sculpture wearied, and concealing his masterpiece behind curtains, stretched himself at length upon a couch, soon to be ostensibly asleep. The curtains thereupon parted on their own account, revealing the statue in another classical pose, again reflected in the mirror. Then once more they closed, only to re-open and repeat their re-opening to revelation of ever fresh poses and reflections, until finally the statue and the mirror reflection confront each other in a famous wrestler's attitude. 
&lt;br&gt;
A pause, and then the mirror crashing as the 'reflection' - brother Frank, to be more explicit - leapt out to grapple with Monte, and execute on stage a variety of wrestling postures. This unique opening was followed by a series of equally novel strength feats in which both iron and human weights figured, closured by Monte pressing Frank aloft with one hand, and a twirl round of the supported performer. This twirl, by the way, was very smartly done. As Frank leant back to be supported on Monte's palm, the lifter would interpose a revolving disc on which his brother's back rested. Thus when Frank had been pressed aloft, it enabled Monte to spin him. 
&lt;br&gt;
At this juncture, the sculptor would commence to stir, whereupon both statue and 'reflection' would leap back and, resuming their original poses, thus satisfying the now awakened chiseller of marble that all which had transpired was actually nothing but a dream. 
&lt;br&gt;
Monte Saldo was one of the few men who have enhanced a reputation made on the stage as a strongman by feats performed away from its atmosphere of glamour and make-believe. The first man in the world to 'swing' over his own bodyweight with one hand, and one of the most successful trainers of strong men ever known..."&lt;ref&gt;Zass, Alexander ''The Amazing Samson, As Told by Himself'' London (1926) pp 66-68]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Entr'acte'' said of this new routine, "An absolutely original athletic act is given by the Montague Brothers. Their performance is entitled 'The Sculptor's Dream' and provides the most original setting we have ever seen, being athletic and at the same time effective when it comes to feats of strength pure and simple. Their work is simply amazing."&lt;ref&gt;''The Entr'acte'' 16 March 1906&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptor was played by Edwin John Woollaston, the duo's older brother.

The act broke up in about 1909, with Monte Saldo opening a gym with [[William Bankier]] ('Apollo, the Scottish Hercules'), while Frank Saldo went into physical training and teaching. Older brother Edwin John Woollaston died in 1918.

The group had their roots in videos about the [[massively multiplayer online game]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', but rose to popularity with their playthrough of the [[sandbox game]] ''[[Minecraft]]'' and their self-produced role playing series ''Shadow of Israphel'' set in the same game.&lt;ref name="bbc tycoons"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18768443|title=The TV tycoons you may have missed|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=10 July 2012|website=bbc.com|publisher=[[BBC News]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the revolutionary world of "Minecraft"|url=https://www.salon.com/2011/12/06/inside_the_geeky_revolutionary_world_of_minecraft/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=9 August 2018|author=Spillman, Rob|date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the group are known to play the sandbox game ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and the action free roam game ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', as well as producing their own live action series. They are also known for their annual Christmas live streaming charity drive, currently named the Yogscast Jingle Jam, which has raised more than twelve million dollars for various charities {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.

== History ==
=== Founding and establishment (2008–2011) ===
[[File:YogscastBlizzCon.jpg|300px|right|thumb|(From left to right) Rutherford, Brindley, and Lane pictured at [[BlizzCon]] in 2011.]]
The group was founded in July 2008 by friends Lewis Brindley ("Xephos") and Simon Lane ("Honeydew"), with the creation of their [[YouTube]] channel on 8 July 2008, and their first YouTube video uploaded on 25 July 2008. Brindley and Lane first began by recording [[iTunes]] podcasts and YouTube video guides on ''World of Warcraft'' from their own homes and joined by friends from their guild,&lt;ref name="pcgamer-print"&gt;{{cite journal|title=PC gaming's new video professionals|journal=PC Gamer|date=September 2011|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.influencerupdate.biz/feature/67359/a-brief-history-of-the-rise-of-the-yogscast/ |title=A brief history lesson on the rise of The Yogscast |last1=Partis |first1=Danielle |website=Influencer Update |date=12 July 2018 |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; desiring to share Lane's quirky style of humour with other people around the world.&lt;ref name="techspark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techspark.co/company-profile-yogscast/|title=Company profile: Yogscast|last1=Walcot|first1=Biddy|date=11 June 2014|website=TechSPARK.co|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180612163501/https://techspark.co/company-profile-yogscast/|archivedate=12 June 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of their fledgling channel, "Yogscast", was derived from the title letters of their ''World of Warcraft'' [[guild (computer gaming)|guild]] Ye Olde Goone Squade, which itself originated from the forum community of [[Something Awful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yogscast &amp;#124; FAQ |url=http://yogscast.com/faqs/ |website=Yogscast |accessdate=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, they joined the [[multi-channel network]] TheGameStation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |type=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZy4beCiD8 |title=The YOGSCAST is joining TheGameStation! Also a special video with love from Simon and Lewis |website=YouTube |publisher=The Yogscast |date=31 August 2010 |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |type=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBtse9K_N4k |title=TGS is welcoming YOGSCAST!! - TGS |website=YouTube |publisher=The Games Station |date=31 August 2010 |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sub-network of [[Maker Studios]].

In December 2010, they recorded a ''Minecraft'' video series subsequently named ''Shadow of Israphel'' which amassed a large number of views and subscribers, and catapulted them to popularity.&lt;ref name="bbc tycoons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt; On 3 May 2011, Brindley and Lane officially incorporated the Yogscast as a registered company in [[Reading, Berkshire]].&lt;ref name="Director Brindley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07620479/filing-history/MzAzNjQ1NDg1OWFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0|title=CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF A PRIVATE LIMITED COMPANY|date=3 May 2011|website=companieshouse.gov.uk|publisher=Companies House|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also moved into a house which they also shared with their friend Hannah Rutherford ("Lomadia") in Reading.&lt;ref name="jinglecats2017"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqzYRz3rd2g&amp;t=4m30s |title=JINGLE CATS! - YOGSCAST JINGLE JAM - 1st December 2017 |website=YouTube |type=Video |publisher=The Yogscast |date=2 December 2017 |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also started a secondary channel for showchasing dubbed-over trailers that they called "yogscast2".&lt;ref name=gotgame&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kent |first1=Andrew |title=Interview with Simon and Lewis from the Yogscast |url=https://gotgame.com/2011/05/23/interview-with-simon-and-lewis-from-the-yogscast/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=GotGame |date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, the Yogscast's main YouTube channel "YOGSCAST Lewis &amp; Simon" hit one million subscribers, making them the biggest YouTube channel in the United Kingdom at that time.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt; 

Other members of Ye Olde Goone Squade subsequently joined Brindley and Lane in creating their own content under the Yogscast brand. Rutherford initially ran the Yogscast's secondary channel which later became her own channel to create her own content, while other early associates such as Duncan Jones ("Lalna"), Paul Sykes ("Sjin"), and Chris Lovasz ("Sips") created their own channels to record their own videos, marking the start of the Yogscast family.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt;

=== Early difficulties (2011–2012) ===
The Yogscast team held their own panel at [[MineCon 2011]],&lt;ref name=salon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minecon 2011 Schedule of Events|url=http://www.gameshampoo.com/magazine/news/2011/11/07/minecon-2011-schedule-of-events.html|publisher=GameShampoo Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they showcased some of the work of the ''Minecraft'' community. Following the event, the group came under fire from ''Minecraft'' creator [[Markus Persson]], who stated that he would no longer work with the group, citing use of profanity and unprofessional behaviour.&lt;ref name=story_so_far&gt;{{cite web|title=Minecraft's Notch versus Yogscast: the story so far|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/22/minecrafts-notch-versus-yogscast-the-story-so-far/|author=Henry Winchester|date=22 November 2011|publisher=PC Gamer|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were questioned by some MineCon attendees as well as game commentator [[TotalBiscuit]].&lt;ref name=story_so_far /&gt; The Yogscast responded on [[Reddit]] and via a YouTube video, denying the accusations and expressing their disappointment and frustration with the organisation of MineCon, as well as their respect for Persson and the ''Minecraft'' community at large.&lt;ref name=edge_notch_minecon&gt;{{cite web|title=Yogscast "disappointed" by Notch Minecon claims|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/yogscast-disappointed-notch-minecon-claims|author=Nathan Brown|date=24 November 2011|publisher=Edge Online|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persson later apologised for the misunderstanding and retracted his accusations, attributing the statements to stress and miscommunication. To date, however, the Yogscast have not published further coverage of subsequent MineCons, nor have they ever worked professionally with Persson.&lt;ref name=stress_related_misunderstanding&gt;{{cite web|title=Minecon Yogscast fall out down to "stress related misunderstanding" says Notch|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/24/minecon-yogscast-fall-out-down-to-stress-related-misunderstanding-says-notch/|author=Tom Senior|date=24 November 2011|publisher=PC Gamer|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, indie games developer Winterkewl Games ran a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to develop a video game called ''Yogventures!'' based upon the intellectual property of the Yogscast featuring Brindley's and Lane's in-game avatars. The goal of $250,000 was quickly reached, with a full total of $567,000 eventually being raised by 13,647 donators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yogventures! |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/winterkewlgames/yogventures |website=Kickstarter |publisher=Winterkewl Games LLC |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project stalled after Winterkewl Games ran out of funds, and was eventually cancelled in July 2014.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-17-kickstarter-funded-yogventures-canned-backers-given-steam-key-for-another-game-instead|title=Kickstarter-funded Yogventures canned, backers given Steam key for another game instead|date=17 July 2014|work=Eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backers were compensated with a copy of the game ''TUG'' developed by Nerd Kingdom, who also took hold of all developmental ''Yogventures!'' artwork and source code.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Later in September of that year, backers were also given a copy of the game ''[[Landmark (video game)|Landmark]]'' by [[Sony Online Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-give-yogventures-backers-free-landmark-key/|title=Yogscast give Yogventures backers free Landmark key|last=Sykes|first=Tom|date=7 September 2014|work=PC Gamer|access-date=13 November 2018|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20161221070006/http://www.pcgamer.com:80/yogscast-give-yogventures-backers-free-landmark-key/|archive-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth in popularity (2012–2016) ===
Despite the setbacks, the Yogscast continued to grow rapidly in scale and popularity. In 2012, Brindley and Lane moved their operations out of their bedrooms in Reading and set up their first office at New Bond House in Bond Street, Bristol, dubbing it "YogTowers".&lt;ref name="bbc tycoons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techspark" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=First details announced for Games Festival; museum acquires Yogscast studio|date=28 June 2017|publisher=National Science and Media Museum|url=https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/about-us/press-office/first-details-announced-2017-yorkshire-games-festival-plus-museum-acquires|access-date=28 October 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181028150013/https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/about-us/press-office/first-details-announced-2017-yorkshire-games-festival-plus-museum-acquires|archive-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07620479/filing-history/MzA1ODMxMTcwN2FkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0|title=Change of Particulars for Director|date=29 May 2012|website=companieshouse.gov.uk|publisher=Companies House|access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol was chosen for its infrastructure and transport links to [[London]] and within [[South West England]] for ease of access by the other members of their team.&lt;ref name="techspark" /&gt; Their team continued to expand as other members of the Yogscast also moved in to the office to consolidate their operations in the shared space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |type=Video |title=YogTours - Farewell 1.0 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jA1D3H6khE |last1=Turpin |first1=Mark |website=YouTube |date=27 June 2012 |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-18767512/minecrafty-meet-yogscast-the-uk-s-kings-of-youtube|title=Minecrafty: Meet Yogscast, the UK's Kings of YouTube|date=10 July 2012|work=bbc.com|access-date=9 November 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by July 2012 the Yogscast had more than a dozen members and staff in their office.&lt;ref name="bbc tycoons" /&gt;

In June 2012, the Yogscast's main channel became the first channel in the United Kingdom to reach one billion views,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/11379293/Yogscast-Britains-biggest-gaming-channel.html |title=Inside the Yogscast, Britain's Biggest Gaming Channel |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=16 September 2015 |author=Hoggins, Tom |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.co.uk/article/yogscast-channel-reaches-one-billion-youtube-views |title=Yogscast Channel reaches one billion YouTube views |author=Anna |website=PluggedIn.co.uk |date=20 June 2012 |access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by June 2013, they had acquired five million subscribers.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt; A variety of new friends and content creators such as Martyn Littlewood ("InTheLittleWood") and [[Hat Films]] also joined, marking the expansion of the Yogscast line-up beyond the original ''World of Warcraft'' group.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt;

The Yogscast also began to hold regular public appearances in exhibitions and events throughout the United Kingdom where they would perform live shows and organise signings at events like the Insomnia Gaming Festival and the London Comic Con.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt; In 2014, Brindley was named by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' as one of Britain's 500 most influential people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain’s 500 most influential |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britains-500-most-influential-rj7xx6m7xdr |access-date=20 October 2018 |work=The Sunday Times |date=26 January 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20170809073131/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britains-500-most-influential-rj7xx6m7xdr |archive-date=9 August 2017 |language=en |dead-url=no |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further expansion and diversification (2016–present) ===
Citing professional difficulties, the Yogscast left [[Maker Studios]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |type=Video |title=Ripping our Decks Off - Bored Meeting - 3rd March 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFULZp2-W8Y&amp;t=3h16m40s |last1=Turpin |first1=Mark |last2=Brindley |first2=Lewis |website=YouTube |publisher=The Yogscast |at=3 hours 16 minutes 40 seconds |date=4 March 2016 |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up their own [[multi-channel network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/4d7bk8/theyve_officially_left_maker_say_hello_to_yogcast/ |title=They've Officially Left Maker, Say Hello To YogCast MCN (Not a typo on my part) |date=4 April 2016 |access-date=1 September 2018 |quote=yeah that is our own MCN and google spelled it incorrectly, as it was done in haste apparently. i think it's the yogscast way to have it misspelled though}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yogscast also partnered with [[Microsoft]]  to produce and manage the Xbox On channel on YouTube on behalf of Xbox UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yogscast.com/news/2016/9/15/yogscast-to-produce-xbox-uk-s-youtube-channel |title=Yogscast to produce Xbox UK‘s YouTube channel |publisher=The Yogscast |website=yogscast.com |date=15 September 2016 |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, numerous content creators such as &lt;!---Please restrict names here to those ONLY from source---&gt;Matthew Meredith ("Caff"), BasicallyBea, Radderss, GeestarGames, Overwatch Central, and Vidiots&lt;!---Please restrict names here to those ONLY from source---&gt; also joined as part of the larger Yogscast network.&lt;ref name="history-influencerupdate" /&gt;

In May 2017, the Yogscast announced their first published game, ''Caveblazers'', developed by indie games developer Deadpan Games, as part of their foray into the game publishing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/6a70v1/yogscast_publishing_caveblazers/|title=Yogscast Publishing Caveblazers|last1=Turpin|first1=Mark|website=Reddit|language=en|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/452060/Caveblazers/|title=Caveblazers on Steam|website=Steam|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==
=== Video series ===
==== ''World of Warcraft'' ====
The Yogscast's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' videos were the first videos released by the Yogscast and largely took the form of parodic [[how-to]] videos. In July 2010, Brindley and Lane also began a series of play-through videos previewing the ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' [[expansion pack]]'s [[closed beta]]. Much of the Yogscast's initial popularity was due to media and blog coverage of these videos, with [[Joystiq]] (later becoming [[Engadget]]) regularly covering them as they were released.&lt;ref name=pcgamer-print /&gt;&lt;ref name=wow_insider&gt;{{cite web|title=Topic: yogscast articles|url=https://www.engadget.com/tag/yogscast/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Minecraft'' ====
One of the most popular video features of the Yogscast are their many ''[[Minecraft]]'' series.&lt;ref name=salon /&gt; In December 2010, Brindley and Lane began an ongoing series of [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]]-style ''Minecraft'' survival multiplayer videos.&lt;ref name=gotgame /&gt; As the series progressed, however, it evolved into a semi-improvised comedy drama named ''Shadow of Israphel''. This new series led to a boom in the number of the group's YouTube subscribers, and was a major contributing factor in their rise to fame. The last installment, episode 42, was released in July 2012. The series has been put on hold since and has not been officially cancelled, although its indefinite hiatus remains a recurring joke amongst the Yogscast and their audience.

Since then, they have also produced other narrative-driven series set in ''Minecraft'' such as ''YogLabs'', ''MoonQuest'', ''MarsQuest'', and ''JaffaQuest'' which have also attracted a large audience.

Another of Brindley and Lane's ''Minecraft'' series also involved them playing and bumbling through different player-made adventure maps,&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; showcasing different maps made by the player community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/|title=Yogscast try out Minecraft's quirkiest mod maps|last=Senior|first=Tom|date=24 June 2011|work=PC Gamer|access-date=13 November 2018|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20141217024136/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-try-out-minecrafts-quirkiest-mod-maps/|archive-date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the Yogscast curated and released a collection of ''Minecraft'' mods which they named the "Yogbox".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/|title=Yogbox bundles Minecraft's best mods into one download|last=Senior|first=Tom|date=29 June 2011|work=PC Gamer|access-date=13 November 2018|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170205181637/https://www.pcgamer.com/yogbox-bundles-minecrafts-best-mods-into-one-download/|archive-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Live Action ====
The Yogscast have participated and produced their own large-scale live action series. The most common of these are the group's coverage of various [[gaming convention]]s, as well as [[Role-playing game|RPG]] sessions and studio-promoted "challenge" videos. Other notable live action productions include a discussion with television and radio presenter [[Jonathan Ross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogscast.com/video/xGVXPvdmNCsz/search/Simon+Meets/page/0|title=Simon Meets Jonathan Ross|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[mockumentary]]-style interview with actor [[Warwick Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vt9EMroU74 |title=When Simon met Warwick - Part 1 |website=YouTube |type=Video |publisher=The Yogscast |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interview with [[Sigourney Weaver]], a promotional project with [[Peter Molyneux]], and a series of promotional live action sketches with [[Ubisoft]], [[Electronic Arts|EA]], [[Microsoft]], the [[BBC]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Sony]], and some smaller indie developers.

'''''The YoGPoD''''' podcast was first released on 5 February 2009, and was intended to run alongside the group's YouTube video releases. Along with hosts Brindley and Lane, it often featured other members of their ''World of Warcraft'' guild, and was initially released with a proposed weekly schedule. Releases became more sporadic over time, however, to the point that ''YoGPoD 42: Strawnana'' came out on 4 July 2012, 5 months after its predecessor. A Halloween-themed YoGPoD, ''YoGPoD 44: Halloween Spack-2-cular'' was released on 28 October 2012, followed by ''YoGPoD 45: Halloween Spack-3-cular'' on 30 October 2013. Following the 2013 Halloween YoGPoD, there was a short run of releases from October 2015 to January 2016, before the schedule paused again.

On 9 July 2018, a surprise Halloween-themed episode entitled ''YoGPoD 51: Halloween Spack-10-cular'' was released to celebrate a decade of Yogscast content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gammon |first1=Robert |title=The YoGPoD is Back to Celebrate 10 Years of Yogscast Nonsense |url=https://www.gamespew.com/2018/07/the-yogpod-is-back-to-celebrate-10-years-of-yogscast-nonsense/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=GameSpew |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, it was recorded and released far from Halloween.

''The YoGPoD'' has no strict structure, but one of the more prominent features has Lane impersonate public figures that Brindley then "interviews". [[Brian Blessed]], [[Warwick Davis]] and [[Elizabeth II]] are often parodied in this fashion.

The podcast reached #1 on the [[iTunes]] UK Podcasts chart on 4 July 2012,&lt;ref name=downloadcharts&gt;{{cite web |title=Xephos, Honeydew – 'The YoGPoD' British iTunes Chart Performance |url=http://www.downloadcharts.net/uk/artists/podcast/xephos-honeydew/podcasts/the-yogpod/ |website=DownloadCharts.net |accessdate=2 September 2018 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20121114202822/http://www.downloadcharts.net/uk/artists/podcast/xephos-honeydew/podcasts/the-yogpod/ |archive-date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the release of ''YoGPoD 42: Strawnana''.

'''''Triforce!''''' is a gaming and general discussion podcast hosted by Brindley, Sips and Pyrion Flax (Edward Forsyth). It was first released on 23 March 2016. The podcast is posted alongside ''The YoGPoD'' and features the trio talking about various ideas centred on gaming but also expand to current topics and sporadic thoughts. The structure of the podcast is fairly loose, with an introduction, miscellaneous topics, a gaming section, a reading from Pyrion Flax's homebrew fiction "Bodega" (Episode 19 to Episode 43) and a Q and A from Twitter followers at the close of the podcast.

In 2017, the official ''YoGPoD'' YouTube channel was rebranded for the ''Triforce!'' podcast. A spinoff [[audiobook]] style series, titled ''Bodega'', was also debuted.
The series features excerpts of the regular ''Triforce!'', podcast where Pyrion Flax narrates his homebrew fanfiction.

Since 2011, the Yogscast have organised a series of live streams every year in December to benefit charity.

'''Ultra Magnus''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional]] robot superhero character from the various ''[[Transformers]]'' storylines in the Transformers robot superhero franchise, generally appearing as a [[lieutenant|chief lieutenant]] of [[Optimus Prime]].

Despite his incredible fighting skills, courage and unmatched talent for improvisation on the battlefield, Ultra Magnus is most comfortable when carrying out orders, and is not naturally at ease if the [[Autobot matrix of leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] should ever find itself placed upon him.

In Ultra Magnus' mind, he is a commander of the wreckers, and his reluctance to change that will see to it that he expends all options before accepting the idea that he is required to lead. As a leader, Magnus would be resolute, fair and courageous, ever-ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good of his companions and mission, and unyielding in preparation for protection of those under his command. Although not interested in overall command, Ultra Magnus was the City Commander for [[Autobot City]] in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', and his toy also featured him in the role of City Commander (a title also held by his original opposite number, the Decepticon leader [[Galvatron]]), which indicates that he at least is willing to accept a leadership role in a smaller capacity rather than as supreme commander, a role filled by both [[Optimus Prime]] and later [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]].

Ultra Magnus is armed with missile launchers capable of hitting a target 30 miles away, and transforms into a car carrier able to transport his fellow Autobot troops.

===Animated series===

====''The Transformers''====
{{Quote|From the secret files of Teletraan II: Ultra Magnus is the most mature spokesman for the Autobot cause. As a soldier, he is always practical and serious. And he is so loved by his fellow Autobots that [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]] and Daniel traveled millions of miles to the Autobot records asteroid, just so they could find out Ultra Magnus's birthday. In his vehicle mode, Ultra Magnus is an armored transport truck, a machine with magnificent fighting skills. His enemies, the Decepticons, respect his courage, but most of all, they fear Ultra Magnus's spirit of self-sacrifice. He always thinks first of the welfare of his fellow Autobots and his mission.|sign=|source=}}
Ultra Magnus makes his first appearance in Japan in the Japan-exclusive ''[[Transformers: Scramble City]]''. ''Scramble City'' never made it to the U.S.A. so most Americans didn't see him until ''[[The Transformers: The Movie|the 1986 animated film]]''.
Ultra Magnus made his first continuity appearance in the Earth year 2005 as commander of [[Autobot City]] on Earth. Leading the defense of the city when it came under Decepticon attack, Magnus suddenly found himself commanding the entire Autobot army when Optimus Prime died after his epic fight with [[Megatron]] and passed the [[Matrix of Leadership]] to him despite his protestations. Subsequently, in a confrontation with the Decepticons on the planet of Junk, Magnus was blown apart and lost the Matrix to [[Galvatron]], but was reassembled and reactivated by the [[Junkions]].&lt;ref&gt;'Transformers: The Movie' lights our darkest hour, University Wire, November 30, 2000, by Chris Kula&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] recovered the Matrix from Galvatron and became [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]], Ultra Magnus decided to step down as leader to give the role to Rodimus, but continued to act as his friend and advisor, keeping him on the straight and narrow and always reassuring him, attempting to urge him out of the shadow of Optimus Prime.

[[Image:Ultramagnus2.jpg|thumb|left|Ultra Magnus in his Car Carrier Truck Mode.]]
Magnus had his share of personal adventures in 2006, such as when he was captured by a [[Quintesson]] [[scientist]] for study, along with the [[Wreck-Gar]], [[Marissa Faireborn]] and [[Cyclonus]]; he and Cyclonus developed a mutual, grudging respect for each other as warriors during the ensuing events, as they worked together to escape a negative universe on the other side of a [[black hole]].

Magnus would later fall afoul of an unrepentant Cyclonus when he went to the aid of [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]] and [[Daniel Witwicky]] when they stumbled into trouble while attempting to discover Magnus's birthday. In addition to these and other battles with Cyclonus, Magnus also found himself facing Galvatron on several occasions - the deranged Decepticon would even occasionally focus his rage more upon Magnus than Rodimus Prime; such a notion is not inappropriate, since Magnus was the being he was originally dispatched to destroy, and who thwarted him in varying ways, certainly enough to permanently earn the deranged Galvatron's ire.

In the Episode "Only Human", Ultra Magnus, [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]], Rodimus, and [[Arcee]] found their minds transferred into human-mimicking "[[synthoid]]" bodies by the human crime lord [[Cobra Commander|Victor Drath]].

In Episode 78, "Madman's Paradise", [[Spike Witwicky]] and his wife Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. [[Grimlock]] followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the [[Red Wizard (Transformers)|Red Wizard]]'s side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the [[Golden One]]. Ultra Magnus, [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]], [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]] followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of [[Perceptor]], the Autobots and Daniel are returned to [[Cybertron]].

When the [[galaxy]] became infected by the Hate Plague, Ultra Magnus was one of the first victims, and his calm, restrained soldier attitude was stripped away, leaving behind a raving, battle-hungry maniac who had particular interest in destroying Rodimus Prime. After the plague was cured by the resurrected [[Optimus Prime]], Magnus subsequently led the defense of Cybertron during the battle for the power of the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]] in 2007.

In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', Ultra Magnus was voiced by [[Robert Stack]]. For the subsequent episodes of the animated series, he was voiced by [[Jack Angel]], who had previously portrayed characters such as [[Astrotrain]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], and [[Omega Supreme]]. His character was most familiar for uttering the line "I can't deal with that now" whenever things got bad.

====''Transformers: The Headmasters''====
Although the American animated series ended with the three-parter "The Rebirth" storyline, it was decided in Japan to continue production of new episodes; to that end, "The Rebirth" was discarded, and in its place, a new 35-episode series, ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'' was created.

Earlier Japanese-exclusive media such as ''[[Transformers: Scramble City|Scramble City]]'' and [[TV Magazine]]'s [[manga]] stories had previously detailed Ultra Magnus's earlier arrival on Earth and his role in the creation of [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]. In ''Headmasters'', Magnus was a supporting character for the early part of the series, once again in charge of Autobot City on Earth, taking a proactive role in the defense of the planet against the Decepticons when they re-emerged in 2011. During the opening skirmish of the renewed conflict, Magnus crossed swords with the large and powerful Decepticon ninja, [[Sixshot]], who went on to lead the villains' earth-based forces, leading to a smoldering enmity between the two. Their rivalry eventually came to a conclusive end when Sixshot and Magnus engaged in a one-on-one duel. Magnus was no match for the multiple powers of Sixshot's numerous transformations, and was felled by his seventh, secret mode. With his dying gasp, Magnus told the Autobots to protect the Earth. At Metroplex's request, the Autobots buried Magnus on Earth.

When Ultra Magnus died, his body did not turn white/grey, like all other Transformers who had died in the past (including those in the ''Headmasters'' series). Whether this is due to his body being composed of external armour over his truck-cab exoskeleton (like the original toy and Dreamwave comic) or simply because of animator error is open to fan-interpretation.

As "The Headmasters" cartoon is set in alternative "Japanese continuity" which officially doesn't belong to original American series that ended with 4th season in three-piece episode titled "The Rebirth", Ultra Magnus did not die in scope of original continuity.

===Marvel Comics===
Ultra Magnus did not appear in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[United States|American]] ''Transformers'' comic book series outside of a comic book adaptation of a third-season episode of the animated ''Transformers'' series. However, its sister title in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] ''did'' feature in the character extensively in its own original stories (particularly issues in and around the 100 mark); the American stories made no use of the new cast introduced in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', and U.K. writer [[Simon Furman]] pounced on the opportunity to use them in his own ways. Whereas all the other movie characters who appeared in the stories — such as [[Galvatron]], [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] and [[Prowl (Transformers)|Kup]] — appeared via the use of [[time travel]], it was Ultra Magnus's present-day self who played a key role in many of the important UK storylines. As per the original intent of his character and toy, Magnus was presented as the arch-foe of Galvatron.

Ultra Magnus was first introduced — and, debatably, first ''constructed'' — in the Earth year 1986, as the underground Autobot resistance on Cybertron prepared to execute their daring "Operation: Volcano" plan, which would involve luring the Decepticons' crack troops to one location where Magnus and the Autobot commando squad, the Wreckers, would finish them off. However, when the Matrix Flame (a flame denoting the activity of the robot containing the [[Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]]) suddenly extinguished, Magnus was dispatched to Earth to discover what had happened to Optimus Prime.

With time nipping at his heels, the launch of Operation: Volcano going ahead whether he returned or not, Magnus allied himself with the Earth Autobots and worked to discover what had caused Optimus Prime, [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] to vanish from the middle of the Autobot base, while the other Autobots battled the threat posed by Galvatron, a Decepticon who had travelled back in time from the future. The appearance of three more Autobots from the future, Hot Rod, Kup and [[Blurr]], gave Magnus his answer: the mass-displacement effect yielded by Galvatron's time travel had shunted Prime and the others into the limbo between dimensions. Ultra Magnus then engaged Galvatron in battle as Kup and the others set up a scheme to force Galvatron back into the future, and even though Magnus was severely beaten by the more-powerful Decepticon, the plan succeeded and the future Decepticon returned to his own time. Magnus, however, was too late to return for Operation: Volcano, but the plan was nullified when the intended Decepticon victims were called away by Megatron, but a parting shot took the life of the Wreckers' leader, Impactor.

In 1987, when Optimus Prime was transported to Cybertron, Ultra Magnus and the Wreckers nearly killed him due to deliberate Decepticon misinformation that claimed he was a masquerading Decepticon agent which was disproved by [[Emirate Xaaron]]. Prime and Magnus then fought side-by-side on Cybertron for a period, until Ratbat cleverly deployed the Spacebridge to displace Magnus, Prime, and an insane Megatron to Earth. As Magnus adjusted to his temporary new home, he stumbled across Galvatron, who had returned from the future with a new scheme to harness the power of the Earth's core. Continuing their deeply bitter feud, Galvatron battled Ultra Magnus with help from the future Autobots, but in the end, the two leaders were entombed in volcanic lava.

Galvatron was eventually able to effect his own release, and the Sparkler Mini-Bots (also known as the Sparkabots) extricated Ultra Magnus, who, by this stage, having suffered repeated defeats at Galvatron's hands, had developed a paralysing fear of confronting the Decepticon. Galvatron, to his own amusement, set about pulverizing the Sparklers, with the intention of further tormenting the temporarily quiescent Ultra Magnus. With his comrades' lives at risk, Magnus overcame his demons to defeat Galvatron.

The present-day Ultra Magnus would not have to face Galvatron again, but more terrifying threats were in store when he and the Sparklers returned to Cybertron and discovered that the city of Kalis had been overridden by hordes of [[zombie]] Transformers, reactivated by the renegade Autobot mad scientist, Flame. Ultra Magnus joined forces with the Wreckers and their allies to defeat Flame's plan to fire Cybertron's subterranean planetary engines and complete Megatron's ancient plan to turn the world into a huge battleship.

Soon after, Magnus found himself involved in a grotesque illegal [[gladiator]]ial game, and although he defeated his monstrous opponent and delivered a stirring speech to the crowd decrying their spectation of such a sport, his words failed to get through.

Although that was the last appearance of the present-day Ultra Magnus, the future version of Ultra Magnus (from the same era as [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]]) made further appearances. He was present when Rodimus Prime, [[Prowl (Transformers)|Kup]], and [[Blurr]] went back in time to confront Galvatron and Death's Head, stating his doubts about the mission, teamed up with [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]'s Decepticons to defeat the [[Quintesson]]s, and was part of Rodimus Prime's team in the Time Wars. He did not get his final confrontation with Galvatron, however, as Galvatron used Decepticon leader [[Scorponok]] as a living shield against Magnus' fire, prompting Scorponok's troops to attack him.

The U.K. ''Transformers'' continuity records that Magnus and the other future Autobots returned find to their own time-stream changed to a different, darker future, where Galvatron was alive and ruling most of Cybertron.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Ultra Magnus from [[Dreamwave Productions]]' 21st century re-imagining of the Generation One universe took the opportunity to indulge two contentious aspects of Ultra Magnus previously resigned to fan speculation: here, he was revealed to be Optimus Prime's "brother" in the Dreamwave continuity, and also hinted to be [[Dion (Transformers)|Dion]], a childhood friend of Optimus Prime from the animated series, due to the name of a strike force he led.

Magnus first chronological appearance was in ''The War Within: Age of Wrath'' miniseries, where he had united the splintered Autobot factions such as the [[The Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]] and [[Lightning Strike Coalition]] (who had struck out on their own following Optimus Prime and Megatron's disappearance in a Space Bridge accident) and managed to negotiate a settlement with the Decepticons and [[Ultracons]]. The plan was derailed first by [[Starscream]]'s [[Predacons]] and then by Megatron's return with an army of Seeker clones, with [[Grimlock]] taking a fatal shot meant for Magnus. After being beaten into submission by Megatron, Magnus was amongst those captured by the Decepticons. The closure of Dreamwave prevented the completion of the series.

Following the disappearance of [[Optimus Prime]] and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s troops four million years ago, Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus took fluctuating joint leadership of the Autobots, until Maximus abandoned the war.

Ultra Magnus appeared in as a major character in Dreamwave Productions ''Micromasters'' mini-series. In issue #1, "Destined For Nothing", Countdown and [[Groundshaker (Transformers)|Groundshaker]] return from space to find the Autobot base largely abandoned. The first Autobots they encounter, [[Topspin (Transformers)|Topspin]] and [[Twin Twist]] seem surprised to see them, and more surprised that [[Optimus Prime]] isn't with them. Countdown and Groundshaker are equally surprised that Optimus has not returned to Cybertron before they did. Countdown confronts Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus and informs them that Operation: Containment, an attempt to prevent the Decepticon threat from spreading beyond Cybertron, has failed. Countdown explains that the Decepticon Skystalker and his forces ravaged the peaceful planet, [[Paradron]], and that the Autobots need to mount an intergalactic patrol force to prevent the same fate from befalling other worlds. Ultra Magnus and Fortress Maximus disagree, stating that Autobot forces are already underpowered and spread thin as it is. Groundshaker interrupts, belligerently demanding the Autobot command take action, before he is pulled from the room by Countdown. As Countdown and Groundshaker leave the command center, they overhear [[Micromasters#Autobots|Big Daddy]] and his patrol griping about the day's events, which interests Countdown greatly. Big Daddy and company then confront Magnus and Maximus, upset that Crunch lost his life defending [[Roadbuster]]. The argument grows more heated, before Fortress Maximus orders the [[Hot Rod Patrol]] to turn in their weapons and dismisses them.

100,000 years later, the Transformers, their war, and the entire planet of Cybertron itself ground to a halt when the world's energy supplies completely ran out, sending Cybertron into a period of reconstructive hibernation, during which the entire population was sent into stasis.

Three thousand years ago, [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] was the first Transformer to be reactivated, and set about restoring the planet and its populace, quietly working towards his own sinister ends. Unifying the Autobot and Decepticon factions, he appointed Ultra Magnus as his second-in-command, who led the attack on [[The Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]] when they travelled to Earth and arrested Optimus Prime and Megatron as war criminals. (In reference to the theory that Ultra Magnus was formerly Dion, the name of the team Ultra Magnus led to take the Autobots into custody was team Dion.)

When Optimus Prime then led a rebel attack on [[Iacon]], Shockwave turned on Magnus, apparently deactivating him. Ultra Magnus survived, however, and his inner robot emerged from his damaged larger form, teaming with Prime to stop Shockwave's plan to use the Matrix to access [[Vector Sigma]].

Ultra Magnus came away from the encounter with less damage than Prime, and soon had his systems repaired. He was seen in his familiar blue outer shell assisting [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] when the burden of leadership threatened to become too much for him, and headed a mission to one of Cybertron's moons to fortify it against attack. Dreamwave's bankruptcy and subsequent closure, however, meant that any further stories of Ultra Magnus went untold.

===Fun Publications===
The ''Transformers: Classics'' story printed by Fun Publications is set in a continuation of the Marvel Comics Transformers series, ignoring the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics. Since Ultra Magnus only appeared in the U.K. comics (baring the movie adaption), the Ultra Magnus appearing in these stories is a new character.

In Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, "Games of Deception" this series Ultra Magnus leads a team of Autobots, which includes [[Elita One]], [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]], [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]], [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]], [[List of Transformers: Energon characters#Autobots|Strongarm]], [[Swoop (Transformer)|Swoop]] and Tryanotron in pursuit of the Decepticon Bug Bite and his forces to Earth. Once on Earth they contact Grimlock to aid them.

In the ''Beast Wars Shattered Glass'' story arc the G1 Ultra Magnus travels to Shattered Glass prehistoric Earth with Prowl, Ironhide, Silverbolt, and Grimlock. Adopting a [[wooly mammoth]] beast mode in order to survive the raw [[Energon]] radiation, he adopts the identity "'''Ultra Mammoth'''", which he attributes to Grimlock. With their home universe destroyed, Mammoth and his team did battle with Megatron's force of Decepticons, who had adopted alternative means of survival. Joined by an alternate version of [[Depth Charge (Transformers)|Depth Charge]], the former Autobots took on a new identity as [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximals]]. After a number of battles with Megatron's similarly renamed Predacons, Ultra Magnus gained possession of the Origin Matrix.

Ultra Mammoth and his comrades eventually made their way to the present of the Shattered Glass Universe, their own universe having been destroyed by the actions of Magnus' Shattered Glass counterpart. While most of his crew chose to take on normal Cybertronian forms, Ultra Mammoth retained his beast form, and through the heroic Galvatron learned that the Matrix he carried was a component of the [[Star Saber]]. He resolved to keep it until [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]] returned, only to run afoul of his alternate self and engage him in a battle. The conflict was soon interrupted by Nexus Prime's arrival, and after sending the evil Magnus to another universe Nexus reclaimed the Matrix and resolved to use the Star Saber and Terminus Blade-the latter being reclaimed from Magnus-to prevent any other universes from suffering the same fate as Ultra Mammoth's.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
Ultra Magnus would make another appearance in the second G. I Joe vs. the Transformers crossover from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], again as one of the leaders of the Autobot resistance to [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. He and [[Perceptor]] saved a group of G. I Joes and Cobras from Shockwave's Decepticons, erecting a forcefield to protect them while they worked to repair the damage caused by Teletran-3, powered by Magnus' own strength. The shield eventually gave out and Magnus was captured. However, they were all rescued when the [[Dinobots]] returned and routed Shockwave's forces.

He reappeared in the third crossover as part of the combined Autobot/G. I Joe force attempting to rescue [[Optimus Prime]], and even held off [[Trypticon]] single-handedly at one point. In the fourth crossover, Magnus was left in charge of the Autobot forces on Cybertron when Optimus Prime journeyed to Earth.

===IDW Publishing===
In issue #3 of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'', a white colored Transformer (resembling Magnus' Titanium War Within toy) is seen from behind at the funeral of [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]] and [[Fastback (Transformers)|Fastback]]. Whether this is actually Magnus is unclear.

In the new [[IDW Publishing]] continuity Magnus is a feared Autobot law enforcement officer. Magnus tracked down all those who broke the accords - be they Autobot or Decepticon. After arresting the Decepticon weapons dealer [[Swindle (Transformers)|Swindle]], the unscrupulous Decepticon managed to talk his way out of it by offering Magnus an even more tempting prize - the whereabouts of [[Scorponok]]. Despite his own personal reservations about doing so, Magnus agreed (planting a tracker on Swindle in the process) and tracked Scorponok down on the planet Nebulos. There he discovered the Decepticon's plan - upgrading several of the Nebulans with Transformer technology. Magnus soon found Scorponok himself, and lost the subsequent fight. However, a shot from Scorponok's beast mode seemingly killed Scorponok's already upgraded partner Lord Zarak. Magnus managed to shoot Scorponok in the head, but the Decepticon escaped again. Much later, after apprehending Swindle (again), the Decepticon again attempted to deal his way out. He reappeared briefly again in the ''Spotlight'' issue on [[Arcee]], where he tracked down, battled and defeated the deranged Arcee, not realising that the facility he was in was actually being used by [[Jhiaxus]] for the expansion.

Ultra Magnus also appears in the IDW ongoing series. He comes to Earth some three years after the events of the ''[[All Hail Megatron]]'' series, once again tracking Swindle. As acting Autobot commander, Bumblebee attempts to persuade Ultra Magnus to abandon his law enforcement duties and take up the fight against the Decepticons that still remained on Earth.

In ''The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye'', Ultra Magnus serves as second-in-command of the starship ''Lost Light'' under the command of Rodimus. Ultra Magnus' obsession with rules often serve as comic relief in the series. However, coping with the end of the Great War causes Magnus to suffer a mental breakdown. It is then revealed that Ultra Magnus is an identity partially created by Chief Justice Tyrest; when the original Ultra Magnus died, Tyrest created a suit replicating Magnus' armor for an Autobot to wear, thus continuing the identity of Ultra Magnus to serve as the duly appointed enforcer of the Tyrest Accord long after the original's death. The current holder of the Magnus Armor is Minimus Ambus, which is revealed in the "Remain In Light" story arc. In the second season of ''More Than Meets the Eye'', Minimus Ambus learns to grow more comfortable outside of the Magnus Armor, and is exiled from the ''Lost Light'' along with any other Autobots who befriended the defected Megatron.

===Binaltech===
In the altered chronology of the ''[[Binaltech]]'' saga, Optimus Prime is still alive, having never had the final showdown with Megatron at the [[Battle of Autobot City]]. When [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] arranges for the Autobots to be alone in the battle against the threat of [[Unicron]], Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus team up to take on the planet-eater, having discovered that the Matrix is the key to Unicron's destruction. Within Unicron's body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged, and although not fatally, he passes the Matrix to Ultra Magnus to complete the mission. Ultra Magnus sheds his outer armor and proceeds on, successfully opening the Matrix and initiating the destruction of Unicron. Magnus and Prime escape the exploding giant.

===Other appearances===
Ultra Magnus is the main character in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] video game ''[[Transformers: Convoy no Nazo]]''. The game is a typical side-scroller in which he battles Decepticons. This game has been poorly received.

Ultra Magnus appears among the Transformers box art on the back of larger third year Transformers toys. He is flying in robot mode without his armor. For many years this was his only depiction in non-armored mode.

===Toys===
*'''''Generation 1'' Ultra Magnus''' (1986)
:Based on the Diaclone toy similar to Optimus Prime, Powered Convoy. Despite the fact that this toy has a smaller robot identical to Optimus Prime that can combine with the trailer for a super robot, he was only depicted in super mode in the animated series and Marvel comics. According to the U.S. patent for this toy the head and chest plate of the super robot mode combine to form a jet with a gun turret on it. Several variations of this toy were released, with varying amounts of paint applications and with rubber or plastic tires on his trailer.
:Like many previous ''Transformers'' toys, the Ultra Magnus toy was a carry-over from the Japanese ''Diaclone'' line, where it was released in silver, red and dark blue colors as "Powered Convoy," a powered-up version of "Battle Convoy," the toy which had become Optimus Prime, hence the identical cabs.&lt;ref&gt;Rare and exclusive plastic, New Straits Times; August 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Diaclone toy's instructions included several more alternate modes the toy could be configured into, which were omitted from Ultra Magnus's instructions in the US release. In the [[Japan]]ese release of the Ultra Magnus character, however, two of these additional modes are kept, while the third (a battle station) is replaced with another battle station mode with a completely different arrangement.
:It is worth noting that Powered Convoy's original colors may have at one point been intended to be kept for the Ultra Magnus character -- an early promotional film advertising ''Transformers: The Movie'' features Ultra Magnus animated in these hues. In line with this, when the original Ultra Magnus toy was re-issued in Japan in 2000, a limited-edition version in the ''Diaclone'' colors was also released, referred to as a "Movie Edition"; this deco would later be used as the basis for a comics-exclusive character named Delta Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Delta Magnus |url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Delta_Magnus |website=Transformers Wiki |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third version also saw release, cast entirely in translucent yellow, intended to represent the moment that Magnus is caught in the light of the Matrix.
:Ultra Magnus' toy consists of a smaller robot, identical to [[Optimus Prime]] but with a mostly white colouration, which acts as the cab of the car carrier and combines with the trailer to form the familiar Ultra Magnus as depicted in the cartoon and comics. The white "inner robot" would not appear in official fiction until the publication of the Dreamwave comics, but was alluded to by the coating applied to Optimus Prime in ''The Return Of Optimus Prime''.

*'''''Generation 1'' Kabaya Gum Ultra Magnus''' (1986)
:Part of the original gum toy series by [[Kabaya]]. Each package comes with a stick of chewing gum and an easy-to-assemble kit. The completed robot looks and transforms almost the same as the larger, original Takara version. The car carrier can accommodate Mini-Car figures (Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, etc.) and most ''World's Smallest Transformers'' figures.

*'''''Generation 2'' Ultra Magnus''' (1993)
:A collectable watch which looked like Ultra Magnus' super robot mode was released in Generation 2

*'''''Generation 1'' Reissue Ultra Magnus''' (2002)
:The reissue of Ultra Magnus in 2002 had elongated missiles and shortened smokestacks to comply with new child safety laws.

*'''''Universe'' Deluxe Ultra Magnus with Over-Run''' (2004)
:The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a white recolor of the Armada Deluxe Optimus Prime and Over-Run toy. There was an error in the assembly of the toy where the lower parts of his arms were swapped with each other, meaning he could not bend his arms up at the elbows fully, unless they are fixed.

*'''''Masterpiece'' MP-02 Ultra Magnus''' (2005)
:A white redeco of ''Masterpiece'' Optimus Prime that comes with a Megatron in gun mode, Energon axe and the Matrix of Leadership.

*'''''Generation 2'' Laser Ultra Magnus''' (2006)
:When the ''Generation 2'' Laser Optimus Prime figure was reissued in Japan in 2006, online retailer eHobby offered an exclusive repainted version of it as a new version of the original Ultra Magnus, referencing - as other toylines had also since done - the connection between the original Prime and Magnus toys. As a repaint of Laser Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus has light-up eyes and headlights, and sword and gun which can also be illuminated when placed in his fist. His trailer can, via a spring-loaded mechanism, transform into a heavily armed battle station with a five-shot missile launcher, disc shooter and bellows-activated foam-tipped rocket launcher.
:The extensive bio for this toy reveals that after Magnus lost his life in a Decepticon attack, he was welcomed into the [[Allspark]], his spark retaining its individuality like the other ancient Autobot leaders due to his brief ownership of the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. Magnus, however, did not feel that he truly belonged there, and, through the cosmic awareness that comes with being part of the Matrix, learned that [[Galvatron|Galvatron II]] was threatening the galaxy. Making contact with Optimus Prime's consciousness, Magnus used the power of Prime's "Reconfiguration Matrix" - the means by which Prime had adopted numerous body forms in the G2 line - to bring about his own resurrection. With the power of the Reconfiguration Matrix, Magnus is able to adopt several different forms of his own, including his original body, but has selected a duplicate version of Prime's "Laser Rod" form for particularly comprehensive offensive power.

*'''''Classics'' Ultra Magnus''' (2007)
:A two pack of Ultra Magnus (repaint of Classics voyager Optimus Prime) and [[Skywarp]] (repaint of Classics Deluxe [[Starscream]]) made a Target store exclusive. The pack was sold under the name "''Battle for Autobot City''".
:A later released 2-pack included Classic Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.

*'''''Titanium'' 6&amp;nbsp;inch War Within Ultra Magnus''' (2007)
:Two different toys of Ultra Magnus appeared in the Titanium line. The first is a repaint of the 6" inch War Within Optimus Prime in white colors.

*'''''Titanium'' 6&amp;nbsp;inch Generation 1 Ultra Magnus''' (2007)
:The second is a new 6" inch Titanium transforming mold which resembles his Generation 1 form. Only features vehicle and super-robot modes, with no separate smaller robot mode, as the trailer does not disconnect from the cab.

*'''Convoy feat. Nike Free 7.0 Ultra Magnus''' (2007)
:A special repaint of the Optimus Prime from the "Transformers: Sports Label" series in Ultra Magnus' colors was released. However it was still packaged under the name Convoy, and is therefore still identified as a version of Optimus Prime.

*'''''Alternity'' Ultra Magnus Featuring Nissan GT-R''' (2010)
:An eHobby exclusive (Japan) and TF China Carnival (China) exclusive white redeco of the ''Alternity'' Convoy figure.

*'''''Generation 1'' Kabaya Gum 25th Anniversary Ultra Magnus''' (2010)
:The 25th anniversary gum toy is not a reissue of the original 1985 toy; instead, it appears to be based on the ''Titanium'' design.

*'''''Timelines'' Ultra Mammoth''' (2013)
:A TFCC exclusive repaint of [[Big Convoy]] with a color scheme based on G1 Ultra Magnus.

The first new character to bear the name of Ultra Magnus since the Generation 1 original was known as '''God Magnus''' in the Japanese 2000 line, ''Transformers: Car Robots''. God Magnus owed his name and alternate mode to Ultra Magnus (and also to [[Ginrai|Godbomber]], an earlier character who disassembled to form armor for his Prime-styled partner), so when the series was translated for release in the West in 2001 as ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', the name change was obvious, and Ultra Magnus returned to TV screens for the first time since the G1 series.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers robots in disguise returns! Hasbro Launches Product Line Based on Original '80s Theme; Fox Kids Series to Debut September 8th. Business Wire September 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a smaller ''Spy Changer'' figure of Magnus, unique to ''Robots in Disguise,'' was released

Ultra Magnus transforms into a car carrier capable of transporting other Autobots such as the Autobot Brothers. In addition to his remarkable strength and fighting ability, he is armed with the "Blue Bolts" - a variable-configuration weapon of immense destructive power.  His weapon can either fire as a rapid fire gun or as a high powered laser. His back-mounted jetpack allows for periods of short flight. In addition to these new abilities, for the first time, was able to combine with Optimus Prime (Robots In Disguise toyline) forming Omega Prime.

=== Animated series ===
As a nod to their origins in ''Generation 1'' Ultra Magnus and [[Optimus Prime]] (''Fire Convoy'' in Japan) were created at the same time by Alpha Trion, but when Prime was chosen to carry the Matrix by [[Vector Sigma]], Magnus felt passed over, jealous and was left carrying a hatred against his brother. That grudge eventually exploded into violence when he arrived on Earth with the intention of taking what he believed was rightfully his - by force, if necessary.  Before meeting up with Optimus, Magnus fought and easily defeated the Decepticons on his own (not even Ruination could beat him). When he met Optimus, he offered Magnus a chance to join him, but Magnus outright refused and attacked him. Severely injuring Prime, who refused to fight back, Magnus tracked him to a desert island, where he pretended to offer him the hand of friendship, only to attempt to absorb the Matrix for himself, forcing the brothers into the combined form of [[Omega Prime]] ''(God Fire Convoy)''. Through this link, Magnus was also able to channel the power of the Matrix, which he used to supercharge the Autobot Brothers into newly coloured forms. Although Magnus remained a free agent, refusing to take orders from his brother, his animosity dwindled and he frequently helped the Autobots by combining with Prime to battle the Predacons and Decepticons. As Omega Prime, they faced [[Galvatron]] together at the Earth's core and defeated him once and for all.

Note that in ''Car Robots'', there is not one singular Matrix, but multiple ones, each held by a high-ranking Autobot. Magnus already possesses a Matrix, and simply seeks to steal the power of Prime's to increase his own (the overspill resulting in the supercharging of the Autobot Brothers).

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
The character of also made one appearance in Dreamwave Productions' Summer Special in a story presented as being in continuity with the animated series, which pitted him against [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], as both denied and debated their Autobot heritage and relation to Optimus Prime.  No further ''RiD'' stories were published by Dreamwave before their closure, as ''Beast Wars'' claimed victory over ''RiD'' in a poll to choose the next mini-series.

===3H Enterprises===
Three versions of Ultra Magnus would appear in the BotCon exclusive ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' storyline.

Although the ''Robots in Disguise'' incarnation of Ultra Magnus did not return to TV screens, his toy was re-released on the shelves of [[Sam's Club]] in 2003's parallel-universe-spanning ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' line, slightly redecoed with bluish-black parts in place of his dark blue ones. Featured in the pages of the ''Transformers: Universe'' comic book exclusive to the [[BotCon|Official Transformers Collectors Convention]], this character was established to the ''RiD'' Magnus, who, along with Optimus Prime, was plucked from his home universe at a point after the conclusion of ''Robots in Disguise'' to become part of a battle between armies gathered from across space and time by [[Unicron]] and [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]].  Led by [[Optimus Primal]] into the final battle, the combatants found their conflict halted when Unicron began to crumble beneath them. Primal's team gathered together to escape through a portal, but when Magnus and Prime passed through, they did not find themselves where they expected...

In another universe, an Autobot bearing a great physical resemblance to Ultra Magnus called '''Ultra Trion''' appeared, being killed by the Decepticon leader [[Megazarak]]. According to series artist [[Dan Khanna]] in a message board response, Ultra Trion was meant to be an alternate universe counterpart to Ultra Magnus, who acted as Alpha Trion's successor until his demise. Ultra Trion was later retconned into being a version Ultra Magnus, who merged with a dying Alpha Trion in an alternate future version of a ''Robot in Disguise'' universe, where Cybertron is ruled by [[Megazarak]] and the Autobots are near-extinct.

Yet another version of Ultra Magnus appeared, in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and this character was seemingly yet another new Ultra Magnus taken from a parallel dimension to that of the ''Robots in Disguise'' fiction. The toy for this version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of the ''Robots in Disguise'' toy and came packaged with Ironhide. This package was a Walmart store exclusive in 2004. The Voice Actor Drama was written for [[OFTCC]] 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus and Ironhide were among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect the beam, which left them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by [[Reptilion]]. Presumably the Autobots were then returned to their own worlds.

===Fun Publications===
Prime and Magnus's toys were released once more in 2005's ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' - exclusively to [[Costco]], with Magnus's toy remaining unchanged from his ''Universe'' redeco - with bios which once again presented them to be the same characters from ''RiD'' and ''Universe''.  It was within the pages of the ''Cybertron'' comic available through the Official Transformers Collectors Club that the story was continued, as the portal through which Magnus and Prime had vanished in ''Universe'' transported them into the ''Cybertron'' universe; there, a black hole left in the wake of Unicron's destruction in that universe had caused multiversal ripples which had resulted in the collapse of Unicron in the ''Universe'' timeline the brothers had just departed, and materialized on Cybertron...

In the ''Cybertron'' universe, Cybertron was under attack by two of the [[Heralds of Unicron]], Nemesis Prime and [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]]. They had already damaged [[Alpha Trion]], and while Ramjet engaged [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]] in a duel high above Cybertron, Nemesis Prime got past [[Sentinel Maximus]] and revealed his plan - he was going to use the Dead Matrix, a corrupted version of the [[Matrix of Leadership]], to drain the lifeforce of [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] and use it to revive Unicron (destroyed in a black hole at the conclusion of [[Transformers: Energon]]). But he was confronted by the most unexpected foe of all - [[Omega Prime]]. Omega then split into Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus, and while Prime attended to Primus, Magnus defeated Nemesis Prime. Informing Sentinel Maximus of what went on, they then stored the Dead Matrix away forever, unaware they were being observed by [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]].

Soundwave subsequently stole the Dead Matrix and threw it into the black hole, reviving Unicron, who took a nearby planet as his new body. Unicron attacked Cybertron again in the midst of a Mini-Con civil war, duelling with Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime. The battle was inconclusive, but Unicron was driven away by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] himself. The brothers recovered - only to receive [[Optimus Prime]], bearing word of Vector Prime's death in battle. Prime and Magnus were subsequently seen planning the hunt for Unicron.

[[Image:Universespychangerultramganus.jpg|thumb|left|Spy Changer Ultra Magnus in his Car Carrier Truck Mode.]]
A God Magnus Leader Class figure was released in 2000, that transforms from car carrier to robot. In car carrier mode, he can hold up to three Deluxe-sized cars (most notably the Car Brothers from the ''Car Robots'' series. His main weapon fires spring-loaded missiles and can fold into three different configurations. This battery-operated figure features truck horn sounds, weapons sound effects and voice samples of God Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/toys/gallery.php?id%3D495%26size%3D0%26start%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234540/http://www.seibertron.com/toys/gallery.php?id=495&amp;size=0&amp;start=0 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combines with Fire Convoy (sold separately) to form God Fire Convoy. Once combined, God Fire Convoy emits different sound effects and voice clips ("''Chou-Kyoudai Gattai!'' God Fire Convoy!" and "God Fire!"). A Toys "R" Us Japan exclusive gift set was offered in late 2000, featuring God Magnus and Super Fire Convoy packaged with the God Sword (a repaint of the sword from the Japanese G1 Fortress Maximus).

Its American counterpart, ''Robots in Disguise'' Leader Ultra Magnus, was originally released in 2001. It is similar to the Japanese release, only with the Japanese voice replaced with the English voice (with the phrase, "Ultra Magnus, Transform!"). Autobot emblems have been placed on the side panels in this version. Much like the Japanese version, this figure combines with Optimus Prime's normal robot mode to form Omega Prime, with a different set of voice and sound clips ("Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Combine!" and "Omega Fire!").

A ''Robots in Disguise'' Spy Changer Ultra Magnus was released in 2002.

It was in the second installment of the [[Unicron]] trilogy, ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', that the Overload toy was repainted into Ultra Magnus's blue, white and red colors and released in the west under the name "Ultra Magnus" in a limited production run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Transformers_Energon_Ultra_Magnus.pdf |title=Untitled-1 |format=PDF |website=Hasbro.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Energon'' version of Ultra Magnus, like all the recolorations of Armada toys featured in the early stages of the toyline, never appeared in the TV show, or the Dreamwave comic.

Although ''Transformers: Cybertron'', the third installment of the "Unicron Trilogy" timeline, saw ''Robots in Disguise'' Magnus enter its timeline, it was not without its own characters bearing the name. The ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'' toyline was the first to re-use Magnus' name, although not in the west - in Japan, where the character known as [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]] in English was named Ultra Magnus. It was not an ill-fitting name, as the first, unpainted pictures of the toy had caused speculation that it was intended to ''be'' a new version of Magnus, bearing as it does his stylistic shoulder design.

===Fun Publications===
Ultra Magnus appeared in the text story from [[Fun Publications]] called ''[[Transformers: Timelines#2008 figures and fiction|Force of Habit]]''. This story explained where he was during the events of the ''Cybertron'' story. Ultra Magnus is commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the [[Cyber Planet Keys]]. He also serves as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], [[Grimlock]], [[Ironhide]], Knock Out, [[Overcast (Transformers)|Overcast]], [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Quickstrike]], RipTide, [[Skyblast]], [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]], [[Swoop (Transformers)|Swoop]], [[Wreckage (Transformers)|Wreckage]] and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team.

"Ask [[Vector Prime]]" later revealed that Ultra Magnus previous possessed a form similar to Optimus Prime's, but that he was rebuilt using the schematics of [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]] after being badly damaged in battle with [[Treadshot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/photos/a.667118866753420.1073741828.664957846969522/725217457610227/?type=3&amp;permPage=1 |title=Ask Vector Prime - Timeline |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of Ultra Magnus is a recolor of ''Armada'' [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]]. It was released in 2004 and came with a recolor of the ''Armada'' Space Mini-Con team. The ''Transformers: Universe'' white and blue repaint of ''Armada'' Optimus Prime designated Ultra Magnus was also incorporated into this version of the character.

==Transformers Cinematic Universe==
In 2007, ''USA Today'' polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the next Transformers film. Ultra Magnus came in tied for fourth with Shockwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breznican |first=Anthony |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-18-Transformers_N.htm |title='Transformers' fans make some noise for Soundwave |website=Usatoday.com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra Magnus was considered to appear in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', before the role was given to Sentinel Prime. The design that was intended to be used for the character is seen briefly during the film's prologue, repurposed as the design of a generic deceased Autobot. To date it is unknown if Ultra Magnus will appear in any future movies.

===Animated series===
Ultra Magnus is the incumbent Supreme Commander of the Autobots, and led his faction through the Great War with the Decepticons. During the war, Ultra Magnus commissioned Project Omega as a desperate measure to defeat the Decepticons, despite his regret that the Autobots were creating a series of living doomsday weapons. After Ultra Magnus led the Autobots to victory, the Decepticons were exiled from Cybertron, leaving the planet at peace. Ultra Magnus later regretfully expelled [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus]] from the Autobot Elite Guard after he assumed responsibility for the apparent death of Elita-1. However, due to liking Optimus and suspecting that [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel]] was not telling the whole truth of the incident, he promoted him to Optimus Prime and gave him command of the stasis-locked Omega Supreme.

In the pilot of ''Transformers Animated'' Ultra Magnus learned that's crew had discovered the [[Spark (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Allspark]] and ordered them to stay put until it could be retrieved. He also told Prime not to try to be a hero; unfortunately Optimus disobeyed and had the ship take off anyway, stating that "''Ultra Magnus'' wasn't carrying the Allspark". Ultra Magnus comes to Earth personally in the episode "The Elite Guard" with his fellow Cybertron Elite Guard members Sentinel Prime and [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Jazz]]. He took on an Earth-vehicle mode. After the battle against some out-of-control police droids and a fragment of the Allspark was retrieved, Ultra Magnus began to respect Optimus Prime as a commander and told Sentinel Prime that he can learn a thing or two from him. During "Mission Accomplished", he informs Optimus and his crew to pack up and get ready to head back to Cybertron, believing that Optimus is emboldening the Decepticons with his shaky claims of Megatron's return. Ultra Magnus is convinced of the Decepticon presence on Earth by a battle with [[Starscream#Transformers Animated|Starscream]], and departs to deal with Decepticon attacks on Autobot space bridges, entrusting Optimus' crew with the protection of Earth.

In "TransWarped", Ultra Magnus realizes that the uprisings were too organized and deduced that Cybertron may have a double agent. He then sends Sentinel and Jazz to Earth to get an update from the Earthbound Autobots. In "Where Is Thy Sting?", [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Longarm Prime]] ([[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Shockwave]]) is outed as the traitor, and Magnus is savagely attacked and barely able to reveal the identity of his attacker to [[Ironhide#Transformers Animated|Ironhide]]. According to [[Alpha Trion#Transformers: Animated|Alpha Trion]] in "Decepticon Air," Ultra Magnus is currently on 'spark-support.' By this time, Sentinel Prime takes over as the new Magnus. In "This Is Why I Hate Machines," the attack by Shockwave and the image of Ultra Magnus in the infirmary are used as propaganda in Sentinel's fanatical government policies. While on spark-support, Ultra Magnus is nearly destroyed by his own hammer when Shockwave attacks the infirmary, but is saved by Ratchet, who takes the hammer with him to Earth and promises to return it once Ultra Magnus recovers.

For a time, Ultra Magnus's ultimate fate was not revealed before the end of the series, but Derrick J. Wyatt stated that if a fourth season of the show was made, Magnus was to have died from his injuries.

The first toy for this version of Ultra Magnus was released in 2008 and transformed from a [[Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck]] to robot. He came with a spring-loaded Magnus Hammer and is armed with numerous guns mounted on his shoulders. The figure emits two sound effects and phrases as voiced by Jeff Bennett. This toy was later recolored in a green, black, and orange theme, in a homage to the ''Generation 1'' robot superhero [[Roadbuster]]. The version released in Japan in 2010 had metallic paint and Japanese voice clips.

Ultra Magnus is the leader of the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], and Optimus Prime's second-in-command. Like the ''Animated'' version of the character, this Ultra Magnus carries a hammer, in actuality a depleted Forge of Solus Prime.

===Animated Series===
Ultra Magnus appears in the third season of ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'', entitled ''Beast Hunters''. He is revealed to be Optimus Prime's second-in-command, who survived the war for Cybertron. He is a by-the-book commander, requesting that the subordinate Autobots, with the exception of Ratchet, and even the humans address him as "sir".

Though he is not mentioned by name prior to his arrival, his image-or a very similar one-appeared when the amnesiac Optimus Prime, then going by Orion Pax, looked up Optimus Prime in the Decepticon database. Ultra Magnus himself arrives on Earth in "Scattered" and meets with Arcee and Jack. Like Wheeljack, he has his own personal vessel, though his is a good deal larger.

In "Prey," Ultra Magnus tells Jack and Arcee that he detected five Autobot life signatures that remained online. Ultra Magnus also mentioned that he had encountered other Autobots during his travels, many of which perished in Decepticon attacks. Later, he helps Bulkhead, Wheeljack and Miko escape from the Predacon named Predaking before finding Ratchet, Bumblebee and Raf at the Harbinger and meeting Agent Fowler and June Darby. Ultra Magnus decides that the Autobots must defeat Megatron once and for all and, after taking command, offers them a large supply of weapons to assist in the fight.

In "Rebellion", Ultra Magnus leads the assault on Darkmount, where Predaking is sent through a Ground Bridge into the Antarctic. Magnus goes after Megatron, but is defeated. Before the Autobots can be executed, a recently repaired Optimus Prime arrives and destroys Darkmount. Later, Magnus gives Optimus command over the Autobots again.

In "Project Predacon", Ultra Magnus' vehicle form is revealed, a nearly all-blue version of Optimus' semi-truck form. It is also revealed that he was put in charge of the Wreckers on Cybertron during the war, as he felt there needed to be someone to keep them in order. Once again taking charge of the Wreckers on Earth, Ultra Magnus also takes the Forge of Solus Prime as a new weapon, as it had no more power and he wanted to give it a "practical use".

In "Chain of Command", Ultra Magnus constantly criticizes Wheeljack's actions, such as attacking without orders, and bringing Miko along. It is revealed that Ultra Magnus becoming the leader of the Wreckers was the reason Wheeljack deserted. When fighting Predaking in the mine and losing, Magnus once again criticizes Wheeljack for detonating a grenade in a confined space. Ultimately Wheeljack deserts the Wreckers once again, though he returns to the Autobot base back in Nevada. This is shown in the episode "Plus One", in which Ultra Magnus, Bulkhead, and Miko return to Nevada in Magnus' ship instead of by groundbridge, bringing with them the reclaimed Apex Armor.

In "Evolution", Ultra Magnus begins to realize that the Autobots aren't very welcoming towards him, not just Wheeljack. Later he partakes in a battle at what is believed to be a Decepticon energon mine, and he takes the Wreckers inside of the mine with Smokescreen. He and Wheeljack stumble upon Shockwave's Predacon cloning lab, and proceed to battle him, but Shockwave escapes and the Predacons begin to awaken. Wheeljack detonates a grenade next to the synthetic energon, and they attempt to make their escape, just as Predaking arrives. Predaking is enraged by the loss of his Predacon brethren and tries to kill the two Autobots. The Wreckers put up more of a fight against Predaking in his robot mode, but eventually are defeated. Predaking crushes Magnus's hand by stepping on it and destroys the Forge of Solus Prime. When he is about to kill them, Optimus Prime comes in and saves them both. Magnus is later being treated by Ratchet, and learns from Optimus that the bond of family is greater than that of any army.

Ultra Magnus continues to work the Autobots, with a metal claw as a replacement for his destroyed hand. He leads the Wreckers in the final battle against the Decepticons in "Deadlock", until the Decepticons are defeated upon the death of Megatron, and witnesses the revival of Cybertron through the use of the Omega Lock.

In the TV movie, ''Predacons Rising'', Ultra Magnus is left in command while Optimus goes to retrieve the Allspark. When investigating the Sea of Rust with Smokescreen, they come across two Predacons, Skylynx and Darksteel. Magnus tries to fight off Skylynx, but is brutally beaten by him, and barely escapes with Smokescreen's help. He spends the rest of the movie under Ratchet's medical attention. He is however seen, still on a medical chair, when Optimus sacrifices himself for Cybertron's restoration with the AllSpark.
He and many others made a cameo in robots in disguise.

===Books===
Ultra Magnus appears in the novel ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-345-52252-8 |title=Transformers: Exodus - The Official History of the War for Cybertron |publisher=Del Rey Books |year=2010 |author=Alexander C. Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt; its sequel, ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'', the third installment in the series. Unlike the animated series, the Wreckers form around Ultra Magnus, who becomes a leading figure amongst the early Autobots. Wielding a powerful hammer, Magnus eventually became leader of the Autobot resistance to Shockwave on Cybertron following the departure of the ''Ark'' and the ''Nemesis.'' Ultra Magnus and his team played a role in the ''Ark's'' successful departure, delaying [[Trypticon]] and the Decepticons long enough for the ''Ark'' to be launched. He then takes up leadership of the Autobot forces resisting Shockwave's domination of the planet, corresponding with Alpha Trion and leading his Wreckers into battle against the enemy. In ''Retribution'' his role is expanded when Alpha Trion is taken prisoner by Shockwave and experimented upon, prompting him to assemble several Wreckers along with [[Jetfire]] and [[Omega Supreme]] to liberate the captured Prime. Their plan would be further complicated by an invasion of [[Sharkticon]]s sent by the [[Quintessons]] to reclaim Cybertron, but they eventually escaped with the aid of the bar owner Maccadam.

===IDW Publishing===
Ultra Magnus also appeared in the ''Transformers: Prime'' comic mini-series, ''Rage of the Dinobots''. Like many Autobots, he developed something of an aversion to the Dinobots due to their altered nature. Due to his rigid personality, he also looked unfavorably upon their combat tactics. However, after they played a significant role in enabling him to depart Cybertron, Magnus came to respect the Dinobots as comrades.

Ultra Magnus makes a cameo, along with Arcee and Bulkhead, in the ''Transformers: Robots in Disguise'' comic, secretly observing Bumblebee and his team fight a Decepticon bird named Flamefeather. He along with Arcee and Bulkhead meet Team Bee during a conflict with Clipshade in issue 2

===Games===
Ultra Magnus appears as a character in the [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]] - Autobots''. He is a level boss that must be defeated, which unlocks him as a playable character. He is also available in the Decepticons version of the game. If the sewer level with Motormaster is played with Autobot characters, Ultra Magnus is used to replace Motormaster.

Ultra Magnus is available as downloadable content for ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''.

Ultra Magnus is one of the evil Autobots in Fun Publications' ''Shattered Glass'' universe. In this universe, he is also Optimus Prime's younger brother, and formerly one of the chief lieutenants in the Autobot dictatorship.

===Fun Publications===
However, he eventually staged a failed coup against Prime, and had his face ripped away for his trouble, leaving him with a skeletal visage. Exiled to Paradron, he eventually formed an alliance with [[Wreck-Gar]] and others, obtaining the Omega Blade and copying Optimus's latest form in preparation to make another grab for power. This would lead to an invasion of the Classics universe, which was eventually destroyed as a result of Magnus' actions while its version of Earth was transported to Magnus' home universe. This would subsequently be revealed to be part of a scheme to harvest the energy of destroyed universes and use it against Optimus, but Magnus ran into unexpected opposition when his counterpart from the universe he destroyed, now known as Ultra Mammoth, engaged him and was exposed to a reaction of the Origin Matrix carried by him. This caused him to briefly go on a rampage, until he was subdued by the arrival of Nexus Prime, who promptly claimed the Omega Blade for his own use. Magnus attempted to escape, but Nexus banished him into another reality and trapped him there before setting out to insure that a plan such as his could never be employed again.

The name derives from the Spanish word ''[[:es:Zapato|zapato]]'' for "[[shoe]]": ''zapatear'' means to strike with a shoe. It is widely used in [[huapango]], [[son jarocho]], [[son jaliscience]], [[son calentano]].

The term is also used to refer to percussive [[footwork (dance)|footwork]] in some Spanish/Latin dances that involve elaborate shoe clicking and tapping and to the [[percussion]] music produced by shoe striking.
