      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2243">The '''African Violet Society of America''' is an international society of plant enthusiasts who promote the cultivation of [[Saintpaulia|African violets]] (''Saintpaulia'' species and cultivars) as house plants. The Society hosts an annual convention and publishes a bi-monthly full-color 64-page magazine, the ''African Violet Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avsa.org African Violet Society of America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The African Violet Society of America Inc. (AVSA) was organized on November 8, 1946, and incorporated on June 30, 1947. Since then it has grown to be the largest society devoted to a single [[indoor plant]] in the world. It is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.

==Objectives==
The purposes of AVSA are:
* to provide a convenient association for people interested in African violets;
* to stimulate interest in propagation and culture of African violets;
* to promote distribution of all varieties and species among members and others interested in growing them;
* to publish reliable, practical information about plants and the organization.

==Membership==
AVSA membership, which includes both amateur and commercial growers, spans the globe. There are national groups in many countries of the world. The purposes of AVSA are carried out, in part, by a strong network of affiliate clubs, state and regional societies, councils of societies, and judges councils. The AVSA sponsors African violet shows staged at the AVSA conventions and by AVSA affiliates. In these shows, plants are merit-judged according to the appropriate AVSA scales of points by AVSA judges.
 
AVSA is the [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] for the genus Saintpaulia and its [[cultivar]]s. This registry is available to the public with the purchase of updatable software.  
&lt;!-- Unsuitable material removed  Information about AVSA’s many publications, services and activities is available in the African Violet Magazine, from the AVSA Office, and from the official website.--&gt;

{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''Ahmad Shah, Crown Prince of Afghanistan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: أحمد شاه خان , born 23 September 1934 in [[Arg (Kabul)#History|Arg-i-Shahi]], [[Kabul]]) is the second son of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], the former [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|King of Afghanistan]].

==Biography==
At the time of his birth he was second in the line of succession to the throne after his older brother [[Muhammed Akbar Khan, Crown Prince of Afghanistan]]. However following the death of his brother on 26 November 1942, he became first in the line of succession and the [[heir apparent]] and Crown Prince.

He attended [[Oxford University]], the [[Sciences Po|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] and later spent time working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in [[Kabul]].

His father's reign [[1973 Afghan coup|ended on 17 July 1973]], when he was ousted by a coup with Afghanistan being declared a republic. The Crown Prince was one of fourteen members of the royal family arrested following the coup. He was allowed to leave the country for [[Rome]] on 26 July.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Economic Digest, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Following the overthrow of the monarchy, the Crown Prince settled in the state of [[Virginia]], United States and took to writing poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070927223217/http://www.steynonline.com/content/view/421/ The head that wore the Crown] &lt;/ref&gt;

Since the death of his father on 23 July 2007, he is the oldest surviving male heir of the last [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|king of Afghanistan]].

Unlike his father, he does not possess the official title "Baba-i-Millet-i-Afghanistan" ([[Father of the Nation]] of Afghanistan).

==Marriage and children==

He was married at Kabul in 1961 to Princess Khatul Begum the daughter of Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan Zikeria, by his wife, Princess Sultana Begum. He has two sons and one daughter:

*Prince Muhammad Zahir Khan (born 1962). If he becomes king he will be known as King Mohammad VIII.
*Prince Muhammad Emel Khan (born 1969).
*Princess Hawa Khanum (born 1963).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">'''Al-Mukhtar al-Qasim''' (died 956) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]], who held or claimed power from 936 to 956.

Al-Qasim bin Ahmad was the eldest son of the imam [[An-Nasir Ahmad (Zaidi imam)|an-Nasir Ahmad]] who died in 934. An-Nasir's death ushered into a period of internal political turbulence among the Zaidis of highland Yemen. His third son [[al-Muntakhab al-Hasan]] demanded the [[imamate]], but the latter's elder brother al-Mukhtar al-Qasim lodged counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Muntakhab died in 936. However, a younger brother called [[al-Mansur Yahya]] is recognized by Zaidi [[historiography]] as the legitimate successor of an-Nasir after 934; he was supported by the majority of the Zaidis after al-Muntakhab's death.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare Ansaldi, ''Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda''. Roma 1933, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In 956, al-Mukhtar al-Qasim, who ruled from his base in [[Sa'dah]], was able to seize the important commercial and political centre [[San'a]], which had hitherto mostly belonged to the rival [[Yufirids|Yu'firid Dynasty]]. However, before the year was over, al-Mukhtar was murdered by a powerful lord from [[Hamdan]], Muhammad bin ad-Dahhak. With his death, San'a temporarily reverted to the Yafurids.&lt;ref&gt;H.C.

'''Alice Prentice Barrows''' (November 15, 1878 – October 2, 1954) was a [[secretary]] of Dr. [[William Albert Wirt (educationalist)|William A. Wirt]], who headed the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Office of Education]] in the early days of the [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]].  Barrows had been a member of the [[Communist party]] since 1919, the same year she began working for the Office of Education.  During [[World War II]] Barrows was the Executive Secretary of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship.

Born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Charles Dana Barrows and Marion Merrill, Alice graduated from [[Vassar College]] with an A.B. During 1901–03, she was employed as an English teacher at the [[Packer Collegiate Institute]], then she taught English at the Ethical School in New York City from 1903–04. She became an English teacher at her alma mater until 1908 and was a graduate fellow of [[Columbia University]]. In 1909, Alice became a social investigator for the [[Russell Sage Foundation]]. Two years later in 1911, she was named director of the Vocational Education Survey.&lt;ref name="Leonard1914"/&gt;

In 1934, a Congressional Investigation was held to examine statements Dr. Wirt made regarding a meeting in Alice Barrows home a year earlier.  The "Wirt Incident" was widely reported and provoked much controversy.  Barrows and several other government employees revealed to Wirt they were members of the Communist party. Wirt testified,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was told they believe that by thwarting our then evident economic recovery, they would be able to prolong the country's destitution until they had demonstrated to the American people that the Government must operate business and commerce.  By propaganda, they would destroy institutions making long term capital loans—and then push Uncle Sam into making these loans. Once Uncle Sam becomes our financier, he must also follow his money with control and management.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wirt further testified they told him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe we have Roosevelt in the middle of a swift stream, and that the current is so strong, that he cannot turn back or escape from it. We believe that we can keep Mr. Roosevelt there until we are ready to supplant him  with  a  [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].  We all think that Mr. Roosevelt is only  the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]]  of this [[World Revolution|revolution]]. We are on the inside. We can control the avenues of influence.  We can make the President believe that he is making decisions for himself.{{ref|73/2/4/10&amp;17/34|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A June 1945 [[Venona project]] decryption of the Washington, D.C. [[KGB]] Office to Moscow's Eighth Department, the political intelligence wing, relayed information on matters regarding [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] and Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]].  KGB agent [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]], who served on the staff of several [[U.S. Congressional subcommittee|Senate Subcommittee]]s, and Barrows are the sources of the information.  [[Mary Van Kleek]] who headed the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] and also served on the Board of the National Council, visited Washington weekly to meet with Barrows and [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]].{{ref|73/2/4/10&amp;17/34|2}}

The organization Barrows served as Director was found in 1953 to be a [[Communist front]] organization by the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB). In its Findings of Fact, the SACB said the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;advances positions...markedly pro-Soviet and...anti-[[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]]...is a Communist-action organization which has as its primary purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement under the [[hegemony]] of the Soviet Union; it has the policy to support and defend the Soviet Union under any and all circumstances...We conclude that the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, Inc., is substantially directed, dominated, and controlled by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]]...and is primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to...the Soviet Union, a Communist foreign government.{{ref|73/2/4/10&amp;17/34|3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}

The '''Bats people''' ({{lang-ka|ბაცი}}) or the '''Batsbi''' (ბაცბი) are [[Nakh languages|Nakh]]-speaking [[Tushetians]] in the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They are also known as the '''Ts’ova-Tush''' (წოვათუშები) after the Ts’ova Gorge in the historic Georgian mountain region of [[Tusheti]]. The group should not be confused with the neighbouring [[Kist people|Kists]] – also a Nakh-speaking people, migrants from Chechnya – who live in the nearby [[Pankisi Gorge]].

==Language and customs==
Part of the community still retains its own [[Bats language]], "batsbur mott", which has adopted many Georgian loan-words and grammatical rules and is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]] with the two other Nakh languages, [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]]. As Prof. Joanna Nichols put it, '[the Batsbur] language is related to Chechen and Ingush roughly as Czech is related to Russian [and the Batsbi] not belong to vai naakh nor their language to vai mott, though any speaker of Chechen or Ingush can immediately tell that the language is closely related and can understand some phrases of it. The Batsbi have not traditionally followed Vainakh customs or law, and they consider themselves Georgians.'&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Batsbur language is unwritten and the Batsbi have used Georgian as a language of literacy and trade for centuries.

The renowned Georgian ethnographer Sergi Makalatia wrote in his study of Tusheti&lt;ref&gt;Makalatia, Sergi, ''Tusheti'', Tbilisi: Komunistis Stamba, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; that "the Tsova-Tush speak their own language, which is related to [[Ingush language|Ingush]] and [[Kist language|Kist]]. This language has, however, borrowed many words from Georgian; the Tsova-Tush speak it both at home and among each other. Everybody knows the Tsova language. It is shameful not to speak it. Children start speaking Tsova-Tush and learn Georgian later."

Nowadays, all Batsbi speak Georgian (usually with a Tushetian or Kakhetian accent). Only a handful speak Batsbur with any kind of proficiency.

The Batsbi have retained very little of their separate cultural traits, and their customs and traditions now resemble those of other [[eastern Georgia|Eastern Georgian mountaineers]], particularly those of the Tush (obviously, but there are also deeper pagan-religious links between the Tush and the neighbouring Khevsur).&lt;ref&gt;Georges Charachidze, ''Le système religieux de la Géorgie païenne — Analyse structurale d’une civilisation'', Paris: François Maspero, 1968 (reprinted by La Découverte, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over ethnic origins==
The origins of the Bats are not so clear, and there are various theories.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt; As the Estonian scholar Ants Viires points out in his ''Red Book'', it is actually two separate disputes: the first being whether it was Nakh tribes or Old Georgians that inhabited Tusheti first, the second being from which (or both) the Bats are descended.&lt;ref name=redbook/&gt;

===Descent from 16th century Ingush migrants===
Some scholars, such as Caucasus linguist Johanna Nichols, argue that the Batsbi crossed the Greater Caucasus range from Ingushetia in the seventeenth century and eventually settled in [[Tusheti]],&lt;ref&gt;NICHOLS, Johanna, "The Origin of the Chechen and Ingush: A Study in Alpine Linguistic and Ethnic Geography", ''Anthropological Linguistics'', Vol. 46, No. 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 and 20(c) in ALLEN, W.E.D. (Ed.), ''Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings – 1589–1605'', The Hakluyt Society, Second Series No. CXXXVIII, Cambridge University Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are therefore a tribe of Ingush origin which was Christianized and "Georgianized" over the centuries.

===Descent from the South Caucasian Nakh tribes===
Others hold that they are descended from ancient Nakh tribes inhabiting the region.&lt;ref name=redbook/&gt; Caucasus historian [[Amjad Jaimoukha]] argues that there was once a larger ethnic group in Kakheti called the "Kakh" in Old Georgian, who he believes called themselves "Kabatsa" and were "Tushians of Nakh extraction".&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad. ''The Chechens: A Handbook''. Routledge Curzon: Oxon, 2005. Page 30. "The Kakh(etians), who used to call themselves Kabatsas and their territory Kakh-Batsa, were surrounded by Nakh tribes and were themselves thought to be Tushians of Nakh extraction. The eighteenth-century historian Vakhushti asserted that the Kakh considered the Gligvs, Dzurdzuks and Kist as their ethnic kin."&lt;/ref&gt; Jaimoukha notes that according to an 18th-century Georgian historian named Vakhushti, the Kakh considered other confirmed Nakh peoples as their kin.

Another theory is that the Georgian name (Tsova-Tush) may be linked to the ''Tsov'', who were claimed by the Georgian historian Melikishvilli to have been Nakh and ruled over the [[Kingdom of Sophene]] in Urartu (called Tsobena in Georgian) who were apparently forcefully moved to the region around [[Erebuni, Armenia|Erebuni]], a region linked by some to [[Nakh peoples]] by place names and various historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Джавахишвили И. А. Введение в историю грузинского народа. кн.1, Тбилиси, 1950, page.47-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ахмадов |first=Шарпудин Бачуевич |title=Чечня и Ингушетия в XVIII - начале XIX века |year= 2002|publisher= "Джангар", АПП|location=[[Elista]] |isbn= 5-94587-072-2 |page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Гаджиева В. Г. Сочинение И. Гербера Описание стран и народов между Астраханью и рекою Курой находящихся, М, 1979, page.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descent from Old Georgian tribes===
Ants Viires also notes that there are theories involving the Bats being descended from Old Georgian tribes who adopted a Nakh language.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt; According to this theory, the Batsbi are held to have originated from Georgian pagan tribes who fled the Christianization being implemented by the Georgian monarchy. A couple of these tribes are thought to have adopted a Nakh language as a result of contact with Nakh peoples.

==Tsovata and migration to Kakheti==
[[File:Map of the Tsova Gorge ("Tsovata") in Tusheti.JPG|thumb|Map of the Tsova Gorge ("Tsovata") in Tusheti]]

{{wide image|tsovata.jpg|1988px|alt=A panorama of Tsovata in the mountainous eastern Georgian region of Tusheti. The photograph was taken during the Bats people's annual summer festival (''dadaloba'') in 2010.|A panorama of Tsovata in the mountainous eastern Georgian region of Tusheti. The photograph was taken during the Bats people's annual summer festival (''dadaloba'') in 2010. The small square stone building half-way up the hill on the left-hand side of the panorama is the shrine of "k'en [old] sameb [Trinity, from the Georgian ''sameba'']"; the ruined village with two stone towers just right of centre is Indurta, historically the Bats people's main settlement.}}

The Batsbi's villages in the Ts'ova Gorge (''Tsovata'') were Ts'aro, Shavts'qala, Nazarta, Nadirta, Mozarta, Indurta, Sagirta and Etelta. Each was inhabited by one or several extended families who believed they shared a common ancestor. In the early nineteenth century, following the destruction of two of their villages by landslides and an outbreak of the [[Black Death|plague]], the Batsbi abandoned their eight villages in the Ts'ova Gorge in western Tusheti and began to migrate down to the lowlands on the left bank of the [[Alazani]] river in western Kakheti.

A significant proportion of the village's women work in Europe and in America, sending money home to the village. Many men still work as shepherds or cowherds, most of them wintering the animals in the Shiraki lowlands (south-eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], on the border with neighbouring [[Azerbaijan]]) and then taking them up to summer pastures in Tusheti (a two- to three-week journey).

According to a study written and published by Prof. Roland Topshishvili&lt;ref&gt;Topshishvili, Prof. Roland, ''The Tsova-Tushs (the Batsbs)'', study published as part of the University of Frankfurt's ECLING project, available online: http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/coll/0001/000070&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the University of Frankfurt's ECLING project, the Batsbi only lived in temporary dwellings around Alvani in winter. In the summer, the men and their families would lead their flocks of sheep up to summer pastures around Tbatana and in Tsovata, returning to Alvani in the autumn.

Prof. Joanna Nichols also wrote about the migration of the Batsbi in her article on "The Origin of the Chechen and Ingush":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Batsbi tradition as recorded by Desheriev (1953, 1963) preserves memory of a two-stage descent: first, abandonment of the original highland area in northern Tusheti, settling of villages lower in the mountains, and a period of transhumance plus permanent descents of a few families; then, complete abandonment of the highlands and year-round settlement in the lowlands after a flood destroyed one of the secondary mountain villages in the early nineteenth century. That is, Batsbi lowland outposts were established by a combination of transhumance and individual resettlements, and some time later there was a sizable migration into an established outpost.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, "The Origin of the Chechen and Ingush: A Study in Alpine Linguistic and Ethnic Geography", in ''Anthropological Linguistics'', Vol. 46, No. 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the Batsbi currently live in the village of Zemo ("Upper") Alvani in the eastern Georgian province of [[Kakheti]], close to the town of [[Akhmeta]] (at the mouth of the [[Pankisi Gorge]]). Around half of Zemo Alvani's c.7,000 inhabitants are of Bats origin.

==Historical population figures==
The first reference to the Batsbi in European ethnographical literature is in the chapter on the Tush and Tusheti in [[Johann Anton Güldenstädt|Johannes Güldenstädt]]'s ''Reisen durch Rußland und im Caucasischen Gebürge'' ["Travels through Russia and in the Mountains of the Caucasus"], published posthumously by [[Peter Simon Pallas]] between 1787 and 1791,&lt;ref&gt;Güldenstädt, Johann Anton. ''Reisen durch Rußland und im Caucasischen Gebürge''. 2 Volumes, Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg: 1787. pp. 376-378 of Volume 1. (An updated, re-edited version of Güldenstädt's ''Reisen'' was also published by [[Julius Klaproth]] in the "Verlage der Stuhrschen Buchhandlung" in 1834, under the title ''Dr. J.A. Güldenstädts Beschreibung der kaukasischen Länder — Aus seinen Papieren gänzlich umgearbeitet, verbessert herausgegeben und mit erklärenden Anmerkungen begleitet von Julius Klaproth''.)&lt;/ref&gt; although Güldenstädt does not mention them by name, merely pointing out instead that "Kistian and Georgian are spoken equally in the 4 first-named villages [in the Ts'ova Gorge]. Their inhabitants could also more easily be descendants of the Kists than the other Tush" ["In den 4 erstgennanten Dörfern wird kistisch mit georgischen untermengt gesprochen. Die Einwohner können auch leicht mehr als die übrigen von Kisten gern abstammen."].

Figures from the Russian imperial census of 1873 given in Dr. Gustav Radde's ''Die Chews'uren und ihr Land — ein monographischer Versuch untersucht im Sommer 1876''&lt;ref&gt;Radde, Dr. Gustav, ''Die Chews'uren und ihr Land — ein monographischer Versuch untersucht im Sommer 1876'', Cassel: 1878&lt;/ref&gt; include the Bats villages in the Ts'ova Gorge (dividing them into the "Indurta" and "Sagirta" communities):

* Indurta community: 191 households, consisting of 413 men and 396 women, totalling 809 souls
* Sagirta community: 153 households (Sagirta proper: 79; Ts'aro: 26; Etelta: 48), consisting of 372 men and 345 women, totalling 717 souls

1873 TOTAL: 344 households, consisting of 785 men and 741 women, in all 1,526 souls.

Dr. Radde adds:
'The members of [these two communities] have largely emigrated to the lowlands along the Alazani River, to the east of Akhmeta; they move up in summer to the rich pastures of Tbatana at the southern end of the Massara mountain range (see Itinerary), but still consider Indurta as their property and even leave 2-3 families living there in winter. [The Ts'ova Gorge is situated] By the north-western spring of the Tusheti Alazani River. [...] Together, these two communities made up the Ts'ova community until 1866.'

==The decline of the Bats/Tsova-Tush language==

Concerning the slow decline of Batsbur as a language, Prof. Topshishvili's writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'In the scientific literature, especially in the Soviet Russian ethnographic science great attention was paid to the marriage facts of people of different languages. Russians were greatly interested in russification of the people living in the Russian empire to make them speak Russian. In the Soviet Russian ethnographic literature (I. Bromlei and others) it is emphasized that the problems rise in the languages of small groups when the percentage of their daughters-in-law of different languages exceeds 15-20%. In this case, the language gradually faces the danger. In such families the children do not speak their fathers’ languages (especially when there do not live grandmother and grandfather in the family). The children start speaking their mothers’ language from the very beginning and speak it afterwards.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'In this view, we got interested in the situation of the Tsova-Tushs at their compact dwelling place in the village Zemo (Upper) Alvani. In the local village board 398 married couples are officially registered. As it turned out, in the last 10-12 years, the considerable part of the married couples, because of different reasons (financial-economic conditions, moving registration center from village to the region center), are not registered officially. It appeared that, from the 398 couples only 226 are Tsova-Tushs. i.e. 226 Tush men’s wives are also Tsova- Tushs. That makes 56-57%. The rest men’s wives are aliens. The most of the latter are the women speaking Tush dialect of Georgian. There are also many women from the different villages of Kakheti region. Several Russian, Kist, Ossethian and Armenian women were also recorded. Thus, the percentage of those women in the Tsova families not speaking the Tsova-Tush language is 43, 22%.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'According to ethnographic data was proved that until the 60-70s of the XX century, the most of the Tsova-Tush (Batsbis) men entered into marriage with Tsova-Tush women. Though, even then were not rare the facts of marrying women speaking Tush dialect of the Georgian language. (Many of them were also studying the Tsova-Tush language. By the way, the Tsova-Tush women married to Georgian-speaking men, often taught their language to their children) But it does not exceed the considerable limit. The above mentioned conjugal relations lasted until the time when the marriage matter was a competence of the parents. Since the parents do not interfere in marriage matters of their children and the young people decide their fate independently, the most Tsova-Tush men often find their partners in other villages. All this reasoned in the dying-out of the Tsova-Tush (Batsb) language. Only 25-30 years ago existing bilingual situation is disappearing and the most part of the population uses Georgian as the usual language. The fact is that, the most Tsova-Tushs (Batsbis) consider this event as quite normal and only some of them are very sorry for that, especially the old people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'It is also a remarkable fact that in disappearance of the Tsova-Tush (Batsb) language, the role of human factor should be eliminated. The indifference towards the above matter could be explained by their Georgian consciousness. They are the organic part of the Georgian nation and do not differ from other Georgians with their traditions, customs and habits and mentality.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bila''', or '''Forest Bira''', is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Mbuti]] Pygmies called [[Kango people|Kango]] and Sua (Batchua).&lt;ref&gt;''L'Apare est un ruisseau, affluent de l'Ituri en région des Bantous Babali.  La route qui relie Bafwasende à Bomili traverse le village, où réside ce groupe de Pygmées devenus sédentaires.  Dans la documentation de l'expédition de 1929 et de 1935, ils étaient désignés sous le nom de Basua [page] Babali aux Bango ''wa mugwase'' (ou Pygme'es de forêt). Après l'expédition de 1949–50, l'auteur préfère substituer à ces deux appellations, données par les Babali, leurs propres noms : les Pygmées de forêt désignent ceux de village du nom de Balioli (=Belueli) (sing. Dioy) et vice-versa ceux-ci désignent les Pygmées de forêt du nom de Bango (sing. Mwango).''&lt;/ref&gt; The other Mbuti speak [[Central Sudanic languages]]. The Kango and Sua speak distinct dialects (southern and northern), but not enough to impair mutual intelligibility with their farming Bila patrons.

Maho (2009) lists Ibutu (Mbuttu, D.313) as a distinct language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8975">'''Bodhi Vamsa''' or '''Bodhahara''' is a [[Sri Lankan caste system|caste]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was also referred to as Panna Dura, Villi Dura, or simply the Dura caste during the colonial period. Originally, members were appointed as guardians of the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]] tree.

== History ==

The caste traces its origin to the arrival of the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree in Sri Lanka. [[Dipavamsa]], the earliest document of the history of Sri Lanka, states that the following persons came to the island with or associated with Sri Mahabodhi.&lt;ref&gt;The Dipavamsa, An ancient Buddhist historical record, Hermann Oldernberg, Asian Educational Services, Fourth reprint, New Delhi, 2006, p 88, p 195&lt;/ref&gt;

# Eight [[Kshatriya]] who were entrusted with protecting the Bodhi Tree
# Bodhiguptha and Chandraguptha
# Sixteen ''Lanka Mahalekhas'' (''Lambakarnas'')
# Castes (or families) that received golden drums used for royal coronations (''Lambakarnas'')

The Mahavamsa records state that during the reign of King Parakramabahu I, three ''[[Lambakarna clan|lambakarnas]]'' (or mahalekha), were sent to southern India for a coronation festival.&lt;ref&gt;Mahavansha (Sinhala),Buddhist Cultural Center,7 th reprint,2010,pp 382&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they are either descendents of Bodhiguptha, Chandragupta, eight kshatriyas or from the [[gotra]] lambakarnas. Mahavamsa itself contains a narrative of this incident which is less credible than Dipavamsa. It states that eighteen families of gods, eighteen families of ministers, eight families of Brahmins, eight families of kelembi etc. have been sent from India.&lt;ref&gt;Mahavansha (Sinhala), Buddhist Cultural Center, 7th reprint, 2010, pp 81&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a certain ''"eight situ families are specifically mentioned as Bodahara Caste"''.&lt;ref&gt;Mahavansha (Sinhala), Buddhist Cultural Center, 7th reprint, 2010, pp 84&lt;/ref&gt; According to later sources, these situ clans are Bodhiguptha, Chandragupta, Samudragupta, Sumitta, Devagupta, Sooryagupta, Dharmagupta, and Juthidara, relatives of King Dharmashoka. It was commonly believed that the members of this caste were descendants of this clan (in particular, Bodhiguptha), and are also connected to the ''lambakarnas''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=හාරිස්පත්තුවේ ආරියවංශාලංකාර හිමි|url=http://www.silumina.lk/2013/10/27/_art.asp?fn=af1310274|website=Silumina|accessdate=13 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141204032715/http://www.silumina.lk/2013/10/27/_art.asp?fn=af1310274|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumbara Harispaththuwa Amarapura Puranaya, H.S.S. Nissanka, Department of Cultural Affairs, 2000, pp 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with Sinhalese royalty==

Many Sinhalese royals prior to the Kandyan era claimed descent from the families that accompanied the [[Bodhi Tree|Sri Maha Bodhi]]. For example, ''[[Kawyashekaraya]]'', a Kotte era literary source mentions:

මහබෝ රකින ලෙස
සැලසු බෝ කලක්‌ වැස
එමහ බෝ අබියස
විසූ කුලයන් මෙලක මුල් බැස

සිරි සඟබෝ නිරිඳු
විකුම් වැඩි මහසෙන් රදු
කිත්සිරි මේ නිරිඳු
බුජස්‌ මහනම කුමර දස්‌ රඳු

The above two verses refer to castes that were entrusted to protect the Bodhi tree establishing roots in the country and producing kings like Sirisangabo, Mahasen, Kithsiri mewan, Buddhdasa, Mahanama, and Kumaradasa. However, due to the absence of direct descendants who claim to be of this caste, it is difficult to prove that this is the same royal clan that lost power by the 17th century. 

The following provides further evidence for royal lineage:

* The term "pannadura" literally means officials assigned with temples, or ''pannasala''. In historical sources similar officials are referred to as ''aramikas'' and inscriptions as ''veherkami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inscriptions of Ceylon, Volume V|last=|first=|publisher=Department of Archeology|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahavamsa]] historical chronicle states that [[King Aggabodhi I]] assigned a hundred of his relatives to be ''aramikas''.
* Some of the people belonging to this caste still attend to the duties assigned to the [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] holy tree to this day.

==Colonial period==

Since the 17th century, the status of the Bodhivansha caste gradually declined as a result of social changes due to western colonial influence. Throughout the colonial period, particularly during the British colonial era, it was portrayed as several disconnected castes with names such as pannadura, villidura, and dura that were not in use prior to the 17th century. Jobs like grass cutting&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Ryan, ''Caste in Modern Ceylon'', Rutgers University Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1855 Ceylon Gazetteer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ievers, R. W., Manual of the North-central Province of Ceylon, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed by various writers without referring to historical and literary sources like the [[Dipavamsa]], [[Mahavamsa]], or [[Pujavaliya]]. During this time of decline, they functioned mainly as soldiers, with some holding high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakehouse.lk/budusarana/2012/12/20/tmp.asp?ID=fea08&lt;/ref&gt; Their military capability is visible even after the collapse of Kanyan kingdom, as they actively supported rebellions of 1818, 1834, and 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Eric P.|title=Historical Aspects of Caste in the Kandyan Regions with Particular Reference to the non-Goyigama Castes of the Kagalla District|journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Humanities|date=2014|volume=40|pages=21–54|url=http://sljh.sljol.info/686/volume/40/issue/0/|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also functioned as royal officers attached to various departments like the [[Kuruwe]] (elephant men), royal stables, and prisons.

{{Update-EB|date=January 2017}}
The '''Bongo''' are an ethnic group living in [[South Sudan]], mostly in the [[Tonj District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/ThePeopleandDemographicsofSouthSudan/Bongo/tabid/187/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Bongo language]], one of the [[Bongo-Baka languages]].
Unlike the Dinka and other Nilotic groups, the Bongo are not a cattle herding people and do not use cows for bride price. Subsistence farming is the primary source of food, though money is obtained by working in forestry, building, selling honey, and other various means.

[[Georg August Schweinfurth]], who lived two years among them, declared that before the advent of the slave-raiders, {{circa|1850}}, they numbered at least 300,000. Slave-raiders, and later the dervishes, greatly reduced their numbers, and it was not until the establishment of effective control by the Sudan government (1904–1906) that recuperation was possible.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Bongo|volume=4|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the twentieth century, Bongo men formerly wore only a loin-cloth, and many dozen iron rings on the arms (arranged to form a sort of armour), while the women had simply a girdle, to which was attached a tuft of grass. Both sexes now largely use cotton cloths as dresses. The tribal ornaments consist of nails or plugs which are passed through the lower lip. The women often wear a disk several inches in diameter in this fashion, together with a ring or a bit of straw in the upper lip, straws in the ''alae'' of the nostrils, and a ring in the ''septum''. The Bongo, unlike other of the upper Nile Negroes, are not great cattle-breeders, but employ their time in agriculture. The crops mostly cultivated were sorghum, tobacco, sesame and durra.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''Bosnian Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]]s whose ancestry can be traced to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. At the 2011 [[Canada 2011 Census|Canadian census]], 22,920 people stated that they are of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] descent.&lt;ref name=2011Census/&gt;
The majority of Bosnian Canadians emigrated to [[Canada]] as [[refugee]]s during and after the [[Bosnian War]], which lasted from 1992-1995. The history of Bosnian arrivals to Canada, however, dates back to as far as the 19th century.&lt;ref name=immigration-online.org /&gt;

==History==
The traditional centers of residence and culture for Bosnian Canadians are located in [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]]. Numerous [[Bosnian language]] newspapers and other periodicals are published in many states. The largest Bosnian organisation in Canada is the [[Congress of North American Bosniaks]].&lt;ref name=bosniak.org /&gt;

==Religion==

The Bosnian Islamic Association Gazi Husrev-Beg was founded in November 1977 under the name 'Association of Islamic Community Gazi Husrev-Beg'. It has been operating under its current name (BIAGH) ever since 1995. The primary reason of its foundation was to respond to the religious needs of its members. That was made possible through a full-time imam, who has been serving this community uninterruptedly since June 1982. The BIAGH caters to the needs of Bosniaks that pertain to Bosniak tradition, folklore, sport and different creative workshops.

Most Bosnian-Canadians either identify as Muslim, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic or non-religious.

{{Other uses|Chamber of Peers (disambiguation){{!}}Chamber of Peers}}

The '''Chamber of Peers of Portugal''', alternatively translatable as the '''[[House of Lords]]''' and formally styled the '''Chamber of the Most Worthy Peers of the Kingdom''' (Portuguese: ''Câmara dos Pares'' or ''Câmara dos Digníssimos Pares do Reino'') was the [[upper house]] of the [[Cortes Gerais]], the legislature of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] during most of the [[constitutional monarchy]] period. Members of the Chamber were [[Peers of the Realm]], appointed directly at the pleasure of the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese monarch]].

==History==
[[File:Uniforme dos Pares do Reino (1860) - Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro, Arquivo Histórico Parlamentar.png|upright|left|thumb|The uniform of [[Peers of the Realm]] while the Chamber was in session; 1860.]]
It was established before the [[Liberal Wars]]. The king appointed a number of the highest nobility to the chamber. It was composed of 90 peerages, who did not have a hereditary right to sit by descent, but were nominated by the king.

The chamber existed from 1826-1838 and again from 1842-1910, when it was known as the Chamber of Peers of the Realm (''Câmara dos Pares do Reino'').&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.parlamento.pt/catalog.aspx?cid=mc.cp1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.parlamento.pt/catalog.aspx?cid=mc.cp2&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the members was [[João Afonso da Costa de Sousa de Macedo, 1st Duke of Albuquerque]].

The chamber met at the [[São Bento Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlamento.pt/Parlamento/Paginas/SalaCapitulo.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The successor of the chamber was the [[Senate of the Republic of Portugal#Second Senate (1911–1933)|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlamento.pt/VisitaParlamento/Paginas/Senado.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese Cambodians''' are [[Cambodia]]n citizens of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] or partial Chinese descent. The [[Khmer language|Khmer]] term ''Khmer kat Chen'' ({{lang|km|ខ្មែរកាត់ចិន}}) is used for people of mixed Cambodian and Chinese descent while ''Khmer Chen'' ({{lang|km|ខ្មែរចិន}}) can mean Cambodian-born citizen of Chinese ancestry. [[Khmer people]] constitute the largest ethnic group in Cambodia among whom ''Chen'' means "Chinese".

==History==
=== Earliest verified communities ===
The earliest records of Chinese settlement dates back to the late 13th century. Yuan emissary [[Zhou Daguan]] visited Cambodia in 1296 and authored his detailed and comprehensive ''Record of Cambodia'' in which he mentions the presence of Chinese residents at Angkor.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese seafarers noted the presence of a Chinese settlement in Phnom Penh in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Lim To Khieng, a Chinese privateer made similar observation during his stay in Cambodia while trading and conducting sea raids.&lt;ref name="Xu2005-10"&gt;Xu and Shen (2005), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644, Chinese troops under the command of [[Mac Cuu]] and [[Duong Ngan Dich]] encouraged large numbers of refugees from Fujian and Guangdong provinces to settle in [[Indochina]].&lt;ref name="Willmott6"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Michel Filippi|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/special-reports/history-chinese-cambodia|title=A history of the Chinese in Cambodia|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the immigrants were men who eventually married local Khmer women. Their descendants usually assimilated smoothly into the local communities, the economic and social process and personally identified as Cambodians. However, customs were also imported, such as the practice of the Chinese topknot that was practized until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nyíri, Savelʹev (2002), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rs4IBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23 |author=Zhou Daguan|title= A Record of Cambodia |translator= Peter Harris |publisher=University of Washington Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-9749511244 |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French rule (1867–1950) ===
The French first introduced a legislation in 1873 which classified Chinese immigrants as 'Alien Asians' and subjects were subjected to resident taxes. King Norodom introduced a legislative reform in 1884 which required the Chinese immigrants to pay higher resident taxes but there were no legal restrictions imposed for immigrants to take up Cambodian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, the French introduced a legislation first introduced by [[Gia Long]] in Cochinchina, called "bang" in Chinese. Five associations were established in Cambodia, each identified by their specific region of ancestral origin in China; Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainanese, Teochew and Hakka. Chinese immigrants were required to register with their association to settle in Cambodia. Each of these associations were led by an elected headman, who would be responsible for maintaining law, order and tax collection duties from their countrymen.&lt;ref name="Nyiri257"&gt;Nyíri, Savelʹev (2002), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence===
The French system of administering the Chinese Cambodian community was terminated in 1958. During the 1960s, Chinese community affairs tended to be handled, at least in Phnom Penh, by the Chinese Hospital Committee, an organization set up to fund and to administer a hospital established earlier for the Chinese community.

This committee was the largest association of Chinese merchants in the country, and it was required by the organization's constitution to include on its fifteen-member board six people from the Teochew group, three from the Cantonese, two from the Hokkien, two from the Hakka, and two from the Hainanese. The hospital board constituted the recognized leadership of Phnom Penh's Chinese community. Local Chinese school boards in the smaller cities and towns often served a similar function.

This was to be a high point in terms of the rights of the Chinese minorities. Cambodian independence in 1953 saw a regression in their treatment by state authorities and the previously existing autonomy was eliminated by the new government. However, many private associations - cultural, business-oriented and to do with education - were simply continued by the Chinese communities and clan associations themselves, as these communities still had very significant economic and political power. Anti-Chinese feeling and policies emerged, however, after the coup of 1970 which saw the establishing of a pro-West government which considered the neighbouring People's Republic of China a dangerous threat - and the Chinese minorities in Cambodia as a possible fifth column.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The year 1970 thus marks the beginning of almost two decades of severe repression of the Chinese minorities in Cambodia. It was after this point that Cambodian authorities started forcing the closure of Chinese schools and newspapers, requiring the Chinese to carry special identity papers, imposing special taxes on the Chinese and moving towards denying them Cambodian citizenship.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the Khmer Rouge regime appeared to have a more ‘tolerant' ethnic policy initially, it continued to discriminate against the Chinese once it had completed its takeover of Cambodia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The continued discrimination, however, now rested on class rather than ethnic grounds; since the majority of urban Chinese were traders, they were classified as ‘capitalists' by the revolutionary regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While there is no evidence that the Chinese were particularly targeted in the Khmer Rouge purges,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} their population in Cambodia was probably reduced by half in the four years of Khmer Rouge rule;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} it seems that there was an increased number of anti-Chinese events just prior to the Vietnamese invasion which brought an end to the Pol Pot regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea after the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 was not completely positive for the Chinese minorities. Partly because of tensions between China and Vietnam, the new Cambodian authorities adopted restrictive measures against the remaining members of the Chinese minorities, including banning them from returning to urban trades.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 1971 the government authorized the formation of a new body, the Federated Association of Chinese of Cambodia, which was the first organization to embrace all of Cambodia's resident Chinese. According to its statutes, the federation was designed to "aid Chinese nationals in the social, cultural, public health, and medical fields," to administer the property owned jointly by the Chinese community in Phnom Penh and elsewhere, and to promote friendly relations between Cambodians and Chinese.

With leadership that could be expected to include the recognized leaders of the national Chinese community, the federation was believed likely to continue the trend, evident since the early 1960s, to transcend dialect group allegiance in many aspects of its social, political, and economic programs.

Generally, relations between the Chinese and the ethnic Khmer were good. There was some intermarriage, and a sizable proportion of the population in Cambodia was part Sino-Khmer, who were assimilated easily into either the Chinese or the Khmer community. Willmott assumes that a Sino-Khmer elite dominated commerce in Cambodia from the time of independence well into the era of the Khmer Republic.

===Under the Khmer Rouge===
The Khmer Rouge takeover was catastrophic for the Chinese community for several reasons. When the Khmer Rouge took over a town, they immediately disrupted the local market. According to Willmott, this disruption virtually eliminated retail trade "and the traders (almost all Chinese) became indistinguishable from the unpropertied urban classes."&lt;ref&gt;Nyíri, Savelʹev (2002), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese, in addition to having their livelihood eradicated on the whole, also suffered because of their socioeconomic class. They were mainly well-educated urban merchants, and thus were characteristic of the people whom the Khmer Rouge detested.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |title=Templates of "Chineseness" and Trajectories of Cambodian Chinese Entrepreneurship in Phnom Penh* |website=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam |pages=67–72 |access-date=2017-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816021339/https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |archive-date=2017-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese refugees have reported that they shared the same brutal treatment as other urban Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge régime but they were not discriminated against as an ethnic group until after the Vietnamese invasion due to the PRC's support of the Khmer Rouge. Several of the most senior members of the Khmer Rouge were themselves of partial Chinese descent, such as [[Nuon Chea]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Khieu Samphan]], [[Kang Kek Iew]], [[Son Sen]], [[Ta Mok]] and even [[Pol Pot]] himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; King Sihanouk saw the delineation and repression of Chinese business and identity as nationalism emerged and the Chinese were perceived as threatening to Cambodian sovereignty. During the various regimes between 1970 and 1990, Chinese enterprise and cultural expression was completely banned and destroyed and many ethnic Chinese died or fled the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/survival-cambodias-ethnic-minorities |title= THE SURVIVAL OF CAMBODIA'S ETHNIC MINORITIES |date=September 1, 1990 |author=Ben Kiernan   | publisher= Cultural Survival |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the PRK/SOC===
Following the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] and the fall of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], the new pro-[[Hanoi]] [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] regime lifted some of the oppressive rules imposed on ethnic Chinese by the Khmer Rouge government. Chinese newspapers were allowed and the ban on speaking Chinese at home was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Policy, Culture, and Identity in Asian Contexts|author1=Amy B. M. Tsui |author2=James W. Tollefson |year=2006|pages=110–5|publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]]|isbn=0-8058-5693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  partial restrictions and a certain amount of suspicion remained, for the [[Eastern Bloc|pro-Soviet]] PRK regime resented China's support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting against it, now renamed as the "[[National Army of Democratic Kampuchea]]" (NADK). Observers at the time believed that the lingering anti-Chinese stance of the PRK government and of its officials in Phnom Penh made it unlikely that a Chinese community of the same scale as before the Khmer Rouge could resurface in Cambodia in the near future.

The conditions for the ethnic Chinese, however, improved greatly under the SOC, the transitional avatar of the PRK after 1989. Restrictions placed on them by the former PRK gradually disappeared. The State of Cambodia allowed ethnic Chinese to observe their particular religious customs and Chinese language schools were reopened. In 1991, two years after the SOC's foundation, the [[Chinese New Year]] was officially celebrated in Cambodia for the first time since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/Ledgerwood/Part4.htm Judy Ledgerwood, ''Cambodian Recent History and Contemporary Society;'' 1989-1993 State of Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern years===
Of particular note is China's economic role in the country, which encouraged Sino-Khmer businessmen to reestablish their past business which were once suppressed by the Khmer Rouge. The modern Cambodian economy is highly dependent on Sino-Khmer companies who controlled a large stake in the country's economy, and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers who are of at least part-Chinese ancestry themselves.&lt;ref name="infzm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes2"/&gt;

The Chinese language study is increasing in Phnom Penh, with the subject recently added to the national curriculum at the university level. Many Cambodians of ethnic Chinese descent learn Chinese for employment as well as business reasons due to the fact as many Mainland Chinese investors are investing across the Cambodian economy.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"/&gt;

The position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. For various reasons, including the growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Chinese companies, the Chinese community has seen its numbers expand dramatically in the 2000s (decade). There has been a huge growth in Chinese-language schools, often generously supported by the government of China through subsidies, and also in the production of textbooks (in Chinese) that incorporate Cambodian history and seminars for teachers. There may be close to 100 such schools today (2007). One of these private schools claims to be the largest overseas Chinese school in the world, with some 10,000 students. A number of Chinese-language newspapers began to be published in the country after 1993, and state television broadcasting even included a news segment in Chinese after 1998. All of the main political parties in Cambodia now appear sensitive to the clout of the Chinese minority, publishing campaign material in Chinese in the last elections. While this minority faced serious discrimination until the 1980s, it appears that that period has come to an end and that they no longer appear to be victimized by state authorities and are allowed to prosper under Hun Sen.&lt;ref name="Minority"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3288/cambodia/chinese.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous People|publisher=Minority Rights Group International|accessdate=2011-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203102234/http://www.minorityrights.org/3288/cambodia/chinese.html|archivedate=2011-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to statistics from the Ministry of Planning by the Cambodian government, approximately 15,000 individuals, or 0.1% out of the country's total population of 15 million were identified as ethnic Chinese in 2013.&lt;ref name="MOP2014"/&gt; A year later, Chinese associations in Phnom Penh estimates that around 700,000 Cambodians have at least some Chinese ancestry.&lt;ref name="MoeunPPPost"&gt;{{cite web|author=Moeun Nhean|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/special-reports/chinese-new-year-family-food-and-prosperity-year-ahead|title=Chinese New Year: family, food and prosperity for the year ahead|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government census done in 1962 showed that 163,000 individuals Cambodian nationals were registered as Chinese, which amounted to as much as 3% of the country's population. The [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal|ECCC]] had noted that then-[[Norodom Sihanouk|Prince Sihanouk]] had estimated the Chinese population in Cambodia made up of 300,000 to 435,000 individuals in 1965, while CIA had estimated that there were about 444,000 Chinese in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/documents/courtdoc/D140_1_1_Public_Redacted_EN.PDF|title=Khmer Rouge Victims in Cambodia, 197501979 – A critical assessment of major estimates|publisher=Extraordinary courts in the Chambers of Cambodia|pages=47–49|id=00385243|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A University field study conducted by William Willmott in 1961 found that there were 425,000 Chinese in Cambodia, which made up to approximately 7.4% of the total population at that time.&lt;ref name="Willmott16"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Willmott noted that there is a tendency for some Chinese who have taken up Cambodian citizenship, or Chinese descendants who have assimilated into Khmer society through intermarriages to be identified as Khmer in government censuses.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s and early 1970s the approximately 425,000 Chinese Cambodians represented the largest ethnic minority in Cambodia. However, this number had fallen to a mere 61,400 by 1984. This rapid decline has been attributed to the accumulation of causes like warfare, economic stagnation, the [[Khmer Rouge]] era and subsequent [[emigration]].&lt;ref name=stud&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/45.htm |title= The Chinese |date= |author=   | publisher= Country Studies |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official censuses between 2004 and 2008 recorded that Chinese consisted of 0.3% of the country's total urban population and are concentrated mostly in Phnom Penh, while Chinese fluctuated between 0.0% and 0.1% of the country's total rural population between 2004 and 2013.&lt;ref name="MOP2014"/&gt; Willmott's study of Chinese in Cambodia's urban and rural areas in 1963 recorded that 59% of the Chinese lived in cities and towns while 41% lived in the countryside. Phnom Penh had a Chinese population of 135,000, or about one-third (33.5%) the city's total population.&lt;ref name="Willmott16"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Chinese Cambodian kids.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cambodian-Chinese children in Phnom Penh]]

===Teochew===
The [[Teochew people]] make up the largest Chinese sub-group in Cambodia and make up about 77% of the Chinese population. About 85% of the Teochews in Cambodia came from the prefectures of [[Jieyang]] and [[Shantou]] of [[Guangdong]] province in China. The earliest records of Teochew immigrants dates back to the 16th century when some mutineers under the leadership of the Chinese pirate, Lim To Khieng settled in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="Xu2005-10"/&gt; No significant of Chinese immigration from the [[Chaoshan]] region occurred until the 1860s, and the Teochews came to Cambodia in modest numbers in the later part of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Xu and Shen (2005), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale immigration occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Teochews established themselves as the dominant Chinese sub-group thereafter. Approximately 48% of the Teochews live in rural area, and they made up about 90% of the rural Chinese population.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Teochews is also the largest sub-group in Cambodia, where some 100,000 out of 135,000 Chinese in 1962 are from this sub-group.&lt;ref name="Willmott104"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 104 – Table A: Chinese Urban Population in Cambodia by province and language group&lt;/ref&gt; Teochews in rural region of the country generally make their living as village shopkeepers, rural credit moneylenders, rice merchants or as vegetable farmers. In Phnom Penh and the smaller towns, the Teochews are generally import-export [[Entrepot]] traders, pharmacists or street peddlars.&lt;ref name="Willmott18"&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantonese===
The [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] are also known as "Chen-Catung" in Khmer language. They made up the largest Chinese sub-group in Cambodia between the 17th century until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; lived mainly in the city. About 40% of the Cantonese are concentrated in Phnom Penh,&lt;ref name="Willmott18"/&gt; while most of the remainder are found in [[Banteay Meanchey]], [[Battambang]], [[Kampong Cham City|Kampong Cham]], [[Kampong Chhnang (city)|Kampong Chhnang]] and [[Kratié (town)|Kratie]] where they make up at least 30% of the Chinese populace.&lt;ref name="Willmott104"/&gt; About 55% of the Cantonese came from the prefectures of [[Dongguan]], [[Guangzhou]] and [[Foshan]] in [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1880s and 1890s, Chinese real estate developers of Cantonese origin secured building contracts from the French colonial government, to develop brick-and-concrete shophouses in a programme of urban renewal of modernizing Phnom Penh.&lt;ref&gt;Muller (2006), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The Cantonese, who comprised the majority of Chinese Cambodians before the Teochew migrations began in the late 1930s, lived mainly in the city. Typically, the Cantonese engaged in transportation and in the skilled construction trades mainly as mechanics or carpenters.&lt;ref name="Hays"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/asian/cat66/sub418/entry-4309.html |title=Different Chinese Groups in Cambodia|last=Hays |first=Jeffrey  |date=June 15, 2015 |website=Facts and Details}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hainanese===
More than 80 percent of the [[Hainanese people]] traced their origins from [[Wenchang]] county. People from [[Hainan]] settled in Cambodia from the early 18th century under [[Mạc Cửu]], who established a trading settlement that spanned modern-day [[Ha Tien]], [[Kampot province]] and [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]].&lt;ref name="Willmott6"/&gt; Early Hainanese settlers started off as entrepot traders but turned to pepper trading at the end of the 18th century. They established pepper plantations in Kampot, and became the dominant Chinese sub-group in that province. Smaller Hainanese communities are also found at [[Sisophon]] and [[Sre Ambel]]. In the 1950s, many Hainanese would then move to Phnom Penh, where, in the late 1960s, they monopolized the city's entire hotel and restaurant business.&lt;ref name=stud/&gt; Hainanese of more humbler socioeconomic backgrounds operated tailor shops and haberdasheries.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hays"/&gt;

===Hokkien===
{{Main|Cambodian Hokkien}}

The [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] sub-group were believed to be the earliest Chinese sub-group to settle in Cambodia. Most of the Hokkiens trace their ancestry back to [[Quanzhou]] and [[Xiamen]] prefectures in southern [[Fujian]] province. The Hokkiens settle mainly in Phnom Penh and Battambang, and many Khmer families in Battambang claimed to have some distant Hokkien Chinese ancestry.
The Hokkien community is involved the import-export shipping trade and in banking.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; They also comprised a large percentage of the country's richest Chinese.&lt;ref name="Hays"/&gt;

===Hakka===
About 65% of the [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] trace their roots back to [[Meizhou]] and [[Heyuan]] prefectures in Guangdong province. About 70% of the Hakkas are found in Phnom Penh where they are dominant professions in the field of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], and shoemaking. Hakkas are also found in [[Takeo province]], [[Stung Treng]] and [[Rattanakiri]] who consist of vegetable farmers and rubber plantation workers. Hakka communities in the provinces migrated to Cambodia through Tonkin and Cochinchina in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott (1967), p. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt; In Phnom Penh, the newly-arrived Hakka were typically folk dentists, sellers of traditional Chinese medicines, and shoemakers.&lt;ref name=stud/&gt;

==Language==
Many Chinese Cambodian families have their children learn Chinese to reaffirm their Chinese identity as Mandarin has been increasingly the primary language of business for Overseas Chinese business communities. One main factor is due to the rise of China's global economic prominence and many Chinese Cambodian business families see Mandarin as a beneficial asset to partake economic links to conduct business between Cambodia and Mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |title=Templates of "Chineseness" and Trajectories of Cambodian Chinese Entrepreneurship in Phnom Penh* |website=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam |pages=74, 82–83 |access-date=2017-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816021339/https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |archive-date=2017-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Chinese Cambodians are generally practitioners of [[Chinese folk religion]], which incorporates rituals associated with [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Most Chinese families maintain a small shrine dedicated to at least one or more legendary or historical figure, and popular choices include [[Kitchen God]], [[Guan Yu]], [[Guan Yin]], [[Mazu (goddess)|Matsu]] and [[Wang Ye worship|Wang Ye]].&lt;ref name="MoeunPPPost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chheng Sambo |author2=Ngo Menghak |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/lifestyle/ching-ming-holiday-draws-crowds-family-gravesites|title=Ching Ming holiday draws crowds to family gravesites|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; During festive occasions such as [[Chinese New Year]], Chinese Cambodians would pray at communal temples either individually or as a group.

[[File:Hun Sen (2016) cropped.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb| [[Hun Sen]]’s pragmatic, capitalist-oriented vision of rebuilding Cambodia has been an impetus for attracting an influx of foreign capital investment, particularly from Mainland China.]]

Today, Cambodia's ethnic Chinese are now at the forefront of opening up the country's economy as an international Overseas Chinese economic outpost. Much of the foreign investment now entering Cambodia is being channeled through Overseas Chinese bamboo networks. Many members of the Chinese Cambodian business community often act as agents for expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors outside of Cambodia. Of particular note is Mainland China's economic role in the country, which has emerged to become a dominant foreign player in Cambodia. China's source of external influence in the Cambodian economy has encouraged Chinese Cambodian businessmen to reestablish their past businesses and regain their lost property which were once confiscated by the [[Khmer Rouge]].&lt;ref name="factsanddetails.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; The modern Cambodian business sector is highly dependent on ethnic Chinese companies who control virtually the country's entire economy and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers and politicians whom are of at least part-Chinese themselves.&lt;ref name="atimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infzm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Cambodia’s lack of an indigenous Khmer commercial culture in the private sector that is dominated entirely by Chinese Cambodians, has encouraged a plethora of Mainland Chinese foreign investment capital into the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; From 1994 to July 2011, Mainland China invested more than $8.8 billion USD across the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; The Cambodian government has made efforts to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from Mainland China and Overseas Chinese businessmen as well as marketing the nations tourism industry to potential Mainland Chinese clients.&lt;ref name="factsanddetails.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition, Mainland Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs and investors have been coming to Cambodia to acquire Cambodian assets and have invested substantial amounts of capital across the Cambodian economy channeling their financial capital through bamboo networks.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"/&gt; The Cambodian Chinese business community has been backed by the Cambodian political elite as much of the country depends on ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs and the pouring of Mainland Chinese investment capital for job creation has added to the globalized value added investment chain in the country. The CPP itself has incorporated many ethnic Chinese who provide financial support to the party with many high government officials and other major political decision makers being of partial Chinese descent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. The influx of Chinese capital has led to a resurgence of Chinese cultural pride among the Chinese Cambodian community while concurrently creating new jobs and economic niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Handbook of Contemporary Cambodia |last=Brickell |first= Katherine |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |isbn= 978-1138831186 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the transition of Cambodia from socialism to market-driven state owned capitalist principles, that Cambodia’s Chinese community began to reassert their cultural identity and economic clout. This reassertion of Chinese identity has blossomed into confident displays of Han Chinese ethnic pride following the influx of Mainland Chinese investment into Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sino-Cambodian Relations: Recent Economic And Military Cooperation – Analysis  |last=Lim |first=Alvin |publisher=Eurasia Review |others= June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990, Cambodia witnessed a rebirth of Han Chinese cultural expression and business boom across the country. Regional trade networks were restored and small and medium sized businesses have flourished since the introduction of market-driven state owned capitalist principles in the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; The growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Overseas and Mainland Chinese companies in the country has led the Chinese Cambodian community to see its numbers expand dramatically since the turn of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="factsanddetails.com"/&gt;

The 21st-century Chinese Cambodian community remains a modern well established commercial middle and upper class group.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  The community remains an insular and tight-knit group that has integrated well into local Cambodian society becoming a stereotypical trope representing socioeconomic success and extreme wealth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; As ethnic Chinese economic might grew, Cambodian hill tribes and aborigines were gradually driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the rural outskirts of major Cambodian cities or into the mountains. The increased resurgence of Chinese cultural and economic activity in 21st-century Cambodia has triggered distrust, resentment and Anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer indigenous Khmer majority, many whom eke out a simple living engaging in rural agrarian rice peasantry or fishing in a stark socioeconomic contrast to their modern, wealthier, and cosmopolitan middle class Chinese counterparts, who mainly engage in business, the skilled trades, or white collar professional occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sino-Cambodian Relations: Recent Economic And Military Cooperation – Analysis  |last=Lim |first=Alvin |publisher=Eurasia Review |others= June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |title=Templates of "Chineseness" and Trajectories of Cambodian Chinese Entrepreneurship in Phnom Penh* |website=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam |pages=75, 87 |access-date=2017-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816021339/https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1589314 |archive-date=2017-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aseantoday.com/2017/07/why-do-southeast-asian-citizens-dislike-china/ |title=Why do Southeast Asian citizens dislike China |last=Ying |first=Tan  |date=July 2, 2017 |website=ASEAN Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Transparency International]] Global Corruption Barometer 2013, corruption is a large concern in the public sector as more than half of the surveyed households consider [[Macedonian Parliament|Parliament]], [[Macedonian Police|police]], public officials, and particularly the judiciary and political parties very corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 107th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The business environment in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] is negatively affected by corruption. Several sources indicate that corruption is considered an obstacle for doing business, and businessmen have reported that bribery is demanded sometimes during public procurement and contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Investment Climate Statement - Macedonia|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204683.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Macedonia Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/macedonia/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Going up or down advertisement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Illustration from a 1916 advertisement for a vocational school in the back of a US magazine.  Education has been seen as a key to economic mobility, and this advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of self-betterment, as well as threatening the consequences of downward mobility in the great [[income inequality]] existing during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ]]

'''Economic mobility''' is the ability of an individual, family or some other group to improve (or lower) their [[economic]] status—usually measured in [[income]].  Economic mobility is often measured by movement between [[income quintiles]]. Economic mobility may be considered a type of [[social mobility]], which is often measured in change in income.

==Types of mobility==

There are many different ideas in the literature as to what constitutes a good mathematical measure of mobility, each with their own advantages and drawbacks.&lt;ref #name="Fields1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Gary S. |last2=Ok |first2=Efe A. |date=1999 |title=The Measurement of Income Mobility: An Introduction to the Literature |url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&amp;context=articles |journal=Cornell University ILR School |publisher=Cornell University |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref #name="Fields1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Gary S. |last2=Ok |first2=Efe A. |date=1996 |title=The Meaning and Measurement of Income Mobility|url=http://kumlai.free.fr/RESEARCH/THESE/TEXTE/MOBILITY/mobility%20salariale/The%20Meaning%20and%20Measurement%20of%20Income%20Mobility.pdf |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |publisher=Academic Press Inc. |volume=71 |issue= |pages=349–377 |doi= 10.1006/jeth.1996.0125|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility may be  between generations ("inter-generational") or within a person or groups lifetime ("intra-generational").
It may be "absolute" or "relative".&lt;ref name="ADR"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Isabel V. |last1=Sawhill |first2=John E. |last2=Morton |date=May 2007 |title=Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well? |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/05useconomics_morton.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503130834/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/05useconomics_morton.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-generational mobility compares a person’s (or group's) income to that of her/his/their parents.  Intra-generational mobility, in contrast, refers to movement up or down over the course of a working career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanekenworthy.net/2008/07/04/types-of-mobility/ Consider the Evidence] Lane Kenworthy{{self-published inline|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absolute mobility involves widespread [[economic growth]]&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt; and answers the question “To what extent do families improve their incomes over a generation?”&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt; Relative mobility is specific to individuals or groups and occurs without relation to the economy as a whole.&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt; It answers the question, "how closely are the economic fortunes of children tied to that of their parents?"&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt; Relative mobility is a zero-sum game, absolute is not.

* '''Exchange mobility''' is the mobility that results from a "reshuffling" of incomes among the economic agents, with no change in the income amounts. For example, in the case of two agents, a change in income distribution might be {1,2}-&gt;{2,1}. This is a case of pure exchange mobility, since they have simply exchanged incomes. More generally, for a set of incomes ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', any permutation of the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will yield a pure exchange mobility. Measures of inequality (e.g. the [[Gini coefficient]]) will not change under pure exchange mobility.
* '''Structural mobility''' is mobility that results from a change in the income distribution function without regard to the identity of the agents. For two agents, a change in income distribution might be {1,3}-&gt;{2,2}. This case may involve some exchange mobility, depending on one's definition, but there is certainly some structural mobility since it does not involve a simple reshuffling of incomes.
* '''Growth mobility''' is mobility that results from an increase in total income. For two agents,  a change in income distribution might be {1,2}-&gt;{2,4} or perhaps {1,2}-&gt;{3,5}. Growth mobility is certainly positive in these cases, since the sum of the incomes increases.

==United States==
{{main|Socio-economic mobility in the United States}}
How much economic mobility really exists has been studied.

===Intergenerational mobility===
According to the 2007 "American Dream Report" study, "by some measurements"—relative mobility between generations -- "we are actually a less mobile society than many other nations, including Canada, France, Germany and most Scandinavian countries. This challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity."&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt; Other research places the U.S. among the least economically mobile countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-16.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Revised Estimates of Intergenerational Income Mobility in the United States'', November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2007 study ("Economic Mobility Project: Across Generations") found significant upward "absolute" mobility from the late 1960s to 2007, with two-thirds of those who were children in 1968 reporting more household income than their parents&lt;ref name="MAG"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julia B. |last1=Isaacs |date=November 2007 |title=Economic Mobility of Families Across Generations |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_generations_isaacs.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009141643/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_generations_isaacs.aspx |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although most of this growth in total family income can be attributed to the increasing number of women who work since male earnings have stayed relatively stable throughout this time&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt;).

However, in terms of relative mobility it stated: "contrary to American beliefs about equality of opportunity, a child’s economic position is heavily influenced by that of his or her parents."&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt;  42% of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution ("quintile") remain in the bottom, while 39% born to parents in the top fifth remain at the top.&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt;  Only half of the generation studied exceeded their parents economic standing by moving up one or more quintiles.&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt; Moving between quintiles is more frequent in the middle quintiles (2-4) than in the lowest and highest quintiles. Of those in one of the quintiles 2-4 in 1996, approximately 35% stayed in the same quintile; and approximately 22% went up one quintile or down one quintile (moves of more than one quintile are rarer). 39% of those who were born into the top quintile as children in 1968 are likely to stay there, and 23% end up in the fourth quintile.&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt; Children previously from lower-income families had only a 1% chance of having an income that ranks in the top 5%.&lt;ref name="UM"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/kf/hertz_mobility_analysis.pdf |title=Understanding Mobility in America |first=Tom |last=Hertz |date=26 April 2006 |publisher=Center for American Progress |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the children of wealthy families have a 22% chance of reaching the top 5%.&lt;ref name="UM"/&gt;

===Intragenerational mobility===
According to a 2007 study by the US Treasury Department, Americans concerned over the recent growth in inequality (after-tax income of the top 1% earners has grown by 176% percent from 1979 to 2007 while it grew only 9% for the lowest 20%&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt;) can be reassured by the healthy income mobility in America: "There was considerable income mobility of individuals [within a single generation] in the U.S. economy during the 1996 through 2005 period as over half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile over this period".&lt;ref name="IMT"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf |title=Income Mobility in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005 |publisher=Department of the Treasury |date=13 November 2007}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies were less impressed with the rate of individual mobility in the United States. A 2007 inequality and mobility study (by Kopczuk, Saez and Song) and 2011 [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] study on "Trends in the Distribution of Household Income, found the pattern of annual and long-term earnings inequality "very close",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~wk2110/bin/mobility-short.pdf Uncovering the American Dream: Inequality and Mobility in Social Security Earnings Data since 1937] Wojciech Kopczuk, [[Emmanuel Saez]], Jae Song, 15 September 2007, Figure 4B&lt;/ref&gt; or "only modestly" different.&lt;ref name=cbo&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485 Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007]. October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source described it as the mobility of "the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early thirties," rather than poor people rising to middle class or middle income rising to wealth.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;Krugman, Paul. "[http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-income-distribution-debate The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate]"prospect.org, 19 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative vs. Absolute===
There are two different ways to measure economic mobility: absolute and relative.  Absolute mobility measures how likely a person is to exceed their parents’ family income at the same age.  Research by the Pew Economic Mobility Project shows that the majority of Americans, 84 percent, exceed their parents' income.&lt;ref name="pewstates.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility Across Generations|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/pursuing-the-american-dream-85899403228|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the size of absolute income gains is not always enough to move them to the next rung of the economic ladder.

A focus on how Americans’ rank on the income ladder compares to their parents, their peers, or even themselves over time is a measure of relative mobility. The Pew Economic Mobility Project’s research shows that forty percent of children in the lowest income quintile remain there as adults, and 70 percent remain below the middle quintile, meaning 30% moved up two quintiles or more in one generation.&lt;ref name="pewstates.org"/&gt;

==Worldwide==
[[File:Intergenerational mobility graph-1.jpg|right|400px]]
In recent years several large studies have found that vertical inter-generational mobility is lower in the United States than in most developed countries.&lt;ref name=DeParle&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?sq=mobility&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all Harder for Americans to Rise From Lower Rungs] | By JASON DePARLE | 4 January 2012 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1996 paper by Daniel P. McMurrer, Isabel V. Sawhill found "mobility rates seem to be quite similar across countries."&lt;ref name="urban.org"&gt;[http://www.urban.org/publications/406722.html Economic Mobility in the United States] Urban Institute 1 October 1996
Daniel P. McMurrer, Isabel V. Sawhill&lt;/ref&gt;  However a more recent paper (2007) found a person's parents is a great deal more predictive of their own income in the United States than other countries.&lt;ref name="UM"/&gt; The United States had about 1/3 the ratio of mobility of Denmark and less than half that of Canada, Finland and Norway.&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt;  France, Germany, [[Sweden]], also had higher mobility, with only the United Kingdom being less mobile.&lt;ref name="ADR"/&gt;

Economic mobility in developing nations (such as those in Africa) is thought to be limited by both historical and global economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14725840500235407 |title=The global 'order', socioeconomic status and the economics of African identity |year=2005 |last1=Kamau |first1=Caroline |last2=Rutland |first2=Adam |journal=African Identities |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=171–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economic mobility is everywhere correlated with income and wealth inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Chait, “No Such Thing as Equal Opportunity,” New York, 7 November 2011, pp. 14– 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (4 June 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 17). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men and women==
Women in their 30s have substantially higher incomes today than their counterparts did in their parents’ generation.&lt;ref name="MvW"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julia B. |last1=Isaacs |date=November 2007 |title=Economic Mobility of Men and Women |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_menwomen_isaacs.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222034021/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_menwomen_isaacs.aspx |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1974 and 2004, average income for women in their 30s has increased almost fourfold.&lt;ref name="MvW"/&gt; This is a stark contrast to the growth in income of their male counterparts. The average income of men in their 30s has increased from 31,000 in 1964 to 35,000 in 2004, an increase of only 4,000.&lt;ref name="MvW"/&gt;

However, much of this can be attributed to [[unemployment|employment rates]]. The employment rate of women in their 30s has increased from 39% in 1964 to 70% in 2004; whereas, the rate of employment for men in this same age group has decreased from 91% in 1964 to 86% in 2004.&lt;ref name="MvW"/&gt; This sharp increase in income for working women, in addition to stable male salaries, is the reason upward economic mobility is attributed to women.

''See: [[De-industrialization crisis]]''

==Black and white families==
Average income for both [[White people|White]] and [[Black people|Black]] families has increased since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="BvW"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Julia B. |last1=Isaacs |date=November 2007 |title=Economic Mobility of Black and White Families |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_blackwhite_isaacs.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005035542/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/11_blackwhite_isaacs.aspx |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, average income for White families in their 30s has increased from $50,000 to $60,000 from 1975 to 2005, compared to an increase from $32,000 to $35,000 for Black families of the same age over the same period.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; So in addition to receiving a lower average income, its growth is also less for Black families (10% growth) than their White counterparts (19% growth).&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; One way this can be explained is that even though marriage rates have declined for both [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], Blacks are 25% less likely to be in a married couple.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; However, Blacks also have less economic mobility and are less likely to surpass their parents’ income or economic standing than Whites.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; Two of three White children born into families in the middle quintile have achieved a higher family income than their parents.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; Conversely, only one of three Black children born into families in the middle quintile has achieved a higher family income than their parents.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; On average, Black children whose parents were in the bottom or second quintile do exceed their parents’ income, but those whose parents were in the middle or fourth quintile actually have a lower income than their parents.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; This is a very large difference compared to Whites, who experience intergenerational income growth in every quintile except the highest.&lt;ref name="BvW"/&gt; This shows that in addition to lower wages with less growth over time, it is less likely for Black families to experience upward economic mobility than it is for Whites.

==Education==
It is a widespread belief that there is a strong correlation between obtaining an education and increasing one’s economic mobility. In the United States, the education system has always been considered the most effective and equal process for all individuals to improve one’s economic standing.&lt;ref name="GA"&gt;McMurrer, D. Sawhill, I. ''Getting Ahead: Economic and Social Mobility in America''. The Urban Institute Press. Washington, D.C. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increasing availability to education for all, family background continues to play a huge role in determining economic success.  To individuals who do not have or cannot obtain an education, the greater overall levels of education can act as a barrier, increasing their chance of being left behind at the bottom of the economic or income ladder. In this regard, education policy that allocates high ability students from lower social economic background to quality schools can have a large impact on economic mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537114000694|title=Lee, Y.S. 2014. "Exams, Districts, and Intergenerational Mobility" Labour Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that education and family background has a great effect on economic mobility across generations.  Family background or one’s [[socioeconomic status]] affects the likelihood that students will graduate from high school or college, what type of college or institution they will attend, and how likely they are to graduate and complete a degree.  According to studies, when split into income quintiles including the bottom, second, middle, fourth and top, adult children without a college degree and with parents in the bottom quintile remained in the bottom quintile.  But if the adult children did have a college degree, there was only a 16% chance that they would remain at the bottom of the quintile.  Therefore, it was proven that education provided an increase in economic status and mobility for poorer families.&lt;ref name="EMPE"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ron |last1=Haskins |date=February 2008 |chapter=Education and Economic Mobility |chapterurl=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/reports/2008/02_economic_mobility_sawhill/02_economic_mobility_sawhill_ch8.pdf |editor1-first=Julia B. |editor1-last=Isaacs |editor2-first=Isabel V. |editor2-last=Sawhill |editor3-first=Ron |editor3-last=Haskins |title=Getting Ahead or Losing Ground: Economic Mobility in America |url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2008/02_economic_mobility_sawhill.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does obtaining a college degree make it much more likely for individuals to make it to the top two quintiles, education helps those who were born in the top quintiles to remain in the top quintiles.  Therefore, hard work and increasing education from those who are born into the lower quintiles can boost economic status and help them move ahead, but children born into wealthier families do seem to have the advantage.&lt;ref name="EMPE"/&gt; Even when the likelihood of attending college is ignored, studies have shown that out of all the students that enroll in college, socioeconomic status or family background still has an effect on graduation rates with 53% of those from the top quintile receiving bachelor's degrees along with 39% from the middle and 22% from the bottom quintile.&lt;ref name="GA"/&gt;  According to the 2002 US Census, students can expect to earn on average about $2.1 million with a bachelor's degree over the course of their working career.  That is almost $1 million more than what individual’s without a college degree can expect to earn.&lt;ref name="ACCESS"&gt;Waldron, K. Access to College Means Access to Economic Mobility for America's Underserved. ''Diverse Issues in Higher Education'' V. 24. No. 2. 8 March 2007. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that inflation rates have not kept up with increasing tuition rates, disadvantaged families have a much harder time affording college.  Especially considering the increased competition for college admittances at public schools, students from lower economic quintiles are at an even greater disadvantage.&lt;ref name="GA"/&gt;  Tuition rates over the past ten years has risen 47% at public universities and 42% at private universities.&lt;ref name="ACCESS"/&gt;  While having to take out more loans and work jobs while taking classes, students from lower income quintiles are considering college to be “a test of their endurance rather than their intelligence”.&lt;ref name="ACCESS"/&gt;

By obtaining an education, individuals with low economic status can increase the income potential and therefore earn more than their parents and possibly surpass those in the upper income quintiles.  Overall, each additional level of education an individual achieves whether it be a high school, college, graduate, or professional degree can add greatly to income levels.&lt;ref name="EMPE"/&gt; On the other hand, there are reports that disagree with the idea that individuals can work hard, obtain an education and succeed because there is the notion that America is actually getting poorer and actually more likely to stay poor as compared to any other western country.  Some claim that the idea of the “American Dream” is starting to fade since the middle-class family income has remained constant since 1973. But upward mobility clearly still exists.  One study claims that economic mobility is 3 times stronger in Denmark, 2.5 times higher in Canada, and 1.5 times higher in Germany as compared to the United States.&lt;ref name="BU"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2007/08/american-inequality-economic|title=Born equal?|last=Stephen|first=Andrew|magazine=New Statesman|date=August 2008|volume=137|issue=4855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of legal [[immigrants]] has been rising steadily since the 1960s.  The number has increased from about 320,000 to almost a million per year.  About 500,000 illegal immigrants also remain in the United States each year.  People immigrate to the United States in hopes of greater economic opportunities and most first generation immigrants experience a boost in their income from the American economy.  But since most do not have an education, their wages quickly begin to fall relative to non-immigrants.  According to studies, there is a great upward jump in economic mobility from the first to the second immigrant generation because of education.  These second generation immigrants exceed the income levels of the first generation immigrants as well as some non-immigrants.&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ron |last1=Haskins |date=July 2007 |title=Immigration: Wages, Education and Mobility |url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2007/07useconomics_haskins.aspx |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614013130/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2007/07useconomics_haskins.aspx |archivedate=14 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[intergenerational mobility]] research, the mobility of immigrants and their children from different nations can be measured.  Considering relative wages from male workers from certain nations in 1970 to second generation male workers in 2000, conclusions can be drawn about economic mobility.  In 1970, if immigrants had come from an industrialized nation, then their average wages tended to be more than the average wages of non-immigrant workers during that time.  In 2000, the second generation workers had experienced a downfall in relative mobility because their average wages were much closer to the average wages of a non-immigrant worker.  In 1970, for the immigrant workers migrating from less industrialized countries, their average wages were less than the average wages of non-immigrant workers.  In 2000, the second generation workers from less industrialized nations have experienced an increase in relative mobility because their average wages have moved closer to those of non-immigrants.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt;

By computing the intergenerational correlation between relative wages of first and second generation workers from the same country a conclusion was made regarding whether or not first generation immigrants influence the wages of the second generation immigrants.  This computation was also reported for native-born first and second generation American families.  The study found that both immigrants and natives pass along almost exactly the same level of economic advantages or disadvantages to their offspring.  These conclusions predict diminishing correlations in wages from the first and second generations if change in the level of education for each immigrant is considered.  Since the majority of immigrants have low levels of education, it may be increasingly difficult for future second generation immigrants to ever surpass the average wages of non-immigrants.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt;

'''Electricity theft in Pakistan''' or '''Electricity hooking in Pakistan''' or ('''Kunda system''' in local language) has particular meaning throughout Pakistan, especially in [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]].  Generally Kunda (hook) system is used for illegal electricity connection.  In Karachi a parallel power supply  “the Kunda System” has been running for years. The word “Kunda” is applied for all connection acquired by any means other than legal procedures. Literally in [[Urdu]] language word “Kunda” is meant a sphere or semi sphere shape with or without further curves for connecting iron chain.  Basically the word Kunda belongs to old [[Hindi]] language family.  Briefly Kunda system means theft of electricity in Pakistan.  The term official Kunda &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

is also used as KESC staff under a provision also provides official Kunda to the consumers of their choice. Users who consume electricity through illegal connections are not only a problem for the Karachi Electric Company but it is also a main cause of inaccessibility of power supply to genuine legal consumers who had to face power breakdowns in addition to power fluctuations due to Kunda system.

Electricity shortage throughout Pakistan is a chronic issue. Street protests in Pakistan for electricity shutdown   and poor performance are common.  However, no proper solution is achieved by the protesters, instead a sweet promise is assured to the victims of electricity supply by the concerned quarters of the locality.&lt;ref name=NYT51813&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan, Rusting in Its Tracks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/world/asia/pakistans-railroads-sum-up-nations-woes.html|accessdate=November 14, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 18, 2013|author=Declan Walsh|quote=natural disasters and entrenched insurgencies, abject poverty and feudal kleptocrats, and an economy near meltdown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= PPI |url= http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/06/20/city/karachi/citizens-take-to-streets-against-k-electric/|title=Citizens take to streets against K-Electric | publisher= Pakistan Today |date= June 20, 2015 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity theft==
Energy theft is a world issue and this white collar crime is committed elsewhere irrespective of economic stability of countries.  Electricity theft of 6 billion US dollars per year was reported in 2012-13 alone in the US.  A business case from a utility in Canada, [[BC Hydro]], claims that electricity theft cost them at least 850 GWh (gigawatt-hours) or approximately US Dollar 100 million per year.  In some countries, energy loss due to theft is estimated at over 35%. Legitimate customers bear the cost of electricity theft, which has grown significantly in the recent decades. The rate of stealing electricity is much higher in developing countries like Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Peter Kelly-Detwiler |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2013/04/23/electricity-theft-a-bigger-issue-than-you-think/|title= Electricity Theft: A Bigger Issue Than You Think | publisher= Forbes Energy |date= April 23, 2013 |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= David Lawrence  |url=http://www.abb-conversations.com/2013/06/sensors-stop-energy-thieves/ |title= Sensors stop energy thieves | publisher= ABB |date= June 19, 2013 |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 it was placed on record in the [[Senate of Pakistan]], that in the last 5 years Pakistan had lost Rs 90 billion in electricity theft and line losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Web Edition | url= http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-91343-Pakistan-lost-Rs90-billion-in-electricity-theft,-line-losses- |title= Pakistan lost Rs90 billion in electricity theft, line losses|publisher= The News, Pakistan|date=March 8, 2013 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power supply to Karachi==
[[K-Electric]] is a successor to KESC which was its original name for more than 70 years and was operating as a vertically integrated power utility in Pakistan.  It is thoroughly integrated in generation, transmission and distribution to the whole Karachi city and its surroundings. Earlier to 1990 [[K-Electric|KESC]] was enjoying a good reputation.  Suddenly it was placed under [[WAPDA]] control at that time company’s share with its face value in Pakistan Rupees 10/- was selling at Rs.160/- in stock market. WAPDA was ill-reputed for corruption and mismanagement.   Under WAPDA control its share was trading below face value. However KESC was privatized later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Salahuddin Haider |url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=267207 | title=K-Electric victim of circumstances and repeated injustice|publisher= Pakistan Observer |date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanization without town planning===
[[BBC]] [[Delhi]] correspondent, besides citing different issues, one of the disclosed reasons of electricity theft was that in India poor people buy stolen power because they cannot afford to buy it.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web |author= Soutik Biswas | url= https://mediacellppp.wordpress.com/2015/05/20/ke-selling-electricity-through-kunda-system-in-slums-of-city-ppp/ | title= Why power theft in India is a complex problem| publisher=BBC, Delhi | date=November 15, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Karachi this reason can also be observed in least developed areas.  According to estimates published in 2012-13, there were approximately 483 Katchi Abadies (unauthorized residential colonies) in Karachi prior to 1990, the residents of such localities do not have legal right to have civic facilities and basic living provisions such as electricity/water from government departments.  According to Chairman of Standing Committee on Urban Development of the [[Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry]], now it has grown to over 4,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Hina Mahgul Rind | url= http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-3-214351-Katchi-Abadis-house-half-of-Karachis-population| title= Katchi Abadis house half of Karachi's population | publisher= The News International | date=November 15, 2012 | accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a main reason, where poor and deprived people are compelled to deal with Kunda Mafia.

===Monopoly and international competition===
Electricity theft, particularly in Pakistan, can best be evaluated in the finding/study by Thomas B. Smith Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Zayed University, Dubai, UAE &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{quotation|
Electricity theft in its various forms can be reduced and kept in check only by the strong and assertive action of power sector organizations. The strategy and the action should be based upon a thorough understanding of the specific nature of the theft problem. As prices in poor countries rise to international levels, many consumers are trapped. Their own income is by local standards, perhaps $2 to $5 per day, but their electricity charges are the same as for a customer in Los Angeles who earns $80 per day. Under these conditions, consumers may feel that there is no alternative but to engage in electricity theft or not pay their bills. (Further)The total power sector is difficult to privatize into effective private sector enterprises because transmission and distribution are natural monopolies, and competition is essential to urge businesses to be more efficient.
}}

===Kunda as a temporary solutions===
According to disclosing by KESC sources the [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times Pakistan]] writes:&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web |author= | url= http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/karachi/06-Nov-2008/kunda-system-a-major-cause-of-load-shedding-excess-billing|title= Kunda system a major cause of load shedding, excess billing | publisher= Daily Times, Pakistan| date=November 6, 2008 | accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| The shops that are within the petrol pump premises have legal connections, meaning that they are within the metered-consumers camp while the remaining are provided with power connections through the kunda system just for Rs 500 per month. More than half of the tyre-puncture shop owners have links with KESC's employees, who ensure that they do not suffer any consequences (alleged the sources).  It is further noticed that the utility has often claimed that power shortages are due to many reasons including 35 to 40 percent line losses and 40 percent power consumption that occurs through illegal connections such as more than 200 restaurants that are opened till late at night are among the major consumers of electricity, majority of these restaurants are established on footpaths and link roads that they have encroached. Switching off the lights of these restaurants will save at least 100 MW.}}

===Artificial reasons of theft===
'''Difference in time of load-shedding''': A large number of illegal ‘kunda’ connections are overloading the K-Electric.  The use of kunda connections not only a cause of financial losses to K-Electric but also the main reason of frequent tripping.  Among many other reasons one of the basis of getting electricity through kunda system is access of consumer to a nearby area where timing of two neighborhoods are different for load shedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= | url= http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=253565&amp;Cat=4&amp;dt=7/29/2010 |title= G Area suffers due to Kunda system | publisher= The News| date=July 29, 2010 | accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Night Matches'''  Kunda system is also applied in Saturday night matches which is very common in Karachi. They use at least 15-20 of 500-watts bulb rods for lighting a little area of pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Editors Mail | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/06/14/comment/editors-mail/stealing-electricity/| title= Stealing electricity | publisher= Pakistan Today | date=June 14, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More consumption versus higher cost===

One of the reasons for electricity theft is that middle class who due to meager resources could not bear to pay the many units consumed at a higher cost on slab to slab increase. The slabs of units consumed and electricity charges are (2015 slabs and rates):&lt;ref name="The News"&gt;{{cite news|title= Karachi Chamber criticises increase in power tariff |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-3-335293-Karachi-Chamber-criticises-increase-in-power-tariff |accessdate=November 16, 2015|newspaper=The News (International) |date=August 21, 2015|author=Correspondant|quote= Hot topic Business page}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Pakistan Rupees 10.20 per unit 
:from 201-300 units Rs.16 per unit
:for consumers of 301-700 units Rs.18 per unit (+ General sales tax and other charges)

There is strong basis for charging electricity consumption bill according to affordability of consumers (reasonable tariff for 300-500 units - this step will reduce electricity theft), incompetency of people because of resources can be noticed that even they had given no importance to a religious decree issued in 2009 prohibiting theft of electricity.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title= Pakistan 'fatwa' on power thieves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8148328.stm |accessdate=November 16, 2015|newspaper=BBC News |date=July 13, 2009|author=Correspondent|quote= Islamic scholars, declared the theft of electricity a sin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-theft measures by Pakistan and K-Electric==

In 2014 [[President of Pakistan]] has issued an ordinance for defining strict punishments to electricity thieves across the country.  The strategy and the action should be based upon a thorough understanding of the specific nature of the theft problem, while implementing the law against electricity thefts so as to technical loss due to pilferage and theft of electricity should not be dealt with combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hadi Aziz| url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2014/01/01/pakistan-approves-first-ever-law-against-electricity-thefts/ |title= Pakistan approves first-ever law against electricity thefts| publisher= The Newstribe | date=January 1, 2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K-Electric has introduced a latest technology which will remove “Kunda system and electricity theft”.  Under this program Area Bundle Cable (ABC) System has already been installed in [[Kiamari]] area and entire city is to be covered with the new technology of ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff Reporter|url=http://www.pstimes.com/2013/05/08/kesc-to-introduce-abc-system-to-avoid-electricity-theft-kunda-system/ | title= KESC To Introduce ABC System To Avoid Electricity Theft, Kunda System|publisher= Pakistan State Times|date=May 8, 2013| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system makes it impossible to steal electricity and K-Electric can reduce transmission and distribution loss (T&amp;D loss) remarkably as the ABC project will install special power cables and digital power tariff meters, which are kunda and tampering proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/112650/replacing-kunda-system-power-utility-starts-anti-theft-project-in-keamari/|title= Replacing kunda system: Power utility starts anti-theft project in Keamar |publisher=The Express Tribune|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Envirofit International''' is a social enterprise established in 2003 to develop technology that will reduce pollution and enhance energy efficiency in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of clean cooking technology through a partnership in Kenya|url=http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/members/2013/11/envirofit-international/|publisher=Business Call to Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envirofit’s founders are Tim Bauer, Nathan Lorenz, Paul Hudnut, and Bryan Willson. The social enterprise is based in Fort Collins, Colorado and has been recognized for the global impact of its innovative technology and market-based delivery of the clean energy cook stoves which help to reduce air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economist names Envirofit founders innovators of year |url=http://www.denverijournal.com/article.php?id=10015 |publisher=Denver Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212073208/http://www.denverijournal.com/article.php?id=10015 |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Envirofit International began in 2003 as an adjunct program to the Colorado State University Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory to bring sustainable clean energy solutions to solve health and energy challenges on a global level. The first product was a retrofit technology to reduce pollution from two-stroke cycle vehicle engines in the Philippines. This project won the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retrofitting for the Environment|url=http://www.rolexawards.com/profiles/laureates/tim_bauer/project|publisher=Rolex Awards for Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envirofit engineers then turned their focus to stoves. Envirofit International’s first commercial clean cook stove model was produced in India in 2008. In order to meet the demands of consumers throughout the various markets and the growing health concerns of cooking on a traditional stove, Envirofit started to scale the model in 2010. In 2009, Nathan Lorenz and Tim Bauer were named Heroes of the Environment for their smokeless and less hazardous stove by Time Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heroes of the Environment 2009|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1924149_1924154_1924431,00.html|publisher=Times Magazine | date=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Envirofit partnered with The Shell Foundation’s Breathing Space Program to develop clean cook stoves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breathing Space|url=http://www.shellfoundation.org/pages/core_lines.php?p=corelines_content&amp;page=breathing|publisher=The Shell Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean Cook Stoves==

Envirofit International developed the clean burning cook stove to help with indoor air pollution in developing countries. The design was created after engineers studied the flow of heat and smoke in a combustion chamber using computer modeling to determine the best size and shape for the stove. It was found that sheet metal can burn through in a matter of weeks. Therefore, researchers worked to develop a metal and insulation to withstand high temperatures and frequent use at a low cost. The design of the cook stove had to best fit with the consumers using it. Most of the consumers live on $2 to $10 a day and spend several hours preparing food and water for their families to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yee|first=Amy|title=A Healthier, More Efficient Way to Cook|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/business/energy-environment/30iht-rencook.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=The New York Times|date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology of the clean cook stove has been dubbed the rocket stove because of the simple yet effective design. The cook stove has a large vertical cylinder that holds a pot and an opening at the bottom to feed the combustible biomass to cook a meal or pasteurize drinking water. In the next five years the clean stoves could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 400,000 tons and prevent more than 85,000 kilograms of black carbon from entering the atmosphere. The combustion chamber of the Envirofit stoves use up to 60% less fuel than other stoves or open fires to reduce toxic emissions by up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovations in Air|url=http://www.uniteforsight.org/environmental-health/module12|publisher=Unite for Sight}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several types of clean stoves produced by Envirofit International including the CH-4400 charcoal stove, the CH-5200 charcoal stove, the CH-2200 charcoal stove, the Z-3000 Built-In wood stove, the G-3300 wood stove, and the M-500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improved Cook Stoves|url=http://arti-africa.org/2010/07/cook-stoves/|publisher=ARTIEnergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand German|Bundesfreiwilligendienst|date=March 2016}}

The '''Federal Volunteers Service''' ({{lang-de|Bundesfreiwilligendienst}}) is a [[Government of Germany|German government]] program which encourages [[volunteering|volunteerism]] among German young adults for public welfare, especially for social, ecological and cultural engagement. Every person who has finished school can apply for a volunteer position in a welfare institution accredited by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bafza.de/startseite.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.staedtetag.de/fachinformationen/bundesfreiwilligendienst/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history of volunteering in Germany==
In [[West Germany]] Liselotte Funcke advocated in the 1960s a [[voluntary social year]] for young women &lt;ref&gt;Ernst Goyke:. '' The 100 of Bonn. Between Barzel and Wehner. '' Gustav Luebbe, Bergisch Gladbach, 1970 (2nd ed.), Here p 83&lt;/ref&gt;
Already in the 1950s there were as State mass initiative in [[East Germany]] for [[National integration]], which took care of the removal of the rubble of World War II. In the 1960s this was the initiative of the "Mach mit Bewegung" ("participate movement").

The starting end of the 1990s by recurring debate on a possible abolition of conscription and the high demand for places in the youth volunteer services led the [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Ministry for Family Affairs]], in 2003, a commission of experts "for the future of civil society" convened. Representatives of social and environmental organizations and the relevant ministries drafted a final report, that suggested, among other things, the promotion of inter-generational volunteer services. Two corresponding model projects started from 2004 but included only projects with weekly working hours to a maximum of 20 hours, so not up to the full-time use in the youth volunteer services. From 2009 to the end of 2011 a follow-up project "Voluntary Service all generations" offered only a part-time (8 hours per week) engagement.

After it became clear in late summer 2010 that the project of [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence Minister]] [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] to suspend conscription will be successful, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs drafted a bill for the Federal voluntary service in the departmental co-ordination. With effect of 28 April 2011 and a relatively short legislative procedure the' 'Law on the Federal Voluntary Service (BFDG Federal Voluntary Service Act)' entered into force. After initial reluctance, the service is now regarded as a success, due to the fact that in the first five years more than 216,000 persons became a "Bufdi" or "BFDler/BFDlerin" (for Bundesfreiwilligendienstleistende, German for Federal Volunteer), how the volunteers serving the BFD are called.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/news/5-jahre-bfd.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several associations and support stand for a further expansion of the service, after almost all the seats were awarded in 2012.

==Statutory rule==
Everybody, and not only German citizens, is allowed to become volunteer of the Federal Volunteers Service after finishing the minimum school age. There is upper age limit. The service has to be fulfilled like full employees in 40 working hours per week. The minimum length of service is 12 months, with some exceptions. Volunteers over the age of 27 are allowed to serve again after five years. For the service period the volunteer has to pay full social insurance like a normal employee.

==Funding==
Depending on the institution the volunteers are working the federal government pays a part or all costs, especially for social insurance. The volunteer only gets pocket money.

==Tasks of the BFD==
* The service is the commitment to the 'common good' in social, environmental and cultural fields as well as in sports and - promote the civil protection and the integration - new in relation to the youth volunteer services. It also serves to lifelong learning.
* Potential volunteers are all individuals after completion of the minimum school age and without limitation upwards.
* The work is done in ''full-time''; for volunteers over 27 years there is also a reduction of more than 20 hours possible.
* The ''service time'' is generally 12 months, in special undertakings between 6 and 24 months; a denomination in 3-month blocks is possible in special cases.
* Adults over 27 years of age may ''every five years again'' become federal volunteer.
* Accommodation, food, clothes and pocket money should be paid similarly to the youth volunteer services.
* '' Operating units'' can become non-profit institutions of the social and environmental field.
* '' Seminars'' must be visited in analogy to the youth volunteer services of 25 days per year, regardless of the working week. At 12 months deviating service a seminar is a month more or less mandatory (§&amp;nbsp;4 Abs.&amp;nbsp;3). A seminar week must serve the political education and should "be carried out usually in the existing state civil service schools".
* A ''educational support'' of all volunteers is provided.
* The ''social insurance'' correspond to those in the youth volunteer services, therefore the volunteers are insured as workers. There is (regardless of the amount of paid pocket money) compulsory insurance under the statutory social law.
* All ''operating units'' have to be recognized by the Federal Government, where all previously recognized community service agencys are automatically considered approved. New bodies are recognized by the Federal Government or by one of FSJ / FÖJ carrier with the consent of the respective state.
* The ''working arrangement'' is closed to the joint proposal of operation sites and volunteers between the Federal Government and the volunteer. This is therefore a bilateral employment relationship, but that is no employment relationship, in which the carrier not a party, but the contractor is the federal government.
* All federal volunteers choose once a year seven speakers and seven alternates who will represent the interests of young volunteers, especially against the BAfzA and the BMFSFJ.
* To issue a qualified certificate for each volunteer is duty of the operating units.

{{Romani people}}
'''The Finnish Kale''' ({{lang-rom|Kàlo}}; {{lang-sv|Kalé}}; {{lang-fi|Kaale}}, also ''Suomen romanit'' "'''Finnish Romani'''") are a group of the [[Romani people]] who live primarily in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

Their main languages are [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Finnish Kalo language|Finnish Romani]].

==History==
[[File:Kolme romaninaista.jpg|thumb|left|Three Finnish Romani women in 1930s.]]
The original Finnish Kale were Romani groups who came to Finland via Sweden in the 16th century, leaving the kingdoms of [[Scotland]] and [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rmf|title=Romani, Kalo Finnish|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eltzler. Zigenarna och deras avkomlingar i Sverige (Uppsala 1944) cited in: Angus. M. Fraser. The Gypsies (The Peoples of Europe) p120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, all Romani groups were declared outlaws who could be hanged without trial; this practice was discontinued in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://k2xx.spraakdata.gu.se/personal/lars/pblctns/FinnishRomani.pdf |title=Finnish Romani|website= spraakdata.gu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Finland declared independence in 1917, all Kales received full citizenship and rights. During the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]], about a thousand Kales served in the [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finnish military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mansetori.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=486&amp;Itemid=568|title=Mansetori.fi|website=mansetori.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
=== Dress ===
Finnish Kale commonly follow their traditions in both male and female dress. Finnish Kale women choose personally whether to don the traditional dress or not at around the age of 15 to 20, and the choice is considered final. In case of nontraditional wear, modesty customs are still followed.

Back in the 19th century, Finnish Kale men dressed nearly identical to the ethnic Finn farmers, in a coat, slacks, high boots, and a rimmed hat. In the early 20th century, many Kale men adopted the clothing style associated with the highly regarded profession of horse cab&lt;!--not Hansom cab--&gt; driver. This dress featured a white shirt, a jacket (sometimes in [[leather]]), a [[peaked cap]], tall black boots, and baggy dark [[jodhpurs|jodhpur trousers]]. The use of jodhpurs was very specific for the Finnish Kale, as Romani in other areas would have associated them with the often aggressive military, and thus avoided them.

During the 1960s and 70s, the peaked cap fell out of use, and the jodhpurs and boots were replaced with slacks and walking shoes. Jackets are still worn as traditional Kale modesty disallows appearing in only a shirt. Light-colored slacks or [[jeans]] are rarely seen. The driver-style dress is used only by some of the older men, or by younger men for special occasions.

The traditional female Finnish Kale dress stems from the traditional dress worn by the ethnic [[Finnish people|Finn]] women. Until the turn of the 20th century, Kale and Finn women dressed much alike in blouses, long skirts, and waist aprons.&lt;ref name="SKM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.craftmuseum.fi/romanit/romanipuku/historiaa.htm | title=Tie romanien elämään | publisher=Suomen käsityön museo | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time and with increased wealth, the female Kale dress has become continually more decorated. The dress features a heavy full-length black [[velvet]] skirt worn relatively high at the waist, supported by padding, and a puffed blouse, often with prominent ruffles and [[lace]], made of decorative cloth such as with [[sequin|sequins]] or a metallic sheen.

Young children wear similar clothing to other ethnicities. Girls approaching maturity, but still below the age to don the traditional dress, often wear long, narrow, dark skirts.

=== Music ===
[[File:Taisto Tammi 1960.jpg|thumb|Taisto Tammi in 1960.]]
Music is a central part of Finnish Kale culture, everyday entertainment and domestic life. In Finland, the Kale are known especially for their contribution to the [[Finnish tango]] and [[Schlager music]]. Kale men have been a vital part of Schlager singers since the start of the genre's popularity in Finland following [[World War II]]. At first Kale singers faced direct discrimination, and for instance were banned from performing at certain establishments either on principle or following Kale audience misbehavior. [[Taisto Tammi]] and [[Markus Allan]] were the two most important earlier Kale performers; both adopted artistic aliases to reduce attention at their ethnic background.

Since then, discrimination has lessened and Kale singers have no need to mask their birth names in order to succeed in the career. Numerous Kale have participated in the ''[[Tangomarkkinat]]'', a national tango-singing contest, the winners including [[Sebastian Ahlgren]], [[Amadeus Lundberg]] and [[Marco Lundberg]].

==Perceived problems of the Kale in Finland==

===Socioeconomic status===
The Kale have traditionally held positions as [[Artisan|craftsmen]], but the occupation has lost importance in modern times, leading to a significant rise in unemployment within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanifoorumi.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=74|title=Romanit Suomessa Suomen Romanifoorumi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published by the Ministry of Labour states that "According to labour administration's client register material, 70% of the Roma jobseekers had a primary school or lower secondary school education." According to the same paper: "Education is compulsory in Finland and this obligation applies equally to the Roma as to other citizens, but dropping out of basic education is still common among young Roma, while in the mainstream population it is extremely uncommon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=
Heikko koulutus pitää romanit poissa työelämästä |trans-title=Low level of education keeps Romani out of employment |language=Finnish |newspaper=[[Keskisuomalainen]] |location= |date=11 September 2008 |url=http://www.ksml.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/heikko-koulutus-pit%C3%A4%C3%A4-romanit-poissa-ty%C3%B6el%C3%A4m%C3%A4st%C3%A4/220015 |accessdate=29 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence and criminality===

In 2007 police officer and boxer Riku Lumberg (of Romani heritage) wrote an open letter to his own people, seeking an end to the "barbaric tradition of [[blood feud]]" in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lumberg |first=Riku |title=Riku Lumbergin avoin kirje romaniyhteisölle |trans-title=Riku Lumberg's open letter to the Romani community |language=Finnish |newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |location=Helsinki |date=19 August 2007 |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Riku+Lumbergin+avoin+kirje+romaniyhteis%C3%B6lle/1135229662785 |accessdate=1 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma artist Kiba Lumberg has said the following about the culture she grew up in: "Blood feud and the violence that exists in Roma culture, can't be discussed in Finland. We can't accept that some groups hide behind culture to excuse stepping on human rights and freedom of speech," and "the problem is, that when a Gypsy dares to speak in public about the negative things happening in their own tribe, they face death threats. If a white person opens their mouth, they're accused of racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Varpula |first=Sari |title=Taiteilija Kiba Lumberg: Sieluni ei mahdu mustalaishameeseen |trans-title=|language=Finnish |newspaper=Sana |location=Helsinki |date=16 August 2007 |url=http://www.sana.fi/etusivu/ajassa/taiteilija_kiba_lumberg_sieluni_ei_mahdu_mustalaishameeseen/ |accessdate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323141759/http://www.sana.fi/etusivu/ajassa/taiteilija_kiba_lumberg_sieluni_ei_mahdu_mustalaishameeseen/ |archivedate=March 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Ministry of Justice indicated that in 2005, persons of Romani background (who make up less than 0.2% of the total population of Finland&lt;ref name="Suomen romanit"/&gt;) perpetrated 18% of solved street robbery crimes in Finland - by way of comparison, the slightly larger 14,769 as opposed the 10,000 Somali population were responsible for 12%, while ethnic Finns were close to 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.optula.om.fi/uploads/gtdiy5wfbcaf939.pdf |title=Ryöstörikoskatsaus 2007 |first=Martti |last=Lehti |date=14 February 2008 |publisher=Oikeuspoliittinen tutkimuslaitos |location=Helsinki |series=OPTL:n tutkimustiedonantoja 83 |pages=36–7 |language=Finnish |trans-title=Robbery Crime Report 2007 |format=PDF |isbn=978-951-704-350-2 |accessdate=21 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2003 report by the Finnish Department of Corrections, there were an estimated 120 to 140 Romanis in the Finnish prison system. The report discussed ways to combat institutional racism and discrimination within the prison system, as well as ways for improving rehabilitation of Romani inmates through, for example, education programmes and better cooperation with the Romani community at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rikosseuraamus.fi/uploads/26k6igza.pdf |title=Romanien asema ja olosuhteet vankiloissa sekä yhdyskuntaseuraamusten suorittajina: Työryhmän raportti |date=20 January 2003 |publisher=Rikosseuraamusvirastolle |location=Helsinki |series=Rikosseuraamusviraston monisteita 2/2003 |pages= |language=Finnish |trans-title=On the status of the Roma and the conditions of prisons and community penalties performed: Task Force Report |format=PDF |accessdate=21 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">The '''Khanzada''' are a sub-group wirthin the [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community found in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They also refer to themselves as Gautam Thakurs. The Gautam Khanzada are [[Muslim]] converts from the [[Gautam Rajputs|Gautam]] community.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Origin==
At various times in history, different lineages of the rajputs Khanzada converted to [[Islam]]. The rajputs Khanzada of [[Fatehpur District]] are said to have converted during the rule of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Jehangir]]. This group of rajputss claim descent from Ratan Sen, who is said to be married to the daughter of [[Jaichand of Kannauj]]. Through him descended two brothers, Bijai Singh and Bahrawat Singh. Bijai Singh took the name Bijli Khan, and his descendents are now found mainly in Bhainsauli. They were at one time substantial landowners. Bahrawat Singh, on his conversion to [[Islam]] took the name Bahadur Khan, was granted eighty four villages, that former the estate of Tappa Jar. His son Mansoor founded the village of Mansoorpur while another son Sarmast founded the village of Sarmastpur. These two villages plus the village of Garhi Jar and Bahadur pur  Meona were home to families who played an important role in the history of [[Fatehpur District]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Another prominent rajputs family was that of the Rajahs of [[Azamgarh]]. The family claimed descent from Chandra Sen, who had two sons, Sagar Singh and Abhiman Singh. Sagar Singh converted to [[Islam]], and took the name Daulat Khan. He passed his estate on to his nephew Harbans Singh. It was Harbans Singh son Bikramjit Singh, also known as Azam Khan who founded the city of [[Azamgarh]]. His brother Azmat founded the town of Azmatgarh. The Rajahs of Azamgarh maintained their independence until their principality fell to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the late 18th Century. Another rajputs family in [[Azamgarh District]] was that of the Sidhari Babus, who were also substantial landowners. Other minor rajputs Khanzada landowners included the chaudhary of Khutahan Shahgang in [[Jaunpur District]], as well as minor landowners in [[Sitapur District]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Present circumstances==
The sense of Rajput identity amongst the rajputs Khanzada remains strong, especially those of [[Fatehpur District]]. In their marriages too, Rajput customs are followed, like bursting of fire crackers and sending specially made [[laddoo]]s to community members, which form part of marriage celebrations. The community also practices clan exogamy, marrying into other [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] communities such as the [[Dikhit Khanzada]]. Rajput traditions have eclipsed the religious divide and forged a common identity for the Hindu rajputs Thakurs and the rajputs Muslims. This is seen by the act that [[Hindu]] rajputs Thakurs participate in Muslim rajputs functions, while rajputs Muslims participate in intercommunity functions including religious ones. For example, rajputs Muslims help organise Holi milans, Ram Lilas and kirtans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20020715/living.shtml |title=Mixed Strains |publisher=[[India Today]] |date=2002-07-15 |accessdate=2010-08-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034445/http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20020715/living.shtml |archivedate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gedatsu-kai was established by Seiken Okano (born Eizo Okano) in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Hardacre (1991), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Within the church he is given the title "Gedatsu [[Vajra|Kongō]] Sonja". Church members refer to him as "Kongō Sama" or "Sonja".

His successor (referred to as Hoshu, or Dharma successor) is Seiho Okano, an affiliate of the revisionist lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]],&lt;ref&gt;Nippon Kaigi website&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=September 2018}} and the Chairman of the board of directors is Teruo Okano.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gedatsukai.jp/english/gaiyo_e/soshiki/ Organization and Activities]" - Gedatsu-kai website, retrieved Nov 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Gedatsu-kai has branches throughout Japan. The church's administrative headquarters are located in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]], but its sacred grounds, or ''goreichi'', are located in the founder's home town in [[Kitamoto, Saitama]]. There are also several branches in the United States, where the organization is called "Gedatsu Church". The largest branches are located in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[Sacramento, California]], and [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].

'''Gender in youth sports''' refers to the role and influence that both young male and females have in sports. The participation of youth in sports is a matter that is always trying to be improved and appeal to all genders. There are organizations across the world that are trying to improve the disparity of participation rates between boys and girls.

==Participation rates in youth sports by gender==

In the United States, 8 million 3rd–12th grade girls and 12 million boys play sports&lt;ref&gt;Sabo, Don, Phil Veliz, and Foundation Women's Sports. "Progress Without Equity: The Provision Of High School Athletic Opportunity In The United States, By Gender 1993–94 Through 2005–06. &lt;/ref&gt; Women's Sports Foundation (2011): ERIC. Web. 26 Oct. 2013. There are more boys participating in sports than girls in urban and suburban areas. Studies on third to fifth grade children found that in urban areas 59% of girls participated in sport compared to the 80% of boys who participated. In suburban areas, 81% of girls compared to 89% of boys involved in youth sports, while in rural areas 73% of girls participated compared to 69% of boys (Sabo, 2008). Gender equality for younger children was better in rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. Young urban girls, especially, have a narrower window of opportunity for becoming involved with sports than their male counterparts and girls from suburban and rural communities. 1 in 4 ninth-to 12th-grade urban girls have never participated in organized or team sports, compared to about 1 in 6 urban boys (Sabo and Veliz, 2008).

Age and social class contribute to differences in gender participation.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Half of low-income parents agreed that their schools and communities were not meeting the needs of girls as much as those of boys (Hessel, 2000).  More African-American and Hispanic parents feel schools and communities are failing their daughters. Boys in immigrant families are more likely to play sports than girls are. Nearly a quarter (23%) of children have at least one parent born outside the United States. Compared to boys, girls in immigrant families report lower rates of athletic participation. Many immigrant parents also hold more traditional attitudes toward girls' and boys' interest in sports (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). However, girls are exploring a wider array of sports and exercise activities than boys do, including traditional, recreational and newly emerging sports such as cheerleading, dance, double dutch and volleyball. Boys focus more on traditional sports and exercise activities, which, most often, take the form of organized school and community sports (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). In short, progress on the gender front in U.S. sports has been made, but it remains uneven, and it is often poor and urban girls who are being left behind.

Girls of color are doubly impacted by both gender and race discrimination in sport (Sabo and Veliz, 2008). Fifteen percent of all girls and 16% of all boys who participate in sports are African-American. 17% of female athletes and 15% of male athletes are Hispanic, while Asian girls and boys comprise 8% and 12%, respectively, of children who play sports. And yet, proportionally fewer girls of color are involved with sports than white girls. Girls of color are also much more likely than their male counterparts to be non-athletes. The same discrepancies across racial and ethnic groups do not exist among boys.

Sports like soccer, baseball, and basketball are shared by both girls and boys. However, there are still sports still considered "boy sports", such as football and wrestling. More females are involved in sports that were once considered male only sports due to the fact that youth sports organizations such as the [[National Alliance for Youth Sports]] have added more mixed gendered opportunities for children over the years (Stiebling 1999). Sport is seen as a status enhancer in school that has led to a difference in participation levels based on factors such as gender, ethnicity, and grade level (Shakib, 2011)

==Gender and sports opportunities==

The rise of organized sports opportunities for girls has increased dramatically since the passage of [[Title IX]] in 1972. During the 1972–73 season, the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] offered its first seven national championships which included badminton, basketball, golf, gymnastics, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, and volleyball. By the 1980–81 season, the [[AIAW]] national program had grown to 39 championships in 17 different sports with 6,000 women's teams and 960 member institutions (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). The number of female participants continues to rise as variables such as opportunity for involvement, valuing of sports as part of total development and overall fitness for girls and women has increased. Among the many forms of sexism in sports, perhaps the most pervasive and devastating is the lack of equal opportunities for girls to compete in programs similar to those offered for boys (Seefeldt, V., Ewing, M. E, 1995).

Despite the tremendous gains in sports participation made by girls and women during the last 30 years, there is still a persistent gap in the enrollment figures between males and females. The participation of girls is currently only 39% of the total participation in interscholastic athletics. There has been a slow but steady climb toward equity in the percent of female participants, from 32% of the males' participation in 1973–74 to 63% in 1994–95 (Hessel, 2000).  Generally more boys attend PE classes than girls, especially in urban and rural schools. (Sabo and Veliz, 2008)  Urban girls are left out when it comes to physical education (PE) in the United States, with 84% report having no [[Physical education|PE]] classes at all in the 11th and 12th grades. Rural girls in the same grades are not far behind with 68% reporting no PE classes. Across the country, young low-income children both girls and boys are undeserved with regard to school-based physical education.

Girls' sports have been defined and shaped by "men's values, men's understanding of the world, and men's experiences-all of which suppress the development and expression of female values" (Blinde, 1989). The history and evolution of gendered sports substantiates this statement and provides evidence of gender bias in sports as well as sport culture created and sustained to maintain that bias. Girls have had to adapt within the established male model. Boys continue to receive the bulk of sport participation opportunities, scholarships, and access to better coaching (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). These gains for boys has resulted in the loss of women's sport culture, therefore merging female sports model into the existing male sport model. The ability for girls to play has led to the reduction of female sport administrative leadership and female coaches.

==Adult gender in youth sports==
===Statistics===

The gendered participation in youth sports is seen not only by the separating of boys and girls, but also in the roles of the adults who are contributing to the teams as volunteers. Messner and Bozada-Deas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Messner, M. A., &amp; Bozada-Deas, S | title=Separating the Men from the Moms: The Making of Adult Gender Segregation in Youth Sports. | year=2009 | publisher=Kaleidoscope of Gender: Third Edition. Pg.495–506}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied yearbooks from a group of 538 youth baseball and softball teams and 1,490 from the American Youth Soccer Organization ([[AYSO]]) in 1999 to 2007. Only 13.4% of the teams had women coaches on the soccer team and only 5.9% of the team's management in baseball and softball were women. There are slots reserved just for team parents, whose sole duty is to take care of snacks, make phone calls to organize team events, hold fundraising, and providing support for the team players, majority women. Men holding the title of team parent is non-existent.

===Responsibility===
Men prefer not to volunteer for team parent positions due to the responsibilities placed on them compared to those of the coach. Women's roles in sports are to hold the position of team parent, while men are usually [[head coach]] or [[assistant coach]]. Team parents are often labeled “team mom”, making this position more likely for female parents than male parents. The gendered assumption of team parent being called “team mom” and the idea of having a “team dad” is ridiculous and often laughed at.  Therefore when given the opportunity to volunteer, more women choose to be team parents, while men will most likely choose to be assistant coaches. For men, coaching involves more masculine tasks, involving leadership over the entire team, setting up games, practices, and trained athletes.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Parents' involvement in youth sports===

For girl athletes, the mentors they mentioned in exercise and sports were their coaches and physical education teachers. For boys, dads and coaches topped the list of main mentors. 46% of boys and 28% of girls credit their father for teaching them “the most” about sports and exercise. While mothers and fathers provide similar levels of encouragement and support for both their daughters and sons, many girls may be shortchanged by dads who channel more energy into mentoring their sons than their daughters (Sabo and Veliz 2008).

==Gender gap in physical education==
The gender gap in physical education: Urban girls are the have-nots of [[physical education]] (PE) in the United States, with 84% report having no PE classes at all in the 11th and 12th grades. Rural girls in the same grades are not far behind with 68% reporting no PE classes. Across the country, young low-income children both girls and boys are underserved with regard to school-based physical education. Generally more boys attend PE classes than girls, especially in urban and rural schools. (Sabo and Veliz 2008)

==Adult gender mentoring in youth sports==
===Professional coaching===
In 1972, more than 90% of women's programs were administered and directed by women. By 1994, less than 21% of those same programs were administered/directed by a female, and by 1999 the percent of female head athletic administrators had dropped to 17.8% (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001). Men began applying for, and getting, women's coaching positions. In 1972, over 90% of the coaches who coached women's sports were female. By 1999, 45.6% of women's sports coaches were female. Coaching opportunities for men in women's sports were increasing significantly. Conversely, the number of female coaches in men's sports has not seen the same growth. About 2% of [[NCAA]] men's programs have a female coach at the helm (Everhart and Pemberton, 2001).

===Volunteer coaching===

===Parental gender bias in sports===

For girl athletes, the mentors they mentioned in exercise and sports were their coaches and physical education teachers. For boys, dads and coaches topped the list of main mentors. 46% of boys and 28% of girls credit their father for teaching them “the most” about sports and exercise. While mothers and fathers provide similar levels of encouragement and support for both their daughters and sons, many girls may be shortchanged by dads who channel more energy into mentoring their sons than their daughters (Sabo and Veliz, 2008).

==Youth sports in urban communities==

More parents in lower-income families indicated that girls were not getting similar support and resources in athletics as boys. Young urban girls, especially, have a narrower window of opportunity for becoming involved with sports than their male counterparts and girls from suburban and rural communities. 1 in 4 ninth-to 12th-grade girls have never participated in organized or team sports in urban schools, compared to about 1 in 6 urban boys (Sabo and Veliz 2008). Half of [[low-income]] parents agreed that their schools and communities were not meeting the needs of girls as much as those of boys compared with about 1/3 of middle-and upper-income parents (Hessel 2000). While a majority of parents say they want similar levels of athletic opportunity for their daughters and sons, many believe that their schools and communities are failing to deliver the goods. Youth sports are racially and ethnically diverse. 15% of all girls and 16% of all boys who participate in sports are African-American. 17% of female athletes and 15% of male athletes are Hispanic, while Asian girls and boys comprise 8% and 12%, respectively, of children who play sports. And yet, proportionally fewer girls of color are involved with sports than white girls. Girls of color are also much more likely than their male counterparts to be non-athletes. The same discrepancies across racial and ethnic groups do not exist among boys. Girls of color are doubly hit by both gender and race discrimination in sport (Sabo and Veliz 2008). Many parents are aware that girls are getting fewer opportunities in sports and physical activity than boys are. More African-American and Hispanic parents feel schools and communities are failing their daughters. Also boys in immigrant families are more than likely to play sports than girls to play sports. Nearly a quarter (23%) of children have at least one parent born outside the United States. Compared to boys, girls in immigrant families report lower rates of athletic participation. Many immigrant parents also hold more traditional attitudes toward girls' and boys' interest in sports (Sabo and Veliz 2008). However, girls are exploring a wider array of sports and exercise activities than boys do, including traditional, recreational and newly emerging sports such as [[cheerleading]], [[dance]], [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|Double Dutch]] and volleyball. Boys focus more on traditional sports and exercise activities, which, most often, take the form of organized school and community sports (Sabo and Veliz 2008).

The '''Greater Awyu''' languages, known in earlier and more limited classifications as '''Awyu–Dumut''' or '''Awyu–Ndumut''', and also known by the geographical label of '''Digul River''' languages, are a family of perhaps a dozen [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] spoken in eastern [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]. Six of the languages are sufficiently attested for a basic description; it is not clear how many of the additional names (in parentheses below) may be separate languages.

==Classification==
The classification below is based on Usher&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/trans-new-guinea/central-west-new-guinea/digul-river-ok/digul-river]&lt;/ref&gt; and de Vries et al. (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Lourens de Vries, Ruth Wester, &amp; Wilco van den Heuvel. 2012. "The Greater Awyu language family of West Papua", pp. 269–312 of Hammarström &amp; van den Heuvel (eds.), ''History, Contact and Classification of Papuan Languages.'' (Language and  Linguistics in Melanesia Special Issue). Port Moresby: Linguistic Society of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/ref&gt; who used morphological innovations to determine relatedness, as these can be obscured by loans.

* [[Sawi language (Papuan)|Sawi]] (Sawuy)
*Awyu–Dumut (Central Digul River)
** Awyu branch: [[Aghu language|Aghu]] (Jair), [[Shiaxa language|Shiaxa]] (Jenimu, Edera), [[Pisa language|Pisa]] (Asuwe)
**Ndeiram–Ndumut
*** Dumut (Wambon) branch: [[Mandobo language|Mandobo]] (Kaeti, Dumut), [[Wambon language|Wambon]]
***Ndeiram River: [[Kombai language|Kombai–Wanggom]]

**Becking–Dawi
***Dawi River: [[Komyandaret language|Komyandaret]], [[Tsaukambo language|Tsaukambo]]
***Becking River: [[Korowai language|Korowai]]

Sawi is classified on pronominal data, as the morphological data used for the rest of the family is not available.  The pronouns of the Awyu–Dumut branch are:

:{|
! !!sg!!pl
|-
!1
|*nu-p||*na-gu-p
|-
!2
|*gu-p||*ga-gu-p
|-
!3
|*e-p, *[n]ege-p, *yu-p||*ya-gu-p
|}
The suffix *-p and the change of the final TNG *a vowel to *u do not appear in the possessive pronouns: ''*na, *ga, *ya/wa, *na-ga, *ga-ga, *ya-ga''.

Various other languages can be found in the literature. Ario (Sumagaxe)&lt;ref&gt;Multitree [http://multitree.org/codes/qgz qgz]&lt;/ref&gt; is listed in Wurm, Foley, etc., but not in the University of Amsterdam survey and has been dropped by ''Ethnologue''. ''Ethnologue'' lists a 'Central Awyu', but this is not attested as a distinct language (U. Amsterdam). In general, the names in ''Ethnologue'' are quite confused, and older editions speak of names from Wurm (1982), such as ''Mapi, Kia, Upper Digul, Upper Kaeme'', which are names of language surveys along the rivers of those names, and may actually refer to [[Ok languages]] rather than to Awyu.

van den Heuvel &amp; Fedden (2014) argue that Greater Awyu and Greater Ok are not genetically related, but that their similarities are due to intensive contact.&lt;ref&gt;van den Heuvel, W. &amp; Fedden, S. (2014). Greater Awyu and Greater Ok: Inheritance or Contact? ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 53(1), 1-36. University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Awyu (pronounced like English ''Ow you'') and Awyu–Dumut families were identified by [[Peter Drabbe]] in the 1950s.

Voorhoeve included them in his proposed [[Central and South New Guinea languages|Central and South New Guinea]] group.&lt;ref&gt;Voorhoeve, C.L. 1968. “The Central and South New Guinea Phylum: a report on the language situation in south New Guinea. Pacific Linguistics, Series A, No. 16: 1-17. Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of Central and South New Guinea, they form part of the original proposal for Trans–New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;McElhanon, Kenneth A.and  C.L. Voorhoeve. 1970. &lt;u&gt;The Trans-New Guinea phylum: explorations in deep-level genetic relationships.&lt;/u&gt; Pacific Linguistics, Series B, No. 16.

There are two '''languages of the [[Pitcairn Islands]]''', English and [[Pitkern]].

Pitkern is a creole language based on eighteenth-century English and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and spoken by about fifty people inland not to mention those outside [[Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands|Adamstown]], mostly dozens of children leaving Pitcairn while becoming adults. It is partly derived from eighteenth-century English because Pitcairn Island was settled by the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]] in the eighteenth century, and they brought some people from Taihiti with them.

Pitkern is closely related to [[Norfuk]] spoken on Norfolk Island, where some descendants of the mutineers subsequently settled.

'''Lucas John "Luke" Helder''' (born May 5, 1981) is a former [[University of Wisconsin–Stout]] student from [[Pine Island, Minnesota]], who earned notoriety as the '''Midwest Pipe Bomber''' in May 2002.

== Bombings ==
While attending the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Stout]] and living in an apartment in [[Menomonie, Wisconsin]], Helder planned to plant [[pipe bomb]]s in mailboxes across the United States to create a [[smiley]] face shape on the United States map.&lt;ref name="TPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tpr.org/post/who-might-be-behind-austin-bombings|title=Who Might Be Behind The Austin Bombings?|date=March 20, 2018|work=Texas Public Radio|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs, which were packed with [[BB gun|BB]]s and [[Nail (fastener)|nails]], were rigged to explode as the mailboxes were opened. Completed and rigged bombs were found in [[Nebraska]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]], [[Illinois]] and [[Iowa]]. In Iowa, six people, including four mail carriers, were injured when the bombs detonated.&lt;ref name="usps001"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = United States Postal Service | title = 2002 Annual Report of Investigations: Violent Crime | work = USPS Website | publisher = | year = 2002 | url = http://www.usps.com/postalinspectors/ar02/ar02_04.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231308/http://www.usps.com/postalinspectors/ar02/ar02_04.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Helder planted 18 bombs and covered 3,200 miles.&lt;ref name="time001"&gt;Reaves, Jessica. "Person of the Week: Lucas Helder." ''Time'' May 9, 2002 [http://www.time.com/time/pow/article/0,8599,236525,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually captured in rural [[Nevada]] before he managed to complete the full smile. At the time of his arrest, police were looking for an unknown suspect driving a black [[Honda Accord]] and newspapers reported that he was wearing a [[Kurt Cobain]] T-shirt.&lt;ref name="lt001"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = Leader-Telegram staff and The Associated Press | title = Dad aids son's capture | work = Leader-Telegram | publisher = Eau Claire Press Company | year = 2002 | url = http://www.leadertelegram.com/SpecialReports/Helder/5-8mainstory.asp | accessdate = 2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombings were heavily covered by the [[United States]] [[News media (United States)|media]].

== Writings and theories ==
[[File:Helder.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Helder performing with ''Apathy'' in his hometown of [[Pine Island, Minnesota]]]]
While Helder was not at the top of his college class, his teachers described him as a reasonably good, quiet and polite student, and at first there was confusion as to what the motivation for the bombings could be.&lt;ref name = "time001"/&gt; Within the year prior to his arrest, Helder had become passionate about [[astral projection]] techniques and came to believe that death of the flesh and body is not the end of existence, as evidenced by the [[manifesto]] he sent to ''[[The Badger Herald]]'' of the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]] at the beginning of the bombing spree.&lt;ref name = "time001"/&gt; The essay also includes statements such as &lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm taking very drastic measure in attempt to provide this information to you... I will die/change in the end for this, but that's ok, hahaha paradise awaits! I'm dismissing a few individuals from reality, to change all of you for the better"&lt;ref name="man001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/luke-helder-manifesto|title=Pipe Bomb Suspect's Grungy Past|date=May 7, 2002|work=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bad001"&gt;Lagorio, Christine. "News Analysis: Newspapers receipt of shady mail a daily occurrence." ''The Badger Herald'' May 10, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notes attached to the bombs went on to denounce [[government]] control over daily lives, deny that anyone who had died was really dead, and promised more of the same kind of message.&lt;ref name="time001" /&gt;

== Trial ==
In April 2004, a federal judge found Helder incompetent to stand trial.&lt;ref name="wqad001"&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Van Hyfte

 | authorlink =

 |accessdate = 2018-03-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a judge could free Helder if doctors find he is not a threat to society, legal experts doubt this possibility due to the violent nature of his crimes. He has been diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victim of mailbox bombing hopes suspect gets well|website=Post Bulletin|url=http://www.postbulletin.com/news/crime/victim-of-mailbox-bombing-hopes-suspect-gets-well/article_38882ddd-c1ee-5871-ac03-9ede3085f5d1.html|last=Foley|first=Ryan|date=2013-05-18|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a federal judge ordered Helder re-evaluated for competency to stand trial.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.twincities.com/2013/05/15/minnesotan-in-2002s-smiley-face-bomber-case-could-finally-face-trial/|title=Minnesotan in 2002’s ‘smiley face bomber’ case could finally face trial|last=staff|date=May 15, 2013|work=Twin Cities Pioneer Press|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helder remains incarcerated in the [[FMC Rochester|Federal Medical Center]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="wqad002"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first=Vanessa |authorlink=The Associated Press |title=Experts say mailbox bomb suspect unlikely to be freed soon |work=WQAD Report |publisher= |date=April 6, 2004 |url=http://www.wqad.com/Global/story.asp?s=1767322 |accessdate=2007-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222627/http://www.wqad.com/Global/story.asp?s=1767322 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical background ==
Prior to his bombing spree, Helder was a member of Apathy, a [[Rochester, Minnesota]], three-piece [[grunge]] band. Although the band was successful only on a local scale, it recorded a CD named ''Sacks of People'' at the end of their first summer together, which they funded and released themselves.

When the news broke that Helder was the pipe bomber, the media made significant mention of his status as a musician.&lt;ref name="cnn001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman |first=Charles |authorlink= |title=Feds: Suspect admitted pipe bomb spree. |work=CNN.com |publisher= |date=May 9, 2002 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/08/mailbox.pipebombs/index.html |accessdate=2007-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117123142/https://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/08/mailbox.pipebombs/index.html |archivedate=November 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many music critics scrambled to acquire copies of Apathy's CD, some of which were auctioned on [[eBay]] for as much as $200.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2870">'''Männerchor''' or '''Maennerchor''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɛnɐˌkoːɐ̯}}, "men's chorus") is the name given to [[German language|German]] [[social clubs]], primarily in the northeastern [[United States]], [[Pennsylvania]] in particular.  The earliest forms of these clubs where "singing societies" that perpetuated traditional [[choral]] music, both German and [[German American|German-American]] culture, providing ''[[Gemuetlichkeit]]'' for new immigrants.  Such clubs are typically attended by men and many function as a restaurant and bar, serving [[German cuisine|German food]]s and [[Beer in Germany|beer]]s.

A Maennerchor was established in [[Cincinnati]] in 1857 with the merging of the Liedertafel, the Saengerbund and the Germanic Societies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&amp;pg=PA465#v=onepage&amp;q=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&amp;f=false | title=Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788-1912, Volume 2 | publisher=The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company | date=1912 | accessdate=2013-05-20 | author=Clark, S. J. | pages=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the oldest musical organization of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJxABLtxX60C&amp;dq=1880%20cincinnati&amp;pg=PA879#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Centennial History of Cincinnati and Representative Citizens, Volume 1 | publisher=Biographical Publishing Company | date=1904 | accessdate=2013-05-22 | author=Charles Theodore Greve | pages=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indianapolis Maennerchor]]. founded in 1854 in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], is another such organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-lib.iupui.edu/special/collections/german-american/mss040 |title=Indianapolis Maennerchor Records, 1866-1990 |publisher=[[IUPUI University Library]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Damenchor]] often serves as the Maennerchor auxiliary for women.

'''Maghrebi Arabic''' ('''Western Arabic'''; as opposed to Eastern Arabic or [[Mashriqi Arabic]]) is an [[Arabic]] [[Varieties of Arabic|dialect continuum]] spoken in the [[Maghreb]] region, in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Western Sahara]], and [[Mauritania]]. It includes [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]], [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]], [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]], [[Libyan Arabic|Libyan]], and [[Hassaniya Arabic]]. Speakers of Maghrebi Arabic call their language '''Derja''', '''Derija''' or '''Darija''' ({{lang-ar|الدارجة}}; meaning "to rise or advance step by step"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehr|first1=Hans|title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic: (Arab.-Engl.)|date=1979|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447020024|page=319|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=WTak55pG-_IC&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Name==
''Darija'', ''Derija'' or ''Delja'' ({{lang-ar|الدارجة}}) means "everyday/colloquial language";&lt;ref&gt;Wehr, Hans: ''Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic'' (2011); Harrell, Richard S.: ''Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; it is also rendered as ''{{transl|aeb|ed-dārija}}'', ''derija'' or ''darja''. It refers to any of the varieties of colloquial Maghrebi Arabic. Although it is also common in [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] to refer to the Maghrebi Arabic varieties directly as languages, similarly it is also common in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] to refer to the Mashriqi Arabic varieties directly as languages. For instance, Algerian Arabic would be referred as ''Dzayri'' (Algerian) and Tunisian Arabic as ''Tounsi'' (Tunisian), and Egyptian Arabic would be referred as ''Masri'' (Egyptian) and Lebanese Arabic as ''Lubnani'' (Lebanese).

In contrast, the colloquial dialects of more eastern Arab countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are usually known as ''{{transl|aeb|al-‘āmmīya}}'' ({{lang|ar|العامية}}), though Egyptians may also refer to their dialects as ''al-logha-d-darga''.

==Characteristics==
The varieties of Maghrebi Arabic (Darija) have a significant degree of mutual intelligibility, especially between geographically adjacent ones (such as local dialects spoken in Eastern Morocco and Western Algeria or Eastern Algeria and North Tunisia or South Tunisia and Western Libya), but hardly between Moroccan and Tunisian Darija. Conversely, Moroccan Darija, Tunisian Derja and particularly Algerian Derja cannot be understood by Eastern Arabic speakers (from Egypt, Sudan, Levant, Iraq, and Arabian peninsula) in general as they derive from different substratums and a mixture of many languages (Berber, Latin ([[African Romance]]), Old Arabic, Turkish, French, Spanish, [[Mozarabic]], Italian, and Niger-Congo languages). Some [[linguists]] like [[Charles A. Ferguson]], [[William Marçais]] consider Maghrebi Arabic Darija an independent language.&lt;ref&gt;
Abdou Elimam, « Le maghribi, langue trois fois millénaire », éd. ANEP, Alger (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdou Elimam, « Le maghribi, alias ed-darija, langue consensuelle du Maghreb », éd. Dar El Gharb, Alger (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maghrebi Arabic continues to evolve by integrating new French or English words, notably in technical fields, or by replacing old French and Italian/Spanish ones with Modern Standard Arabic words within some circles; more educated and upper-class people who code-switch between Maghrebi Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic have more French and Italian/Spanish loanwords, especially the latter came from the time of [[al-Andalus]]. Maghrebi dialects all use ''n-'' as the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] on [[verb]]s, distinguishing them from [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine dialects]] and Modern Standard Arabic.

===Relationship with Modern Standard Arabic and Berber languages===
Modern Standard Arabic ({{lang|ar|الفصحى}} ''al-Fusḥā'') is the primary language used in the government, legislation and judiciary of countries in the Maghreb. Maghrebi Arabic is mainly a [[spoken language|spoken]] and [[vernacular language]], although it occasionally appears in entertainment and advertising in urban areas of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In Algeria, where Maghrebi Arabic was taught as a separate subject under French colonization, some textbooks in the language exist but they are no longer officially endorsed by the Algerian authorities. Maghrebi Arabic contains a [[Berber languages|Berber]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]], which represents the languages originally spoken by the native populations of the Maghreb prior to their adoption of Arabic.&lt;ref name="Mohand"&gt;Tilmatine Mohand, « Substrat et convergences : Le berbère et l'arabe nord-africain », ''Estudios de dialectologia norteaafricana y andalusi'', n°4, 1999, pp. 99-119&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect may also possess a [[Punic language|Punic]] substrate.&lt;ref name="maghribi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benramdane|first=Farid|title=''Le maghribi, langue trois fois millénaire'' de ELIMAM, Abdou (Éd. ANEP, Alger 1997)|journal=Insaniyat|volume=|issue=6|date=1998|pages=129–130|issn=|url=http://insaniyat.revues.org/12102|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Maghrebi Arabic has a [[Latin]] substratum, which may have been derived from the [[African Romance]] that was used as an urban lingua franca during the [[Byzantine Empire]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sayahi|first1=Lotfi|title=Diglossia and Language Contact: Language Variation and Change in North Africa|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521119367|page=26|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9R5GAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with foreign languages===
Maghrebi Arabic speakers frequently borrow words from French (in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), Spanish (in Morocco) and Italian (in Libya and Tunisia) and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] them according to the rules of their dialects with some exceptions (like passive voice for example). Since it is not always written, there is no standard and it is free to change quickly and to pick up new vocabulary from neighbouring languages. This is somewhat similar to what happened to [[Middle English]] after the [[Norman conquest]].

The '''Manhattan Club''' was a social club in [[Manhattan]], New York founded in 1865 and dissolved around 1979.

==History==
Designed to be the Democratic answer to the [[Union Club of the City of New York|Union Club]], its prominent members included [[Samuel J. Tilden]], [[August Belmont]], [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Alfred E. Smith]], [[Herbert H. Lehman]], [[Jimmy Walker]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]&lt;ref name="sold"&gt;{{cite news| title=MANHATTAN CLUB SOLD FOR $600,000 - Century-Old Institution Was Refuge for Democrats.|work=New York Times |date = 5 May 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members included [[Augustus Schell]], [[Dean Richmond]] and [[John T. Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/97673063/fulltextPDF/13F67D0CC1E452A60D5/1?accountid=34227| title=Famous Manhattan Club Is Fifty Years Old: Since Its Founding in 1865 the Noted Democratic Organization Has Many Times Played a Prominent Part in the History of New York.|work=New York Times |date= 10 October 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885 it was listed as the residence of [[Robert Roosevelt|Robert Barnwell Roosevelt]], the uncle of Theodore Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=James|date=December 1997|title=The New York Public Library97117The New York Public Library.

The Manhattan Club was organized on September 25, 1865 at [[Delmonico's]] on 14th Street at Fifth Avenue.  Its first home was the Benkard House at 96 Fifth Avenue near the corner of 15th Street (called "Old 96" by members), followed by the [[Alexander Turney Stewart#Fifth Avenue mansion|A.T. Stewart Mansion]] on 34th Street at Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/97673063/fulltextPDF/13F67D0CC1E452A60D5/1?accountid=34227| title=Famous Manhattan Club Is Fifty Years Old: Since Its Founding in 1865 the Noted Democratic Organization Has Many Times Played a Prominent Part in the History of New York.|work=New York Times |date= 10 October 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1966, it occupied the [[Jerome Mansion]], at which time the building was sold to a developer and subsequently was torn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Time Running Out for City Landmark: 17-Month Search For Buyer for Jerome Mansion Fails.|work=New York Times |date = 22 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manhattan Club then moved to a suite of rooms at the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel|Barclay Hotel]] previously occupied by the [[Cornell Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=News of Realty : Club Will Move - 101 Year Old Manhattan Gets Barclay Hotel Suite.|work=New York Times |date = 10 November 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter functioned mainly as a luncheon club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=For Luncheon Clubs, Food is of Secondary Importance.|work=New York Times |date = 23 April 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1979, its suites were converted into conference rooms and the Manhattan Club was closed.&lt;ref&gt;http://nealprince.omeka.net/items/show/108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambiguous Democratic Party Legacy===
Despite having been conceived as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] bastion during the [[U.S. Civil War]], in its later days, the members of the Manhattan Club were often decidedly Republican in sympathies.  In 1954, a survey of the men's social clubs of Manhattan noted that the club had become "ninety percent Republican."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url =http://www.andrewcusack.com/2008/08/14/the-great-club-revolution/| title=The Great Club Revolution - What with all this democracy things will never be the same |journal=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |author=[[Cleveland Amory]] |date=December 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A half-century earlier, the significant majority of members supported Republican [[William McKinley]]'s bid for President of the United States, triggering letters of resignation from members who wanted it to be a Democratic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DE1DE103BEE33A25752C1A9679D94679ED7CF| title=Col. Brown's Resignation - Correspondence with the Manhattan Club's President.|work=New York Times |date= 11 November 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of the Manhattan Cocktail==
A popular history suggests that the Manhattan cocktail originated at the club in the early 1870s, where it was invented by Dr. Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by [[Jennie Jerome]] (Lady Randolph Churchill, [[Winston Churchill|Winston]]'s mother) in honor of presidential candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]]. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—"the ''Manhattan'' cocktail".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Manhattan (cocktail)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the club was featured in an 1891 painting by [[Childe Hassam]] when it was at the [[Alexander Turney Stewart#Fifth Avenue mansion|Stewart Mansion]].

==Murder of Stanford White==
On June 26, 1906, [[Stanford White]] was shot to death by [[Harry K. Thaw]], the eccentric millionaire, after leaving the Manhattan Club. The murder 
took place three blocks south in what was then [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="sold"/&gt;

'''Mang''', or '''Mashan Miao''' also known as '''Mashan Hmong''' (麻山 ''máshān''), is a [[Miao languages|Miao language]] of China. The endonym is ''Mang'', similar to other [[West Hmongic languages]] such as [[Mong language|Mong]].

==Varieties==
Mang was classified as a branch of [[Western Hmongic]] in Wang (1985), who listed four varieties.&lt;ref&gt;王辅世主编，《苗语简志》，民族出版社，1985年。&lt;/ref&gt; Matisoff (2001) gave these four varieties the status of separate languages, and, conservatively, did not retain them as a single group within West Hmongic. Li Yunbing (2000) added two minor varieties which had been left unclassified in Wang, Southeastern (Strecker's "[[Luodian County|Luodian]] Muyin") and Southwestern ("[[Wangmo County|Wangmo]]").&lt;ref&gt;李云兵，《苗语方言划分遗留问题研究》，中央民族大学出版社，2000年。&lt;/ref&gt;

*Central Mang: 70,000 speakers
*Northern Mang: 35,000
*Western Mang: 14,000
*Southern Mang: 10,000
*Southeastern Mang: 4,000
*Southwestern Mang: 4,000

==Phonology and script==
A pinyin alphabet had been created for Mang in 1985, but proved to have deficiencies. Wu and Yang (2010) report the creation of a new alphabet, albeit a tentative one, based on the Central Mang dialect of [[Ziyun County]], ''Zōngdì'' 宗地 township, ''Dàdìbà'' 大地坝 village.&lt;ref&gt;Wú Zhèngbiāo and Yáng Guāngyīng, 2010. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150420085819/http://218.249.224.102/upfile/20115613035615353.pdf 麻山次方言区苗文方案的设计与使用——兼谈苗族英雄史诗《亚鲁王》的记译整理问题], 民族翻译.&lt;br&gt;Several consonants were added to the 1985 alphabet, while ''bz, pz, nbz, mz'' and ''gh'' were removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants, in pinyin, are:
:labial: ''b p nb np, m f v, by py nby my, bl pl nbl npl ml''
:lateral: ''l lj''
:dental or alveolar stops: ''d t dl dj nd nt n''
:dental affricates: ''z c s nz nc''
:retroflex: ''dr tr ndr nr sh r''
:alveolo-palatal: ''j q nj x y ny''
:velar or uvular: ''g k ngg ng, h w hw''
:(zero onset)
The Latin voiced/voiceless opposition has been coopted to indicate aspiration, as usual in pinyin alphabets.

Correspondences between Central Mang dialects include Dadiba retroflex ''dr, tr'' with dental ''z, c'' in another village of the same Zongdi township, Sanjiao (三脚 ''Sānjiǎo''). The other five varieties of Mang have more palatalized initials than Central Mang, though these can be transcribed as medial ''-i-''. The onsets ''by, py, nby, my'' are pronounced {{IPA|[pʐ pʰʐ mpʐ mʐ&amp;thinsp;]}} in Central Mang and {{IPA|[pj pʰj mpj mj]}} in the other five Mang varieties.

Vowels and finals, including those needed for Chinese loans, are:

:''a aa'' {{IPA|[ã]}} ''ai ao ain ang
:''e ea ei en ein eu ew eng
:''i iou in ie iu iao ian iang
:''o ou ow ong
:''u uw ua ui ue un uai uan uang
:''yu''

Most Central Mang and Western Mang dialects have eleven to thirteen [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. Compared to the eight tone categories of other [[Western Hmongic]] languages, the odd-numbered tones are each split into two. The tones of at least three villages of Central Mang have been documented: Dadiba (Wu &amp; Yang 2010), Jiaotuozhai (Wang &amp; Mao 1995; Li 2000), and Jingshuiping (Xian 1990; Mortensen 2006&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen (2006), [http://www.pitt.edu/~drm31/VowelRaisingInShuijingping.pdf Diachronic Universals and Synchronic Parochialisms: Explaining Tone-Vowel Interactions].&lt;/ref&gt;), all in the Zongdi township of [[Ziyun County]]. They lie several kilometers apart and have minor differences.

Although some pairs of tones (such as tones 6 and 7b) have the same value when pronounced alone, they behave differently with regard to [[tone sandhi]] and should be treated as different phonologically. Tones also interact with phonation types and vowel quality. Jiaotuozhai tones 4 and 6 are breathy voiced and have higher vowels.

A '''meshrep''' ({{lang-ug|مەشرەپ, мәшрәп|pin=mäxräp}}; {{zh|c=麦西热甫|p=màixīrèfŭ}}, lit. "harvest festival") is a traditional male [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] gathering that typically includes "poetry, music, dance, and conversation within a structural context".&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; Meshreps typically include music of the [[Muqam]] variety and ad-hoc [[tribunal]]s on moral questions. "Meshrep" may also refer to the Islamic youth groups that became a political force in [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]], [[Xinjiang]] in the 1990s. The voluntary societies used extralegal means such as [[boycott]]s to enforce what they saw as Islamic mores against gambling, alcohol and drug abuse among young Uyghur men. Amid continuing political campaigns and antigovernment protests launched by these meshrep, the Xinjiang government cracked down on key religious leaders, including meshrep leaders, leading to [[Ghulja Incident|urban violence in 1997]] and the flight of meshrep leaders to [[Kazakhstan]]. In November 2010, China successfully petitioned [[UNESCO]] to list the traditional meshrep in its [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].

==Traditional structure==
The practice of meshrep is diverse among Uyghur communities, but there are some commonalities. Meshrep are usually held in the courtyard of one of the members' family home. Traditionally, meshrep were only held on the [[harvest]], and on [[wedding]]s, [[circumcision]]s, and girls' [[coming of age|comings of age]].&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of a Musical Canon in Chinese Central Asia: The Uyghur Twelve Muqam|author=Harris, Rachel A.|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2008|pages=24–25, 104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each meshrep consists of a leader (''yigit bashi'', an older man), a disciplinarian (''passip begi''), and 30 younger men (''ottuz oghul''), who sit on a carpet according to seniority.&lt;ref name="Thwaites"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thwaites, Dilber Kahraman|title=An Uyghur Meshrep Dichotomy|journal=Central Eurasian Studies Review|volume=4|number=2|date=Summer 2005|pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the meshreps were primarily [[male bonding]] events,&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; the women and children of the host's family were to stay inside the house and only interact with the men to bring them food or to otherwise serve them.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Music is an essential component of the meshrep, and during the meshrep, men play progressively faster [[muqam]] melodies on the [[dutar]] while others compete to see who could perform whirling circle dances for the longest period of time. Some meshrep also feature songs, skits, and lectures from religious leaders.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Aside from the entertainment value of the meshrep, these groups also formed part of the informal governance structure of Uyghur communities, and still do outside of China.&lt;ref name="Roberts204"&gt;{{citation|chapter='The Dawn of the East': A Portrait of a Uyghur Community Between China and Kazakhstan|last=Roberts|first=Sean R.|title=Situating the Uyghurs between China and Central Asia|editor-first=Ildikó|editor-last=Bellér-Hann|year=2007|series=Anthropology and cultural history in Asia and the Indo-Pacific|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the meshrep, the moral transgressions of the men, such as [[polygamy]], are publicly scolded and the men humiliated by slapping&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; or [[caning]].&lt;ref name="Wayne"/&gt; There is no limit on the length or attendance of the meshrep, and the [[Dolan people|Dolan Uyghurs]] were famed for hosting meshrep "attended by hundreds of people, and often last[ing] the whole night".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

==Ili Youth Meshrep==
The meshrep is attested to in modern Chinese literature as early as 1942, in the [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] play ''Gulnissa'', where the meshrep is portrayed as a secular, [[coeducational]] [[youth culture]].&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; During that time, the meshrep in [[Yining City|Yining]] (Ghulja) consisted of musical performances and "informal court hearings" for community dissidents.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; [[Uyghurs in Kazakhstan]] began practicing the meshrep as early as the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Roberts204"/&gt; After China's [[Economic history of the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] in the 1980s, a middle class began to develop in China, and ordinary Chinese had more leisure time and discretionary income.&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt; At the same time, political and religious controls were loosening, and Chinese officials encouraged the building of [[mosque]]s and the [[Hijab|veiling of women]].&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; Contemporary developments in the region, including the global [[Islamic revival]] and the independence of the [[Soviet Central Asia]]n states in 1992, inspired [[Uyghur independence]] feeling and the establishment of militant groups like the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]] (ETIM).&lt;ref name="Bulard"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://mondediplo.com/2009/08/02china|title=China's wild west|first=Martine|last=Bulard|date=August 2009|publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the 1990s, the social and political life in the city of [[Yining City|Yining]] (Ghulja) was predominantly secular. In Yining, young Uyghur men would informally gather, usually once a week, to drink [[baijiu]], perform poetry and music, and otherwise socialize. These gatherings, called ''olturax'', grew to perform important political and economic functions in Yining life.&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt;

Islamic&lt;ref name="Wayne"/&gt; youth groups organized in the evenings grew in opposition to and eventually eclipsed the olturax, also serving "the foci for Uyghur resistance to Chinese rule".&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulard"/&gt; Calling themselves "meshreps", the clubs criticized the secular nature of the olturax&lt;ref name="Tyler"/&gt; and the alcohol consumption within [[Islam and alcohol|as un-Islamic]].&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt; These meshreps, which have been compared to the Catholic [[Knights of Columbus]],&lt;ref name="ETIM"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ETIM: China's Islamic Militants and the Global Terrorist Threat|author=Reed, J. Todd|author2=Raschke, Diana|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2010|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; were more formal than the olturax: tasked with providing "moral guidance", they kept strict membership lists and organized regular meetings, wherein members would read passages from the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; Meshrep practitioners were held to a strict code of Islamic conduct in their daily lives, including abstinence from alcohol and [[hashish]]. Initiation into the meshrep involved [[hazing]] rituals,&lt;ref name="Wayne"/&gt; and once admitted, men who did not continue to meet the group's standards of Muslim piety were given [[corporal punishment]], such as [[caning]],&lt;ref name="Wayne"/&gt; or petty fines by the group.&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt; These practices diverged significantly from the meshrep's secular tradition,&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; and thus revived the meshrep in Yining with "new religious and nationalist meanings".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Initially, both social reformers and the local government supported the meshreps, as they provided an outlet for young Uyghur men in an environment rife with unemployment, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyler"/&gt; But as the popularity of meshrep grew, meshrep groups became more assertive in their opposition to the government's goals.&lt;ref name="Thwaites"/&gt; In the spring and summer of 1995, meshreps started a campaign of boycotts and intimidation against shops that sold [[liquor]] in Yining and the surrounding villages.&lt;ref name="Wayne"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's War on Terrorism: Counter-insurgency, politics, and internal security|author=Wayne, Martin I.|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the meshrep's political potential, Xinjiang authorities banned the gatherings in July 1995.&lt;ref name="ETIM"/&gt; However, most meshrep groups continued to operate in secret, or delegated their morals enforcement duties to legal [[neighborhood watch]] groups.&lt;ref name="Starr"/&gt; When a [[association football|football game]] organized by underground meshrep teams was canceled by authorities, the meshrep mobilized several hundred Uyghur men to march across government offices and to gather in Yining's main plaza, although there was no violence and the crowd dispersed after a few days. Authorities then drew a distinction between "healthy, traditional" meshrep and an "illicit" political and religious meshrep, encouraging the former but cracking down on the latter.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland|author=Starr, S. Frederick|publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]]|year=2004|pages=109, 282, 284–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a national anticrime campaign resulted in the arrests of meshrep leaders and [[talibe]]s in Yining, leading to mass riots called the [[Ghulja Incident]].&lt;ref name="Tyler"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang|first=Christian|last=Tyler|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2004|pages=168, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern meshrep==
After the Ghulja Incident, local antigovernment Uyghurs migrated to [[Almaty]] in Kazakhstan, where they continued to practice the meshrep as they had in Ili.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Central Asia and the Caucasus: Transnationalism and Diaspora|first=Touraj|last=Atabaki|first2=Sanjyot|last2=Mehendale|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2005|pages=159, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, [[UNESCO]] approved China' nomination of the meshrep to the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-11/15/c_13608055.htm|title=China's three nominations inscribed on List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding|date=2010-11-15|accessdate=2011-07-30|publisher=[[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nordic race''' was one of the putative [[Historical race concepts|sub-races]] into which some late-19th to mid-20th-century [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] divided the [[Caucasian race]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=o1sAuLlvQLwC&amp;pg=PA188 p.167]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological traits of Nordics were described as truthful, equitable, competitive, naïve, reserved, and individualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, Hans F. K., ''The Racial Elements of European History'', translated by G. C. Wheeler, Methuen &amp; Co. LTD, London, 1927, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other supposed sub-races were the [[Alpine race]], [[Dinaric race]], [[East Baltic race]], and the [[Mediterranean race]].

'''Nordicism''' is an ideology of [[racial segregation|racial separatism]] which views Nordics as an endangered and superior racial group, most notably outlined in [[Madison Grant]]'s book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'', and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]'s ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]''. This ideology was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Northwestern Europe|Northwestern]], [[Central Europe|Central]], and [[Northern Europe]]an countries as well as in North America and Australia. The idea of the Nordic phenotype being superior to others was originally embraced as "[[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]]ism" in Germany, "[[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxonism]]" in England and the United States, and "Gallicism" in [[France]].&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharma |first1=Ram Nath |last2=Sharma |first2=Rajendra K. |title=Anthropology |date=1997 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDrYsjGq35wC&amp;pg=PA69|isbn=9788171566730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smedley"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smedley |first1=Audrey |last2=Smedley |first2=Brian D. |title=Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview |date=2012 |publisher=Avalon Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XofAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243|isbn=9780813345543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmanon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McManon |first1=Richard |title=The Races of Europe: Construction of National Identities in the Social Sciences, 1839-1939 |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8SADQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204|isbn=9781137318466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the superiority of the "Nordic race" and the [[Northwestern Europe]]an nations associated with this supposed race influenced the United States' [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (which effectively banned or severely limited the immigration of Italians, Jews, and other [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]]ans) and the later [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]]&lt;ref name="vandenberghe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van den Berghe |first1=Pierre L. |title=The Ethnic Phenomenon |date=1987 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ethnic_Phenomenon.html?id=esAA9Njteu0C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=WASPs#v=onepage&amp;q=nordic&amp;f=false|isbn=9780275927097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was present in other countries outside of Northwestern Europe such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="tyson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tyson |first1=Lois |title=Critical Approaches to Literature |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QRGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323|isbn=9781351049894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicworld"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paulist Fathers |title=Catholic World |date=1927 |volume=125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5sEAAAAMAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, the [[Nazi party|Nazis]] claimed that the Nordic race was the most superior of the "[[Aryan race]]" and constituted a [[master race]] (''Herrenvolk'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Gregor| first =A James| title = Nordicism Revisted| journal = Phylon | volume =22| issue =4| pages = 352–360| year = 1961 |jstor=273538| doi =10.2307/273538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Karl von Müller.jpg|thumb|190px|upright|''[[Meyers Blitz-Lexikon]]'' ([[Weimar Republic|Leipzig, 1932]]) shows [[Germany|German]] war hero [[Karl von Müller]] as an example of the Nordic type]]
In the mid-19th century, [[scientific racism]] developed the theory of [[Aryan race|Aryanism]], holding that Europeans ("Aryans") were an innately superior branch of humanity {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, responsible for most of its greatest achievements. Aryanism was derived from the idea that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages constituted a distinctive race or subrace of the larger Caucasian race{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.
	
Its principal proponent was [[Arthur de Gobineau]] in his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races'' (1855){{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Though Gobineau did not equate Nordic peoples with Aryans, he argued that Germanic people were the best modern representatives of the Aryan race. Adapting the comments of [[Tacitus]] and other [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers, he argued that "pure" Northerners regenerated Europe after the [[Roman Empire]] declined due to racial "dilution" of its leadership{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.
	
By the 1880s a number of linguists and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. [[Theodor Poesche]] proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or [[Pinsk Marshes]], then in the [[Russian Empire]], now covering much of the southern part of [[Belarus]] and the north-west of the [[Ukraine]], but it was [[Karl Penka]] who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in [[Scandinavia]] and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

{{anchor|Xanthochroi}}

The biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] agreed with him, coining the term ''Xanthochroi'' to refer to fair-skinned Europeans, as opposed to darker Mediterranean peoples, whom Huxley called ''[[Mediterranean race|Melanochroi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Huxley| first = Thomas| title = The Aryan Question |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Huxley| first = Thomas| title = On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind| url=http://cs.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Huxley who also concluded that the Melanochroi (Peoples of the Mediterranean race), who he described as "dark whites", are of a mixture of the Xanthochroi and [[Australoid race|Australioids]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Thomas. On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006. [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html aleph0.clarku.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction was repeated by [[Charles Morris (American writer)|Charles Morris]] in his book ''The Aryan Race'' (1888), which argued that the original Aryans could be identified by their blond hair and other Nordic features, such as [[cephalic index|dolichocephaly]] (long skull). The argument was given extra impetus by the French anthropologist [[Vacher de Lapouge]] in his book ''L’Aryen'', in which he argued that the "dolichocephalic-blond" peoples were natural leaders, destined to rule over more brachycephalic (short-skulled) peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)| first =Georges | title = ''Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question''| journal = The American Journal of Sociology| volume = 5| issue = 3|pages = 329–346| year = 1899| doi =10.1086/210895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] also referred in his writings to "blond beasts": amoral adventurers who were supposed to be the progenitors of creative cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Detwiler|first=Bruce |title=Nietzsche and the Politics of Aristocratic Radicalism|year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-226-14354-5|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' (1887), he wrote, "In Latin malus ... could indicate the vulgar man as the dark one, especially as the black-haired one, as the pre-Aryan dweller of the Italian soil which distinguished itself most clearly through his colour from the blonds who became their masters, namely the Aryan conquering race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Nietzsche| first =Friedrich| title = On the Genealogy of Morals| year = 1887| url = http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/genealogy1.htm| doi =| accessdate = 2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining characteristics==

It was the Russian-born French anthropologist [[Joseph Deniker]] that initially proposed "nordique" (meaning simply "northern") as an "ethnic group" (a term that he coined).
He defined ''nordique'' by a set of physical characteristics: The concurrence of somewhat wavy hair, light eyes, reddish skin, tall stature and a [[dolichocephalic]] skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpa.nordish.net/bilder/viii6d.JPG|title=Deniker, J., The Races of Man|website=nordish.net|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080501233430/http://www.snpa.nordish.net/bilder/viii6d.JPG|archivedate=1 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of six 'Caucasian' groups Deniker accommodated four into secondary ethnic groups, all of which he considered intermediate to the Nordic: ''Northwestern'', ''Sub-Nordic'', ''Vistula'' and ''Sub-Adriatic'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Deniker, J. - Les Races de l'Europe (1899);The Races of Man (London: Walter Scott Ltd., 1900);Les Races et les Peuples de la Terre (Masson et Cie, Paris, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deniker (J.)

''Bulletins de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris''. Volume 12 Numéro 12. 1889. pp. 320-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

American economist [[William Z. Ripley]] purported to define a "Teutonic race" in his book ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;[[William Z. Ripley]], in ''The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1899)&lt;/ref&gt; He divided [[European ethnic groups|European]]s into three main subcategories: Teutonic (''teutonisch''), [[Alpine race|Alpine]] and [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]. According to Ripley the "Teutonic race" resided in Scandinavia, Northern France, northern Germany, [[Baltic states|Baltic]] states and [[East Prussia]], northern Poland, northern Russia, Britain, [[Ireland]], parts of Central and Eastern Europe and was typified by light hair, light skin, blue eyes, tall stature, a narrow nose, and slender body type. [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] had called this race "Homo Europaeus".

[[Madison Grant]], in his book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', took up Ripley's classification. He described a "Nordic" or "Baltic" type: &lt;blockquote&gt;"long skulled, very tall, fair skinned, with blond, brown or red hair and light coloured eyes. The Nordics inhabit the countries around the North and Baltic Seas and include not only the great Scandinavian and Teutonic groups, but also other early peoples who first appear in southern Europe and in Asia as representatives of Aryan language and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Madison Grant, "''The Passing of the Great Race''", Scribner's Sons, 1921, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o1sAuLlvQLwC&amp;pg=PA188 p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Grant, the "Alpine race", shorter in stature, darker in colouring, with a rounder head, predominated in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] through to Turkey and the Eurasian [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]] and Southern Russia. The "Mediterranean race", with dark hair and eyes, [[aquiline nose]], [[olive skin|swarthy]] [[complexion]], moderate-to-short stature, and moderate or long skull was said to be prevalent in [[Southern Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925|author=John Higham|year=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3123-6|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Sociology of Class|author=Bryan S Turner|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-16723-9|page=241|authorlink=Bryan S.

==20th century==

By 1902 the German archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]] identified the original Aryans ([[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]) with the north German [[Corded Ware culture]], an argument that gained in currency over the following two decades. He placed the [[Indo-European Urheimat]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], arguing that they had expanded across Europe from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arvidsson|first=Stefan |title=Aryan Idols |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=USA |isbn=978-0-226-02860-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century this [[North European hypothesis|theory]] was well established, though far from universally accepted{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Sociologists were soon using the concept of a "blond race" to model the migrations of the supposedly more entrepreneurial and innovative components of European populations. As late as 1939 [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]] wrote that "The Poles who came to the United States during the 19th century, and the early decades of the 20th, did not represent a cross-section of the Polish population, but a taller, blonder, longer-headed group than the Poles as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coon|first=Carleton |title=''The Races of Europe'', chapter 1, ''Theory and Principles of the Concept Race''|year=1939 |publisher=Macmillan|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''"high brow"''/''"low brow"'' distinction, derived from such theories, also became enshrined in language.

It was the already mentioned work of sociologist/economist [[William Z. Ripley]] which popularized the idea of three biological European races. Ripley borrowed Deniker's terminology of Nordic (he had previously used the term "[[Teuton]]"); his division of the European races relied on a variety of [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] measurements, but focused especially on their cephalic index and [[stature]].

Compared to Deniker, Ripley advocated a simplified racial view and proposed a single ''Teutonic'' race linked to geographic areas where Nordic-like characteristics predominate, and contrasted these areas to the boundaries of two other types, ''Alpine'' and ''Mediterranean'', thus reducing the 'caucasoid branch of humanity' to three distinct groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =J.G.| title = review of ''The Races of Europe'' by William Z. Ripley| journal = The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| volume = 29| issue =  1/2 | pages =188–189| year = 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, Ripley's tripartite Nordic/Alpine/Mediterranean model was well established. Most 19th century race-theorists like [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Otto Ammon]], [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] preferred to speak of "Aryans," "Teutons," and "Indo-Europeans" instead of "Nordic Race". The British German racialist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] considered the Nordic race to be made up of [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]], as well as some [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. Chamberlain called those people ''Celt-Germanic peoples'', and his ideas would influence [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi]] ideology.

Only in the 1920s did a strong partiality for "Nordic" begin to reveal itself, and for a while the term was used almost interchangeably with Aryan.&lt;ref name=GGField&gt;{{cite journal

For example, the later Nazi minister for Food, [[Richard Walther Darré]], who had developed a concept of the German peasantry as Nordic race, used the term 'Aryan' to refer to the tribes of the Iranian plains.&lt;ref name=Bramwell/&gt;

The notion of a distinct northern European race was also rejected by several anthropologists on [[craniometry|craniometric]] grounds. [[Rudolf Virchow]] attacked the claim following a study of craniometry, which gave surprising results according to contemporary [[scientific racism|scientific racist]] theories on the "Aryan race." During the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]], Virchow denounced the "Nordic mysticism," while Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated that the people of Europe, be they German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a "mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology" led to "struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race".&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870–1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121218231754/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2012-12-18 }}, ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gunther 1922===
[[File:Rassenkarte von Europa.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Hans F. K. Günther]]'s map, from 1922, with the Nordic race shown in bright red; light brown indicates the [[Dinaric race]]; light blue indicates the [[Mediterranean race]]; yellow, the [[Mongols|Mongolian race]].]]
In ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (Racial Science of the German People), published 1922, [[Hans F. K. Günther]] identified five principal European races instead of three, adding the East Baltic race (related to the Alpine race) and Dinaric race (related to the Nordic race) to Ripley's categories. This work was influential in [[Ewald Banse]]'s publication of ''Die Rassenkarte von Europa'' in 1925 which combined research by [[Joseph Deniker]], [[William Z. Ripley]], [[Madison Grant]], Otto Hauser, [[Hans F. K. Günther]], [[Eugen Fischer]] and Gustav Kraitschek.

In '''The Racial Elements of European History''' Gunther further identified a race he named ''Hither Asiatic'' in Southern Spain and Morocco which he believed was carried into Europe through the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasions. He identified an ''Inner Asiatic'' race residing in Northern Scandinavia and Northern Russia. He also identified the ''Oriental'' race residing and originating from Arabia, as well as the ''Near Asiatic'' race originating from Persia.

Gunther concluded that Germany was one of the most racially diverse nations of Europe and that all racial groups, in varying distributions, could be found in any European nation. Gunther argued Jews are a nationality and not a race, comprising several racial groups including Nordics, but predominantly Hither Asiatic and Oriental.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, Hans F. K., ''The Racial Elements of European History'', translated by G. C. Wheeler, Methuen &amp; Co. LTD, London, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coon (1939)===
[[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]] in his book of 1939 ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'' subdivided the Nordic race into three main types, "[[Corded]]", "Danubian" and "Keltic", besides
a "Neo-Danubian" type&lt;ref&gt;"de-Corded Nordic (and hence Danubian) prototype brachycephalized by Ladogan admixture." [http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-31.htm Plate 31: Neo-Danubians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514211003/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-31.htm |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of
Nordic types altered by Upper Palaeolithic or Alpine admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-32.htm|title=Plate 32: Nordics Altered by Northwestern European Upper Palaeolithic Mixture: I|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901075651/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-32.htm|archivedate=1 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-33.htm|title=Plate 33: Nordics Altered by Northwestern European Upper Palaeolithic Mixture: II|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901075656/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-33.htm|archivedate=1 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-34.htm|title=Plate 34: Nordics Altered by Mixture with Southwestern Borreby and Alpine Elements|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901075701/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-34.htm|archivedate=1 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Exotic Nordics" are morphologically Nordic types that occur in places distant from the northwestern European center of Nordic concentration.&lt;ref&gt;examples from eastern Russia, Albania, Portugal and North Africa; [http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-30.htm Plate 30: Exotic Nordics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514210958/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-30.htm |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coon takes the Nordics to be a partially depigmented branch of the greater [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] racial stock. He suggests that the Nordic type emerged as a result of a mixture of "the Danubian Mediterranean strain with the later Corded element". Hence his two main Nordic types show Corded and Danubian predominance, respectively .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-27.htm|title=Plate 27: The Nordic Race: Examples of Corded Predominance|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414194158/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-27.htm|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The third "Keltic" or "[[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]]" type Coon takes to have emerged in the European Iron Age, in Central Europe, where it was subsequently mostly replaced, but "found a refuge in Sweden and in the eastern valleys of southern Norway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-29.htm|title=The Nordic Race: Hallstatt and Keltic Iron Age Types|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901075646/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/p-29.htm|archivedate=1 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coon further recognizes the following terminology of earlier authors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/a-02.htm|title=Coon (1939), "Appendix II.: Glossary"|website=altervista.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001080000/http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/a-02.htm|archivedate=1 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fenno-Nordic, "a hypothetical eastern branch of the Nordic race"
*[[Dinaric race#.22Noric.22 subtype|Noric]], "a blond, Dinaricized Nordic"
*Osterdal type, "the classic Iron Age Nordic, as found today in the eastern valleys of Norway"
*Sub-Nordic, "a racial group which would fall partly in the East Baltic and partly in the Neo-Danubian categories"
*Trønderlagen type or Trønder type, "a variety of Nordic with an excessive Corded element and Upper Palaeolithic mixture"
*Anglo-Saxon type, "a sub-type of Nordic which contains unreduced Upper Palaeolithic mixture"

===Depigmentation theory===
Coon's (1939) theory that the Nordic race was a depigmentated variation of the greater [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] racial stock was also supported by his mentor [[Earnest Albert Hooton]] who in the same year published ''Twilight of Man'', which notes: "The Nordic race is certainly a depigmented offshoot from the basic long-headed Mediterranean stock. It deserves separate racial classification only because its blond hair (ash or golden), its pure blue or grey eyes".&lt;ref&gt;''Twilight of Man'', [[Earnest Albert Hooton]], G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1939 p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melville Jacobs 1963. P. 57"&gt;Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1963. P. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1990s study by Ulrich Mueller found that depigmentation of Nordic peoples around the Baltic Sea likely occurred due to [[vitamin D]] deficiency amongst peoples living there 10,000-30,000 years ago who had a lack of access to vitamin D foods such as dairy products at the time. Depigmentation allowed greater amount of [[ultraviolet]] B light to be absorbed through the skin to synthesize to produce vitamin D.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hegselmann, Ulrich Mueller, Klaus G. Troitzsch.

==Nordicism==
{{Further|Master race|Racial supremacy}}
{{Distinguish|Scandinavianism}}
By the early twentieth century the concept of a "masterly" Nordic race had become familiar enough that the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[psychology|psychologist]] [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], writing in 1920, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among all the disputes and uncertainties of the ethnographers about the races of Europe, one fact stands out clearly—namely, that we can distinguish a race of northerly distribution and origin, characterised physically by fair colour of hair and skin and eyes, by tall stature and dolichocephaly (i.e. long shape of head), and mentally by great independence of character, individual initiative and tenacity of will. Many names have been used to denote this type, ... . It is also called the Nordic type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McDougall|first=William |title= The Group Mind|year=1973 |publisher= Arno Press|location=USA|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nordicists claimed that Nordics had formed upper tiers of ancient civilisations, even in the Mediterranean civilisations of antiquity, which had declined once this dominant race had been assimilated. Thus they argued that ancient evidence suggested that leading Romans like [[Nero]], [[Sulla]] and [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] were blond or red-haired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Suetonius, Life of Nero | date =May 2008 | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html| accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Pluatarch, Life of Sulla | date =May 2008 | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html| accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Pluatarch, Life of Cato | date =May 2008 | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html| accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All these are roads taken by Nordic tribes: by the Phrygians to Troy and Asia Minor; by the Nordic Hellenes to Greece; by the Nordic Italics (Romans) to Italy; by the Nordic Kelts to France and Spain.

Some Nordicists admitted the Mediterranean race was superior to the Nordic in terms of artistic ability{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. However, the Nordic race was regarded as superior on the basis that, although Mediterranean peoples were culturally sophisticated, it was the Nordics who were alleged to be the innovators and conquerors, having an adventurous spirit that no other race could match{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

The Alpine race was usually regarded as inferior to both the Nordic and Mediterranean races, making up the traditional peasant class of Europe while Nordics occupied the aristocracy and led the world in technology, and Mediterraneans were regarded as more imaginative.&lt;ref&gt;According to Madision Grant, "The Nordics are, all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors, adventurers and explorers, but above all, of rulers, organisers and aristocrats in sharp contrast to the essentially peasant character of the Alpines&amp;nbsp;... The mental characteristics of the Mediterranean race are well known, and this race, while inferior in bodily stamina to both the Nordic and the Alpine, is probably the superior of both, certainly of the Alpines, in intellectual attainments." Grant accepts that Mediterraneans created Semitic and Egyptian cultures, but insisted that Greece was "invigorated" by Nordics, and that "Roman ideals of family life, loyalty, and truth, point clearly to a Nordic rather than to a Mediterranean origin" .{{cite web| last = Grant| first = Madison| title = The Passing of the Great Race| year = 1916| url = http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/pgr/pgr-2.-11.html| page = part 2, ch. 11; part 2, chapter 5| accessdate = 2007-07-18| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608061044/http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/pgr/pgr-2.-11.html| archivedate = 2007-06-08| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of Nordicism rejected these arguments. The anti-Nordicist writer [[Giuseppe Sergi]] argued in his influential book ''The Mediterranean Race'' (1901) that there was no evidence that the upper tiers of ancient societies were Nordic, insisting that historical and anthropological evidence contradicted such claims. Sergi argued that Mediterraneans constituted "the greatest race in the world", with a creative edge absent in the Nordic race. According to him, they were the creators of all the major ancient civilisations, from [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Roman Empire|Rome]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

This argument was later repeated by C. G. Seligman, who wrote that "it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievement to its credit than any other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Seligman| first = C.G.|title=Presidential Address.

It is my personal reaction to the living Greeks that their continuity with their ancestors of the ancient world is remarkable, rather than the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==={{anchor|Nordicism in the USA}}In the United States===
[[File:CalvinCoolidgeimmigration3.jpg|thumb|President [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] signs the 1924 immigration act, restricting non-Northern European immigration. [[John J. Pershing]] is on the President's right.]]

In the United States, the primary spokesman for Nordicism was the [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]]. His 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race|The Passing of the Great Race, or the Racial Basis of European History]]'' about Nordicism was highly influential among racial thinking and government policy making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guterl|first=Matthew Pratt| authorlink=Matthew Pratt Guterl |title=''The Color of Race in America, 1900–1940|year=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|isbn=978-0-674-01012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant used the theory as justification for immigration policies of the 1920s, arguing that the immigrants from certain areas of Europe, such as Italians and other Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans, represented a lesser type of European and their numbers in the United States should not be increased. Grant and others urged this as well as the complete restriction of non-Europeans, such as the Chinese and Japanese.

Grant argued the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and admixture was "race suicide" and unless eugenic policies were enacted, the Nordic race would be supplanted by inferior races. Future president [[Calvin Coolidge]] agreed, stating "Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully. With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Coolidge| first =Calvin | title = Whose Country is This?| journal = Good Housekeeping| volume =| page = 14| year = 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] was signed into law by President Coolidge. This was designed to reduce the number of immigrants from Southern Europe, Southeast Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, exclude Asian immigrants altogether, and favor immigration from the [[British Isles]], [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], while also permitting immigration from [[Latin America]].

The spread of these ideas also affected popular culture. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] invokes Grant's ideas through a character in part of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', and [[Hilaire Belloc]] jokingly rhapsodied the "Nordic man" in a poem and essay in which he satirised the stereotypes of Nordics, Alpines and Mediterraneans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Belloc| first =Hilaire| title = Talking (and singing) of the Nordic Man| url =http://rcatholic-l.freeservers.com/nordic.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordicist thought in Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0912-500, Prof. Hans Günther.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hans F. K. Günther]] (1891–1968), prominent [[Germany|German]] racial theorist who helped to popularise Nordicism in his country.]]

In Germany the influence of Nordicism remained powerful. There it was known under the term "Nordischer Gedanke" (''Nordic thought'').

This phrase was coined by the German eugenicists [[Erwin Baur]], [[Eugen Fischer]] and [[Fritz Lenz]]. It appeared in their 1921 work ''Human Heredity'', which insisted on the innate superiority of the Nordic race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baur|first=E. |author2=Fischer, E |author3=Lenz, F. |title=Grundlagen der menschlichen Erblichkeitslehre und Rassenhygiene |year=1921 (1923)|publisher= Lehmann|location=München}}, Volume II, page 273 see: Lutzhöft 1971:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting the arguments of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and others to [[Darwinian]] theory, they argued that the qualities of initiative and will-power identified by earlier writers had arisen from [[natural selection]], because of the tough landscape in which Nordic peoples evolved. This had ensured that weaker individuals had not survived.

This argument was derived from earlier eugenicist and [[social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] ideas. According to the authors, the Nordic race arose in the ice age, from:
{{quote|quite a small group which, under stress of rapidly changing conditions (climate, beasts of the chase) was exposed to exceptionally rigorous selection and was persistently inbred, thus acquiring the peculiar characteristics which persist today as the exclusive heritage of the Nordic race&amp;nbsp;... Philological, archaeological and anthropological researches combine to indicate that the primal home of the Indo-Germanic [i.e. Aryan] languages must have been in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baur|first=E. |author2=Fischer, E |author3=Lenz, F. |title=Grundlagen der menschlichen Erblichkeitslehre und Rassenhygiene |year=1921 (1923)|publisher= Lehmann|location=München}}, Volume II, page 249. see: Lutzhöft 1971:15&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They went on to argue that "the original Indo-Germanic civilisation" was carried by Nordic migrants down to India, and that the physiognomy of upper caste Indians "disclose a Nordic origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baur|first1=Erwin |author1-link= Erwin Baur|last2=Fischer|first2=Eugen|authorlink2=Eugen Fischer|last3=Lenz|first3=Fritz|authorlink3=Fritz Lenz| others=trans [[Eden Paul|Eden]] and [[Cedar Paul]]|title=Human Heredity |year=1931|publisher=Allen and Unwin |location=London, page 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, M.

By this time, Germany was well-accustomed to theories of race and racial superiority due to the long presence of the [[Völkisch movement]], the philosophy that Germans constituted a unique people, or volk, linked by common blood. While Volkism was popular mainly among Germany's lower classes and was more a romanticised version of ethnic nationalism, Nordicism attracted German anthropologists and eugenicists.

[[Hans F. K. Günther]], one of Fischer's students, first defined "Nordic thought" in his programmatic book ''Der Nordische Gedanke unter den Deutschen''.&lt;ref&gt;Lutzhöft 1971:15&lt;/ref&gt; He became the most influential German in this field. His ''Short Ethnology of the German People'' (1929) was very widely circulated.

In his ''Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes'' (''Race-Lore of the German Volk''), published 1922, Günther identified five principal European races instead of three, adding the [[East Baltic race]] and [[Dinaric race]] to Ripley's categories.&lt;ref name=GGField/&gt; He used the term Ostic instead of Alpine.&lt;ref name=GGField/&gt; He focused on their supposedly distinct mental attributes.

Günther criticised the Völkish idea, stating that the Germans were not racially unified, but were actually one of the most racially diverse peoples in Europe. Despite this, many Völkists who merged Völkism and Nordicism embraced Günther's ideas, most notably the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder|first= Louis|title=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan |location=New York|isbn=978-1-56924-917-8|page=1799

====Nazi Nordicism====
{{Further|Nazism and race}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S33882, Adolf Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf Hitler]] was a proponent of the concept of the [[Aryan race]] and Aryanism. He viewed the Nordic racial subtype as being at the top of the racial hierarchy within the Aryan race.]]

Adolf Hitler read ''Human Heredity'' shortly before he wrote ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', and called it scientific proof of the racial basis of civilisation.&lt;ref name=MinorValue&gt;{{cite web|author1=Center for Holocaust  |author2=Genocide Studies |lastauthoramp=yes | title= Racism: elimination of human beings of minor value | publisher= University of Minnesota | url =http://chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/racism.html| accessdate = 2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its arguments were also repeated by the Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]], in his book ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1930).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Nazi racial theories held the Atlanteans to be a race of Nordic supermen, and Alfred Rosenberg wrote of a "Nordic-Atlantean" master race whose civilisation was lost through inward corruption and betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mizrach|first1=Steve|title=The Occult and Nazism Redefined|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/occult-reich.html|publisher=''Florida International University''|accessdate=16 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202085606/http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/occult-reich.html|archivedate=2 December 2001|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosenberg, the Nordic race had evolved in a now-lost landmass off the coast of Europe, perhaps mythical [[Atlantis]], migrated through northern Europe and expanded further south to Iran and India where it founded the Aryan cultures of [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Like Grant and others, he argued that the entrepreneurial energy of the Nordics had "degenerated" when they mixed with "inferior" peoples.

With the rise of Hitler, Nordic theory became the norm within German culture. In some cases the "Nordic" concept became an almost abstract ideal rather than a mere racial category. For example, [[Hermann Gauch]] wrote in 1933 (in a book which was banned in the Third Reich)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v-weiss.de/roland.html|title=Der genealogische Verein "Roland" in Dresden im Dritten Reich|first=Volkmar|last=Weiss|website=www.v-weiss.de|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the fact that "birds can be taught to talk better than other animals is explained by the fact that their mouths are Nordic in structure." He further claimed that in humans, "the shape of the Nordic gum allows a superior movement of the tongue, which is the reason why Nordic talking and singing are richer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauch|first=Hans |title=New Foundations of Racial Science |year=1934|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich|location=USA|isbn=978-1-56924-917-8|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such views were extreme, but more mainstream Nordic theory was institutionalised. [[Hans F. K. Günther]], who joined the Nazi Party in 1932, was praised as a pioneer in racial thinking, a shining light of Nordic theory. Most official Nazi comments on the Nordic Race were based on Günther's works, and Alfred Rosenberg presented Günther with a medal for his work in anthropology.

[[Eugen Fischer]] and [[Fritz Lenz]] were also appointed to senior positions overseeing the policy of [[Racial Hygiene]]. Madison Grant's book was the first non-German book to be translated and published by the Nazi Reich press, and Grant proudly displayed to his friends a letter from Hitler claiming that the book was "his Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Marks| first = Jonathan| title = Eugenics -- Breeding a Better Citizenry Through Science| publisher = University of North Carolina at Charlotte| url = http://personal.uncc.edu/jmarks/eugenics/eugenics.html| accessdate = 2007-07-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703212044/http://personal.uncc.edu/jmarks/eugenics/eugenics.html| archivedate = 2007-07-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Alexander| first =Charles| title = Prophet of American Racism: Madison Grant and the Nordic Myth| journal = Phylon | volume =  23| issue =  1 | pages = 73–90| year = 1962| doi =10.2307/274146| jstor =274146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in the [[Holocaust]]. Ironically, in Grant's first edition of his popular book, he classified the Germans as being primarily Nordic, but in his second edition, published after the USA had entered World War I, he had re-classified the now enemy power as being dominated by "inferior" Alpines.

Günther's work agreed with Grant's, and the German anthropologist frequently stated that the Germans are not a fully Nordic people.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The standard tripartite model placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the [[Anschluss]].

J. Kaup led a movement opposed to Günther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a "German race" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than Günther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong.

Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and "racial" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the "Oriental-Armenoid" race, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.&lt;ref&gt;The Racial Analysis of Human Populations in Relation to Their Ethnogenesis Andrzej Wiercinski; Tadeusz Bielicki, Current Anthropology, Vol. 3, No. 1. (February 1962), pp. 2+9-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905–1979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British Army from 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Kurt Caro | publisher =[[German Federal Archives]] | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0001/adr/adrag/kap1_3/para2_16.html | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert claiming to unmask Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23,8% Lapponid race, 21,5% Nordic race,
20,3% Armenoid race, 18,4% Mediterranean race, 16,0% Oriental race.&lt;ref&gt;''Hitlers "Mein Kampf". Dichtung und Wahrheit'' by Manuel Humbert (Kurt Michael Caro) Paris 1936. page 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939 Hitler had abandoned Nordicist rhetoric in favour of the idea that the German people as a whole were united by distinct "spiritual" qualities. Nevertheless, Nazi eugenics policies continued to favour Nordics over Alpines and other racial groups, particularly during the war when decisions were being made about the incorporation of conquered peoples into the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Lebensborn]] program sought to extend the Nordic race. {{cite web|last=Gumkowski |first=Janusz |authorlink= |author2=Kazimierz Leszczynski |title=Poland under Nazi Occupation |publisher= |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Crossland | first =David| title = Nazi Program to breed Master race, Lebensborn Children Break Silence | work =Der Spiegel| publisher =| url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,446978,00.html| accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Opening Statement of the Prosecution in the Einsatzgruppen Trial| work =Nuremberg Trial Documents| publisher =| url =http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/einsatzopenpros.html| accessdate =2007-07-20| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070417023514/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/einsatzopenpros.html| archivedate =2007-04-17| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Hitler stated in private, &lt;blockquote&gt;I shall have no peace of mind until I have planted a seed of Nordic blood wherever the population stand in need of regeneration. If at the [[migration period|time of the migrations]], while the great racial currents were exercising their influence, our people received so varied a share of attributes, these latter blossomed to their full value only because of the presence of the Nordic racial nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Hugh, ''Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-44'', 1973 edition, p. 475 (12 May 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his [[Hitler's Table Talk|"table talk"]], Hitler described how the presence of German and English soldiers in the combat areas he served in during [[World War I]] had, in his view, improved the quality of the young people he saw there in 1940, in a "Nordicizing process, the results of which are today [according to Hitler] incontestable."  He also said he observed the same process at work in the area of his mountain home near [[Berchtesgaden]], which he described as having, when he first came there, a mongrel population, the quality of which was much improved by the presence of his [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|SS Bodyguard Regiment]], which was responsible for "the numbers of strong and healthy children running around the area." Hitler went on to say that "[This] shows that elite troops should really be sent wherever the composition of the people is poor, in order to improve it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Ernst Schramm|Schramm, Percy Ernst]] (1978) "The Anatomy of a Dictator" in ''Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader''.

===Nordicist thought in Italy===

In Italy, the influence of Nordicism had a divisive effect in which the influence resulted in [[Northern Italian]]s who regarded themselves to have Nordic racial heritage considered themselves a civilised people while negatively regarding [[Southern Italy|Southern Italians]] as non-Nordic and therefore biologically inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Gems. Sport and the Shaping of Italian American Identity. Syracuse University Press, 2013. P57.&lt;/ref&gt; Nordicism was controversial in Italy because of common Nordicist perceptions of Mediterranean people, and especially southern Italians, being racially degenerate. The distinction between a superior northern Italy and a degenerate and an inferior southern Italy was promoted by the Neapolitan [[Carlo Formichi]], the Vice-President of the Italian Academy, who in 1921 said that Italy needed "a great revolution ..., a return to the genius of the noble Aryan race, which is after all our race, but that has been overcome by the Semitic civilisation and mentality".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Bradshaw, Tom Bishop, Alexander C. Y. Huang, and Jonathan Gil Harris. ''The Shakespearean International Yearbook''. Ashgate Publishing, 2011. Pp. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; At least some of the stereotypes about Southern Italians were created by [[Cesare Lombroso]], an Italian Jewish criminologist and anthropologist of Sephardic descent.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleone Colajanni, Ire e spropositi di Cesare Lombroso, Filippo Tropea editore, Catania, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Chirico, Linkiesta 11 novembre 2012, rif&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gian Antonio Stella, Corriere della Sera, 28 aprile 2009, http://www.corriere.it/cultura/09_aprile_28/stella_lombroso_catalogo_assurdita_8bd638b2-33c2-11de-8558-00144f02aabc.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duccio Canestrini, dicembre 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.ducciocanestrini.it/eventi/conferenze_spettacolo?news_id=20090207095204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103084937/http://www.ducciocanestrini.it/eventi/conferenze_spettacolo?news_id=20090207095204 |archivedate=2017-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

====Fascist Nordicism====

[[File:Mussolini mezzobusto.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benito Mussolini]]. Mussolini was initially a strong proponent of [[Mediterraneanism]]; however with the rise in influence of pro-Nordicist Nazism, Mussolini promoted Aryanism and recognised Italians as having Nordic-Mediterranean heritage.]]

[[Italian Fascism]]'s stance towards Nordicism changed from being initially hostile to being favourable.

Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealised "pure" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as fair skin, blond hair and light eyes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and British Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter skinned peoples had been dipigmented from a darker skin. This theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe:A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]] in his work ''The races of Europe'' (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref name="Melville Jacobs 1963. P. 57"/&gt; Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;

In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany with Hitler's emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic "Germanic race" was absurd, saying "a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; That Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]] and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]] while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 &gt;Anne Maxwell. Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870–1940. Eastbourne, England: UK; Portland, Oregon, USA: SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2008, 2010. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by [[Giulio Cogni]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book ''Il Razzismo'' (1936).&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"/&gt; Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;  Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;

In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognise Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognised Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on [[Mediterraneanism]] was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Mussolini in July 1938 declared that Italians had strong Nordic heritage particularly through the heritage of the Germanic tribe of the [[Lombards]] who conquered Italy after the collapse of the Roman Empire and claimed that the intermixing of Mediterranean Romans with the Nordic Lombards was the last significant racial mixing that occurred in Italy and that none had occurred since.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert. ''Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce''. Palgrave MacMillan, 2008. P. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Nazi re-evaluation and decline of Nordicism==
Even before the rise of Nazism, Grant's concept of "race" lost favour in the USA in the polarising political climate after [[World War I]], including the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, criticism of the Nordicist model was growing in Britain and America. The British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in ''A Study of History'' (1934) argued that the most dynamic civilisations have arisen from racially mixed cultures. In southern Europe the theory understandably had less influence.

This required the abandonment of Grant's gradations of "white" in favour of the "[[One-drop theory]]"—which was embraced by white supremacists and black leaders alike. Among the latter were [[Marcus Garvey]], and, in part, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], at least in his later thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =W.E.B. Dubois | publisher =Encarta | url =http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563380/W_E_B_Du_Bois.html | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20040628183828/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563380/W_E_B_Du_Bois.html | dead-url =yes | archive-date =2004-06-28 | accessdate =2007-07-19 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017}}

With the rise of Nazism many critics pointed to the flaws in the theory, repeating the arguments made by Sergi and others that the evidence of ancient Nordic achievement is thin when set against the civilizations of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The equation of Nordic and Aryan identity was also widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Anthropologists on Aryanism | work =Time Magazine| publisher = | date = August 13, 1934| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747665,00.html| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 [[M. W. Fodor]], writing in ''The Nation'', claimed that [[racialized]] Germanic nationalism arose from an [[inferiority complex]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No race has suffered so much from an [[inferiority complex]] as has the [[Germany|German]]. [[National Socialism]] was a kind of [[Émile Coué|Coué method]] of converting the inferiority complex, at least temporarily, into a feeling of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fodor | first = M.W. | title = The Spread of Hitlerism | work = The Nation | publisher =  | year = 1936 | url = http://newdeal.feri.org/nation/na3656.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715071640/http://newdeal.feri.org/nation/na3656.htm | archivedate = 2007-07-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[Lombardy|Lombard]] nationalists took it up in Italy, but even after the establishment of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascist government racial theories were not prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gilette| first =Aaron| title = Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|year = 2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=81–3 |isbn=978-0-415-25292-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini stated, "Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Snowdon| first =Frank M | title = Race Propaganda in Italy| journal = Phylon | volume = 1| issue =  2| pages = 103–111| year = 1940| doi=10.2307/272514| jstor =272514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the categorisation of peoples into "superior" and "inferior" groups fell even further out of political and scientific favour, eventually leading to the characterisation of such theories as [[scientific racism]]. The tripartite subdivision of "Caucasians" into Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean groups persisted among some scientists into the 1960s, notably in Carleton Coon's book ''The Origin of Races'' (1962).

Already race academics such as [[A. James Gregor]] were heavily criticising Nordicism. In 1961 Gregor called it a "philosophy of despair", on the grounds that its obsession with purity doomed it to ultimate [[pessimism]] and [[isolationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gregor | first = A James | title =Nordicism revisited| work =Phylon| publisher = | year = 1961| url =http://dienekes.angeltowns.net/texts/nordicism_revisited.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1977 the Swedish author [[Bertil Lundman]] wrote a book ''The Races and Peoples of Europe'' mentioning a "Nordid Race". The development of the [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan theory]] of Indo-European origins challenged the Nordicist equation of Aryan and Nordic identity, since it placed the earliest Indo-European speakers around central Asia and/or far-eastern Europe (although according to the Kurgan hypothesis some [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] ''did'' eventually migrate into Central and Northern Europe and become the ancestors of the Nordic peoples.)

The original German term used by Ripley, "''[[Theodiscus]]''", which is translated into English as ''Teutonic'', has fallen out of favour amongst German-speaking scholars, and is restricted to a somewhat ironical usage similar to the archaic ''teutsch'', if used at all. While the term is still present in English, which has retained it in some contexts as a translation of the traditional Latin ''Teutonicus'' (most notably the aforementioned [[Teutonic Order]]), it should not be translated into German as "''Teutonisch''" except when referring to the historical [[Teutones]].

===Early criticism: depigmentation theory===
Nordicism was subject to substantial criticism. [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Steven Coon]] in his work ''The Races of Europe'' (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the [[Mediterranean race]].&lt;ref name="Melville Jacobs 1963. P. 57"/&gt;
The depigmentation theory received notable support from later anthropologists, thus in 1947 [[Melville Jacobs]] noted: "To many physical anthropologists Nordic means a group with an especially high percentage of blondness, which represent a depigmentated Mediterranean".&lt;ref&gt;Outline of Physical Anthropology'', 1947, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work ''Races of Man'' (1963, 2nd Ed. 1965) [[Sonia Mary Cole]] went further to argue that the Nordic race belongs to the "brunette Mediterranean" [[Caucasoid]] division but that it differs only in its higher percentage of blonde hair and light eyes. The Harvard anthropologist [[Claude Alvin Villee, Jr.]] also was a notable proponent of this theory, writing: "The Nordic division, a partially depigmised branch of the Mediterranean group."&lt;ref&gt;''Biology'', 1972, Saunders, p. 786.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' as late as 1984 contains an entry for this theory, citing anthropological support.&lt;ref&gt;''Collier's Encyclopedia'', Vol. 9, William Darrach Halsey, Emanuel Friedman, Macmillan Educational Co., 1984, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Early 21st century genetic studies have provided new insights into the origins of Irish people as well as their neighbours from other parts of the [[British Isles]]. Correspondingly, researchers in the field have suggested that migrations from [[prehistoric Iberia]] can be viewed as the primary source for their genetic material, having demonstrated marked similarities with modern representatives of the aforementioned time period in that of the [[Basque people]]. However, the majority of Irish males fall under the [[R1b#R1b1a2a1a1b4 .28R-L21.29|R1b]] sub-clade L-21, which is quite rare for Basques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A1FF83F550C758CDDAA0894DF404482 Nicholas Wade, "A United Kingdom? Maybe"], ''New York Times'', 6 March 2007, accessed 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070306-21245600-bc-britain-brits.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181453/https://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070306-21245600-bc-britain-brits.xml |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }} ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lundman (1977)===
In his work ''The Races and Peoples of Europe'' (1977) the Swedish anthropologist [[Bertil Lundman]] introduced the term "Nordid" to describe the Nordic race, described as follows:

{{quote|"The Nordid race is light-eyed, mostly rather light-haired, low-skulled and long-skulled (dolichocephalic), tall and slender, with more or less narrow face and narrow nose, and low frequency of blood type gene q. The Nordid race has several subraces. The most divergent is the Faelish subrace in western Germany and also in the interior of southwestern Norway. The Faelish subrace is broader of face and form. So is the North-Atlantid subrace (the North-Occidental race of Deniker), which is like the primary type, but has much darker hair. Above all in the oceanic parts of Great Britain the North-Atlantic subrace is also very high in blood type gene r and low in blood type gene p. The major type with distribution particularly in Scandinavia is here termed the Scandid or Scando-Nordid subrace."}}

===Forensic anthropology===
Some forensic scientists, pathologists and anthropologists up to the 1990s continued to use the tripartite division of [[Caucasoids]]: Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean, based on their cranial [[anthropometry]]. The anthropologist [[Wilton M. Krogman]] for example identified Nordic racial crania in his work "The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine" (1986) as being "dolichochranic".&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine", Wilton Marion Krogman, M. Yaşar İşcan, C.C. Thomas, 1986, p. 270, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work "Forensic Pathology", published in 1991, [[Bernard Knight]], a Professor of Forensic Pathology, also uses the tripartite model and identifies the Nordic race based on its dolichocephalic skull shape.&lt;ref&gt;"Forensic Pathology", Bernard Knight, Oxford University Press, 30 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic anthropologists of the 21st century however no longer continue to use the tripartite division of [[Caucasoids]], but instead only recognise [[Caucasoid]], [[Negroid]] and [[Mongoloid]] through analysis of skeletal remains and not subraces of these racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Racial Identification in the Skull and Teeth |journal=Totem: The University of Western Ontario, Journal of Anthropology |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=2000 |at=Article 4 |url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/totem/vol8/iss1/4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
[[File:Haplogroups europe.png|thumb|310px|Y-haplogroups in Europe]]

In the 21st century there is a prevailing view amongst many anthropologists and biologists that completely "pure" races do not and have not existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01076.x| title = Current Views of European Anthropologists on Race: Influence of Educational and Ideological Background| journal = American Anthropologist| volume = 111  | issue = 1| pages = 43–56| year = 2009| last1 = Kaszycka | first1 = K. A.| last2 = Štrkalj | first2 = G.| last3 = Strzałko | first3 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 edition of ''[[The World Factbook]]'', produced by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the United States, describes Spain's population as a "composite of Mediterranean and Nordic types".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html|author=[[CIA]]|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population genetics===

The emergence of [[population genetics]] further undermined the categorisation of Europeans into clearly defined origin groups. A 2007 study on the [[genetic history of Europe]] found that the most important genetic differentiation in Europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east (northern Europe to the Balkans), with another east-west axis of differentiation across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dupanloup | first =Isabelle | authorlink = |author2=Giorgio Bertorelle |author3=Lounès Chikhi |author4=Guido Barbujani| title =Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans | publisher = | url =http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1361#T03/| accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =World Haplogroups Map| publisher = | url =http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf 3| accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Johnston | first =Ian | title = We're nearly all Celts under the skin | work =The Scotsman| publisher = | date =21 September 2006 | url =http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1393742006| accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Finns]] seem to mark an exception in European genetic groups, as they seem not to share strong genetic relationship ties with other European countries, but instead appear to be genetically a rather isolated group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Genetic Map of Europe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/science/13visual.html?_r=2&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the [[Y-chromosome]] there are three large [[haplogroup]]s which account for most of Europe's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]].&lt;ref name="DNA Heritage"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Semino O, Passarino G, Oefner PJ |title=The genetic legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in extant Europeans: a Y chromosome perspective |journal=Science |volume=290 |issue=5494 |pages=1155–9 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11073453 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11073453 |doi=10.1126/science.290.5494.1155|bibcode = 2000Sci...290.1155S |display-authors=etal}} Note: Haplogroup names are different in this article. For example: [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup I]] is referred as M170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advent of new media ==
{{essay-like|section|date=April 2017}}
The advent of New Communication Technology (NCT) has brought forth a set of opportunities and challenges for conventional media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, B., 1996. Successful Strategies for Computer-Assisted Reporting. Mahwah, NJ, USA: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of new media and the Internet in particular, has posed a challenge to conventional media,especially the printed newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Domingo, D. &amp; A. Heinone. 2008. “Weblogs and Journalism: A Typology to Explore the Blurring Boundaries.” Nordicom Review, 29 (1): 3-15. )&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts{{which|date=April 2017}} in industrial organizations and businesses are of the view that the U.S. newspaper industry is suffering through what could be its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Barthelemy, S., M. Bethell, T. Christiansen, A. Jarsvall &amp; K. Koinis. 2011. “www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/workshops/documents/WorldNewuigsmediaInnovationsStudy-CapstoneWorkshopSpring2011-ABRIDGED.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising revenues are tumbling due to the severe economic downturn, while readership habits are changing as consumers turn to the Internet for free news and information.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some major newspaper chains{{which|date=April 2017}} are burdened by heavy debts. As in the past, major newspapers have declared bankruptcy as several big city papers shut down,lay off reporters and editors, impose pay reductions, cut the size of the physical newspaper, or turn to Web-only publication (Kirchhoff, 2009). The new media have also affected the way newspapers get and circulate their news. Since 1999, almost 90% of daily newspapers in the United States have been actively using online technologies to search for articles and most of them also create their own news websites to reach new markets.&lt;ref&gt;Domingo, D. &amp; A. Heinone. 2008. “Weblogs and Journalism: A Typology to Explore the Blurring Boundaries.” Nordicom Review, 29 (1): 3-15. )&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges faced ==
{{Weasel|date=April 2017}}
Some observers believe that the challenges faced by conventional media, especially newspapers, has to do with the perfect storm of the global economic crisis, dwindling readership and advertising dollars, and the inability of newspapers to monetize their online efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Yap, B. 2009. “Time running out for newspapers.” The Malaysian Insider. Retrieved
October 31, 2010 from www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/opinion/brianyap/28538-time-running-out-for-newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers, especially in the West and the US in particular, have lost the lion's share of classified advertisement to the Internet. The situation worsened when a depressed economy forced more readers to cancel their newspaper subscriptions, and business firms to cut their advertising budget as part of the overall cost-cutting measurements. As a result, closures of newspapers, bankruptcy, job cuts and salary cuts are widespread.&lt;ref name="mysinchew.com"&gt;Mahmud, S. 2009. “Is the newspaper industry at death's door?” Retrieved October 30, 2009 from: www.mysinchew.com/node/24415?tid=14.Straits Times. 22 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has made some representatives of the US newspaper industry seek some sort of bailout from the government by allowing U.S. newspapers to recoup taxes they paid on  profits earlier this decade to help offset some of their current losses. This is what they put forward to the Joint Committee of Congress (The Star Online, September 2009). Accusations are being hurled at search engines giants by publishers such as Sir David Bell, who categorically accused Google and Yahoo of “stealing” the contents of newspapers. A similar allegation came from media mogul Rupert Murdoch in early April 2009. "Should we be allowing Google to steal all our copyrights?" asked the News Corp.Chief.&lt;ref name="mysinchew.com"/&gt; Likewise, Sam Zell, owner of the Tribune Company that publishes the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and the Baltimore Sun claimed it was the newspapers in America who allowed Google to steal their contents for nothing, but asked without the contents what would Google do, and how profitable would Google be?&lt;ref name="mysinchew.com"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the men's families were allowed to settle in [[Israel]] under the [[Law of Return]], meaning that they all had at least one grandparent with a [[Jews|Jewish mother]], although none of them were Jewish according to the Jewish law.

==Activities==

The group desecrated buildings, especially synagogues, with [[swastika]]s and graffiti, and carried out attacks on migrant workers from Africa and Asia, drug addicts, gays, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and elderly people. Patrol 36's members reportedly had tattoos with the number [[88 (number)|88]] (a reference to the phrase "Heil Hitler") and were stockpiling guns, [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], knives and portraits of Adolf Hitler. The group produced videos of their own attacks, which were found on computers seized by police.&lt;ref name="nazichic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100049486/nazi-chic-from-mongolia-to-tel-aviv-angry-teenagers-think-hitler-is-cool/|title=Nazi chic: from Mongolia to Tel Aviv, angry teenagers think Hitler is cool|accessdate=August 22, 2010|date=August 3, 2010|first=Damian|last=Thompson|publisher=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jailtime"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7744966.stm|accessdate=August 22, 2010|title=Jail terms for Israeli neo-Nazis |date=November 23, 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/global-reach-neo-nazis|title=The global reach of neo-Nazis|accessdate=August 22, 2010|date=August 2, 2010|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|first=Jason|last=Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==

Israeli Police began investigating the group in 2006, after two incidents of Neo-Nazi graffiti in Petah Tikva. On September 9, 2007, seven of the group's members were arrested, while the leader, Erik Bonite, fled the country. Police also seized computers depicting videos of their attacks that they had filmed, Neo-Nazi related materials, such as swastika posters and Neo-Nazi films, along with explosives and an improvised pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3447377,00.html |title=Israeli neo-Nazis arrested - Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Israeli"/&gt; They were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, assault, racial incitement, and distribution of racist materials, and tried in the Tel Aviv District Court.

==Reaction==

Their discovery led to renewed calls amongst politicians to amend the Law of Return.&lt;ref name="Stoil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheetrit may deport alleged neo-Nazis|author=Rebecca Anna Stoil, Mark Weiss and Matthew Wagner|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=9 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-10|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1188392567423}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Effi Eitam]] of the [[National Religious Party]] and the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]], which represent the religious [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and have previously attempted to advance bills to amend the Law of Return, stated that Israel has become "a haven for people who hate Israel, hate Jews, and exploit the Law of Return to act on this hatred."&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior Minister: I'll consider revoking neo-Nazis' citizenship|author=Roni Singer-Heruti|publisher=[[Ha'aretz]]|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-10|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/902093.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Tsvi Gurfinkel, who issued the guilty verdict {{clarify|date=April 2016}}, said that "the fact that they are Jews from the ex-Soviet Union and that they had sympathised with individuals who believed in racist theories is terrible." [[BBC]] reported that the news of the attacks and of the men's arrests in 2007 "shocked the nation" because Israel was founded in the wake of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. One of the members who was arrested and sentenced was the grandson of a [[List of Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]].&lt;ref name="jailtime"/&gt;

A '''planned unit development (PUD)''' is a type of building development and also a regulatory process. As a building development, it is a designed grouping of both varied and compatible [[land use]]s, such as [[house|housing]], [[recreation]], [[commerce|commercial]] centers, and [[industrial park]]s, all within one contained development or [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]].

==History==
The origins of PUDs in the new American communities can be traced to British movements during the 1950s. The developments in Britain's new communities dealt with the locations of [[industry|industrial]] elements and how they were publicly dictated before building ever began in order to uphold an [[economic base]]. However, in America, privately controlled communities often had to attract industry after the residential sectors had been built and occupied.

The oldest forms of the planned unit development in America appeared shortly after World War II in the [[Levittown]]s and [[Park Forest, Illinois|Park Forest]] developments, as whole communities within the limits and orbits of large metropolitan centers. The first zoning evidence of PUD was created by [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] in 1949. It "permit[ed] the development of a large tract of land as a complete neighborhood unit, having a range of dwelling types, the necessary local shopping facilities and off-street parking areas, parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other community facilities" (Burchell 43). Alexandria, Virginia, in 1952, as an amendment to its city code, provided for a "Community Unit Plan", with the intent to provide for planned community facilities and [[Urban open space|open space]] development with new residential building.  One of the first modern uses of the term "planned unit development" appears in San Francisco's code of ordinances in 1962.

==Current definitions==
PUD as a regulatory process is a means of land regulation which promotes large scale, unified land development by means of mid-range, realistic programs in chase of physically curable, social and economic deficiencies in land and cityscapes. Where appropriate, this development control promotes: 
*A mixture of both land uses and dwelling types with at least one of the land uses being regional in nature
*The clustering of residential land uses providing public and common open space
*Increased administrative discretion to a local professional planning staff while setting aside present land use regulations and rigid plat approval processes
*The enhancement of the bargaining process between the developer and government municipalities which in turn strengthens the municipality's site plan review and control over development for potentially increased profits due to land efficiency, multiple land uses, and increased residential densities.

Frequently, PUDs take on a variety of forms ranging from small clusters of houses combined with open spaces to new and developing towns with thousands of residents and various land uses. However, the definition of a PUD does not take into consideration these types of developments unless they fit into a category of size ranging from {{convert|100|to|200|acre}}. In a PUD the property owner owns the land the dwelling sits on.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Mixtures of land uses==
In PUDs, the zoning of districts becomes very different from what was standard under the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act|Standard Zoning Enabling Act]]. Historically, the districts were very narrow in type and large in area. Within PUDs, zoning becomes much more integrated with multiple land uses and districts being placed on adjacent land parcels.

Residential properties in PUDs are by far the most numerous and occupy the largest land areas. PUDs tend to incorporate single-family residential uses in proximity to two-family units and multiple-family dwellings to form a larger diversified neighborhood concept. Schools, churches, retirement homes, hospitals, and recreation facilities begin to find their way into residential districts. Residential districts also tend to use the best land in the community and the most favorable sites are protected from commercial and industrial uses.

Grouping shopping districts by service area is a first step in returning to the neighborhood concept. Land is reserved for regional, community, and local shopping clusters with some specific restrictions based on market experience and on what types of business intend to locate at each development. Local shopping districts with sufficient provisions for off-street parking, height restrictions, and traffic control are not frequently found surrounded by residential areas.

Industrial standards now help to reduce the journey for employees to work. Nowadays, there tends to be environmental and performance regulations that cut back on the amount of nuisance to surrounding areas adjacent to industrial districts. With sufficient setbacks, off-street parking, and height regulations, industrial locations adjacent to residential zones are usually looked to as an overall community goal. PUDs do not normally have large numbers of industrial districts, but if so, they tend to be geared more towards light industry.

A '''planned residential unit development (PRUD)''' (sometimes '''planned unit residential development (PURD))''' is a variant form of PUD where common areas are owned by the individual homeowners and not a [[homeowners association]] or other entity.  A PURD is considered the same as a PUD for planning commission purposes and allows for flexibility in zoning and civic planning.

=== Maintenance of common areas ===
In most PUDs, individual owners have full ownership of their homes and buildings, making them the responsible party for maintenance. Governing documents of homeowners associations within PUDs often delegate most of the maintenance responsibilities to the owners, assuming the least amount of responsibility possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOA Maintenance Responsibility in Condominiums and Planned Unit Developments|url=http://www.echo-ca.org/article/hoa-maintenance-responsibility-condominiums-and-planned-unit-developments |publisher=ECHO|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==

===Houses and placement of houses===
Houses in PUDs often include access to a large shared open space surrounding the house as well as a smaller private yard. These large protected open spaces are created by the layout of the buildings and are intended for use by all residents of the developments. Different housing types ([[Single-family detached home|single-family]], [[two-family]], [[multiple-family]]) are often mixed rather than separated as is done in conventional development

===Streets===
[[Street pattern]]s are one of the most important elements in establishing the neighborhood character of a residential community. Most non-PUD development focuses on obtaining maximum [[frontage]] for lot sizes and maximum flow of traffic on all streets. However, in order to dispel the monotony of the typical [[grid plan]] street pattern, PUDs often employ a [[street hierarchy|hierarchy of street types]] based on usage. Local streets serve only residences and have a low traffic volume, while collector streets connect [[local street]]s to arterials, which are the major routes of travel throughout a PUD.

===Sidewalks and pedestrian ways===
Sidewalks and pedestrian ways of PUDs supplement and complement street systems in establishing the character of the neighborhood. Sidewalks are located on at least one side of every street to enable the [[walkability]] of the developments. Circulation systems are provided to link residential groupings, open space areas, schools, and local shopping areas.

===Combining design features===
It is in the ability to design each of these components simultaneously that makes PUDs unique and effective. Each of the elements work together to enhance the whole. This represents a major advantage over traditional zoning practices that force lots to be planned in accordance with broad rules that may allow for some incompatibility.

{{Rape}}

'''Rape''' is one of the most common crimes in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/08/06/egyptian-woman-unusual-account-tells-tv-alleged-police-rape/ |title=Egyptian woman goes public about alleged police rape in rare TV interview |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marital rape]] is not illegal in the country. By 2008, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] quoted [[Egypt's Interior Ministry]]'s figure that 20,000 rapes take place every year, although according to the activist [[Engy Ghozlan]] ([[Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights|ECWR]]), rapes are 10 times higher than the stats given by Interior Ministry, making it 200,000 per year.&lt;ref name="irinnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/76827/egypt-are-attitudes-to-rape-beginning-to-change |title=EGYPT: Are attitudes to rape beginning to change? |publisher=[[IRIN]] |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mona Eltahawy]] has also noted the same figure (200,000), and added that this was before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|revolution]], and that today the number is actually higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapeartistes.com/2012/04/26/how-safe-is-egypt-after-the-revolution/ How Safe is Egypt After the Revolution?], EscapeArtistes, April 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapes have been carried out during festivals and the Egyptian protests, and include the public rapes of women, and female journalists.&lt;ref name="NY post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/07/02/dutch-female-reporter-gang-raped-by-5-men-in-violent-egyptian-protests/ |title=Dutch female reporter gang-raped by 5 men in violent Egyptian protests |publisher=[[NY Post]] |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==

Rapes are usually not reported in Egypt, due to the fear of social rejection, and culturally it is not accepted.

Rania Hamid from Centre for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance (CEWLA) says that no one tells that they have been raped, saying "Girls consider it to be quite enough that a few people know about the rape." Rania Hamid further describes the problem, that even if a girl would reveal that she has been raped, the whole issue would take form of honour, she said that "There are problems of honour. Sometimes a brother or cousin may kill her, saying 'you wanted this, you encouraged this, you’re not honourable, and what is that you are wearing?...' Of course it’s not her fault, but who are you going to tell that to? The girl or society?"&lt;ref name="irinnews"/&gt;

According to the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|US State Department country report]], "[[honour crimes]]" are not actually illegal in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Farah Shash, a psychologist explains that young boys are rarely stopped or opposed by their parents for molesting girls publicly, it's because the children always saw the same behavior around them. Shash further adds that "Often, families will just laugh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/201381494941573782.html|title=Egypt's sexual assault epidemic|date=14 August 2013|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According Seif el-Dawla who runs a center in the country told that "Sexual molestation and harassment ... is routine for women who come across police".

[[Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights]] (ECWR) has called the problem "social cancer" and suggested that dress code is not deterrent at all. [[Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights|ECWR]] carried out a survey in 2008 which found that 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign women within Egypt had experienced sexual harassment at some time, and only 12% had gone to police for complaining such issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.arabianbusiness.com/egyptian-jailed-three-years-for-groping-84452.html |title=Egyptian jailed three years for groping |date=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 62% of Egyptian men admitted harassing women, and 53% of Egyptian men have blamed women for 'bringing it on.'

[[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality]] on May 23, 2013, reported that estimated of 99.3% of Egyptian women said they faced some form of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/03/opinion/burleigh-rapes-tahrir-square/index.html|title=Gang rape, the dark side of Egypt's protests|date=3 July 2013|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, rape has been connected to religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mnnonline.org/article/12056|title=Egyptian police torture and beat believer in attempt to force her reconversion|date=30 December 2008|publisher=[[Mission Network News]]|accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists reported that the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] pays for raping women and beating men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pathwaysofempowerment-org-staging/downloads/uncovering_stories_of_sexual_assault_original12854b8f7935685e52600bd699fe8c15.pdf|title=Uncovering Stories of Sexual Assault in the Shadow of The Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During protests ===
During the 2011 - 2014 [[Timeline of the 2011–present Egyptian civil unrest|Egyptian protests]], rape had been carried out publicly.
[[File:Lara Logan crop.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Lara Logan]]]]
CBS correspondent [[Lara Logan]] revealed in her [[60 Minutes]] program that she and her CBS crew were arrested and detained for one night by the Egyptian Army on 3 February 2011, while covering the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian Revolution]]. She said the crew was blindfolded and handcuffed at gunpoint, and their driver beaten. They were advised to leave the country, but were later released.&lt;ref name="esquire"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamer|first=Foster|title=Lara Logan's Egypt Interrogation Tell-All|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/lara-logan-egypt-5219471|publisher=Esquire}}

*[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11457 Charlie Rose Interview with Lara Logan], see 3:30–4:00, 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2011, CBS News released a statement that Logan had been beaten and sexually assaulted on 11 February, while covering the celebrations in Tahrir Square following [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/cbs-lara-logan-suffered-brutal-attack-in-cairo/?scp=5&amp;sq=Lara+Logan&amp;st=nyt |title=CBS Says Lara Logan Suffered 'Brutal' Attack in Cairo |publisher=The New York Times |date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Logan's own words, they raped her with their hands, while taking photographs with their cellphones. They began pulling her body in different directions, pulling her hair so hard she said it seemed they were trying to tear off chunks of her scalp.
Believing she was dying, she was dragged along the square to where the crowd was stopped by a fence, alongside which a group of women were camping. One woman wearing a [[chador]] put her arms around Logan, and the others closed ranks around her, while some men who were with the women threw water at the crowd. A group of soldiers appeared, beat back the crowd with batons, and one of them threw Logan over his shoulder. She was flown back to the U.S. the next day, where she spent four days in the hospital. She was contacted by US president [[Barack Obama]] when she arrived home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/02/15/60minutes/main20032070.shtml |title=Lara Logan Assaulted During Egypt Protests |publisher=CBS News |date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS said it remained unclear who the attackers were, and unlikely that any will be prosecuted.

A female 22-year-old Dutch journalist was gang raped by 5 men in the protest.&lt;ref name="NY post"/&gt;

On 3 July 2013, it was reported that about 91 women were raped and sexually abused in [[Tahrir Square]] in 4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2354477/Egypt-protests-2013-NINETY-ONE-women-raped-sexually-abused-Tahrir-Square-4-days.html|title=NINETY-ONE women protesters raped and sexually abused in Tahrir Square in just four days|date=3 July 2013|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such incidents don't seem to be opposed by the government or officials, but instead they seemed to have gathered support. Report by [[Nina Burleigh]] quotes Egyptian [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] preacher Ahmad Mahmoud Abdullah, who said that "women protesting in [[Tahrir Square]] have no shame and want to be raped".&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;

After revolution, about 50% of women have reported more harassment. 44% said that harassment remained is same as it was before, while, over 58% of men surveyed have told that harassment has been increased after revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2013/06/02/Women-in-Egypt-suffer-more-sexual-violence-under-Islamist-rule-.html|title=Women in Egypt suffer more sexual violence under Islamist rule|date=2 June 2013|publisher=Alarabiya|accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eid al Fitr assaults ===

A solid red flag, signifying the ship’s intent to engage in combat with a Spanish galleon (left ship), flies at the Dutch warship's [[stern]] (right ship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/collection/artobject/156252/versions/2014-04-24_artobject_156252.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Naval Encounter |author=Cornelius Verbeeck |website=Nga.gov |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term '''''red flag''''' could mean either a literal [[flag]] used for signaling or, as a [[metaphor]], a sign of some particular problem requiring attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/red%20flag |title=Red Flag &amp;#124; Definition of Red Flag by Merriam-Webster |website=I.word.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation for "red flag" in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from 1602 and shows that at that time the flag was used by military forces to indicate that they were preparing for battle.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''1602''' [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''Satiromastix'', ''Wks.'' 1873 I. 233 ″What, dost summon a parlie, my little Drumsticke? tis too late: thou seest my red flag is hung out.″&lt;br&gt;'''1666''' ''Lond. Gaz.'' No. 91/4 ″That the Red Flag was out, both Fleets in sight of each other, expecting every hour fit weather to Engage.″&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation of "red flag" in the sense of a warning is dated 1777 and refers to a flag warning of flood.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;'''1777''' [[Philip Thicknesse]], ''Year's Journey'' I. iii. 23 There is a red flag hoisted gradually higher and higher, as the water flows into the harbour [at Calais].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and the expression "to raise the [[red]] flag" come from various usages of real [[flag]]s throughout history. The [[Railway signal#Mechanical signals|semaphore]] red flag (or red light) on railways means an immediate stop, while a red flag is frequently flown by armed forces to warn the public of live fire exercises in progress, and is sometimes flown by ships carrying munitions (in this context it is actually the flag for the letter B in the [[International maritime signal flags|International maritime signal flag alphabet]], a red [[swallowtail (flag)|swallow-tailed flag]]). In many countries a red flag is flown to signify that an outdoor [[shooting range]] is in use. The [[United States Air Force]] refers to its largest annual [[military exercise|exercise]] as [[Red Flag (USAF)|red flag]] operation. Red flags are used for various signals in team sailing races (see [[Racing Rules of Sailing]]). A [[red flag warning]] is a signal of high [[wildfire]] danger and a red flag on the beach warns of dangerous water conditions (double red flags indicate beach closure). Red flags of various designs indicate dangerous wind and wave conditions for mariners. In auto racing, a red flag indicates a stop to the race due to dangerous conditions.

A signal of [[Risk|danger]] or a problem can be referred to as a red flag, a usage that originated in the 18th century. The term "red flag" is used, e.g., during screening of communications, and refers to specific words or phrases encountered that might indicate relevance to the case. For example, email [[spam filter]]s make use of such "red flags".

[[Azerbaijani SSR]] was one of the first republic of Soviet Union that faced the problem of '''[[refugees]] and [[internally displaced persons]]'''. The refugees are ethnic [[Azerbaijanis]] from Armenia and the internally displaced persons are ethnic Azerbaijanis from [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and the [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|seven adjacent rayons]] which are controlled by the self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]].

==Internally displaced persons from Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent territories==
[[File:Refugeesaz.jpg|300px|thumb|Refugees in Azerbaijan]]
During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], territories constituting the former [[NKAO]] region of Azerbaijan and the [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|seven adjacent rayons]] (some of them partly) were occupied by the Armenian forces. As a result, people had to leave their homes. Azerbaijan now has one of the highest numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Report on Internal Displacement|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2017/ |publisher=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre |accessdate=September 5, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901185105/http://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2017/|archivedate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDPs are presented in all of the 76 administrative districts in Azerbaijan. Initially, most of them lived in tent camps and public buildings such as schools, hostels, and dormitories. Since 2001, the Government increased its efforts to solve IDPs' problems. In 2002, the construction of new settlements started, and by the end of 2007, all tent camps were abolished.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

The Government of Azerbaijan with the help of the international community has started drafting a Framework Plan for the Return of IDPs to the occupied regions after the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict ([[The Great Return Programme]]).&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

==Other refugees and asylum seekers==
In 1944, [[Meskhetian Turks]] were deported en masse from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to [[Central Asia]] by [[Joseph Stalin]]. One of the regions they resettled in was [[Fergana Valley]], [[Uzbekistan]]. In 1989, interethnic violence occurred there triggering an evacuation of Meskhetian Turks from Uzbekistan. This group of refugees in Azerbaijan numbered about 50,000 people. According to the 1998 Citizenship Law, they are all eligible for citizenship. By the end of 2001, [[UNHCR]] estimated that most of them were believed to have naturalized

==Statistics==
[[File:Distribution of IDPs in Azerbaijan (2009).jpg|380px|thumb|Distribution of IDPs in Azerbaijan's regions according to the Government of Azerbaijan]]

'''According to''' [[State Committee of Republic of Azerbaijan for Refugees and IDPs|State Committee of Republic of Azerbaijan for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons]], there were 603,251 IDPs in Azerbaijan in March 2009. The majority live in and around Baku, as well as in Sumgayit. Significant numbers of
IDPs also live along the central-southern route of [[Füzuli]]–[[Agdam|Aghdam]]–[[Agjabedi]]–[[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]]–[[Mingechevir]]–[[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], the northern route of [[Shamakhi]]–[[Ismailli]]–[[Qabala|Gabala]]–[[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]] and the southern route of [[Sabirabad (city)|Sabirabad]]–[[Saatli]]–[[Imishli]]–[[Beylagan]].&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

==Problems==
Although relations between IDPs and the local population are generally amicable and there is a high level of tolerance among the local population, there are instances of conflicts arising due to the special status of IDPs (such as privileged access to employment, government financial assistance, free health services and property ownership privileges).&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

{{History of Burma}}
{{Burmese characters}}

The '''Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom''' ({{lang-my|ဟံသာဝတီ နေပြည်တော်}}) was the kingdom that ruled [[Lower Burma]] and parts of [[Upper Burma]] from 1740 to 1757. The kingdom grew out of a rebellion by the [[Mon people]], who then formed the majority in Lower Burma, against the [[Bamar|Burman]] [[Toungoo Dynasty]] of [[Inwa|Ava]] in Upper Burma. The rebellion succeeded in restoring the fallen [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking [[Kingdom of Hanthawaddy]], which ruled Lower Burma from 1287 to 1539. Supported by the [[French colonial empire|French]], the upstart kingdom quickly carved out a space for itself in Lower Burma, and continued its push northward. In March 1752, its forces captured Ava, and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty.&lt;ref name=geh-211-217/&gt;

A new dynasty called [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung]] led by King [[Alaungpaya]] rose in Upper Burma to challenge the southern forces, and went on to conquer all of Upper Burma by December 1753. After Hanthawaddy's invasion of Upper Burma failed in 1754, the kingdom came unglued. Its leadership in self-defeating measures killed off the Toungoo royal family, and persecuted ethnic Burmans in the south, both of which only strengthened Alaungpaya's hand.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206/&gt; In 1755, Alaungpaya invaded Lower Burma. Konbaung forces captured the [[Irrawaddy delta]] in May 1755, the French defended port of [[Thanlyin]] in July 1756, and finally the capital [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] in May 1757.

The fall of Restored Hanthawaddy was the beginning of the end of Mon people's centuries-old dominance of Lower Burma. Konbaung armies' reprisals forced thousands of Mons to flee to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]].&lt;ref name=tmu-97&gt;Myint-U (2006): 97&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, assimilation, inter-marriage, and mass migration of Burman families from the north had reduced the Mon population to a small minority.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206/&gt;

==Rise of southern kingdom==
The southern rebellion was the most serious threat to the Toungoo Dynasty, which was already on its last legs. Its weak kings had been unable to stem the constant raids on the [[Chindwin river]] valley by the [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] since 1724, or put down a nagging rebellion in [[Lan Na]] in the east since 1727. The Ava-appointed governor at Pegu was assassinated on {{OldStyleDate|29 November|1740|18 November}} by the local court.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-215&gt;Lieberman 1984: 215&lt;/ref&gt; The court elected a [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking Burman of royal lineage with the Mon title of [[Smim Htaw Buddhaketi]], as king of Hanthawaddy on {{OldStyleDate|8 December|1740|27 November}}.&lt;ref name=Hmn3&gt;Hmannan Vol. 3 (1829): 372–373&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Lieberman 1984: 215–216): His forces attacked Syriam on {{OldStyleDate|15 December|1740|4 December}}, a week after his accession.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1742, the Hanthawaddy forces started raiding annually up the [[Irrawaddy river]] as far as Ava. By 1745, Hanthawaddy controlled much of Lower Burma, and parts of Upper Burma up to [[Prome]] and [[Toungoo]].&lt;ref name=geh-211-217&gt;Harvey (1925): 211–217&lt;/ref&gt; (The new kingdom did not control the northern Tenasserim coast. The rulers of [[Martaban]] (Mottama) and [[Tavoy]] (Dawei) sought and received Siamese protection.)

The low grade warfare continued until November 1751 when [[Binnya Dala]], who succeeded Smim Htaw as king in 1747, launched a full-scale invasion of Upper Burma. The Hanthawaddy armies gradually advanced north, and finally sacked the capital city of Ava in March 1752. The royal family was deported to Pegu. Mistakenly thinking that Upper Burma had been won, the Hanthawaddy leadership prematurely returned to Pegu, leaving only a third of the forces led by Gen. [[Dalaban]] to mop up the final resistance in upcountry Burma.&lt;ref name=geh-211-217/&gt;

==Fall==
{{Main|Konbaung-Hanthawaddy War}}
The inevitable Burman resistance came swiftly. In March 1752, a village headman of [[Shwebo|Moksobo]] named Aung Zeya founded the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] with the title of [[Alaungpaya]] to resist the Mon occupation. Alaungpaya rapidly gained a following from all over Upper Burma. By December 1752, he had reconquered all of Upper Burma north of Ava, and the city itself a year later. In March 1754, Binnya Dala invaded Upper Burma with the entire army. The invasion went well at first, laying siege to Ava and advancing deep into upcountry but ultimately faltered, driven back with heavy losses.

Following the defeat, the leadership of Hanthawaddy escalated its "self-defeating" policies of ethnic polarization in the south. It executed all Avan captives, including the last king of Toungoo, and began requiring all Burmans in the south to wear an earring with a stamp of the Pegu heir-apparent and to cut their hair in Mon fashion as a sign of loyalty.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206&gt;Lieberman (2003): 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, Alaungpaya began the southern push, capturing the [[Irrawaddy delta]] in April and Dagon (now [[Yangon]]) in May. The [[French colonial empire|French]] defended port city of [[Syriam]] (Thanlyin) was taken only after a 14-month siege in July 1756. With French support cut off, the end of the kingdom followed. The capital Pegu fell on 6 May 1757.&lt;ref name=app-166-169&gt;Phayre (1883): 166–169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The fall of the kingdom was the end of independence for the Mon people as well as their centuries-old dominance of Lower Burma. Konbaung armies' indiscriminate sacking of the low country forced thousands of Mons to flee to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]].&lt;ref name=tmu-97/&gt; Ethnic Burman families from the north also began settling in the delta. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206/&gt;

A '''stereotypy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛr|i|ə|ˌ|t|aɪ|p|i|,_|ˈ|s|t|ɪər|-|,_|-|i|oʊ|-}},{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|Stereotypy}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|Stereotypy}}}} {{respell|STERR|ee|oh|ty|pee}} or {{respell|STEER|ee|oh|ty|pee}}) is a repetitive or ritualistic movement, posture, or utterance. Stereotypies may be simple movements such as body rocking, or complex, such as self-caressing, crossing and uncrossing of legs, and marching in place.  They are found in people with [[intellectual disabilities]], [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[stereotypic movement disorder]], but may also be encountered in neurotypical individuals as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jankovic J |title=Differential diagnosis and etiology of tics |journal=Adv Neurol |date=2001 |volume=85 |pages=15–29 |pmid=11530424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown stereotypies associated with some types of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Pedro BM, Pilowsky LS, Costa DC, ''et al.'' |title=Stereotypy, schizophrenia and dopamine D2 receptor binding in the basal ganglia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=423–9 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8084937|doi=10.1017/s0033291700027392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frontotemporal dementia]] is also a common neurological cause of repetitive behaviors and stereotypies.&lt;ref name="Mateen FJ, Josephs KA 2009 1237–40"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mateen FJ, Josephs KA | title=The clinical spectrum of stereotypies in frontotemporal lobar degeneration | journal=Movement Disorders | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=1237–40 |date=June 2009 | pmid=19412926 | doi=10.1002/mds.22555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendez MF, Shapira JS |title=The spectrum of recurrent thoughts and behaviors in frontotemporal dementia |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=202–8 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18323753 |url= http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several causes have been hypothesized for stereotypy, and several treatment options are available.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Singer HS |title=Motor stereotypies |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=77–81 |year=2009 |pmid=19501335 |doi=10.1016/j.spen.2009.03.008 |url= http://m.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/pediatric-neurology/conditions/motor-stereotypies/motor-stereotypies.pdf |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypy is sometimes called ''[[stimming]]'' in autism, under the hypothesis that it self-stimulates one or more senses.&lt;ref name=Nind/&gt; Related terms include [[punding]] and (more colloquially) ''tweaking'' to describe repetitive behavior that is a side effect of some drugs.&lt;ref name=Weisheit/&gt;

Among people with [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]], more than half (60%) had stereotypies. The time to onset of stereotypies in people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration may be years (average 2.1 years).&lt;ref name="Mateen FJ, Josephs KA 2009 1237–40"/&gt;

==Distinction from tics==
Like [[tic]]s, stereotypies are patterned and periodic, and are made worse by fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Unlike tics, stereotypies usually begin before the age of three, involve more of the body, are more rhythmic and less random, and are associated more with engrossment in another activity rather than premonitory urges. Examples of early tics are things like blinking and throat clearing, while arm flapping is a more common stereotypy.  Stereotypies do not have the ever-changing, waxing and waning nature of tics, and can remain constant for years. Tics are usually suppressible for brief periods; in contrast, children rarely consciously attempt to control a stereotypy, although they can be distracted from one.&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Muthugovindan D, Singer H |title=Motor stereotypy disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=131–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19532036 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e328326f6c8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed causes==
There are several possible explanations for stereotypy, and different stereotyped behaviors may have different explanations. A popular explanation is [[stimming]], which hypothesizes that a particular stereotyped behavior has a function related to sensory input. Other explanations include hypotheses that stereotypy discharges tension or expresses frustration, that it communicates a need for attention or reinforcement or sensory stimulation, that it is learned or neuropathological or some combination of the two, or that it is normal behavior with no particular explanation needed.&lt;ref name=Nind&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Nind M, Kellett M |title=Responding to individuals with severe learning difficulties and stereotyped behaviour: challenges for an inclusive era |journal=Eur J Spec Needs Educ |date=2002 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=265–82 |doi=10.1080/08856250210162167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
{{Main|Stereotypy (non-human)}}
&lt;!--detail moved to Stereotypy (non-human)--&gt;
Stereotypies also occur in non-human animals.  It is considered an [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behavior]] and is sometimes seen in [[Captivity (animal)|captive animals]], particularly those held in small enclosures with little opportunity to engage in more normal behaviors. These behaviors may be maladaptive, involving self-injury or reduced reproductive success, and in laboratory animals can confound behavioral research.&lt;ref name="garner mason"&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Evidence for a relationship between cage stereotypies and behavioural disinhibition in laboratory rodents |author=Garner JP, Mason GJ |journal=Behav Brain Res |date=2002 |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=83–92 |doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(02)00111-0 |pmid=12385793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of stereotypical behaviors include pacing, rocking, swimming in circles, excessive sleeping, self-mutilation (including feather picking and excessive grooming), and mouthing cage bars. Stereotypies are seen in many species, including [[primate]]s, birds, and [[Carnivora|carnivore]]s. Up to 40% of elephants in zoos display stereotypical behaviors.&lt;ref name="elephants"&gt;{{vcite news |title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate |author=Stern A |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm |accessdate=2006-05-30 |date=2005-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypies are well known in [[stable]]d  [[horse]]s, usually developing as a result of being confined, particularly with insufficient exercise. They are colloquially called [[stable vices]].  They present a [[horse care|management]] issue, not only leading to facility damage from chewing, kicking, and repetitive motion, but also lead to health consequences for the animal if not addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/DI8538.pdf |author=Christie, Julie Christie, |title=Horse Behavior and Stable Vices |work=University of Minnesota Extension |year=2008 |publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102165506/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/DI8538.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypical behaviors are thought to be caused ultimately by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioral needs. Rather than refer to the behavior as abnormal, it has been suggested that it be described as "behavior indicative of an abnormal environment."&lt;ref name="primate newsletter"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Davis E, Down N, Garner J ''et al'' |title=Stereotypical behavior: a LAREF discussion |url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Primate/lpn43-4.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Lab Primate Newsl |date=2004 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=3–4 |accessdate=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypies are correlated with altered behavioral response selection in the [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="garner mason" /&gt; As stereotypies are frequently viewed as a sign of psychological distress in animals, there is also an [[animal welfare]] issue involved.

Stereotypical behavior can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by [[environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]], including larger and more stimulating enclosures, training, and introductions of stimuli (such as objects, sounds, or scents) to the animal's environment. The enrichment must be varied to remain effective for any length of time. Housing social animals with other members of their species is also helpful. But once the behavior is established, it is sometimes impossible to eliminate due to alterations in the brain.&lt;ref name="primate newsletter" /&gt;

The '''Tellus Institute''' is a non-profit research and policy organization based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Its mission is to advance the transition to a sustainable, equitable, and humane global civilization. The Tellus Institute was founded in 1976 by [[Paul Raskin]], Richard Rosen, Stephen Bernow, John Stutz, and David Nichols for the purpose of research on resource and environmental strategies. Dr. Paul Raskin is the President of the Institute. Initially called  the Energy Systems Research Group (ESRG), the Institute adopted its current name in 1990.

==History==
Since 1976, Tellus has conducted over 3,500 resource management and environmental strategy projects throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tellus.org/ | title=Our vision, our work | last= | first= | date= | website=Tellus Institute | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is well known in the environmental strategies domain for its many studies on state and municipality recycling programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic &amp; Environmental Benefits of Beverage Container Recycling: The Case for Updating Massachusetts’ Bottle Bill|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/assets/pdfs/campaigns/massachusetts/1998-EconEnviroBenefits.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of System Costs and Materials Recovery Rates: Implementation of Universal Single Stream Recycling With and Without Beverage Container Deposits - Draft Report|url=http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/wastediv/solid/documents/DRAFT-ReportToANR-4MAR2013.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Bottle Bill - A Final Report to: Michigan Great Lakes Protection Fund|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-whm-BottleBillRpt-Tellus_255247_7.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its 1992 Packaging study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/01/00047/7-10.htm | title=Tellus Packaging Study | last= | first= | date= | website=Pollution Prevention Infohouse | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 Assessment of Options for Massachusetts' Solid Waste Master Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment of Materials Management Options for the MA Solid Waste Master Plan Review|url=http://www.tellus.org/pub/Final_Report-Materials_Management_Options_for_MA_SW_Master_Plan_Review_-_With_Appendices_-_12-08.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Preliminary Analysis of the Costs and Benefits of Bottle Bills study done for the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is a National Bottle Bill Worthwhile?|url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=18077|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Tellus has created numerous scientific tools and reports in many different areas, including energy, water, [[sustainable communities]], [[corporate social responsibility]], and climate change; however, since 2005 the Institute has shifted its focus to developing a [[Great Transition]] vision for a sustainable future.

==Research and programs==
The main body of Tellus' current research specializes in the application of quantitative analysis to the development of possible future scenarios.

Tellus has also launched a number of subsidiary working groups and research programs:

*'''The [[Global Scenario Group]] (GSG)''' was convened in 1995 in order to compile a set of possible scenarios for global development in the twenty-first century. Its goal was to identify a sustainable and equitable future within this set of scenarios and to isolate the policies, actions, and human choices required to achieve this scenario. Its findings indicated that an environmentally sustainable, socially equitable future —which the GSG termed a "Great Transition"—was possible. The GSG’s work culminated with the 2002 publication of ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay | title=GT Essay | last= | first= | date= | website=Great Transition Initiative | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Raskin led the GSG, which consisted of more than 20 environmental scholars from throughout the globe. Scenarios developed by the GSG have informed the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]’s Global Environment Outlook series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Environment Outlook Scenario Framework: Background Paper for UNEP's Third Global Environment Outlook Report|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO3/pdfs/GEO_ScenarioFramework.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other international and national vision studies.
*'''The [[Great Transition#Great Transition Initiative|Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI)''' was formed in 2003 to re-channel the momentum of the GSG. Its mandate is to continue scenario development, disseminate the Great Transition vision to a larger audience, and build a network of GTI members. It was relaunched in April 2014 as an online journal and discussion network devoted to vision and praxis around a progressive global transformation.
*'''Corporation 20/20''' is an initiative of Tellus focused on [[corporate social responsibility]]. Its mission is to develop and advocate the redesign of corporations so that business is guided by social purpose as well as financial gain. Co-founded in 2004 by Allen White, Vice President of Tellus, and Marjorie Kelly, co-founder and former editor of ''Business Ethics'' magazine, Corporation 20/20 hosts a forum of leading thinkers, practitioners, and advocates who work to construct alternate visions of the corporate structure, which it then disseminates into the corporate community.
*'''The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]''', founded by [[Ceres (organization)]] and Tellus Vice President Allen White, had the goal of developing and disseminating a standardized framework for sustainability reporting. Now an autonomous organization based in Amsterdam, the GRI's framework has become the de facto international standard used by over 1,200 companies for corporate reporting on environmental, social and economic performance.
*'''The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings (GISR)''' is an initiative launched by Ceres and Tellus in 2011 whose goal is to develop an independent, standardized framework for sustainability ratings.
*'''Boston Scenario Project''' was initiated in 2005 as a process for developing local scenarios for the Boston metropolitan region that mirror the global-scale scenarios described in the Great Transition essay. The project seeks to reconcile worldwide effects with local actions in order to envision a future of sustainability, pluralism, justice, and global responsibility for the Boston region, which would also contribute to worldwide sustainability and equity. The Boston Scenario Project is coordinated by James Goldstein, Tellus Senior Fellow.

==Tools==
Tellus developed and uses a series of software programs in its research. These programs were designed for strategic planning and [[scenario analysis]], allowing the user to create, evaluate, and compare alternative futures based on current data and hypothetical trends. Long range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) System software facilitates energy-environment planning; [[Weap|WEAP]], water planning; WastePlan, solid waste planning; and PoleStar, sustainability planning.
