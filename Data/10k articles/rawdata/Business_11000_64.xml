# '''Approach''': what processes, strategies, and structures have been developed and reasons why they have been selected;
# '''Deployment''': how these processes, strategies, and structures have been implemented;
# '''Results''': what trends are indicated by the [[Key Performance Indicator]]s (KPIs) and how this is assessed; and
# '''Improvement''': what process is used for reviewing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ''Approach'' and ''Deployment'' above.

The approach is used to improve quality in a cyclical manner at many universities.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://planning.curtin.edu.au/quality/adri.cfm | title=ADRI Quality Cycle |  publisher=Office of Strategy and Planning, [[Curtin University]] | location=[[Australia]] | accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for independent reviews of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oaaa.gov.om/QualityTraining/Handout/01v6_handout.pdf | publisher=Ministry of Higher Education &amp; Oman Accreditation Council | location=Oman | title=ADRI: A quality assurance model for self-reviews and external reviews | first=Martin | last=Carroll | date=11 September 2006 | accessdate=31 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">An '''agency shop''' is a form of [[union security agreement]] where the employer may hire [[trade union|union]] or non-union workers, and employees need not join the union in order to remain employed.&lt;ref name="Pynes"&gt;Pynes, Joan. ''Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations.'' 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7879-7078-6}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the non-union worker must pay a fee to cover collective bargaining costs.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt; The fee paid by non-union members under the agency shop is known as the "agency fee".&lt;ref name="Guerin"&gt;Guerin, Lisa and DelPo, Amy. ''The Manager's Legal Handbook.'' Rev. 4th ed. Berkeley, Calif.: Nolo, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4133-0718-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}; {{cite journal |last1=Mc Closkey |first1=Margie Ransom |last2=Rubin |first2=Richard S. |title=Union Security in the Public Sector: Types, Problems, Trends |journal=[[The Journal of Collective Negotiations]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1977 |pages=1 |doi=10.2190/UJAU-1DJJ-0H1C-NBRJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer"&gt;Mauer, Michael.

Annapolis, Md.: Union Communication Services, Inc., 2001. {{ISBN|0-9659486-1-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the agency shop is illegal, as is common in labor law governing [[United States|American]] [[public sector]] unions, a "fair share provision" may be agreed to by the union and the employer.&lt;ref name="Guerin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer" /&gt; The provision requires non-union employees to pay a "fair share fee" to cover the costs of the union's collective bargaining activities. The "fair share" is similar to the agency shop, but usually more restrictive as to what may be charged to the non-member.{{clarify|date=November 2013|reason=If this is the only difference, it needs to be specified.}}&lt;ref name="Guerin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer" /&gt; In Canada, the agency fee is usually known as the [[Rand formula]].&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy, John.

Waterloo, Ontario, Canada: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-88920-230-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, compelling payment of agency fees from non-union employees in the public sector was held unconstitutional in [[Janus v. AFSCME]], in June 2018. 

[[International Labour Organization]] covenants do not address the legality of agency fee provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+%40ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 "Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190504/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+@ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 |date=2011-06-04 }} Document No. 031960034188. Cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association. International Labor Organization. March 4, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of agency shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all.

'''Arthur Hadfield Fisher''' (11 February 1871 &amp;ndash; 23 March 1961) was a New Zealand cricketer and businessman.

He was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Fisher"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Arthur Hadfield Fisher|first= David|last= Richmond|id=2f9|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played for [[Otago cricket team|Otago]] from 1890-91 to 1909-10 as a left-arm medium-pace bowler, taking 197 wickets at an average of 16.38. Against a touring [[Queensland cricket team]] in 1896-97 he took 9 for 50 in the first innings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4697.html Otago v Queensland 1896-97]&lt;/ref&gt;

He represented New Zealand, in the days before New Zealand had [[Test cricket|Test]] status, in matches against Australian and English teams. Against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in Wellington in 1906-07, he took 4 for 25 and 5 for 61 in a 56-run victory for New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7210.html New Zealand v MCC 1906-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Dunedin]] in 1961 at the age of 90.

'''Bound Together Anarchist Collective Bookstore''' is an [[anarchist]] [[bookstore]] and visitor attraction in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]].

The '''Business Roundtable''' ('''BRT''') is a group of [[chief executive officers]] of major U.S. corporations formed to promote pro-business [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, L. (1991, March 7). The Business Roundtable is mentioned by G. William Domhoff in ''Who Rules America?''  Domhoff argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control and influence over the economy, politics, and media.  Perils to conservatives in a conservative court.

==History==
The Roundtable was founded in 1972 by John Harper, the head of [[Alcoa]], and [[Fred J. Borch]], CEO of [[General Electric]], who were concerned about growing public hostility toward corporations as evidenced by support for government regulation of the workplace environment and about the power of unions to squeeze corporate profits in an increasingly competitive international market. The two CEOs talked with [[John Connally]], [[President Nixon]]'s [[Secretary of the Treasury]], and [[Arthur Burns]], the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], who advised them to set up a lobbying organization that would specifically represent large banks and corporations. Harper was the first president, followed by Thomas Murphy of [[General Motors]], Irving Shapiro of [[DuPont]], and Clifford Garvin of [[Exxon]]. 

The group was formed through the merger of three existing organizations: the March Group, consisting of chief executive officers who met informally to consider public policy issues; the Construction Users Anti-Inflation Roundtable, a group devoted to containing construction costs; and, the Labor Law Study Committee, largely made up of labor relations executives of major companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//aboutUs/history.aspx "About Us"], Business Roundtable website&lt;/ref&gt; The group has called itself President Obama's "closest ally in the business community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Business leaders say Obama's economic policies stifle growth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062205279.html |work= |location= |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Roundtable played a key role in defeating an [[anti-trust]] bill in 1975 and a [[Ralph Nader]] plan for a consumer protection agency in 1977. It also helped dilute the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act]]. But the Roundtable's most significant victory was in blocking labor law reform that sought to strengthen labor law to make it more difficult for companies to intimidate workers who wanted to form unions. The AFL-CIO produced a bill in 1977 that passed the House. But the Roundtable voted to oppose the bill, and through its aggressive lobbying, it prevented the bill's Senate supporters from rounding up the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to withstand a [[filibuster]].

In fiscal policy, the Roundtable was responsible for broadening the 1985 tax cuts signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]], lobbying successfully for sharp reductions in corporate taxes. In trade policy, it argued for opening foreign markets to American trade and investment. The [[Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act|Omnibus Trade Act]] of 1988 reflected  the thinking of the Business Roundtable. In 1990, the Roundtable urged George Bush to initiate a free trade agreement with Mexico. In 1993, the Roundtable lobbied for [[NAFTA]] and against any strong side agreements on labor and the environment. It provided the money and leadership for the main pro-NAFTA lobby.

The Roundtable also successfully opposed changes in corporate governance that would have made boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders. In 1986, the Roundtable convinced the Securities and Exchange Commission to forgo new rules on merger and acquisitions, and in 1993 convinced President Clinton to water down his plan to impose penalties on excessive executive salaries. [[Citicorp]] CEO, John Reed, chairperson of the Roundtables Accounting Task Force, argued that Clinton's plan would have had negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. The Roundtable's Health, Welfare, and Retirement Income Task Force, chaired by [[Prudential Insurance]] CEO Robert C. Winters, cheered President Bush's plan, which consisted mainly of subsidies to the health care industry. The nation's health care system works well for the majority of Americans, the Roundtable announced in a June 1991 statement. "We believe the solutions lie not in tearing down the present system, but in building upon it."

In a press release, it said it "strongly supported passage of" the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002, and was "actively working with states on implementation." It has issued press releases, submitted editorials, given congressional testimony, and distributed position advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//taskForces/taskforce/issue.aspx?qs=6545BF159F849514481138A6DBE7A7A19BB6487BF6B38 "ISSUE: No Child Left Behind"] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Roundtable also acts as a major [[lobbying|lobby]] that aims to extend or maintain administrators' rights/power in large companies. For example, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] adopted the so-called "shareholders’ access to proxy" rule, which aimed to empower shareholders in the proposition and nomination of administrators of big corporations. The Business Roundtable was strongly against that rule, as its president John Castellani reported to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' about removing this rule: "this is our highest priority [...] Literally all of our members have called about this".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/13/AR2010051305288.html&lt;/ref&gt; And they got the upper hand: the SEC rule was finally dropped after intense lobbying and lawsuits.

===Legislation===
The Business Roundtable wrote a letter to members of the House strongly endorsing the [[Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress)]].&lt;ref name=BRTletter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutler|first1=Alexander M.|title=BRT Letter to House on the Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act|url=http://businessroundtable.org/resources/brt-letter-house-customer-protection-and-end-user-relief-act|publisher=Business Roundtable|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Business Roundtable letter, a survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers "underscores the urgent need for the end-user provisions" in this bill because "eighty-six percent of respondents indicated the fully collateralizing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives would adversely impact business investment, acquisitions, research and development, and job creation."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt; The letter concluded that the Business Roundtable "supports efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt;

==Criticism==

The Business Roundtable has been identified by advocates for shareholder democracy and owners' rights as a primary inhibitor of progress in corporate governance, who claim that through its lobbying of the SEC, the NYSE, and other regulatory and self-regulatory institutions, the Business Roundtable has sought to limit shareholders proxy rights and the power to nominate directors. The critics of the Business Roundtable contend that rather than fighting on behalf of stockholders in companies, it has focused purely on increasing executive power and compensation, thereby diminishing return to the owners (shareholders) of these firms.

* Corporate governance pioneer [[Robert A. G. Monks|Robert A.G. Monks]], in his 2007 book [[Corpocracy: How CEOs and the Business Roundtable Hijacked the World's Greatest Wealth Machine -- And How to Get It Back]], argues that the Business Roundtable has been a key player in the steady dilution of shareholder access to the boardroom and that this has contributed to the skyrocketing rates of CEO compensation.
* [[G. William Domhoff]], in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control, and influence over the economy, politics, and media.
* In [[The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]], [[John C. Bogle]], the founder of the [[Vanguard Group]] and author of investing classic [[Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor]], argues that the Business Roundtable is to blame for the failure of recent corporate governance initiatives.
* The [[University of Hawaii]]'s Robert R. Locke, author of Confronting Managerialism, identifies the Business Roundtable as a major contributor to what he calls "Managerialism", the shift in power from owner/shareholders to those who are the manager/agents of firms. His 2011 work, [[Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance]], explores several cases in which the Business Roundtable has opposed changes to corporate governance rules that would have empowered shareholders at the expense of CEOs.

==Governance==

A Council is elected and appointed by members regionally. The Council is responsible for appointing the Board and assisting management in ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of Members. 
The Council also advises the Board and management on Member and strategic issues.

The Board is the delegated decision-making body. It operates on a corporate model and has oversight responsibility for the development and approval of long term strategy and performance including key policy issues and oversight of risk.

The Strategic Leadership Team supports the CEO and is responsible for the day-to-day operation.

Regional Councils represent Members in Australia and New Zealand by providing a voice for the Members in their region and advising the Council on member issues.

Every Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Member living in New Zealand is represented by a Local Leadership Team (LLT) in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charteredaccountantsanz.com/en/Site-Content/Our-Story/Governance.aspx | title=Governance | publisher=Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand | accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

===Chartered Accountants===
The [[Chartered Accountant]] (CA) designation denotes an accountant qualified to offer the full range of accountancy services privately and to the public.

===Associate Chartered Accountants===

The ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' (ACA) designation is a mid-level qualification.  The designation recognises individuals who may not wish to train to be Chartered Accountants but who want to be recognised for their skills in business and finance. The ACA designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

The designation ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' is not directly comparable to the ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' (ACA) designation offered by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] , the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]].

===Accounting Technicians===
The Accounting Technician (AT) designation is for individuals employed to oversee and manage financial accounts in roles such as Accounts Manager or Assistant Finance Manager. The AT designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

New Zealand's practice in this respect is not followed in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, accounting technicians generally belong to the [http://www.aat.org.uk Association of Accounting Technicians].

===Fellowship===
Fellowships (FCA) are awards granted to Chartered Accountants ANZ members to recognise outstanding achievement in and/or contribution to the profession of accountancy at either a local, national or international level.

==Public practice==
Chartered Accountants may apply for a ''Certificate of Public Practice''. Every member who offers accounting services to the public must be a Chartered Accountant and hold a Certificate of Public Practice (CPP). The requirements for the issuing of this certificate are that (amongst others) a member must have had two years of acceptable practical experience while a member of the College of Chartered Accountants and have attended a course for new practitioners.

'''''Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States''''', 318 U.S. 363 (1943), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that federal [[negotiable instruments]] were governed by federal law, and thus the federal court had the authority to fashion a [[federal common law|common law rule]].{{ref|citation}}

==Facts &amp; procedural history==
On April 28, 1936, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] mailed a [[Cheque|check]] for $24.20, drawn on the [[Treasurer of the United States]], to Clair Barner. The check was Barner's paycheck from the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Barner never received the check, which was stolen by an unknown party. The thief [[forgery|forged Barner's signature]] and cashed the check at the [[J.C. Penney]] department store in [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania]], where the thief [[Identity theft|assumed the identity]] of Mr. Barner. J.C. Penney then turned the check over to Clearfield Trust Co. as its collection agent. Clearfield Trust Co. collected the check from the [[Federal Reserve]] Bank, knowing nothing about the [[forgery]].

On May 10, 1936, Barner informed his supervisors at the WPA that he had not received his paycheck.  His complaint made its way up the chain of command, and on November 30, 1936, Barner signed an [[affidavit]] alleging that the endorsement of his name on the check was forged. Neither J.C. Penney Co. nor Clearfield Trust Co. had any notice of the forgery until January 12, 1937, when the U.S. government sent its first notice about it. The United States sent its initial request for reimbursement on August 31, 1937, and filed suit against Clearfield Trust Co. in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]] on November 16, 1939. The government based its [[cause of action]] on the express [[guaranty]] of prior endorsements by Clearfield Trust Co.

The District Court determined that the dispute should be governed by the state law of [[Pennsylvania]].  It then dismissed the government's complaint on grounds of [[Laches (equity)|laches]], holding that because the United States unreasonably delayed in notifying Clearfield Trust Co. of the forgery, it was barred from recovery.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] reversed the dismissal.

==Decision==
Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], writing for a unanimous United States Supreme Court, first distinguished the case from ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'', holding that because the U.S. government was exercising a [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]]-permitted function in disbursing its own funds and paying its [[debt]]s, the [[commercial paper]] it issues should be governed by federal law rather than state law. Thus, the [[Erie doctrine]] rule -- that a [[United States District Court]] must apply the law of the state in which it is sitting -- did not apply. In the absence of an applicable Act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], a federal court had the right to fashion a governing common law rule by its own standards.

While the Court's decision explicitly retained the option of applying state law in fashioning a federal common law rule, the Court chose instead to fashion its own rule based on prior decisions. Justice Douglas identified a major federal interest in permitting the Court to fashion its own rule: uniformity in dealing with the vast amount of [[negotiable instruments]] and [[commercial paper]] issued by the federal government. Douglas reasoned that if each transaction were subject to the application of a multiplicity of different state laws, confusion and uncertainty in the administration of federal programs would be the result.

Justice Douglas chose to follow the rule set forth in ''[[United States v. National Exchange Bank of Providence]]'', {{ussc|214|302|1909}}, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the U.S. government, “''as drawee of commercial paper stands in no different light than any other drawee''” and could recover on a check as a drawee from a person who had cashed a [[pension]] check with a forged endorsement, despite the government's protracted delay in giving notice of the forgery. The ''National Exchange Bank'' case held the government to conventional business terms, but said nothing about whether lack of prompt notice was a defense for nonpayment of a check. The Court held that the Pennsylvania state law -- requiring prompt notice from the drawee -- presumed injury to the defendant by the mere fact of delay. In this case, not only did Clearfield Trust Co. fail to demonstrate that it had suffered a loss because of the delay in notice, it could still recover the amount of the check from J.C. Penney, because none of its employees detected the fraud. The court chastised both companies for their "neglect and error" in accepting the forged check, and suggested that they should only be permitted to shift the loss to the drawee only when he can demonstrate that the delay in notice caused him damage.

'''Coolhunting''' is a [[neologism]] coined in the early 1990s referring to a new kind of [[marketing]] professionals who make [[observation]]s and [[prediction]]s in changes of new or existing  [[Cool (aesthetic)|"cool"]] cultural [[fads and trends]]. Coolhunting is also referred to as "trend spotting," and is a subset of [[trend analysis]].

Coolhunters resemble the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] fashion magazine editors of the 1960s such as [[Nancy White (editor)|Nancy White]] (''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' 1958–1971).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Coolhunters operate mostly in the world of [[street fashion]] and [[design]], but their work also blurs into that of [[Futurology|futurists]] such as [[Faith Popcorn]].

==Business model==

A  coolhunting firm  is a [[marketing agency]] whose exclusive purpose is to conduct [[research]] of the youth demographic. They then compile their data and produce reports detailing emerging and declining trends in [[youth culture]] as well as predictions for future trends. These reports are then sold to various companies whose products target the youth demographic. They also offer [[Consultant|consulting]] services. Coolhunting firms often provide services for some of the largest [[corporation]]s in the world.

Rather than [[outsourcing]] their [[market research]], some companies opt for  in-house  youth culture marketing divisions. These divisions act in much the same way as a coolhunting firm but the reports and data collected remain within the company and are used solely to promote its products. A company will often prefer this form of coolhunting as a way to gain an advantage in the valuable youth market since the research conducted by coolhunting firms is available to anyone willing to pay for it.   [[Viacom]]'s [[MTV]] television network employs  in-house coolhunting.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

==Methods and practices==
Coolhunting is  more than simple [[market research]] because of the nature of the subjects. The teen and preteen market is often referred to as a "stubborn" demographic in that they do not respond as well to blatant [[advertising]] and marketing campaigns targeted at them. Coolhunters therefore must be more stealthy in their methods of gathering information and data.

[[Focus group]]s, though quite obvious in their attempts at gathering information, are very popular among coolhunters as they provide direct insight into the [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s of their target [[demographic]].  Coolhunters will typically gather a group of randomly selected individuals from their target demographic. While one or more market researchers interact with the group, they are often being monitored and [[Document|recorded]] by a non-visible group, because not only do coolhunters want to ''hear'' what their subjects have to say, they also want to ''observe'' their simple mannerisms.

Depending on the nature of the study, the methods of the [[information gathering|information-gathering]] during a focus group interview may be extremely broad, with questions relating to lifestyle and youth culture, or more specific, like comparing certain [[brand]]s and determining which brands the group is most responsive to.

Participants in focus groups are usually rewarded for their participation, whether it be a cash amount, free products, or other rewards.

Coolhunters will often seek out individuals from within their target demographic who are regarded as [[leader]]s or trendsetters. They will then hire these individuals to be ''Cool Narcs'', who gather information secretly among their peers and report their findings back to their employers. This is a popular method of coolhunting as it provides insight into their target demographic within their natural environment.

There are a wide variety of methods for conducting market research online. Popular examples are online [[statistical survey|survey]]s where upon completion, the participant will usually receive a prize or monetary compensation. Other times coolhunters will enter [[chatroom]]s and webgroups posing as an individual within the target demographic and gather information.

The '''Cort Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] located at 138 [[48th Street (Manhattan)|West 48th Street]] in the [[Theater District, New York|Theater District]] of [[midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It is owned by the [[Shubert Organization]], the largest owner of Broadway theatres.

The Cort Theatre was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] on November 17, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]. [http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/1987CortTheater.pdf "Cort Theatre Designation Report"] (November 17, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[John Cort (Cort circuit)|John Cort]] (''ca.'' 1861-1929), founder of the Northwestern Theatrical Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Syndicate Denies a Truce, But Opinion Is That a Sort of Agreement Has Been Made with Cort |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/11/03/archives/syndicate-denies-a-truce-but-opinion-is-that-a-sort-of-agreement.html |date=November 3, 1910 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=Dec 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned architect [[Thomas W. Lamb]] to design the theater. Its [[façade]] was modeled on the [[Petit Trianon]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The resulting 1082-seat Cort Theater is one of the few Lamb theaters still extant and functioning as a legitimate theater. The interior was designed in the style of the era of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], with a [[Pavanozza]] [[marble]] lobby with plasterwork panels. The arch of the [[proscenium stage]] consists of perforated plaster treated with art glass, and was designed to be lit during performances. The arch still exists as of 2007, although the lighting feature is no longer in operation.

The Cort Theatre opened on December 20, 1912 with [[Laurette Taylor]] starring in the play ''Peg o' My Heart'', which ran for 603 performances, an auspicious start for the new venue.&lt;ref name=Reeds/&gt; Numerous famous British actors have appeared at the Cort: [[Basil Rathbone]] played Dr. Nicholas Agi in ''The Swan'' in October 1923, and in April 1927 appeared as Vladimir Dubriski in ''Love is Like That''. In October 1924, [[Henry Daniell]] appeared as Aubrey Tanqueray in ''The Second Mrs Tanqueray'', was there again in August 1943 in ''Murder Without Crime'', and in January 1946 appeared as Leontes in ''The Winter's Tale''. This was also the theatre where the aspiring actor James Dean made his broadway debut in 1952 with the play "See The Jaguar".

The [[Shubert Organization]] purchased the theatre in 1927, two years before John Cort's death.&lt;ref name=Reeds&gt;[http://www.reedstickets.net/cort-theater-tickets.html Cort Theater Tickets], Reeds Tickets. Accessed December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was used as a television studio for ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from 1969 to 1972.

==In popular culture==
In the 1968 version of the comedy film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', directed by [[Mel Brooks]], the Cort Theatre was seen in the movie across the street from the Playhouse Theater (torn down in 1969), whose marquee can be glimpsed momentarily and exterior was used only. However, in the scene where the theater blows up, the marquee of the Cort Theater can be seen.

'''Dick van Burik''' (born 29 November 1973) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (football)|central defender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/vereine/1-bundesliga/2006-07/hertha-bsc-29/1685/spieler_dick-van-burik.html | title = van Burik, Dick | language = German | publisher = kicker.de | accessdate = 12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]],  Van Burik played in the [[Eredivisie]] with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[NAC Breda|NAC]] and [[FC Utrecht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nac.nl/108/newsid/7941/Van-Burik-naar-FC-Utrecht.html Van Burik naar FC Utrecht] - NAC {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he would be best known for a 10-year stint with German [[Bundesliga]] outfit [[Hertha BSC]], where he would be a defensive mainstay for a side that participated in five [[UEFA Cup]] editions and the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]] (as a result of a third league place in [[1998–99 Bundesliga|1998–99]], with Van Burik subsequently appearing in ten Champions League contests, as Hertha reached the second group stage).

Van Burik was dismissed by Hertha after the club accused him of playing a role in the departure of teammate [[Jérôme Boateng]], who was a client of van Burik's father and football agent Karel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/home/wegen-van-burik-en-hertha-bsc-scheiden~a00cb2ff/ Wegen Van Burik en Hertha BSC scheiden] - Trouw {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently retired in June 2007.

==Retirement==
He was  assistant manager at [[SC Heerenveen]] from February to June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldfootball.net/spieler_profil/dick-van-burik/ | title = Dick van Burik | publisher = worldfootball.net | accessdate = 12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He runs a football agency with his father and a coating company, VB Coatings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Dick-van-Burik-over-zijn-eerste-miljoen-Ik-onderneem-zoals-ik-voetbalde-159085 Dick van Burik over zijn eerste miljoen: 'Ik onderneem zoals ik voetbalde'] - Quotenet {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">The '''duty of loyalty''' is often called the cardinal principal of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary relationships]], but is particularly strict in the law of [[Equity (law)|trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Restatement of Trusts, Third ed.|date=2003–2008|publisher=American Law Institute|location=Chapter 15|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that context, the term refers to a [[trustee]]'s [[duty]] to administer the [[Trust law|trust]] solely in the interest of the [[beneficiaries]], and following the [[Trust Law|terms of the trust]].   It generally prohibits a trustee from engaging in transactions that might involve [[self-dealing]] or even an appearance of [[conflict of interest]].   Furthermore, it requires a fiduciary to deal with [[Transparency_(behavior)|transparency]] regarding [[Materiality_(law)|material facts]] known to them in interactions with beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Restatement of Trusts, Third ed.|date=2003–2008|publisher=American Law Institute|location=Section 78|pages=93-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{Companies law}}
Duty of loyalty in [[corporation law]] to describe a fiduciaries' "conflicts of interest and requires fiduciaries to put the corporation's interests ahead of their own."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"&gt;''Corporations.'' Fifth Edition. Examples and Explanations. Alan R. Palmiter. ASPEN. New York. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; "Corporate fiduciaries breach their duty of loyalty when they divert corporate assets, opportunities, or information for personal gain."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;

It is generally acceptable if a director makes a decision for the corporation that profits both him and the corporation.  The duty of loyalty is breached when the director puts his or her interest in front of that of the corporation.

==Conditions of self-dealing transaction==
* ''Flagrant Diversion'': corporate official stealing tangible corporate assets - "a plain breach of the fiduciary's duty of loyalty since the diversion was unauthorized and the corporation received no benefit in the transaction."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;
* ''Self-Dealing'': A key player and the corporation are on opposite sides of the transaction or the key player has helped influence the corporation's decisions to enter the transaction. "When a fiduciary enters into a transaction with the corporation on unfair terms, the effect is the same as if he had appropriated the difference between the transaction's fair value and the transaction's price."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;
*''Executive Compensation''
*''Usurping [[Corporate opportunity|Corporate Opportunity]]''
*''Disclosure to Shareholders''
*''Trading on Inside Information''
*''Selling out''
*''Entrenchment''
* The key player's personal financial interest are at least potentially in conflict with the financial interests of the corporation.

==Ways the proponent of a self-dealing transaction can avoid invalidation==
* By showing approval by a majority of disinterested directors

[[File:E-Verify logo.svg|thumb|right|E-Verify logo]]
'''E-Verify''' is a United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) website that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees, both  U.S. or foreign citizens, to work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Introduction to E-Verify | url= https://everifyautomation.wordpress.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-Verify was originally established in 1996 as the Basic Pilot Program to prevent illegal immigrants and other people who have violated immigration laws from obtaining employment illegally in the United States.  In August 2007, DHS started by requiring all federal contractors and vendors to use E-Verify. The Internet-based program is free and maintained by the [[United States government]]. Use of E-Verify at the state level varies; some states have mandated use of E-Verify or similar programs, while others have discouraged the program.{{Citation needed|reason=Vague, seems that facts would be appreciated by most viewers|date=November 2018}}

E-Verify compares information from an employee's [[I-9 (form)|Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9]] to data from U.S. government records. If the information matches, that employee is eligible to work in the United States. If there is a mismatch, E-Verify alerts the employer and the employee is allowed to work while he or she resolves the problem; they must contact the appropriate agency to resolve the mismatch within eight federal government work days from the referral date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 2011-02-06| title= Resolving a tentative nonverify| url=http://www.uscis.gov/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=017bfb41c8596210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=017bfb41c8596210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD| accessdate= 6 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is operated by the DHS in partnership with the [[Social Security Administration]]. According to the DHS website, more than 600,000 employers used E-Verify as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 2016-06-25 | title= What is E-Verify? | url=https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify/what-e-verify | accessdate= 14 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that E-Verify harms the labor market outcomes of undocumented immigrants and improves the labor market outcomes of Mexican legal immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanics, but has no impact on labor market outcomes for non-Hispanic white Americans.&lt;ref name=Orrenius2015/&gt; A 2016 study suggests that E-Verify reduces the number of undocumented immigrants in states that have mandated use of E-Verify for all employers, and further notes that the program may deter illegal immigration to the US in general.&lt;ref name=Orrenius2016/&gt;

==History==
The program was originally established in 1997 as the '''Basic Pilot Program''' along with two other programs created to prevent illegal immigrants from getting jobs.&lt;ref name="DHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartbusinesspractices.com/legal_everifyfaq.php |title=U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-11-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320040612/http://www.smartbusinesspractices.com/legal_everifyfaq.php |archivedate=20 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The others were discontinued.  In the two years since ICE finalized the regulations for electronically storing and/or generating I-9 records there has also been a steady increase in the number of administrative I-9 audits – where employers are asked to deliver their I-9 records to ICE within 72 hours for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICE Releases Guidance on Evaluating Electronic I-9 Systems |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/ice-releases-guidance-evaluating-electronic-i-9-systems|publisher= John Fay|work=LawLogix Group, Inc.|date=2012-10-18|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USCIS Verification Division reported that over 16,000 E-Verify compliance letters were issued in Fiscal Year 2010. Another 13,000 letters and over 26,000 emails were sent to employers in Fiscal Year 2011. Additionally, another 23,000 e-mails were sent in the first half of Fiscal Year 2012, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can E-Verify "Self-Assessment" Help an Employer? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/can-e-verify-self-assessment-help-employer|publisher= LawLogxGroup, Inc.|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-08-02|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
All employers, by law, must complete Form I-9. E-Verify is closely linked to Form I-9, but participation in E-Verify is voluntary for most employers.  After an employee is hired to work for pay, the employee and employer complete Form I-9. After an employee begins work for pay, the employer enters the information from Form I-9 into E-Verify. E-Verify then compares that information against millions of government records and returns a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2010-04-12| title=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Companion to Form I-9| url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=b4059589cdb76210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=b4059589cdb76210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD| accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2007, the program began to include [[facial]] image data to help enhance searches.  The 14 million images kept by federal immigration authorities are being used in the program, and the government is in talks with some states to cross reference with state drivers license records.&lt;ref name="DHS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite news | author=Franklin, Stephen| date=2007-09-25| title=Fighting the flood of phony IDs| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-09-26/news/0709260038_1_illegal-worker-immigration-laws-workers-social-security-numbers|work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="georgia"&gt;{{cite web | author=Casey, Winter| date=2007-08-10| title=Administration announces border, immigration initiatives| url=http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=38136&amp;ref=rellink| publisher=National Journal's Technology Daily| accessdate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], E-Verify was anticipated to "be inaccessible for the duration of the shutdown." Also, "the 'three-day rule' for processing employment eligibility queries in E-Verify is indefinitely suspended pending a resolution of 2013 funding impasse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Binshteyn|first=Nataliya|title=Government Shutdown Prompts E-Verify Closure, Imperils Other Immigration Services|journal=The National Law Review|date=2 October 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/government-shutdown-prompts-e-verify-closure-imperils-other-immigration-services|publisher=[[Greenberg Traurig]], LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
A 2015 study found that E-Verify reduced the average earnings of undocumented immigrants, improved labor market outcomes for male Mexican immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanic men, and had no impact on U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites.&lt;ref name=Orrenius2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orrenius|first=Pia M.|last2=Zavodny|first2=Madeline|date=2015-04-01|title=The impact of E-Verify mandates on labor market outcomes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/soej.12023/abstract|journal=Southern Economic Journal|language=en|volume=81|issue=4|pages=947–959|doi=10.1002/soej.12023|issn=2325-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that E-Verify "reduces the number of less-educated prime-age immigrants from Mexico and Central America—immigrants who are likely to be unauthorized—living in a state. We find evidence that some new migrants are diverted to other states, but also suggestive evidence that some already-present migrants leave the country entirely."&lt;ref name=Orrenius2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orrenius|first=Pia M.|last2=Zavodny|first2=Madeline|date=2016-12-01|title=Do state work eligibility verification laws reduce unauthorized immigration?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40176-016-0053-3|journal=IZA Journal of Migration|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/s40176-016-0053-3|issn=2193-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandated use==

===Federal government===

As of September 2007, most of the federal government did not use the system when hiring employees, but an Office of Management and Budget directive mandates that all federal government agencies sign up to use E-Verify by 1 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2008-05-20| title=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Statement for the Record: E-Verify| url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=bca6fa693660a110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD| accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Security Administration failed to perform required verifications of the Social Security numbers of 19 percent of its own new hires during an 18-month period, according to a January 2010 report from the agency’s inspector general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 2010-01-11| title= SSA fails to E-Verify 19 percent of new hires, IG says| url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2010/01/11/WEB-EVerify-Social-Security-inspector-general.aspx| accessdate= 5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update|date=January 2016}}

===Federal contractors===

As of 8 September 2009, employers with federal contracts or subcontracts that contain the [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] (FAR) E-Verify clause are required to use E-Verify to determine the employment eligibility of 1) Employees performing direct, substantial work under those federal contracts and 2) New hires organization-wide, regardless of whether they are working on a federal contract. A federal contractor or subcontractor who has a contract with the FAR E-Verify clause also has the option to verify the company's entire workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2009-12-18| title=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services E-Verify Fact Sheet| url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD| accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OPT extension for students===

In April 2008, U.S. government extended the duration of post-completion work authorization (the "Optional Practical Training" (OPT))
from 12 months to an additional 24 months, for a total of 36 months of work authorization between the various OPT authorizations granted by USCIS, for certain qualifying students with completed U.S. degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In all circumstances, students are only eligible for this extension if their employer participates in the E-Verify program. If an employer does not participate in E-Verify, students working for those employers are only given 12 months of OPT, and can not get the 24-month extension even if they would otherwise qualify for the extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2012-04-25|title=Questions and Answers: Extension of Optional Practical Training Program for Qualified Students|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=9a3d3dd87aa19110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=68439c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State laws==
There are a number of state laws requiring or limiting the use of E-Verify for employers. According to a 2012 survey by the Center for Immigration Studies, 16 states require use of E-Verify in some form. The survey found that six states have laws requiring all or nearly all businesses to use E-Verify to determine employment eligibility: Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Five states require use of E-Verify by public employers and all or most public contractors: Indiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Missouri. Three states require only public contractors to use E-Verify: Louisiana, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Idaho only requires public employers to use E-Verify, while Florida only requires it for agencies under direction of the governor. Colorado and Utah encourage use of E-Verify, but allow for alternative means of employment verification. An E-Verify-only mandate in Utah is contingent on the state's effort to create a state-level guestworker program. The survey also found that some states have moved in the opposite direction, limiting or discouraging use of E-Verify: California, Rhode Island, and Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Feere, "An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level," July 2012, Center for Immigration Studies. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the-state-level&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of the U.S.]] rejected a suit arguing that [[Arizona]]'s state law, which can cause employers found failing to use E-Verify to lose their state business licenses, was pre-empted by federal law. The ruling effectively confirmed that states may mandate the use of E-Verify.&lt;ref&gt;Kephart, Janice.

===Alabama===
The state of [[Alabama]] passed a law mandating employers to use E-Verify on new hires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/tagblogsfindlawcom2011-freeenterprise-idUS123058502120110610 | work=Reuters | title=Alabama Immigration Law: E-Verify Now Required | date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act" (H.B. 56) was signed into law on 9 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201010647/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm |archivedate=1 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act makes it illegal for any business entity, employer, or public employer to "knowingly employ, hire for employment, or continue to employ" an illegal immigrant to perform work within the state. Effective 1 April 2012, every employer in Alabama must enroll in E-Verify and use the program to check employment authorization. The act creates an incentive for using E-Verify as businesses and subcontractors that enroll in E-Verify are immune from liability for employing an illegal immigrant. The act requires the Alabama Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish and maintain an E-Verify employer service for any employer in the state with 25 or fewer employees that wants assistance. The Alabama DHS will enroll a participating business in E-Verify on its behalf at no cost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Jon Feere, "An Overview of E-Verify Policies on the State Level," Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the-state-level&lt;/ref&gt; This law is applied to businesses both inside and outside Alabama that do business with the state.

===Arizona===
The state of [[Arizona]] requires employers to participate in E-Verify: the ''Legal Arizona Workers Act'' has survived a number of constitutional challenges, up to and including the [[US Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/26/scotus.arizona.law/index.html?hpt=T1|title=High court backs Arizona immigration law that punishes businesses|last=Mears|first=Bill|date=25 May 2011|publisher=CNN|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently in effect. The Legal Arizona Workers Act requires all Arizona employers to use E-Verify with all newly hired employees, effective 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=lawa&gt;{{cite news |title=State's employer sanctions law goes mostly unused |first=Brady |last=McCombs |work=Arizona Daily Star |date=11 December 2008 |url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/border/article_20e72f1a-81bf-5b4b-9af6-3721061c8416.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2008, 5.6 percent of Arizona businesses had signed up with E-Verify.&lt;ref name=lawa/&gt;

As amended, the law prohibits employers from intentionally and/or knowingly hiring illegal immigrants (or a person who employs or contracts with an illegal immigrant) and requires all employers to use E-Verify during the employment process and keep a record of the verification for the duration of the employee's employment or at least three years, whichever is longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azleg.gov/ArizonaRevisedStatutes.asp?Title=23 Arizona Revised Statutes]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional legislation prohibits the state government from entering into a contract with any contractor or subcontractor that fails to use E-Verify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/48leg/2R/laws/0152.htm&amp;Session_ID=86 Format Document]&lt;/ref&gt; According to USCIS, there are 39,191 employers in Arizona using E-Verify at 84,703 hiring sites.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Jon Feere, "An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level," Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the-state-level&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In 2011, California passed an act to prohibit municipalities from mandating use of E-Verify.&lt;ref&gt;http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_1201-1250/ab_1236_bill_20110909_enrolled.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At least 20 municipalities had required use of E-Verify,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Feere, Jon.

=== Colorado ===
Colorado's E-Verify law became effective on 7 August 2006, and was amended on 13 May 2008, (H.B. 06-1343, amended by H.B. 07-1073 and S.B. 08-193). The amendment created the "Department Program" and is offered as an alternative to E-Verify, meaning that E-Verify is not mandated in Colorado. Public contractors must participate in either E-Verify or the Department Program. The state's Department of Labor and Employment is tasked with investigating complaints and can conduct on-site inspections and random audits of state agencies. It has the authority to request and review citizenship documentation of persons performing work on public contracts. Under the "Department Program" public contractors must consent to random audits to assess compliance with the law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251695475820&amp;ssbinary=true;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
On 4 January 2011, Gov. Rick Scott signed an executive order requiring agencies under his direction to use E-Verify. It was superseded on 27 May 2011, with a similar E-Verify order that brought the policy more in line with standard E-Verify practices by requiring verification of new employees rather than both new and existing employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2011/11-116-suspend.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sunshine (State) Surprise - Florida's New E-Verify Requirement|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/sunshine-state-surprise-florida-s-new-e-verify-requirement |publisher= Greenberg Traurig, LLP|work=The National Law Review|date=2011-01-10|accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, all agencies under the direction of the governor have been directed to verify the employment eligibility of all new employees through E-Verify. Agencies not under the direction of the governor are "encouraged" to follow the same guidelines. All agencies under the direction of the governor must expressly require contractors to use E-Verify for all new employees hired by the contractor during the contract term as a condition of all contracts for the provision of goods and services to the state in excess of nominal value. Additionally, subcontractors performing work pursuant to the contract must use E-Verify. Agencies not under the direction of the governor are encouraged to follow these guidelines as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Florida was the second State to join the E-verify RIDE program, which allows employers to view State ID and driver's license photos during the verification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/e-verify-on-the-fritz-likely-due-to-flor-38559/|title=E-Verify on the fritz likely due to Florida going live on the RIDE Program|work=JD Supra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] requires both public and private employers to use E-Verify during the hiring process. In 2006 the state passed the "Georgia Security and Immigration Compliance Act" (S.B. 529), which applied to public employers, contractors, and subcontractors and was followed by a number of amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/fulltext/sb529.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918173026/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/fulltext/sb529.htm |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ga&gt;{{cite news |title=Ga. employers use system to deter illegal workers |first=Mary Lou |last=Pickel |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=19 March 2008 |url=http://www.ajc.com/wireless/content/business/stories/2008/03/18/everify_0319.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the state passed the "[[Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011]]" (H.B. 87), which extends required use of E-Verify to private employers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 July 2007, all public employers in Georgia were required to use E-Verify for all new employees. With additional amendments, the law now requires all public employees to permanently post the employer's federally issued user identification number and date of authorization on the employer's website. If the public employer does not have a website, then the local government is directed to submit the relevant information to the Carl Vinson Institute of Government of the University of Georgia to be posted by the institute on the website created for local government audit and budget reporting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

An official at the state's Department of Labor told the Center for Immigration Studies that funding has not been made available for the auditing process rendering the law largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Feere, "An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level," Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012.

===Idaho===
On 29 May 2009, Gov. Butch Otter signed Executive Order 2009-10, mandating, among other things, that state agencies verify that new employees are eligible for employment under federal and state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.idaho.gov/mediacenter/execorders/eo09/eo_2009_10.html|title=Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter - The State of Idaho|work=idaho.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the order does not specifically reference E-Verify, subsequent internal guidelines resulted in all state agencies using E-Verify to meet the order's requirements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The order came into effect on 1 July 2009.

Public contractors and subcontractors are required to declare to the contracting state agency that they have "substantiated that all employees providing services or involved in any way on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or part by state funds or federal stimulus dollars" are legally authorized to work in the United States. According to an official at the state's Department of Human Resources, public contractors are encouraged, but not required to use E-Verify to meet this requirement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

On 14 July 2013, Idaho joined the E-verify RIDE program, which allows employers to view State ID and driver's license photos during the verification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alipac.us/f12/idaho-joins-e-verify-ride-program-283475/|title=Idaho Joins E-Verify RIDE Program|work=alipac.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois===
Section 12(a) of the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act prohibited [[Illinois]] employers from using E-verify to verify the work authorization of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=With E-Verify, too many errors to expand its use? |work=Christian Science Monitor |first=Alexandra |last=Marks |date=7 July 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0707/p02s01-usgn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Department of Homeland Security sued to prevent the law from taking effect as scheduled on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=dhsil&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice for Illinois Employers about E-Verify |work=United States Department of Homeland Security |date=6 October 2008 |url=https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/programs/gc_1199120920203.shtm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302231944/http://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/programs/gc_1199120920203.shtm |archivedate=2 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2009, agreeing with the federal government, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois ruled that Illinois’ law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause to the U.S. Constitution because it conflicts with the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The case was United States v. Illinois, (No. 07-3261, C.D. Ill., 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= E-Verify again an eligibility verification option for Illinois employers| url= http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/articles/19306/1/E-Verify-again-an-eligibility-verification-option-for-Illinois-employers/Page1.html| accessdate= 26 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, E-Verify is not required in Illinois. In fact, Illinois is the only state that has tried to block the use of E-Verify by private employers. Concerned about inaccuracies in the E-Verify data kept by the federal government as well as ongoing privacy implications for workers, Illinois enacted a law in 2007 that would have prohibited private employers from using E-Verify until the federal government made specific improvements to the system. However, DHS challenged the Illinois law in federal court and eventually won. Thus, the provision of the Illinois law prohibiting employers from using E-Verify was struck down, but the rest of the statute survived. An amended version of the law was enacted in August 2009, and it is that version which went into effect on 1 January 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Under the new law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.martindale.com/labor-employment-law/article_Quarles-Brady-LLP_882158.htm |title=New Illinois E-Verify Law Takes Effect on January 1, 2010: Special Illinois Procedures Required |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amends the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, Illinois employers are required to sign a sworn attestation either upon initial enrollment in E-Verify, or by 31 January 2010 if they are already enrolled in the program. The attestation form affirms that the employer has received the requisite E-Verify training materials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), and that all employees with access to the company’s E-Verify account have completed mandatory online E-Verify tutorials. It further states that the employer has posted the required legal notices regarding its enrollment in E-Verify and certain non-discrimination procedures. The employer must retain the signed original attestation and proof of its employees’ E-Verify training.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Indiana===
On 1 July 2011, Indiana enacted S.B. 590.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/SE/SE0590.1.html|title=Enrolled Act, Senate Bill 0590|work=in.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things, the law requires state agencies and political subdivisions to use E-Verify to determine work authorization status of all employees hired after 30 June 2011. The requirement to use E-Verify also applies to public contractors. The law does not contain any enforcement provisions or any auditing process to determine employer compliance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Louisiana===
On 15 August 2011, two pieces of E-Verify legislation were approved in Louisiana. The first bill, H.B. 342, requires all state and local contractors who seek to do business with Louisiana to use E-Verify. The second bill, H.B. 646, encourages all private businesses to verify the legal status of their new hires by providing employers a safe harbor against sanctions if they use E-Verify or another method for determining worker eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.la.us/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=760867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blr&gt;{{cite web |title=Louisiana Passes E-Verify Bills Covering State Contractors and Private Employers |work=Numbers USA |date=8 July 2011 |url=https://www.numbersusa.com/content/news/july-8-2011/louisiana-passes-e-verify-bills-covering-state-contractors-and-private-employers.ht }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnesota===
On 7 January 2008, then-Governor Tim Pawlenty signed Executive Order 08-01, requiring use of E-Verify for the state's executive branch employees and for some public contracts. Gov. Mark Dayton allowed the order to lapse in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/08/19/budget-deal-brings-everify-back/|title=Budget deal brings E-Verify back, but with a twist|author=Sasha Aslanian|date=19 August 2011|work=publicradio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new E-Verify provision requires use of E-Verify only for some public contracts. It requires state contracts for services in excess of $50,000 to require certification from vendors and subcontractors that they have implemented or are in the process of implementing the E-Verify program for all newly hired employees who will perform work under the contract. It exempts contracts entered into by the State Board of Investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/ss2011/11-3590.htm|title=File not found -  Minnesota House of Representatives|work=state.mn.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mississippi===
The Mississippi Employment Protection Act requires all [[Mississippi]] employers to use E-Verify with new hires.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web |title=Mississippi Requires Use of E-Verify by Employers |work=Business &amp; Legal Reports, Inc. |date=25 March 2008 |url=http://hr.blr.com/news.aspx?id=78130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mepa&gt;{{cite web |title=Mississippi Employment Protection Act (Senate Bill 2988) |work=Mississippi Senate |year=2008 |url=http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2008/html/SB/2900-2999/SB2988SG.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mississippi employers with 250 or more employees must comply with the law as of 1 July 2008.&lt;ref name=mepa/&gt; The law goes into effect for employers with 100 to 249 employees as of 1 July 2009.&lt;ref name=mepa/&gt; Employers with 30 to 99 employees must comply by 1 July 2010.&lt;ref name=mepa/&gt; The law is effective for employers with fewer than 30 employees on 1 July 2011.&lt;ref name=mepa/&gt; As of June 2011, a total of 4,336 employers representing more than 9,000 worksites in Mississippi were using E-Verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=e72badec01a80310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8a2f6d26d17df110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD|title=USCIS and Mississippi Implement New E-Verify Tool to Combat Fraud Fact Sheet|work=USCIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of the law, and its effectiveness, remains a significant problem. An official at the Mississippi Attorney General's office explained to the Center for Immigration Studies that his office is tasked with investigating complaints that the public may file about potential violations of the law. However, when asked how often such complaints are filed, he responded, "Rarely." This is consistent with information from a two-day immigration hearing held at the state capital in 2010. Then, a different spokesperson for the Attorney General's office explained that the office had received no formal complaints. A state representative told the Center for Immigration Studies that because the state law grants authority over E-Verify regulation to multiple state agencies, no agency has taken the lead and enforcement has been nominal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

As of August 2012 Mississippi was the first state to use USCIS's RIDE program as part of its E-Verify efforts (Florida and Idaho have also since joined). On 13 June 2011, in an effort to improve E-Verify's accuracy in Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched the "Records and Information from DMVs for E-Verify" (RIDE) program in the state. The RIDE program compares driver's licenses or other government-issued ID cards against data held by the state's motor vehicle agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=a2dd6d26d17df110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextoid=304cadec01a80310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD|title=USCIS and Mississippi Implement New E-Verify Tool to Combat Fraud|work=USCIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missouri===
On 7 July 2008, Missouri's E-Verify bill (H.R. 1549) was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills081/billpdf/truly/HB1549T.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It became effective on 1 January 2009. The law prohibits businesses from knowingly employing, hiring, or continuing to employ an illegal immigrant to perform work within the state of Missouri. The E-Verify portion of the law does not apply to all businesses, but those businesses that do use E-Verify are provided an affirmative defense that the business has not violated the provisions of the law that prohibit the employment of illegal immigrant. All public employers are required to "actively participate" in E-Verify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Nebraska===
On 8 April 2009, Nebraska's L.B. 403 was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/101/PDF/Slip/LB403.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires use of E-Verify by state agencies (and political subdivisions) and by public contractors starting 1 October 2009. Every contract between a public employer and public contractor must contain a provision requiring the public contractor to use E-Verify for new employees physically performing services within Nebraska. The requirement does not apply to public contracts made prior to the operative date of this act. According to state surveys, use of E-Verify appears to be low.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===North Carolina===
The [[North Carolina]] governor signed H.B. 36 into law on 23 June 2011. All counties and municipalities were required to begin using E-Verify by 1 October 2011. The law also requires private businesses to use E-Verify for new employees, but exempts any "seasonal temporary employee who is employed for 90 or fewer days during a 12-consecutive-month period". Employers with 500 or more employees must be using E-Verify by 1 October 2012; employers with 100 to 499 employees must be using E-Verify by 1 January 2013; and employers with 25 to 99 employees must be using E-Verify by 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H36v8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phase-In Mandatory E-Verify Law Passes in North Carolina  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/phase-mandatory-e-verify-law-passes-north-carolina|publisher=Jennifer G.

===Oklahoma===
The "Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007" (H.B. 1804) was signed into law on 9 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssl.csg.org/dockets/29cycle/29A/2009adocketbills/1929A04ok.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the law requires public contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify (or a third-party program with an equal or higher degree of reliability, should one appear). After 1 July 2008, public employers were prohibited from entering into contracts for the physical performance of services within Oklahoma unless the contractor (and any subcontractor) uses E-Verify to verify the work authorization of all new employees. If an independent contractor, contracting for the physical performance of services in Oklahoma, fails to provide to the contracting entity documentation to verify the independent contractor's employment authorization, the contracting entity is required to withhold state income tax at the top marginal income tax rate as provided under state law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Pennsylvania===
On 5 July 2012, Pennsylvania Governor [[Tom Corbett]] signed "Public Works Employment Verification Act" (S.B. 637). It requires some public works contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify to determine employment eligibility of all new hires. In order to ensure compliance, employers are subject to complaint-based and random audits. The act takes effect 1 January 2013. Under the act, "public work" means "construction, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, and/or repair work other than maintenance work, done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of the funds of a public body" where the estimated cost of the total project is in excess of $25,000 but does not include work performed under a "rehabilitation or manpower training program."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2011&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0637&amp;pn=2347&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation was approved by both houses of the state legislature and aims to ensure that all construction jobs funded by taxpayers employ only documented workers by checking employees’ information against government records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Law Mandates E-Verify for Public Construction Projects in Pennsylvania  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-law-mandates-e-verify-public-construction-projects-pennsylvania |publisher= Greenberg Traurig, LLP|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-07-21|accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhode Island===
In March 2008, Governor [[Donald Carcieri|Carcieri]] issued an executive order requiring executive agencies to use E-Verify; and for all persons and businesses, including grantees, contractors and their subcontractors and vendors to use E-Verify.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riaclu.org/documents/Carcieri_Executive_Order_immigration.pdf; {{cite web| title=State of Rhode Island Division of Purchase – E-Verify Information| url=http://www.purchasing.ri.gov/EVerify.aspx|accessdate=26 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2011, less than 24 hours after his swearing-in, Gov. [[Lincoln Chafee]] rescinded Executive Order 08-01, calling it "an agent of divisiveness, incivility, and distrust among the state's citizens."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.governor.ri.gov/documents/executiveorders/2011/Executive_Order_11-02.pdf; {{cite web| title=Chafee says marriage equality, rescinding E-Verify important to economic growth| url=http://www.pbn.com/Chafee-says-rescinding-e-verify-marriage-equality-important-to-economic-growth,54730|accessdate=4 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defending his move, Gov.

Huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law requires all employers to use E-Verify. The original version of the law gave employers the option of confirming the eligibility of new employees through either E-Verify or by checking the validity of driver's licenses and other identification cards. The 2011 amendment made E-Verify the exclusive method for confirming employment eligibility. South Carolina is said to have one of the nation's most effective E-Verify laws in that the state uses an audit process to ensure businesses are in compliance with the law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

South Carolina conducted approximately 6,000 audits of businesses under the 2008 version of the law. During the first year — 1 July 2009, through 30 June 2010, when the law applied to businesses with 100 or more employees (a total of 2,300 employers) — South Carolina conducted approximately 1,900 audits. The second year, when the law applied to every employer, the state conducted audits of approximately 4,200 businesses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Every public employer must register and participate in "federal work authorization program to verify the employment authorization of all new employees."  See SC Code Section 8-14-20(A).  Public employer must also require public contractors and subcontractors to agree to use e-verify or "to employ only workers who" possess or qualify to obtain a SC drivers license or identification card.  See SC Code Section 8-14-20(B).  The latter requirement applies as follows:  "(1) on and after 1 January 2009, with respect to contractors, subcontractors, or sub-subcontractors of five hundred or more employees; (2) on and after 1 July 2009, with respect to contractors, subcontractors, or sub-subcontractors of one hundred or more employees but less than five hundred employees; and (3) on and after 1 January 2010, with respect to all other contractors, subcontractors, or sub-subcontractors."  See SC Code Section 8-14-20(D).

SC Code Section 41-8-20 requires that "(A) All private employers in South Carolina shall be imputed a South Carolina employment license, which permits a private employer to employ a person in this State. A private employer may not employ a person unless the private employer's South Carolina employment license and any other applicable licenses as defined in Section 41-8-10 are in effect and are not suspended or revoked. A private employer's employment license shall remain in effect provided the private employer complies with the provisions of this chapter.
(B) All private employers who are required by federal law to complete and maintain federal employment eligibility verification forms or documents must register and participate in the E-Verify federal work authorization program, or its successor, to verify the work authorization of every new employee within three business days after employing a new employee. A private employer who does not comply with the requirements of this subsection violates the private employer's licenses.
(C) The South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce shall provide private employers
with technical advice and electronic access to the E-Verify federal work authorization program's website
for the sole purpose of registering and participating in the program.
(D) Private employers shall employ provisionally a new employee until the new employee's work
authorization has been verified pursuant to this section. A private employer shall submit a new
employee's name and information for verification even if the new employee's employment is terminated
less than three business days after becoming employed. If a new employee's work authorization is not
verified by the federal work authorization program, a private employer must not employ, continue to
employ, or reemploy the new employee.
(E) To assist private employers in understanding the requirements of this chapter, the director shall
send written notice of the requirements of this section to all South Carolina employers, and shall publish
the information contained in the notice on its website. Nothing in this section shall create a legal
requirement that any private employer receive actual notice of the requirements of this chapter through
written notice from the director, nor create any legal defense for failure to receive notice.
(F) If a private employer is a contractor, the private employer shall maintain the contact phone numbers
of all subcontractors and sub-subcontractors performing services for the private employer. The private
employer shall provide the contact phone numbers or a contact phone number, as applicable, to the
director pursuant to an audit or investigation within seventy-two hours of the director's request.

===Tennessee===

The Tennessee Lawful Employment Act (HB 1378) was signed into law by Governor [[Bill Haslam]] in June 2011.  Effective January 1, 2017, private employers with 50 or more employees under the same FEIN are required to use the federal E-Verify employment verification process. This applies to employees working in or outside the state of Tennessee.  Private employers with fewer than 50 employees may choose to use E-Verify for newly hired employees or request and maintain documents under the TLEA’s list of authorized identity and employment eligibility documents.  The TLEA covers “non-employees” as well, while not employed directly, are paid directly by the employer for labor or services.  Companies in Tennessee are required to request and maintain copies of certain identity and work authorization documents for non-employees, unless an exception applies (i.e. workers are employed by a separate company). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.tn.gov/workforce/employers/staffing-redirect/hiring-regulations/employment-verification.html "E-Verify Implemented in Tennessee" Time &amp; Pay, January 2012.

===Texas===
On December 3, 2014, Governor [[Rick Perry]] issued Executive Order RP 80, relating to state agencies using the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify System. The order requires all agencies under the direction of the governor to verify the employment eligibility of all current and prospective agency employees through the E-Verify system. It also requires all agencies under the direction of the governor to include, as a condition of all state contracts for services, a requirement that contractors utilize the E-Verify system to determine the eligibility of all persons employed during the contract term to perform duties within Texas and all persons (including subcontractors) assigned by the contractor to perform work pursuant to the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://governor.state.tx.us/news/executive-order/20372/ Office of the Governor Rick Perry - Executive Order RP 80- Relating to state agencies using the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify System]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utah===
The "Private Employer Verification Act" (S.B. 251) was signed into law on 31 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://le.utah.gov/~2010/htmdoc/sbillhtm/sb0251s01.htm S.B. 251 Substitute Bill Documents – 2010 General Session]. Le.utah.gov. Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires all private employers who employ more than 15 or more employees as of 1 July 2010, to use a "status verification system" to verify the employment eligibility of new employees, though it does not mandate use of E-Verify. As an alternative to E-Verify, businesses can use any other federal program the state deems equivalent to E-Verify, including "the [[Social Security Number Verification Service]] or similar online verification process implemented by the United States Social Security Administration." (Note: However, the E-Verify is considered to be more reliable than the mere verification through a Social Security Administration database that the social security number, name of employee, and date of birth all match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://employerschoicescreening.com/news/tip-of-the-month/social-security-verification-vs-e-verify/]&lt;/ref&gt;) The law exempts employers of aliens on H-2A (temporary agricultural) and H-2B (temporary, non-agricultural) visas. An official at the Social Security Administration told the Center for Immigration Studies that the program is not sufficient for determining immigration status.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Virginia===
On 11 April 2010, Virginia's H.B. 737 was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?101+ful+CHAP0633 Bill Tracking - 2010 session &gt; Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, Gov. [[Bob McDonnell|Robert McDonnell]] announced that he would push up the deadline by 18 months to 1 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/21/virginia-to-advance-date-for-e-verify-to-june-1/|title=Virginia to advance date for E-Verify to June 1|work=The Washingtion Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The state's E-Verify policy requires both state agencies and businesses contracting with Virginia to use E-Verify, the result of two pieces of legislation. On 25 March 2011, an E-Verify bill aimed at public contractors was signed into law: H.B. 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.2-4308.2 LIS &gt; Code of Virginia &gt; 2.2-4308.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Effective 1 December 2013, employers with more than an average of 50 employees for the previous 12 months entering into a work or service contract in excess of $50,000 with any state agency must register and participate in E-Verify. Failure to comply with the law results in the employer being debarred from contracting with any state agency for a period up to one year. Such debarment ends upon the employer's registration and participation in E-Verify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Criticism==
As of 2012, "the overall accuracy of E-Verify for employment-authorized workers, as measured by the FNC (Final Nonconfirmations) accuracy rate, was approximately 94 percent.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Verification/E-Verify/E-Verify_Native_Documents/Everify%20Studies/Evaluation%20of%20the%20Accuracy%20of%20EVerify%20Findings.pdf|page x&lt;/ref&gt; However, the margin of error, currently around 8%, is decreasing, as many of the errors came from changing last names after marriage or not informing the government of changes in citizenship status.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As of 2018, 98.88% of E-Verify applicants were approved to work.&lt;ref name="Sanchez2018"&gt;Tatiana Sanchez (Jan 23, 2018) [http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-tns-bc-everify-workers-20180123-story.html E-Verify doesn't prevent many companies from hiring undocumented workers], ChicagoTribune.com, accessed 10 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Calabrese of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] opposes E-Verify, citing concerns that it could expand into an onerous national ID system: "Employers are not police officers, except in this one context where we suddenly want them to be law enforcement agents who are going to police their workforce."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/02/12/the-problem-with-e-verify-the-aclus-chri The Problem with E-Verify]. Reason Magazine (12 February 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Farm Bureau Federation]] opposes E-Verify and stated in July 2011 that it "could have a significant, negative impact on US farm production, threatening the livelihoods of many farmers and ranchers in labor intensive agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercehomelandsecurity.com/story/backgrounder-e-verify/2011-08-03 Backgrounder: E-Verify]. FierceHomelandSecurity (3 August 2011). Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==RIDE Program==
Arizona, Maryland and Wyoming have  joined the federal government's E-Verify program for checking records from motor vehicle departments, a system designed to electronically verify an employee’s driver’s license or ID card used to prove work eligibility. RIDE is an ongoing initiative that links the E-Verify employment eligibility verification system with participating employers that use E-Verify and state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) to help to reduce document and employment eligibility verification fraud in E-Verify.
RIDE allows employers using E-Verify to validate the authenticity of driver’s licenses and state identification cards issued by state DMVs that employees present as identity documents for the Form I-9.The other states in the RIDE program are Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emptrust.com/blog/arizona-maryland-wyoming-e-verify-ride-program-support-in-emptrust-dhs-e-verify-services&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4884">'''Edith Kingdon Gould Martin''' (August 20, 1920 – August 17, 2004) was an American socialite, linguist, actress, and poet.

==Birth==
She was the daughter of [[financier]] [[Kingdon Gould, Sr.]], granddaughter of financier [[George Jay Gould I]], and great-granddaughter of [[Jay Gould]] the robber baron. She appeared as an actress in the 1946 [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s play ''[[Murder on the Nile/Hidden Horizon|Hidden Horizon]]''.

==Poet==
[[Time (magazine)|Time]] writes on December 24, 1934:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Out just in time to make a fine Christmas present for her schoolmates at [[Hewitt School|Miss Hewitt's Classes]] was a thin, blue &amp; white book of Poems by Edith Kingdon Gould, 14, great-granddaughter of Jay Gould. On the day it was published Manhattan newshawks called at the Goulds' Manhattan penthouse, found the butler and Miss Edith, a well-poised girl with bangs and saucer eyes, at home. Said Poet Gould. "I suppose I must get used to this if I am going to be any good with my verse." Thereupon she rattled solemnly: "I have been writing poetry since I was 6. It's funny that I should have loved poetry, isn't it? Most of the girls I know really loathe it. ... I like horseback riding, swimming, and tennis, but I am poor at tennis. ... I like boys all right, but I don't like them my own age. They seem so stupid. ... I think it's very silly of Roosevelt to tax the rich and give it to the unemployed." Miss Gould posed for newscameramen, then ushered her callers to the elevator. "You know," said she "I will get 10 cents for every copy that's sold. Best of her 37 verses. Author Gould likes "When Tomorrow," written on her 14th birthday last August:
*When tomorrow has become today
*I will be one year older, people say.
*When today has joined the endless train
*Of yesterdays that came and went again,
*This past year with its wild desires,
*Hopes unrealized that youth inspires,
*Dreams that became deceptions, rapture, all
*Will have passed far out beyond recall.
*Year that I have lived! Thoughts that were my own!
*Dying in the dead of night, alone.
*Will I, too, sometime have slipped their way
*When tomorrow has become today?" 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Navy==
In October 1942 she joined the [[WAVES]] as an apprentice seaman and trained in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. She graduated as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] from the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] in April 1944. Later she was promoted to a Lieutenant. She spoke five languages.

==Marriage and children==
She married Isaiah Guyman "Guy" Martin, Jr. (1911-2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isaiah G. Martin, Jr. Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=171003561|accessdate=5 August 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=May 13–15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was age 35. He was a Navy lieutenant and a lawyer in [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]]. They married in [[Manhattan]] in October 1946. They had four children: Isaiah Guyman Martin III, Jason Gould Martin, Christopher Kingdon Martin, and Edith Maria Theodosia Burr Martin.

==Death==

She served as a radiowoman in San Diego and later worked in the Office of Naval Intelligence, attaining the rank of lieutenant junior grade.

== History of the ICTI Ethical Toy Program ==

Working conditions in Asian [[toy]] [[factory|factories]] in the 1990s were under intense scrutiny, most notably following the [[Kader Toy Factory Fire]] in [[Bangkok]] ([[Thailand]]), considered the worst industrial factory fire in history,&lt;ref name=WSWS&gt;{{cite news|last1=Symonds|first1=Peter|title=Thai toy factory fire: 10 years after the world’s worst industrial inferno|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2003/05/kade-m16.html|accessdate=16 Apr 2015|work=World Socialist Web Site|date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a toy factory fire in [[Shenzhen]] ([[China]]) in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/world/fire-ravages-a-doll-factory-in-southern-china-killing-81.html|title=Fire Ravages a Doll Factory In Southern China, Killing 81|date=20 November 1993|work=Reuters|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together caused more than 250 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pangelinan|first1=M A|title=Lives Lost to the Overseas Toy Industry: A Call for Action; in: Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review, 16(3), S. 735– 761|date=1994|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction to the tragedy, the Hong Kong Toy Coalition was established and published the "Charter on the Safe Production of Toys"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Pearson|author2=Gill Seyfang|author3=Rhys Jenkins|title=Corporate Responsibility and Labour Rights: Codes of Conduct in the Global Economy|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-1-1365-6890-9|page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 1990s. In this charter, the Hong Kong Toy Coalition demanded the improvement of labor, social, and safety standards in Chinese [[toy]] [[factory|factories]].

Following the production of the charter, larger toy brands and retailers started to create their own [[Code of Conduct|Codes of Conduct]]. [[Hasbro]] established its “Global Business Ethics Principles” in 1993, [[Zapf Creation]] a [[code of conduct]] in 1995, [[The Walt Disney Corporation]] its “International Labor Standards” in 1996, [[Mattel]] its “Global Manufacturing Principles” 1997, and [[LEGO]] created a [[code of conduct]] in 1997. It is estimated that there were up to 70 different standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biedermann | first = Reinhard | title = Sozialstandards durch private governance Zwei-Stufen-Kooperation in der globalen Spielzeugbranche | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-8452-0126-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made it difficult for toy factories to comply with varying standards and created significant amounts of duplication of [[audit]]ing in [[factory|factories]]. Therefore, an industry wide ethical manufacturing standard was called for in the toy industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) created the Code of Business Practices in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Likosky|first1=Michael|title=Transnational Legal Processes: Globalisation and Power Disparities|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-4069-4674-4|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 at the annual general meeting of ICTI, the member toy industry associations unanimously agreed to launch the ICTI CARE Process, a worldwide [[audit]]ing process to implement the ICTI Code of Business Practices, drive convergence, and reduce duplication of social [[audit]]ing in the global [[toy]] industry [[supply chain]].

In 2004, the ICTI CARE Foundation was created as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisation]] working completely independently of ICTI to oversee the ICTI CARE Process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Byrne | first = Christopher | title = They came to play : 100 years of the Toy Industry Association | publisher = Toy Industry Association | location = United States |pages=77| year = 2016 | isbn = 978-0-692-61707-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the organization became the ICTI Ethical Toy Program. Along with a new name, the next generation of the Ethical Toy Program was unveiled with an updated mission and strategy for the organization, a new membership model and a brand-new look and feel to deliver the changes.

== Ethical Toy Program Certification Program ==

Ethical Toy Program is the ethical [[manufacturing]] program specifically designed for the [[toy]] industry based on the ICTI Code of Business Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ICTI Code of Business Practices ===

The ICTI Code of Business Practices, upon which the Ethical Toy Program is based, covers nine core principals:
* [[Working time|Working hours]] must not be excessive &amp; [[overtime]] must be voluntary
* Legal and fair pay
* No [[child labor]]
* No [[Contemporary slavery|forced or involuntary labor]]
* No [[discrimination]]
* [[Employment|Employees]] must be treated with [[dignity]] and [[respect]]
* [[Employment|Employees']] [[Freedom of association|right of association]] must be observed 
* Individual written labor [[contract]]s must be provided 
* [[Occupational safety and health|Working conditions are safe]] and [[Employment|employee]] health is not endangered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification ===

When a [[factory]] is awarded a Seal of [[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] by the Ethical Toy Program this denotes their adherence to the Ethical Toy Program. The Ethical Toy Program offers Seals of Compliance from Class A to C depending on the maximum number of [[working time|hours worked]].

==Origins==
FIN 46 was an interpretation of ARB 51, an accounting principle issued in August 1959 defining the situations where [[Consolidation_(business)|Consolidated Financial Statements]] must be prepared.&lt;ref name=ARB51&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1175820901468&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf |title=ARB 51: Consolidated Financial Statements.  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 1959 |website= |publisher=FASB |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whenever a company has a controlling financial interest in another entity it must consolidate the assets and liabilities of the other entity - that is, it must add the assets and liabilities of the other entity to its own, canceling any intercompany interests. The traditional ARB 51 approach assumed that equity - usually common stock - would receive the residual economic interest generated by a business, which is why ARB 51 focuses on equity-based majority voting interests.  The traditional criterion for a controlling financial interest under ARB 51 is a majority voting interest.  In the 1980s and 1990s it became common for companies to control assets in certain businesses without maintaining a majority voting interest in those businesses.  This was more often done with securitizations rather than traditional limited liability corporations, because the securitization's common stock or other voting interests could be paid defined, limited amounts and all other cash flows could be directed to other securityholders.  Until FIN 46 was implemented, this enabled companies to avoid consolidation, which permitted them to keep the liabilities and losses of their controlled [[special purpose entity|special purpose entities]] off of their financial statements. In such cases, consolidation based on equity did not serve the purpose of effective reporting because it does not reflect the true nature of relationships among entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gbr.pepperdine.edu/2010/08/special-purpose-entities/ |title=Special Purpose Entities; Throwing the baby out with the bathwater? |last1=Crawford |first1=Peggy J. |last2=Fredericks |first2=Edward H. |date=2003 |website=Graziadio Business Review Volume 6 Issue 2 |publisher=[[Pepperdine University]] |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VIEs and Deconsolidation==
FIN 46 closed this loophole by defining tests to identify a controlling financial interest beyond formal equity ownership and voting rights.  This is important in cases where the legal equity is insignificant or at least somewhat irrelevant from the viewpoint of risk/rewards.  The new rules emphasize the substance of relationships among entities, rather than emphasizing the form of relationships among entities (such as a majority voting interest), which can be more easily manipulated. 

Under FIN 46, the first step is to determine if a company has a variable interest in another entity.  In general terms, a variable interest is an interest in an entity that increases and decreases in value (i.e., is variable) according to increases and decreases in the expected cash flows from the entity's assets and liabilities.  Once a variable interest is established, the second step is to determine who is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity (or "VIE").  The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that holds the majority of the risks and rewards associated with the VIE.  Once a primary beneficiary is identified, it is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and must consolidate the VIE onto its financial statements, whether or not it holds a majority voting interest.

When FASB first began working on FIN 46, it focused on [[special purpose entity|special purpose entities]] such as the entities Enron used.  FASB then recognized that the principles of FIN 46 should apply to all entities where a variable interest exists, so the final interpretation was broader than the original objective. Also, in a securitization, if a party selling assets to a VIE maintains an ongoing involvement with those assets (for example as a swap counterparty to the VIE with respect to asset cashflows) then [[Financial Accounting Standards Board|Financial Accounting Standard]] 140 ([[FAS 140]]), which deals with de-recognition of assets upon transfer to a special purpose entity, will also be relevant.

==Replacement==
FIN 46 was revised by '''FIN 46R''' in December 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1175801627792&amp;acceptedDisclaimer=true |title=FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities; an interpretation of ARB No. 51 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2003 |website=www.accountingweb.com |publisher=FASB |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, among other things, defined in more detail the calculation of an entity’s economic risks and rewards, which party must consolidate a variable interest entity, and when a consolidation or deconsolidation should be reconsidered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/Acct592/CourseMaterials/Lecture%20Notes/V%20I%20E%20s/KPMG%20Defining%20Issues%20on%20Fin%2046%20revision%20DI%2003_28.pdf |title=Defining Issues No. 03-28 FASB Completes Revisions to VIE Accounting |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2003 |website=www.webpages.uidaho.edu |publisher=[[KPMG]] LLP |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FIN 46R was then replaced by a new accounting standard, FASB Statement 167, in June 2009 in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007-08]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/publication/vwluassetsdld/hottopic_bb1784_consolidation_12june2009/$file/hottopic_bb1784_consolidation_12june2009.pdf |title=FASB issues Statement 167, amendments to FIN 46(R) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 June 2009 |website=www.ey.com |publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]] |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board''' ('''FASAB''') is a United States federal advisory committee whose mission is to improve federal financial reporting through issuing federal financial accounting standards and providing guidance after considering the needs of external and internal users of federal financial information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fasab.gov/mission-objectives/|title=Mission|website=fasab.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; FASAB is designated as the body that sets [[U.S. generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) for the United States Government and its component entities, referred to as federal financial reporting entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fasab.gov/the-history-of-fasab/#designation|title=History of FASAB|website=fasab.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AICPA]] Council designated FASAB as the body that establishes GAAP for federal entities in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/CodeofConduct/DownloadableDocuments/2014December15ContentAsof2016August31CodeofConduct.pdf section 
1.320.020 paragraph .03&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]] required annual, audited financial statements for the United States Government and its federal reporting entities. In order to apply the statutes of the CFO Act of 1990, the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], the Director of the [[United States Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), and the [[Comptroller General of the United States|Comptroller General]] established FASAB to develop the "applicable accounting principles" for the newly required financial statements.

FASAB issues the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS), Interpretations, Technical Bulletins, Technical Releases, and Staff Implementation Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://files.fasab.gov/pdffiles/handbook_foreword.pdf|title=FASAB Handbook of Federal Accounting Standards and Other Pronouncements|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; FASAB standards are publicly available on its website--both by chapter and in the FASAB Handbook, which is updated annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fasab.gov/accounting-standards/|title=Standards &amp; Guidance|website=fasab.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Sigman''' is the founder, CEO and –jointly with his wife, Biochemist Silvia Gold— the only shareholder of [[Grupo Insud]], a business conglomerate with an active presence in the fields of pharmaceuticals, agroforestry, culture, nature and design.

==Biographical data and experience==

Hugo Sigman was born in Buenos Aires, [[Argentina]], in 1944. He completed his primary and secondary schooling in public schools.
In 1969, he earned his Medical Doctor degree from [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]], and in the same year, he graduated from the Social Psychology School led by [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière|Dr. Pichon Riviére]].

In 1970, he joined as Resident the Psychiatry Service of Policlínico Lanús, directed by Professor Mauricio Goldenberg. He continued his career, first as Chief of Residents, and then as founder and director of the Psychiatric Emergency Unit at the same hospital. In 1976, he moved to [[Spain]], where he worked at the Psychiatry Service of Hospital Clínico de Barcelona.

At that time, encouraged by his father-in-law Roberto Gold, Hugo Sigman started his entrepreneurial career and got involved in the pharmaceutical industry.
In 1978, with his wife, Silvia Gold –his partner in love and work for 45 years-, he founded Chemo, a chemical-pharmaceutical company, and the first company of Grupo Insud.
Their goal was to create a company to produce high-quality medicines at affordable prices.
In the 1980s, Hugo and Silvia returned to Argentina to continue the path they had started in Europe.

==Life Sciences==

At present, Grupo Insud comprises three companies in the life sciences industry: Chemo, a company that sells active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished dosage forms (FDFs) to 1,200 pharmaceutical companies around the world, has 15 manufacturing sites and 9 R&amp;D centers; Exeltis, a company that sells branded products in more than 40 countries, and mAbxience, a biotech company created in 2008, with 3 manufacturing sites, the first monoclonal antibody plant in Latin America –pharmADN- and the first vaccine and biotech production plant in Argentina, Sinergium Biotech.

Chemo signed an agreement with the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Utrecht University]] to produce the Palivizumab [[monoclonal antibody]] and facilitate access to this medicine for premature children, as it is estimated that 250,000 premature children die every year around the world without treatment due to its high cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uu.nl/cooperation-between-utrecht-university-and-who-for-affordable-medicines-in-developing-countries/ Utrecht University. Cooperation for affordable medicines in developing countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jointly with renowned Argentine companies, in 2011 Hugo Sigman founded the Argentine Chamber of Biotechnology, Cámara Argentina de Biotecnología, which he currently chairs. The goal of CAB is to strengthen the public-private collaboration policy in biotechnology and encourage its development in the region.
In Argentina’s veterinary industry, he is a partner of Biogénesis Bagó, which runs a world-class facility for foot-and-mouth disease vaccine production, the only one that has been authorized by the government of China to build a plant in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201310/35611-la-planta-de-biogenesis-bago-en-china-sera-la-primera-firma-extranjera-dedicada-a-producir-vacunas-en-china.html Primera firma extranjera dedicada a producir vacunas en china]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 20 years, Hugo and Silvia have led the Public-Private Consortium for Research and Development of Innovative Oncology Therapies, which developed the first therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer, [[Racotumomab]] (Vaxira),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacciavillano | first1 = W | last2 = Sampor | first2 = C | last3 = Venier | first3 = C | last4 = Gabri | first4 = MR | last5 = de Dávila | first5 = MT | last6 = Galluzzo | first6 = ML | last7 = Guthmann | first7 = MD | last8 = Fainboim | first8 = L | last9 = Alonso | first9 = DF | last10 = Chantada | first10 = GL | date = Jul 2015 | title = A phase I study of the anti-idiotype vaccine racotumomab in neuroblastoma and other pediatric refractory malignancies | url = | journal = Pediatr Blood Cancer | volume =  62| issue = | pages =  2120–4| doi = 10.1002/pbc.25631 | pmid = 26154941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reichert | first1 = JM | year = 2015 | title = Antibodies to watch in 2015 | journal = MAbs. | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.4161/19420862.2015.988944 | pmid = 25484055 | pmc=4622967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernández | first1 = AM | last2 = Vázquez | first2 = AM | date = Jan 2015 | title = Racotumomab-alum vaccine for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer | url = | journal = Expert Rev Vaccines | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 9–20 | doi = 10.1586/14760584.2015.984691 | pmid = 25420897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gajdosik | first1 = Z | date = Apr 2014 | title = Racotumomab - a novel anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccine for the treatment of cancer | url = | journal = Drugs Today (Barc). | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 301–7 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2014.50.4.2116670 | pmid = 24918647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 2013, and which currently has five new products in research.

In this framework, Hugo Sigman strongly supports public-private partnerships, which he views as a positive paradigm to be promoted with ethics and transparency. He understands that public research centers should give back to society by contributing their knowledge and developments, and the private sector should recognize that contribution by compensating them accordingly. Inspired in that model, he has built partnerships with prestigious institutions including Universidad de Buenos Aires, [[Universidad Nacional de Quilmes]], [[Universidad Nacional de San Martín]], Roffo and [[Garrahan]] Hospitals, [[:es:Academia Nacional de Medicina (Argentina)|Academia Nacional de Medicina]], and several foreign universities.

Approximately 250 researchers work at the partnerships supported by the Group, doing basic and applied research; 100 of them are dedicated to the development of products for treating cancer.

==Agribusiness==

His entrepreneurial spirit and interest in biology have led Hugo Sigman beyond the frontiers of the pharmaceutical industry. In 1998, he started agricultural and forestry activities in different locations of Argentina, focused on genetic improvement and sustainable production, with companies Garruchos, devoted to farming and cattle-raising; Pomera, ranked as the top Argentine-capital forestry company; and Cabaña Los Murmullos, a leading cattle breeding ranch.
Sigman is also a shareholder of Bioceres, an Argentine [[biotechnology]] company focused on agricultural production. This young company developed a gene that enables the production of wheat, corn and soybean resistant to draughts and soil salinity, and has licensed its products to the USA, France and India.

==Communication and Art==

Hugo Sigman encourages the exchange of ideas through publishing company Capital intellectual, which includes a line of publications in Spain under the publishing brand Clave Intellectual, the Southern Cone edition of Le Monde Diplomatique, and the Latin American version of prestigious The New York Review of Books.
In 2005, Hugo Sigman partnered with [[Oscar Kramer]] and established filmmaking company Kramer&amp;Sigman Films (K&amp;S), which has grown to be a thriving production company, with several box-office successes, including ''[[Kamchatka (film)|Kamchatka]]'', ''[[El perro]]'', ''The Last Elvis'', ''Seventh Floor'', ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/satirical-wild-tales-stands-out-among-oscars-foreign-language-nominees/2015/02/25/37cdfdc4-b880-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html Satirical ‘Wild Tales’ stands out among Oscar’s foreign language nominees] [[Washington Post]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wild tales===

Produced by Hugo Sigman for Kramer&amp; Sigman Films and by [[El Deseo]] ([[Pedro Almodóvar]] and [[Agustín Almodóvar]] ’s production company), ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (Relatos Salvajes) was directed by [[Damián Szifron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/s/ap-interview-damian-szifron-lives-own-wild-tale-234109186.html |title=Damian Szifron lives his own wild tale |author=Sigal Ratner-Arias |date=January 16, 2015 |publisher=[[Associasted Press|AP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Ricardo Darín]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://varietylatino.com/video/relatos-salvajes-entrevista-ricardo-darin-cannes-video/ Interview with Ricardo Darin, Variety Latino]&lt;/ref&gt; Julieta Zylberberg, Rita Cortese; [[Darío Grandinetti]]; [[Érica Rivas]]; [[Oscar Martínez (actor)|Oscar Martínez]] and [[Leonardo Sbaraglia]]. Co-produced by Telefé and Corner, and distributed by Warner Bros.

An art and culture enthusiast, between 2010 and 2013, Hugo Sigman was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[National Fine Arts Museum of
Argentina]], and is currently a member of the Board of Patronage of [[Museo Reina Sofía]], in Madrid, Spain. Additionally, the venue of Grupo INSUD in Buenos Aires (the traditional Díaz Vélez Palace), built in 1907 and recently restored, has won several architectural awards and has been declared a protected heritage site of Buenos Aires City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socearq.org/2.0/2015/03/26/visita-al-edificio-insud-nueva-sede-coorporativa/, Sociedad Central de Arquitectos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Responsibility: Mundo Sano Foundation==

Hugo and Silvia have always had a strong commitment to give back to society. This social responsibility is infused in their work with the Mundo Sano Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29343210 Chagas disease - inheriting a silent killer] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina, Spain and Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundosano.org/en/press-communications/from-salta-to-ethiopia-mundo-sano-replicates-its-original-work-in-the-fight-against-soil-transmitted-helminths/ From Salta to Ethiopia: Mundo Sano replicates its original work in the fight against soil-transmitted helminths]&lt;/ref&gt; with the vision to transform the reality of populations affected by [[neglected tropical diseases]] (NTDs) including [[Chagas disease|Chagas]], [[dengue]] and [[soil-transmitted helminths]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/04/Global-Partners-Are-Taking-the-Neglect-out-of-Neglected-Tropical-Diseases Global Partners Are Taking the "Neglect" out of "Neglected Tropical Diseases"] [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Håkan Lennart Jeppsson''' (born 6 May 1961) is a Swedish [[businessman]] who is currently the chairman of the Swedish [[Association football]] club [[Malmö FF]], a post he has held since 2010. Jeppsson received his education at [[Lund University]] and works as [[CEO]] for Inwido.&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Styrelse/Hakan%20Jeppsson.aspx|title= Håkan Jeppsson|accessdate= 25 June 2012|work= mff.se|publisher= Malmö FF|language= Swedish|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310080149/http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Styrelse/Hakan%20Jeppsson.aspx|archivedate= 10 March 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Sport career===
In his younger years Jeppsson played football at Malmö FF simultaneously as he played [[table tennis]] at IK Pallas. After a couple of years being active in both sports he decided to quit football in favour of becoming a professional table tennis player. Jeppsson had his active career at the same time as Sweden was dominating the table tennis world in the 1970s and the 1980s. After growing tired of the life as a professional player he decided to focus on a civil career and started studying international economy at [[Lund University]].&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;

===Civil career===
After graduating he worked his way up to higher positions. Jeppsson was the president of Papyrus AB from 1999 to 2002. He later went on to become the president and CEO of BE group. Jeppsson has been the president and CEO of Inwido since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inwido.se/sv/content/styrelsen |title=Styrelsen |accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=inwido.se |publisher=Inwido |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329220102/http://www.inwido.se/sv/content/styrelsen |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairman of Malmö FF===
Jeppsson was elected a board member of Malmö FF in 2004. Eventually he was elected vice chairman under [[Bengt Madsen]]. In 2010 when Madsen decided not to stand for re-election Jeppsson was the only candidate to succeed him and did so on 18 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/hakan-jeppsson-tar-over-mff/|title= Håkan Jeppsson tar över MFF|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=sydsvenskan.se|publisher= Sydsvenskan|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first year as chairman and the same year as the club's centennial anniversary Malmö FF won its 16th [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championship]].

Malmö FF had completed the move from former home stadium [[Malmö Stadion]] to [[Swedbank Stadion]] a year before Jeppsson's presidency began. The new stadium created both financial opportunities as well as certain risks for the club. These risks became apparent when the club announced that the loss for the [[2010 Malmö FF season|2010 season]] was 30 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/mffs-pelle-svensson-avgar/|title= MFF:s Pelle Svensson avgår|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=sydsvenskan.se|publisher= Sydsvenskan|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the club sacked its current managing director and Jeppsson announced that there would be several austerity measures to turn the result back to positive. As part of the plan Malmö FF increased their share in Swedbank Stadion to 75% to reduce costs and increase profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff-utokar-agandet-i-stadion|title= MFF utökar ägandet i stadion|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=sydsvenskan.se|publisher= Sydsvenskan|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnPaterson.jpg|thumb|right|John ("Jock") Paterson, businessman and influential politician.]]

'''John ("Jock") Paterson''' (1822 – 1880) was a prominent politician and successful businessman of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], and had a great influence on the development of [[Port Elizabeth]] where he was based. He ran newspapers, established the [[Grey High School|Grey Institute]] and played a significant role in founding South Africa's [[Standard Bank (historic)|Standard Bank]]. As a politician he was somewhat less successful, playing a role in the failed separatist movement for a [[Eastern Cape Separatist League|British ruled Eastern Cape]] in the 1870s and backing [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Carnarvon]]’s ill-fated confederation plan.

== Early life and business ventures ==

Born and raised in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], Paterson studied at Marischal university college and emigrated to [[Port Elizabeth]] in 1841 to take up a position as a school master. Later he successfully persuaded [[Sir George Grey]], then the [[Governor of the Cape Colony]], to take an interest in his proposals for new boys schools and Grey made land and funding available to Paterson for their founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greyhighschool.com/index.php/Our-School/History-of-Grey/|title=History of Grey Highschool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911095229/http://www.greyhighschool.com/index.php/Our-School/History-of-Grey/|archivedate=11 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a notoriously volatile temperament. On 7 May 1845, he secretly started his first business, the ''[[Eastern Province Herald]]'' newspaper, with his partner John R. Phillip as the official owner. As he was still contracted by the state this was an illegal activity so his involvement remained clandestine. After the two men fought, Paterson stopped publication in 1850 and started a new newspaper, the ''[[Eastern Province News]]'' which he soon renamed to the original name in 1854. He later sold the newspaper in 1857 to his friend [[Robert Godlonton]] who owned the ''[[Grahamstown Journal]]'', though he continued to use the paper as a platform for his opinions. Philip meanwhile had opened the competing ''[[Port Elizabeth Mercury]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstide.co.za/content.asp?PageID=422|title=History of the Eastern Cape Herald Newspaper and John Paterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson was however already a successful businessman. He had made a series of property investments on the outskirts of the expanding town of Port Elizabeth, and a range of other business enterprises. He also briefly served as the Consular Agent for the United States in Port Elizabeth, and gained much American business for his trading firm though this. 
He had a lifelong interest in boys schools, and founded several in his life, including [[Grey High School]], an elite school for boys in [[Port Elizabeth]] that he founded in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonpad.com/2009/06/the-worlds-top-10-banks/|title=The Worlds Top Banks. Standard Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

Paterson's temperament led him to be intensely drawn to politics, from relatively early on. His early activity involved lobbying for increased European immigration, and the widespread anti-convict agitation of 1849.

=== First Parliamentary term and Eastern Cape separatism (1854-1858)===
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
In 1854 he was elected to the first Cape Parliament as one of the two members for [[Port Elizabeth]] (together with [[Henry Fancourt White]]). From the beginning of his political career he made the secession of the eastern part of the Cape Colony a priority. He felt very strongly that the [[Xhosa people]] of the eastern Cape frontier were a severe threat to the colonists' safety and that this threat was not helped by the Cape government's relaxed attitude to the frontier.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 1:pp 142, 227 }} The Cape Town parliament at the time was also dominated by liberals such as [[Saul Solomon]] who prevented the settlers of the eastern Cape from cheaply exploiting African labour. Deprived of cheap African labour, Paterson then moved a resolution to import indentured "coolie labour" from Asia to work the farms instead, but the government blocked that motion too.
Altogether, Paterson felt that the distant and overly-tolerant Cape government was "...the root of all the troubles with the kaffirs...".{{sfn|Walker|1929|p=381}}

His proposed solution was a view which he held for the remainder of his life - that the white eastern Cape deserved a greater degree of separation, or to become the seat of the Cape's parliament and government. In this, he differed from the radical members of the "separatist league", who were based further east in Grahamstown, were led by [[Robert Godlonton]], and who proposed absolute and immediate separation. He also angered Godlonton's Grahamstown clique by his blocking of their Kowie harbour proposal, which he saw as potentially taking shipping activity away from Port Elizabeth. The separatist movement began a gradual decline due to a growing fear in the Midlands around Port Elizabeth and Graaff-Reinett that if they attained separation then they would fall under the domination of Grahamstown.

He resigned from politics in 1858 due to his wife's fatal illness.

=== Business interlude (1859-1873)===
In 1859 he made a business trip to Britain where he had a great deal of family and business connections, and he even made a bid for a seat in the British parliament, which he eventually decided against.

In 1862 he founded [[Standard Bank]], now one of the largest banks in southern Africa. However he later suffered several business failures and declared bankruptcy in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/14929/5/005_p040-049.pdf|title=Standard Bank. History}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the Cape attained self-rule (or "[[responsible government]]" as it was known) and an economic boom ensued as the new locally elected government began vast infrastructure projects across the country. Paterson, financially uplifted by the economic boom, re-entered politics.

=== Return to Parliament (1872-1877) ===

==== Separatist League (1872-1874)====
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
Paterson was elected to the Cape Parliament again in 1873. The enormous growth in the economy was fueling a competition between the ports Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, for the expanding inland trade. Paterson therefore returned to his fight for a moderate form of separation - so as to avoid dominance by either Cape Town to the west, or Grahamstown to the east. 
In other developments, he put forward bills for a local government system, and for a division of public money according to customs and land revenue, but both bills were defeated.

Paterson and his political ally [[John Gordon Sprigg]] comprised the core of the opposition to the first Cape government, together with the renegade independent [[John X. Merriman]] (who soon joined the government). Paterson's strongest critic was the liberal [[Saul Solomon]], who ridiculed Paterson's ideas.

Paterson's role in the "[[Eastern Cape Separatist League]]" also brought him into a direct showdown with the strong-willed Prime Minister of the Cape, [[John Molteno]] – a firm proponent of regional and racial unity in the Cape{{sfn|Molteno|1900|p=214}} – who reacted in May 1874 by passing the [[Seven Circles Act]]. This re-drew the borders of the Cape’s subdivisions, abolishing the last legal remnants of the East/West distinction. Together with Molteno's policy of drawing ministers from the Eastern Cape into his government, and the general rising prosperity of the whole country, this effectively crushed the separatist movement. Paterson fought the Bill bitterly, but nonetheless kept his seat in parliament as a member of the opposition once it was passed.{{sfn|Walker|1929|pp=488}} He went on to become the primary critic of the Molteno Ministry over the following years, even when the official head of the opposition [[John X. Merriman]] joined Molteno's unity government.

Not always popular, Paterson's views, and especially the way in which he delivered them, often provoked considerable hostility in parliament.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 2:p 125}} This all too frequently left him isolated and unable to do more than temporarily obstruct government projects.{{sfn|Henry|Siepmann|1963|p=}}

==== Enforcement of Confederation (1874-1877)====

Starting in 1874, the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], having recently federated Canada, began a project to impose the very same system of [[confederation]] on the very different states of southern Africa. This was to consolidate European control of southern Africa and bring about a united policy towards the Black African inhabitants. Lord Carnarvon also expressed an interest in making Paterson the next Cape Prime Minister, in order to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrated History of South Africa''. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}. p.182, ''"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun"''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.75|[[John Molteno]], Cape Prime Minister and Paterson's lifelong political opponent.]]

There was little local enthusiasm for the project, and its timing was particularly unfortunate – coming when the various southern African states were still simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion. However Carnarvon was determined, and appointed [[Henry Bartle Frere]] – an autocratic imperialist with little experience of southern African politics – as governor, with instructions to implement Carnarvon's confederation. [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] turned the confederation idea down flat, saying it was impractical and badly timed, but Paterson saw an opportunity to ensure that his eastern province gained autonomy (albeit within the proposed confederation), and that he himself could win the position of leading it. In a series of letters between him and Carnarvon (''The Confederation Despatch'', 1876), Paterson discreetly offered the [[British Colonial Office]] his support against the Molteno government in exchange for vague promises of a future leadership position. Paterson also made a public call for a British invasion and annexation of the [[Transvaal Republic]], for the future confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofsafrica01theauoft/historyofsafrica01theauoft_djvu.txt|title=The History of South Africa from 1795 to 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Molteno, by now furious with Paterson for what he saw as a betrayal of the Cape's independence and democracy, made it clear that he was willing to resign but not to endorse confederation, Frere used the authority of the British Colonial Office to suspend the elected Cape government and assumed direct control in 1878 (appointing [[Gordon Sprigg]] as his puppet Prime Minister, instead of Paterson who was at the time considered too divisive a politician for the job). Paterson, disappointed, then travelled to London as a representative of the potential new Eastern Province, while Frere launched his [[Anglo-Zulu war|invasion of Zululand]] in 1879 before being recalled to London to face charges of misconduct.

The confederation scheme was dropped, having by now spawned a trail of wars across southern Africa – including new frontier wars against the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa]] and the [[Pedi people]], the [[Anglo-Zulu war]], the [[Basuto Gun War]] and later the [[First Boer War]].

== Death ==
[[File:Paterson lectures Observer 1878.jpg|thumb|right|Paterson's "pedagogic" approach is alluded to in this 1878 cartoon by the [[The Observer (Cape newspaper)|Port Elizabeth Observer]] (a newspaper that supported him). Paterson is shown lecturing the MPs of parliament on budgeting and finance.]]
Paterson died suspiciously on his way back to the Cape in May 1880 in a bizarre double-shipwreck. He initially twice delayed his departure, missing ships, before he boarded the ship the Union R.M.S. ''American''. The ''American'' was then dramatically wrecked off West Africa, when its propeller-shaft snapped, bent and tore open part of the ship's plating. The passengers evacuated the ship in an ordered way before it sank but, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, the lifeboats became separated. The passengers were all later found and rescued. However, Paterson's lifeboat was separately picked up by the ''Senegal'' which then ran aground on the coast of Grand Canary Island. In the chaos following this second shipwreck, Paterson was reported to have been struck by a hard object (reportedly the ship's propeller) and killed. He was the only casualty from the two shipwrecks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 2:p 124}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pe.org.za/historicalfacts.html|title=Historical Facts|website=www.pe.org.za|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://molegenealogy.blogspot.com/2010/05/shipwreck-reports-for-family-history.html|title=Shipwrecks. The Paterson family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon news of Paterson's death, flags across the Cape were flown at half mast. His obituary in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'', while acknowledging the political controversy and hostility he sometimes caused, paid tribute to his zeal for what he believed to be right, and to his enormous achievements. The village of [[Paterson, Eastern Cape|Paterson]] in the [[Eastern Cape]], South Africa was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.org.za/tour-sa-addo-elephants.html|title=Paterson, Eastern Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Stanley Little commented on Paterson's death and political style in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leaders. 
{{Quote
|text= He never attained to the position to which his ambition led him to aspire, but lost his life, in a sad manner, on his voyage out to the Cape. The American, in which vessel he took his passage, sustained shipwreck, but he escaped in the Senegal, which ship grounded a few days afterwards, and Mr Paterson went to the bottom. He represented Port Elizabeth in the Assembly, and was for some time the leader of the Opposition. He was an able man, but some severe things were said about him, which on the wholesome principle ''de mortuis nil nisi bonum'', I shall not repeat. He was a firm Confederationist, and took the Eastern view of matters in the East versus West controversy. He could speak well, and would have been worth listening to, had it not been for a certain ugly mannerism. His delivery too, was dry and cold, and very trying, and he had moreover, been unsuccessful in his efforts to cure himself of the sing-song tin-kettle brogue of the bourgeoisie Scotchman. Mr Paterson had been a schoolmaster, and in good sooth, he retained a pedagogic style to the last.

'''Juanita Broaddrick'''  is an American former [[nursing home]] administrator. In 1999, she alleged that [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] raped her in April 1978 when he was the attorney general of Arkansas. Clinton's attorney, [[David E. Kendall|David Kendall]] denied the allegations on his client's behalf. Clinton declined to comment further on the issue.

Rumors circulated about Broaddrick's allegations for many years, but she refused to speak to the media. In a sworn statement in 1997 with the [[Jane Doe|placeholder name]] "Jane Doe #5",&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/janedoe022099.htm|title=Another Clinton Accuser Goes Public|last=Romano |first=Lois|date=February 20, 1999|newspaper=Washington Post|last2=Baker|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broaddrick filed an [[affidavit]] with [[Paula Jones]]' lawyers stating there were unfounded rumors and stories circulating "that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies. ... These allegations are untrue".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/affidavit122398.htm|title=Affidavit From Jane Doe #5|last=Broaddrick|first=Juanita|date=January 2, 1998|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation continued that Broaddrick had more to say on the matter, and in an interview with ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' that aired on February 24, 1999, Broaddrick told her story in public in full for the first time, this time stating that Clinton had indeed raped her.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview"&gt;''Dateline NBC'': February 24, 1999. ''The Washington Post'' [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm published a story about the interview] on February 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most serious of the claims that emerged during the 1990s comprising the [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations]].

Broaddrick's claims have received new attention as a consequence of the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016]] and the 2017 [[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo phenomenon]].

==Background==
Broaddrick is from [[Van Buren, Arkansas]], a town in the northwest part of the state.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost /&gt; She was born Juanita Smith to parents Buster Smith and Mary Elizabeth Smith.&lt;ref name=mesobit&gt;http://www.ockerputmanfuneralhome.com/book-of-memories/609508/Smith-Mary/obituary.php?Printable=true&lt;/ref&gt; She has an older sister.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; Her father owned the Smith Cleaners establishment. The family belonged to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=mesobit /&gt; In her memoir she says her mother was physically and emotionally abusive to her and her sister.&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;''You'd Better Put Some Ice On That'', pp 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Smith graduated from [[Van Buren High School (Van Buren, Arkansas)|Van Buren High School]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Van-Buren-High-School/232615|title=1960 Van Buren High School Yearbook|website=www.classmates.com|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended nursing school at Sparks School of Nursing from 1960 to 1963.&lt;ref name=rabin /&gt; She then worked as a [[registered nurse]] at several [[nursing home]]s.&lt;ref name=rabin /&gt;&lt;ref name=trans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shadowgov.com/Clinton/DNBCJuanitaTranscript.html|title=ShadowGov – Clinton Rapist / Dateline NBC Transcript|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 she decided she wanted to run a nursing home herself and so she bought one in Van Buren.&lt;ref name=rabin&gt;Dorothy Rabinowitz, "Juanita Broaddrick Meets the Press", The Wall Street Journal, February 19, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trans /&gt; It was known as the Brownwood Manor Nursing Home.&lt;ref name=wsaudit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-auditing-of-juanita-broaddrick/article/12132|title=The Auditing of Juanita Broaddrick|date=June 12, 2000|work=Weekly Standard|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was part owner with her.&lt;ref name=mesobit /&gt;

Juanita was first married to Gary Hickey, with the marriage happening before she left nursing school.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p 22&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son who was born around 1969. At the time of the alleged 1978 rape, she was having an affair with David Broaddrick, who also was married to another person.&lt;ref name="The Rape of Juanita Broaddrick"&gt;[http://www.wnd.com/2005/05/30492/ "The Rape of Juanita Broaddrick"], ''[[wnd.com]]'', May 26, 2005. With excerpt about Broaddrick from Candice Jackson's book, ''Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations against Bill Clinton==

===1978: Her account===
Broaddrick, who was known as Juanita Hickey at the time, first met Clinton when he made a visit to her nursing home during his [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978|1978 gubernatorial campaign]]. Clinton was [[Arkansas Attorney General]] at the time. Broaddrick wanted to volunteer for the campaign, and says Clinton invited her to stop by the campaign office in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Barringer, Felicity; Firestone, David (February 24, 1999). [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html "On Tortuous Route, Sexual Assault Accusation Against Clinton Resurfaces"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; She contacted the office a few weeks later while in the area for a nursing home conference. Clinton said he would not be in the campaign office that day and suggested they meet at her hotel's coffee shop instead. Upon his arrival, however, he allegedly requested that they instead have coffee in her room to avoid a crowd of reporters in the lobby. Broaddrick agreed.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;

Broaddrick says the two spoke briefly in her room, with Clinton describing plans to renovate a prison visible from her window if he became governor. Then, according to Broaddrick, Clinton suddenly kissed her. Broaddrick says she pushed Clinton away and told him she was married and not interested, but he persisted. As recounted in the NBC interview:&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;

{{quote|text=Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip ... He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him 'No,' that I didn't want this to happen but he wouldn't listen to me. ... It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to 'Please stop.' And that's when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip. ... When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says 'You better get some ice on that.' And he turned and went out the door.}}

When asked if there was any way Clinton could have thought it was consensual, Broaddrick said "No, not with what I told him and with how I tried to push him away. It was not consensual."&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;

Broaddrick shared the hotel room with her friend and employee Norma Rogers. Rogers attended a conference seminar that morning, and says she returned to their room to find Broaddrick on the bed "in a state of shock," her pantyhose torn in the crotch and her lip swollen as though she had been hit. Rogers says Broaddrick told her Clinton had "forced himself on her."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Rogers helped Broaddrick ice her lip, and then the women left Little Rock. Rogers said that Broaddrick was very upset on the way home and blamed herself for letting Clinton in the room.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt; Broaddrick says she did not tell her husband, Gary Hickey, about the incident, and told him she accidentally injured her lip. He told NBC he did not remember the injury or her explanation.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/is_juanita_broaddrick_telling_the_truth.html "Is Juanita Broaddrick Telling the Truth?"]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. March 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; David Broaddrick, however, has said he noticed her injured lip, and she told him that Clinton had raped her when he asked about it. Three other friends confirmed that Broaddrick had told them about the incident at the time: Susan Lewis, Louis Ma, and Jean Darden, Norma Rogers' sister.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt; Broaddrick did not recall the date of the alleged incident, but said it was spring of 1978 and that she had stayed in the Camelot Hotel. Records show Broaddrick attended a nursing home meeting at the Camelot Hotel in Little Rock on April 25, 1978.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; The Clinton White House would not respond to requests for Clinton's official schedule for the date,&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost-Feb25-1999" /&gt; but news reports suggest that he was in Little Rock that day, with no official commitments in the morning.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt;

Three weeks after the alleged assault, Broaddrick participated in a small Clinton fundraiser at the home of a local dentist. Broaddrick said she was "in denial" and felt guilty, thinking that she had given Clinton the wrong idea by letting him into her room.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt; When she arrived at the event, she says, her friend who had picked the Clintons up from the airport told her that [[Hillary Clinton]] had asked if she would be at the event. Broaddrick says Bill Clinton did not speak to her at the event, but Hillary Clinton approached her, took her hand, and said "I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate what you do for him." When Broaddrick moved her hand away, she says, Hillary Clinton held on to her and said, "Do you understand? Everything that you do." Broaddrick says she felt nauseated and left the gathering. Broaddrick says she interpreted the incident as Hillary Clinton thanking her for keeping quiet.&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10722580/bill-clinton-juanita-broaddrick|title=The rape allegation against Bill Clinton, explained|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=November 14, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Jill (October 11, 2016).

In 1984, Broaddrick's nursing facility was adjudged the best in the state, which brought a congratulatory official letter from the governor. On the bottom was a handwritten note from Clinton, saying, "I admire you very much."&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;''Wall Street Journal'': [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919379691540145000 Juanita Broaddrick Meets the Press]. February 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broaddrick said that in 1991, Clinton called her out of a state nursing standards meeting to try to apologize: "'Juanita, I'm so sorry for what I did. I'm not the man that I used to be, can you ever forgive me? What can I do to make this up to you?' And I'm standing there in absolute shock. And I told him to go to hell, and I walked off."&lt;ref name=trans /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost-Feb25-1999"&gt;Kurtz, Howard (February 25, 1999).

A15.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Darden, in whom Broaddrick had confided about the incident, also attended the meeting, and said she saw Broaddrick talking to Clinton in the hallway.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt; Clinton announced [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|his 1992 presidential campaign]] soon after that alleged interaction.

===1992–1998===
Though Broaddrick was resistant to talking to the media, rumors about her story began circulating no later than Clinton's presidential bid in 1992. Broaddrick had confided in Phillip Yoakum, whom she knew from business circles and at the time considered a friend. When Clinton won the Democratic nomination, Yoakum, widely considered to have a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] agenda,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; contacted [[Sheffield Nelson]], Clinton's opponent in the 1990 gubernatorial race. Yoakum arranged a meeting between Nelson and Broaddrick, who resisted Yoakum's and Nelson's push that she go public.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost /&gt; Yoakum secretly taped the conversation and wrote a letter summarizing the allegations, which began to circulate within Republican circles. The story reached the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in October 1992, but the papers dropped the story after Broaddrick refused to talk to reporters and Yoakum refused to release the recording.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In the fall of 1997, Paula Jones's private investigators tried to talk to Broaddrick at her home, also secretly taping the conversation.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;Weiss, Philip. (April 19, 1999). [http://observer.com/1999/04/nbcs-vetting-of-juanita-broaddrick-clintons-accuser-discusses-agonizing-weeks-as-nbc-dragged-it-out/ "NBC’s Vetting of Juanita Broaddrick: Clinton’s Accuser Discusses Agonizing Weeks as NBC Dragged It Out"]. ''New York Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; Broaddrick refused to discuss the incident, saying "it was just a horrible horrible thing," and that she "wouldn't relive it for anything." The investigators told her she would likely be subpoenaed if she would not talk to them. Broaddrick said she would deny everything, saying "you can't get to him, and I'm not going to ruin my good name to do it ... there's just absolutely no way anyone can get to him, he's just too vicious."&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;[http://www.mega.nu/ampp/toobin_leaks/5.pdf transcript of conversation] recorded by Rick Lambert&lt;/ref&gt; Broaddrick was subpoenaed in the Jones suit soon after and submitted an affidavit denying that Clinton had made "any sexual advances".&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recording of Broaddrick's conversation with the investigators was leaked to the press, but Broaddrick continued to refuse to speak to reporters.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;

Despite Broaddrick's denial in her affidavit, Jones' lawyers included Yoakum's letter and Broaddrick's name in a 1998 filing.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt; The letter suggested that the Clintons had bought Broaddrick's silence, describing a phone call where Broaddrick's husband asked Yoakum to say the incident never happened and said that he intended to ask Clinton "for a couple of big favors."&lt;ref name=Yoakumletter&gt;Yoakum, David (December 23, 1998). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/lettertext122398.htm "Letter About Jane Doe #5"]. ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with the discrepancy between the letter and Broaddrick's affidavit, attracted the attention of independent counsel [[Kenneth Starr]], who was investigating Clinton for obstruction of justice. After being approached by the FBI, Broaddrick consulted her son, a lawyer, who told her she could not lie to federal investigators.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; After Starr granted her [[legal immunity|immunity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/hacked-clinton-email-reveals-strategy-to-refute-juanita-broaddricks-rape-claims/|title=Hacked Clinton Email Reveals Strategy to Refute Juanita Broaddrick's Rape Claims|publisher=Mediaite}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus assuring that she would not be prosecuted for perjury regarding her affidavit in the Jones case, Broaddrick recanted the affidavit. However, she insisted that Clinton had not pressured or bribed her in any way, and so Starr concluded that the story was not relevant to his investigation and his report only mentioned the recanting in a footnote.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost /&gt;

===1999===
Rumors continued to circulate in tabloids and on talk radio, now with Broaddrick's name attached.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt; Broaddrick was upset by a tabloid report that she had been paid to keep quiet, and decided to agree to an interview with NBC's [[Lisa Myers]]. Myers interviewed her on January 20, 1999, the day after [[Impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]]. The interview only aired on February 24, 1999, 35 days later and after Clinton had been acquitted on February 12. NBC was accused of intentionally sitting on the story and invoking unusually demanding standards of corroboration until the impeachment process ended. Broaddrick and another source said NBC gathered the key corroborating evidence within 10 days of the interview, NBC assistant producer Chris Giglio said it may have taken him 14 days—in either case, while the impeachment process was ongoing.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt; Though the story was unaired, at least one Republican senator reportedly invoked it to convince undecided Republicans to vote for impeachment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

While NBC waited to air the interview, Broaddrick was approached by [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]], who wrote for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial page. Upset with NBC's delay, Broaddrick agreed to speak with Rabinowitz, and the story debuted on the ''Wall Street Journal'''s editorial page on February 19.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal&gt;Editorial Commentary, Dorothy Rabinowitz; February 19, 1999; Page A18.&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired Myers' interview soon after.

===Clinton response to allegations===
On Friday night, February 19, 1999, Clinton's attorney, [[David E. Kendall|David Kendall]], denied the allegations on Clinton's behalf. Kendall stated: "Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false. Beyond that, we're not going to comment."&lt;ref name = deny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/20/assault.allegation/|title=CNN – White House denies allegations of 1978 sexual assault by Clinton – February 20, 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton himself did not say anything on the matter.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt; When asked about Broaddrick's claims at a news conference on February 24, 1999, Clinton said: "Well, my counsel has made a statement about the ... issue, and I have nothing to add to it."&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost-Feb25-1999" /&gt;

Clinton has never been charged with anything in connection with Broaddrick's allegations.&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt;

===Public and press reactions===
Because of the time elapsed since the alleged incident and the nature of acquaintance rape cases, there was limited corroborating evidence and so the allegations rested on Broaddrick's testimony. Because she had filed and then recanted an affidavit saying there was no assault, some thought she was not credible.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; According to the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' in 1999, the problems with Broaddrick&lt;nowiki&gt;'s accusations were that "There is no physical evidence to verify it. No one else was present during the alleged encounter in a Little Rock hotel room nearly 21 years ago. The hotel has since closed. And Mrs. Broaddrick denied the encounter in an affidavit in January 1998 in the Paula Jones case, in which she was known only as ''Jane Doe No. 5.''&lt;/nowiki&gt; Through all those years, she refused to come forward. When pressed by the Jones lawyers, she denied the allegation. And now, she has recanted that denial."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In March 1999 [[Slate magazine|''Slate'' magazine]] ran a much-cited analysis piece, called "Is Juanita Broaddrick Telling the Truth?", that gave possible grounds upon which Broaddrick should be believed, or should not be believed, regarding each of a number of key points.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; On the disbelief side, it was suggested the five people that said Broaddrick had confided in them soon after the incident could be lying.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; Rogers and Darden had an independent reason to dislike Clinton: as they notified NBC, Clinton had commuted the life sentence of the man who killed their father.&lt;ref name="NBCinterview" /&gt; The disbelief argument proposes that they may have a grudge against Clinton. Even if the confidants were telling the truth, skeptics noted that Broaddrick could have been lying when she originally confided in them.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;

Some details in Broaddrick's account corresponded with other women's allegations. In an interview that emerged after Broaddrick's allegations, [[Elizabeth Ward Gracen]] said that Clinton bit her lip during a consensual encounter that became rough.&lt;ref&gt;Isikoff, Michael (May 30, 2000). ''Uncovering Clinton''. Three Rivers Press. p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Broaddrick said that after the assault, Clinton told her not to worry about pregnancy because childhood [[mumps]] had rendered him sterile.&lt;ref name="WallStreetJournal" /&gt; When contacted about the issue, [[Gennifer Flowers]], who Clinton later admitted to a sexual relationship with, agreed that Clinton had thought he couldn't have children.&lt;ref&gt;''The Weekly Standard''. (February 20, 1999). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/010/352lwsba.asp "A Case of the Mumps?"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1999, shortly after the allegations publicly aired, 56% of Americans believed the allegations were false, while a third believed that Broaddrick's allegation of rape was at least possibly true. Similarly, 29%  of the public felt the press should continue to cover the story, while 66% felt that the media should stop pursuing the story.&lt;ref name=CNNPoll0301-1999&gt;Holland, Keating (March 1, 1999). [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/03/01/poll/ "Poll: Most believe media should lay off Broaddrick allegation"]. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public and media had "scandal fatigue" from the [[Sexual misconduct allegations against Bill Clinton|repeated sexual misconduct allegations against Clinton]] and, after his impeachment and acquittal, many felt the charges had nowhere to go.&lt;ref name=WPweary&gt;Kurtz, Howard (March 1, 1999). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1999/03/01/no-rest-for-the-scandal-weary/81fd7680-4339-4348-9a0e-ef43d65487a6/ "No Rest for the Scandal-Weary"]. ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reporters had encountered the story while it was being disseminated by Republican activists and felt they had already looked into it.&lt;ref name=Salon-0220-1999&gt;Walsh, Joan (February 20, 1999). [https://www.salon.com/1999/02/20/cov_20news_2/ "The Ugliest Story Yet"]. ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Nelson (journalist)|Jack Nelson]], Washington bureau chief of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', said "This is a story that's been knocked down and discredited so many times ... [E]veryone's taken a slice of it, and after looking at it, everyone's knocked it down. The woman has changed her story about whether it happened. It just wasn't credible."&lt;ref name="Salon-0220-1999" /&gt; Julia Malone, a [[Cox Communications]] reporter, became frustrated by what she perceived as media neglect of the story and held a National Press Club panel on the issue entitled "Too Hot for a 'Scandal-Weary' New Media to Handle?"&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt; [[Sam Donaldson]] of [[ABC News]] said he was frustrated over his fellow reporters' unwillingness to press Clinton to respond to the allegations: Clinton refused to comment when Donaldson asked about the allegations, and no one else would press the issue.&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;

Judgement on the Broaddrick matter has varied among book-length treatments of the Bill Clinton years. [[Joe Conason]] and [[Gene Lyons]]' book ''[[The Hunting of the President]]'' argued that Broaddrick's claim is not credible, noting that the FBI had found evidence for the allegations "inconclusive". [[Michael Isikoff]]'s book, ''Uncovering Clinton'', stated that Clinton's lawyers figured that he might well have had consensual, extramarital sex with Broaddrick, but they did not believe he would have forced himself on her.&lt;ref name=vox /&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]]' book, ''[[No One Left to Lie To]]'', argued that Broaddrick's claim is credible and shows similarities to [[Paula Jones]]' later allegation of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/07/hitchens/|title=The (un)friendly witness of Christopher Hitchens|first=Charles|last=Taylor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Broaddrick filed a lawsuit against Clinton in December 1999 to obtain documents that the [[White House]] may have gathered about her, claiming its refusal to accede to her demand for such documents violated the [[Privacy Act of 1974]].&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt; Her lawyer was conservative judicial activist [[Larry Klayman]], head of [[Judicial Watch]].&lt;ref name = lawsuit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/20/broaddrick.suit/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS|title=Juanita Broaddrick sues Clinton Administration over alleged 'smear campaign' |date=December 20, 1999|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]] in March 2001. The judge ruled that the Privacy Act did not apply in this case and that Broaddrick had failed to show evidence that the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] had improperly released documents about her.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Gerstein, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121718 "White House Wag: Courts Back Clinton"], ABC News, April 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit did not ask for money, and indeed unlike many of the women involved in Bill Clinton instances, Broaddrick did not seek out financial settlements, publishing deals, or a role as a celebrity.&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt;

During that time, Broaddrick's business was audited by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] which she charged was retaliation: "I do not believe this was coincidence," Broaddrick declared, "I do not think our number just came up."&lt;ref&gt;''Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine''. World Ahead Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|9780974670133}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000]] unfolded, in which Hillary was a candidate, Broaddrick published an [[open letter]] to her, denouncing her alleged role in covering for her husband's alleged attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/Juanita.htm|title=AN OPEN LETTER TO HILLARY CLINTON BY JUANITA BROADDRICK|website=www.apfn.org |accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broaddricks divorced in 2004. David Broaddrick had opposed her going public with her rape story in 1999. Juanita Broaddrick felt, according to a 2005 book, that the publicity around the ''Dateline'' interview contributed significantly to the end of her second marriage.&lt;ref name="The Rape of Juanita Broaddrick" /&gt; She says she also developed a fear of enclosed spaces as a result of what happened.&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt;

In 2008 Broaddrick sold her nursing home business and retired,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/264988-bill-clinton-rape-accuser-hillary-tried-to-silence-me "Bill Clinton rape accuser: Hillary 'tried to silence' me"], ''The Hill'', January 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; having done well as a businesswoman. She continues to live in Van Buren, on a 23-acre farm.&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/juanita-broaddrick-wants-to-be-believed "Juanita Broaddrick wants to be believed"], BuzzFeed, August 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed attention during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign==
Broaddrick resurrected her rape claims on Twitter during the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], as Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee for president.&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt;

In this context, the Broaddrick case has often brought about unease on the part of people who are generally supportive of the Clintons. In an October 2016 recap of the case, [[Dylan Matthews]] of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] said: "The basic answer is that some of the claims [against Bill Clinton] appear more credible than others. There are three main accusers [the others being Jones and Willey], of whom it seems by far the most credible—based on the publicly available evidence—is Broaddrick." Matthews continues: "Given the prevailing view among many progressives—including Hillary Clinton—that one should default to believing rape accusers, the Broaddrick allegation thus poses a problem."&lt;ref name=vox /&gt; [[Michelle Goldberg]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote in a late 2015 essay, "our rules for talking about sexual assault have changed since the 1990s, when these women were last in the news. Today, feminists have repeatedly and convincingly made the case that when women say they've been sexually assaulted, we should assume they're telling the truth. Particularly when it comes to Broaddrick, it's not easy to square the arguments against believing her with the dominant progressive consensus on trusting victims. This is a tension that people on the right are eager to exploit."&lt;ref name=slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/12/bill_clinton_s_sexual_past_can_still_hurt_hillary.html "Why Bill's past could still hurt Hillary"], Michelle Goldberg, Slate, December 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conservative commentators who were typically quite skeptical of sexual assault claims without firm evidence, found Broaddrick's allegations quite believable.&lt;ref name = buzz /&gt;
As Katie J. M. Baker of [[BuzzFeed]] lamented, "In theory, partisan politics shouldn't play a role in determining whether an alleged rape victim deserves to be heard."&lt;ref name = buzz /&gt; Similar observations have been made by Robby Soave of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/17/on-rape-liberals-dont-believe-the-victim|title=On Rape, Liberals Don't 'Believe the Victim' If It's Juanita Broaddrick|date=August 17, 2016|work=Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now-retired NBC reporter who broadcast her story, Lisa Myers, has said: "No one can objectively look at Juanita's story and not be troubled. One of the things that makes her so credible is who she is—open, straightforward, seemingly guileless."&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt;

When in late 2015, during a town hall that was an event during the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016]], Hillary Clinton was asked about this question in terms of these women's charges, she responded: "Well, I would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence."&lt;ref name=belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/politics/hillary-clinton-paula-jones-question/index.html|title=Hillary Clinton asked about Paula Jones|author=Eric Bradner and Dan Merica |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Broaddrick shared on the social networking site [[Twitter]], "I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73. ... it never goes away." Broaddrick said she was neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but she supported [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]]: "He says the things I like to hear."&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2008]] she voted for [[Barack Obama]] and gave more than $1,000 to his campaign because he was running against Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt; She agreed with Trump's injection of Bill Clinton's acknowledged and alleged sexual misdeeds into the campaign.&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; And as the campaign went on, she more and more aligned herself with conservative actions and outlook.&lt;ref name=buzz /&gt;

On October 8, 2016, in the wake of the [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy|Donald Trump ''Access Hollywood'' controversy]], Trump retweeted Broaddrick's tweets in which she calls Bill Clinton a "rapist" and calls Hillary Clinton's actions "horrific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Louis|title=Trump puts Clinton on watch by retweeting Juanita Broaddrick |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/juanita-broaddrick-trump-twitter-clinton-229387|accessdate=October 9, 2016|work=POLITICO|date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Donald Trump just retweeted Juanita Broaddrick calling Bill Clinton a rapist.

==#MeToo and re-evaluation in 2017–18==
In 2017, in the wake of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]], Broaddrick criticized 1990s Bill Clinton paramour [[Monica Lewinsky]] for aligning herself with the [[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo movement]], saying, "I have always felt sad for you, but where were you when we needed you?" Broaddrick added, "I always felt she was a victim. I only wish she had spoken up in '99 when I was going thru so much persecution after my interview on ''NBC Dateline''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/juanita-broaddrick-monica-lewinskys-metoo-your-silence-was-deafening-688924|title=One of Bill Clinton's accusers slams another over the #MeToo campaign|date=October 19, 2017|website=Newsweek|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once again media attention focused on the allegations against Clinton, including those from Broaddrick.&lt;ref name ="web-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/politics/liberals-journalists-call-reevaluation-bill-clinton-sexual-assault-claims/amp/|title=While Women Come Out with Harassment Claims, Liberals Are Taking Another Look at One of Their Own|date=November 14, 2017|website=Washington Free Beacon|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atl-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729/|title=Bill Clinton: A Reckoning|first=Caitlin|last=Flanagan |date=November 13, 2017|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews wrote that "America's ongoing national reckoning with sexual assault and sexual harassment by powerful men now has liberals and Democrats reconsidering the legacy of one of party's most important figures of the past quarter-century: President Bill Clinton."&lt;ref name=vox /&gt;

Caitlin Flanagan of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote "Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger, stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s. Juanita Broaddrick reported that ..." before recapping the case.&lt;ref name="atl-17" /&gt; During an [[NPR]] interview Flanagan said, "And so there were a series of women throughout the course of his presidency who came forward with accounts of things they said he did to them which really mirror the kinds of things we're looking at now in the very worst of the cases. Juanita Broaddrick, most prominently, said that he raped her very violently in a way that is quite like the Harvey Weinstein accusations in terms of the hotel room and the suddenness and the bleak horror of it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfae.org/post/rethinking-bill-clinton-amid-sexual-harassment-debates|title=Rethinking Bill Clinton Amid Sexual Harassment Debates|publisher=WFAE|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg wrote an op-ed in the ''New York Times'' entitled "I Believe Juanita", where she said, "In this #MeToo moment, when we're reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her.

'''Embarcadero Plaza''', previously known as '''Justin Herman Plaza''' from its opening in 1972 until 2017, is a {{convert|1.23|acre|abbr=on|adj=on}} plaza near the intersection of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market]] and [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It is owned by [[Boston Properties]], who acquired the neighboring [[Embarcadero Center]] office, hotel, and retail complex in 1998.

==Design==
{{quotebox|align=left|width=25em|text=The Ferry Building Park could be a great open space with canals, lagoons, and fountains that would revive the marine flavor by actually bringing the Bay back into the area. The atmosphere of European ports could be injected with handsome paving, sidewalk cafes, and fine restaurants. The freeway should be painted dark, and large trees should be planted to suppress its sight and its sounds. Difficult as all this may be, establish the Ferry Building Park area as a vibrant, alive, colorful place, used by day and at night, and it will send a tingle up the spine of Market Street. |author=Halprin, Carter, and Rockrise |source=''What to do About Market Street'' (1962)&lt;ref name=1962market /&gt;}}
The design of Embarcadero Plaza is credited to [[Don Carter (architect)|Don Carter]] (principal-in-charge) with help from [[Mario J. Ciampi]] and [[John Savage Bolles|John Bolles]]. The original concept was devised by [[Lawrence Halprin]], who described five distinct districts of Market Street in the 1962 report ''What to do About Market Street'' starting at the Embarcadero and ending at Van Ness.&lt;ref name=1962market&gt;{{cite report |url=https://archive.org/details/whattodoaboutmar00livi/page/31 |title=What to Do About Market Street: A prospectus for a development program prepared for the Market Street Development Project, an associate of SPUR: The San Francisco Planning and Urban Renewal Association |chapter=The Look of Market Street |pages=23–34 |author1=Halprin, Lawrence |author2=Carter, Donald Ray |author3=Rockrise, George T. |publisher=Livingston and Blayney, City and Regional Planners |year=1962 |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, Halprin's vision for Market was described as a "pedestrian-oriented series of linked civic spaces"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/halprinlegacy/justin-herman-plaza.html |title=Justin Herman Plaza, 1962-71 |website=The Landscape Architecture of Lawrence Halprin |publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were later realized as the open spaces running from Embarcadero Plaza (in the northeast) to [[United Nations Plaza (San Francisco)|UN Plaza]] in the southwest. Halprin described an early concept for what he called Ferry Building Park in the 1962 ''Market Street'' report, proposing to bring [[San Francisco Bay]] and the original harbor closer to Market, as "the [Embarcadero] Freeway and the Ferry building have created an impenetrable barrier, at street level, to one of San Francisco's most priceless assets – its marine setting" and offering ways to minimize the visual and aural impact of the double-decked freeway.&lt;ref name=1962market /&gt;

===Reception===
During the debate over changing the name, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' urban spaces critic John King called it "a stark concrete landscape" and added "there's no earthly reason you would want to be there."&lt;ref name=SFC-171018 /&gt; In an earlier article published just after Halprin's death in 2009, King noted that Embarcadero Plaza was "oversize and stiff, unable to adjust to the changing urban scene on all sides."&lt;ref name=SFC-091103&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Lawrence-Halprin-s-living-legacy-in-S-F-3211095.php |title=Lawrence Halprin's living legacy in S.F. |author=King, John |date=November 3, 2009 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The plaza, located at the eastern end of Market Street, opened in 1972. It was originally named for [[M. Justin Herman]], executive director of the [[San Francisco Redevelopment Agency]] from 1959 to 1971.

In 2017, County Supervisor [[Aaron Peskin]] introduced a resolution to rename the site Embarcadero Plaza, citing Herman's role in displacing poor and minority residents from the [[Western Addition, San Francisco|Western Addition]], [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore]], [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], and [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market]] neighborhoods while presiding over the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/SF-Supervisor-Peskin-ramps-up-drive-to-rename-11415576.php |title=SF Supervisor Peskin ramps up drive to rename Justin Herman Plaza |author=Dineen, J.K. |date=July 27, 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] passed the resolution unanimously on September 19, 2017. The name Embarcadero Plaza will be temporary until a new official name can be decided upon.&lt;ref name="nbc-19sep2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Leaders Vote Unanimously to Rename Justin Herman Plaza|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/SF-Leaders-Vote-Unanimously-to-Rename-Justin-Herman-Plaza-445886603.html|accessdate=September 19, 2017|newspaper=[[NBC Bay Area]]|date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board's resolution is nonbinding, as the authority to change the name rests with the [[San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department|San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission]]. Peskin stated he had received an unsolicited text from the owner, Boston Properties, which said they would cover the cost of replacing the plaque bearing Herman's name.&lt;ref name=SFC-170921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-supervisors-want-Justin-Herman-Plaza-to-get-a-12210332.php |title=SF supervisors want Justin Herman's name yanked off plaza |author=Swan, Rachel |date=September 19, 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Recreation &amp; Parks Commission voted 4–2 to remove Justin Herman's name on November 16, 2017. An earlier vote in October ended in a 3–3 tie after one of the commissioners (who had favored removal of the name) left the meeting before the vote was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/11/17/16669802/justin-herman-plaza-name-sf |title=City officially removes Justin Herman's name from plaza |author=Brinklow, Adam |date=17 November 2017 |work=SF Curbed |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE-171019&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/rec-park-commission-votes-remove-justin-hermans-name-plaza/ |title=UPDATE: Commission’s vote to remove Justin Herman’s name from plaza later declared invalid |author=Sabatini, Joshua |date=October 19, 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Johnson (photographer)|David Johnson]], a photographer who documented life in the Western Addition prior to SFRA's redevelopment, is a leading candidate for the renaming of the plaza.&lt;ref name=SFE-171019 /&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Ortigas Center began as the 4,033-hectare "Hacienda de Mandaloyon", an estate from the [[Augustinians|Augustinian Order]]. In the following years, there were several changes of partners. Then, on July 10, 1931, the company was incorporated “Ortigas, Madrigal y cia., S. en C.” as a limited partnership by shares ({{lang-es|sociedad comanditaria por acciones}}). The parties to the partnership were Francisco Ortigas (Don Paco), Vicente Madrigal, B.C.M. Johnston, Fulgencio Borromeo, Clyde A. Dewitt and Manuel L. Quezon.

When Ortigas &amp; Company acquired the estate, it was a virtual wasteland. The vision of the management, headed by Atty. Francisco Ortigas Jr., who was President and Chairman at that time, turned it into a progressive industrial, commercial and residential urban complex.

'''Page-Vawter House''' in the town of [[Ansted, West Virginia|Ansted]] in [[Fayette County, West Virginia]] was built in 1889-90 by company carpenters of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company for the family of [[William Nelson Page]], who was company president. The palatial white Victorian mansion is located on a knoll in the middle of town. William and [[Emma G. Page|Emma (née Gilham) Page]] raised their four children there, attended by a staff of 8 servants.

Architect William Minter designed the house in a Gothic style. It has 15 regular rooms, plus a butler's pantry and a dressing room. There are 11 fireplaces with hand-carved wooden mantels; most are in different styles. Even the doors have ornately decorated hinges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/624294/historic_ansted_house_goes_on_the_market/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior features 52 8-foot-tall windows built by company carpenters on a knoll in the middle of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=38468 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526135759/http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=38468 |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to author and railroad historian [[H. Reid]] in his book ''The Virginian Railway'' (Kalmbach, 1961), it was in this mansion that Page developed the plans for the coal-hauling [[Virginian Railway]], which was financed by [[industrialist]] [[Henry Huddleston Rogers]] and became the "Richest Little Railroad in the World" after its completion in 1909. The nearby  railroad town of [[Page, West Virginia|Page]] was named for him.

The mansion was later occupied by several generation of the Vawter family. In the 21st century, it still stands as evidence of the once-thriving [[bituminous coal|coal]] business.

The Page-Vawter House was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.&lt;ref name = nris/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Buffett began his musical career in the early part of the 1980s in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].  There, he recorded and produced albums for local talent.  He also was hired by [[advertising agency|ad agencies]] to compose [[advertising|commercials]] and [[logo]]s - including [[MTV]] and [[CNN]], both of which were new to [[cable television]] at the time.

===Music career===

====1987-1995====
[[Narada Productions]], a [[new-age music]] recording company, signed Buffett to a recording contract.  In 1987, Buffett debuted with Narada, releasing an album entitled ''The Waiting''.  His second album, ''One by One'', was inspired by [[Evan S. Connell]]'s book "[[Son of the Morning Star]]". In 1989, Buffett moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], home of Narada Productions and closer to his childhood home in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  Buffett would release two more albums with Narada:  ''Lost Frontier'' and ''Yonnondio''.

While with Narada, Buffett had his first major success scoring the "Fire Dance" scene in the film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0119368/ |title=Peter Buffett |publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[film score]], composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. Barry would later invite Buffett to collaborate with him again, this time at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]].  Buffett contributed the American Indian soundscapes to the film as well as composed two songs for the soundtrack of ''[[The Scarlet Letter (1995 film)|The Scarlet Letter]]''.

After the release of ''Yonnondio'', Buffett signed with [[Epic Records]]. In 1994, he released his soundtrack for the [[CBS]] [[miniseries]] ''[[500 Nations]]'', which was produced by [[Kevin Costner]]. Buffett also met Chief Hawk Pop while scoring the series.

====1996-2005====
In 1996, Buffett produced ''Star of Wonder'', a [[Christmas song|Christmas CD]] featuring [[Celtic music|Celtic]] [[harpist]] [[Kim Robertson (musician)|Kim Robertson]] and arranger Eric Segnitz. Buffett then signed with [[Hollywood Records]], which released his album ''Spirit Dance'' in 1997.

In 1998, he entered the pop music realm with the release of ''Comet9&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s "Like Mercury" on Milwaukee-based independent label ''Don't Records'', with Buffett producing, writing and playing multi-instrumentalist.  Co-writer and guitarist [[Tom Nelson (musician)|Tom Nelson]] and vocalist Susan Zielke completed the studio trio, with [[Citizen King]] members D. J. Brooks and Malcolm Michiles guesting on drums and turntables, respectively. The live band added bassist Josh Warner to the lineup.

In 1999, Buffett's score for the documentary ''Wisconsin: An American Portrait'' won the [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Best Soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin: An America Portrait'' http://www.americanvisions.org/our-films/wisconsin-an-american-portrait/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1999, Buffett's ''Spirit – A Journey in Dance Drums and Song'' aired on PBS as a highly successful pledge break special. Combining modern and American Indian dancers with Director and Choreographer [[Wayne Cilento]], ''Spirit'' went on to tour through the end of 1999. In 2004, Buffett worked with Jody Ripplinger and Frank Anderson to create ''Spirit –The Seventh Fir''e; an updated version of his earlier show. It was premiered on the [[National Mall]] during the opening of the [[National Museum of the American Indian|Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/id/5378750#.UhJtKdJJOAg "Warren Buffett's son taps into 'Hidden Heritage]'[http://www.today.com/id/5378750.UhJtKdJJOAg "]; [[MSNBC]], July 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in its 800-seat theater tent.

====2006-present====
In 2006, Buffett released his first vocal album, ''Gold Star''. Over the course of the next two years, he released two more albums, ''Staring at the Sun'' (2007) and ''Imaginary Kingdom'' (2008) on his own label BeSide Records.

In 2009, Buffett began to release exclusive singles through his social networking community on [[Ning (website)|Ning]]. He has released over 25 singles since then, including a compilation album of fifteen of the songs.  The collection, released initially as a USB album, was titled ''Running Blind'' (2011) and contained an innovative interactive environment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

During this time he collaborated twice with Grammy-nominated recording artist [[Akon]] and once with Grammy-winning artist [[Angélique Kidjo]] on human rights inspired songs. One Akon collaboration, titled “Blood Into Gold,” debuted at a special event at the [[UN General Assembly]] in March 2009 that focused on [[human trafficking]].

In 2013, Peter released "Already Flown" which was the inspiration behind his ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed piece, ''The Charitable-Industrial Complex''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/the-charitable-industrial-complex.html "The Charitable-Industrial Complex" ]''The New York Times. ''July 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The piece sparked a lively debate on the role of philanthropy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The history of the '''[[Tejo Power Station]]''', operating from 1908 to 1975 in the [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém district]] of [[Lisbon]], Portugal. 

==Introduction==
As the latter 19th century advanced, Lisbon's rate of urbanisation and electricity consumption was outgrowing existing power generation stations. The two power stations that supplied the city with electricity were the ''Avenida Power Station'' (1889) and the ''Boavista Power Station'' (1903). Their names were intimately connected to their locations. It was for this same reason that during the Tejo Power Station's initial stages, toponymy remained in use and it was originally named the ''Junqueira Power Station'', being located in the Junqueira district. Despite everything, this name didn’t last long since, once construction was concluded, official documents and the plant's facade took on the name of the [[Tagus River|Tagus River (Rio Tejo)]] it was built on, as the [[Tejo Power Station]].

== The original Tejo Power Station ==
The small power plants that existed in the capital (Avenida and Boavista Power Stations) became obsolete due to the increasing demand for [[electric power]]. Furthermore, they were located in heavily urbanised neighbourhoods, thereby exerting a strong environmental impact on the residents and presenting a lack of space for the more than predictable expansions that the new electricity industry was going to require.
For these reasons, at the beginning of 1908, the company that held the concession to produce and distribute electric power in Lisbon, the ''Companhias Reunidas de Gás e Electricidade'' ([[CRGE]] - United Gas and Electric Companies) undertook construction of a new [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] in Lisbon. In the operating license, they asked for permission to install a “new power generating station”, located in a manufacturing district that went from the Navy Dockyard to Pedrouços beach, in the western part of the city.

The chosen location was situated halfway between the [[Belém Palace]] and the [[Junqueira National Rope Factory]], which still exist today. Thus, after raising the capital to finance the new thermoelectric power station, in March 1908 construction began on the plant that would provide Lisbon and the surrounding area with electricity for more than six decades.

The final technical project was created by engineer [[Lucien Neu]], who made the most of all the usable space by placing the turbines in the central area and the boilers on either side. This project underwent several alterations, with the construction work extending for longer than had initially been programmed. The company responsible for constructing the buildings was [[Vieillard &amp; Touzet]], who maintained approximately 50 workers on the site.
In the summer of 1909, the Tejo Power Station was officially inaugurated despite undergoing important alterations in its interior until 1910, such as the acquisition of new [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]] or the expansion of the boiler room, which involved building a new 36 meter-high chimney in the shape of an inverted pyramidal stem.

From its construction up to 1912, the Junqueira Power Station acquired new machinery to increase its production. In 1908 it started off with two alternators from the Boavista Power Station, each with a 1 MW output, and six Delaunay – Belleville boilers. The 1910 expansion involved the installation of three new [[Brown Boveri &amp; Cª.]] turbo-alternators that raised the total output to 7.75 MW, as well as four boilers at a first stage, later joined by five more boilers with greater vaporisation capacity.
Thus, in 1912, when all this equipment was in place, the original Tejo Power Station had fifteen small Belleville boilers and five generating sets that supplied the city of Lisbon's electric grid.

Regarding the exterior, the building that accommodated this extensive set of machinery displayed an architectural style typical of the small power stations at the end of the 19th century, the then called “electricity factories”. Its plan was of a longitudinal nave covered on two sides, and three transversally adjacent pavilions on the western side. Between them, two slim chimneys doubled the height of the plant's body and “overlooked” the area. The North-South facades displayed the inscription ''1909 / Cªs Reunidas Gás e Electricidade / Estação Eléctrica Central Tejo'' (United Gas and Electric Companies / Tejo Electric Power Station).

This original Tejo Power Station was planned to operate for six years (1908–1914) until the CRGE managed the necessary means to build a larger plant with greater capacity. However, due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in that final year, the Tejo Power Station's original phase was extended and remained operational until 1921. The production and distribution of electricity began to take place under very precarious conditions since, among other aspects, the fuels used were of poor quality, and as a consequence the boilers suffered constant breakdowns, which led to a significant reduction in the rate of expansion and development of electricity in the city.

Despite these setbacks, construction work on the low pressure boiler building continued, and at the end of 1916 the plant started receiving steam from the first two low pressure boilers installed in the new building that was still under construction but nonetheless guaranteed the necessary conditions to reinforce the supply to the existing generating sets.

In 1921, once the Low Pressure building was constructed and made fully operational, the original Tejo Power Station was deactivated and dismantled, with a set of workshops and warehouses taking its place. Some years later, in 1938, the need to build a new High Pressure boiler building led to the demolition of the naves from the station's original phase, leaving no trace behind.

== The current Tejo Power Station ==
The need to build a new power station to satisfy the growing demand for electricity, and the precarious conditions under which the original Tejo Power Station was operating, led in 1914 to the construction of new buildings and the installation of more efficient machinery. This was a time of growth and modernisation that only ended with the installation of the 15th and final boiler in 1951.

Generally speaking, there were two main construction periods:
* The first, from 1914 to 1930, involved the Low Pressure facility and consisted of building and expanding the low pressure boiler room and the machinery room.
* The second took place between 1938 and 1951, and involved setting up High Pressure production. From the end of this period to this day, the architectural ensemble has remained unaltered, with the high pressure boiler building standing out from the rest of the complex.

=== Low Pressure ===
With the construction of the low pressure boiler building and the new machinery room, the Tejo Power Station began to consolidate itself both in terms of production and on an architectural level, with the use of [[brick]] on the visible facades of the entire industrial complex.

Once again, it is possible to separate this low pressure period into three construction phases:
* The first, from 1914 to 1921, included beginning construction of the boiler building, the coal distributor and the machinery room.
* The second phase lasted from 1924 to 1928. It stands out from the first expansion due to the construction of a manufacturing body to house the new boilers and another coal distributor, identical to the existing ones, a new generating set and the docks to the cooling system and its respective channels.
* Finally, the third phase, which took place between 1928 and 1930, involved expansion of the machinery room and the final expansion of the boiler room, due to the purchase of furnaces that were larger than the previous ones.

==== The First Phase (1914-1921) ====
Construction on the low pressure and machinery buildings began in 1914. The project included several manufacturing bodies: two longitudinal naves covered on both sides, each one to accommodate six [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] low pressure [[boiler]]s; one machinery room with a capacity for two German [[AEG]] 8MW [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]]; as well as a smaller control and substation building. Construction began from north to south and east to west, and aside from the above, the possibility of later expanding on the southern side to the edge of the [[Tagus]] river was also immediately plotted.

Shortly after beginning the construction work, [[World War I]] broke out, causing delays in established deadlines and problems receiving the two turbo-alternators ordered from [[Germany]], which remained detained until the end of the conflict. Nonetheless, in 1916 the first two low pressure boilers were installed (which in the project were assigned numbers 5 and 6) in order to supply the generators from the original power station.

During the two years that followed, two new boilers were installed (numbers 3 and 4) which, along with 5 and 6, exceeded the output that the old generators from the original Tejo Power Station could withstand. The CRGE concluded that it was necessary that another turbo-alternator be purchased to add to the two generators ordered years before from the German supplier and which were still held up, thus moving forward with the construction of one part of the machinery room to accommodate this new generator. In 1919, the new Swiss [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie]] 7500&amp;nbsp;kW turbo-alternator began operating.

The next year, the remaining boilers (numbers 1 and 2) were installed, and with the war over, the two German AEG sets were finally received, beginning operation in 1921. With the permanent installation of these 6 boilers and three generating sets, production stabilised and it was possible to dismantle the outdated equipment from the Junqueira Power Station.

==== Second Phase (1924-1928) ====
Gradually, due to the increase in consumption, it was once again necessary to carry out new and important work on the power station in order to expand and complete the low pressure boiler room. The program created by the CRGE consisted in expanding one industrial nave that would accommodate three new low pressure boilers and purchasing one new generating set.

Thus, throughout 1922 a study was conducted regarding the installation of boilers number 7 and 9, and the possibility of these operating with pulverised [[coal]], which ended up proving unsuccessful, since in boiler number 6 the tests carried out to implement this process produced unsatisfactory results. Nonetheless, pulverised coal would still be used in boiler number 11.

The “new boiler room”, as it was called, grew southward, toward the [[Tagus]] River, with the facade facing the river and remaining unfinished, temporarily closed off with a sheet of [[zinc]] and a metallic structure imitating the bay windows on the opposite side. This because a third and final expansion was anticipated for this low pressure boiler room. Boilers 7 and 9, both [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], were the first to be installed in this new space in 1924 and 1925 respectively. The third, boiler 11 – a Humboldt – was installed in 1928; since it used pulverised coal, it had its own coal mill.

The machinery room didn’t undergo any change in size but inside,  an 8MW generating set – number 4, a [[Stal-Asea]] – was installed in 1925. The channels and two [[siphon]]s on the cooling system's new [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] were also built, which carried water from the river to the power station's interior.

==== Third Phase (1928-1930) ====

It was in the third building phase of the Tejo Power Station's first period that construction on the industrial naves was completed, both on the boiler rooms and machinery room. In 1928, the same year boiler 11 was installed, it was decided to go ahead with the purchase of the final two low pressure boilers, numbers 8 and 10, from the most frequent supplier, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, due to the delays on the installation of the Humboldt boiler. However, their permanent installation was only concluded at the end of 1930.

The new manufacturing body that accommodated them maintained the same aesthetic lines as the previous structures, although with greater dimensions. For this, the temporary [[zinc]] sheet facade was removed and the building was built toward the river, acquiring the facade that remains today.

Regarding the machinery room, it was also necessary to pull down the existing southern facade in order to expand the plant's area toward the river, thus aligning it with the boiler room in order to allow the installation of the new and final Escher Wyss/Thompson [[Electrical generator|generating set]] (which, following the sequence used until then, was assigned the number 5), as well as creating a space on the lower floor for unloading and managing [[turbine]]s, alternators and other material. The reinforcement of the machinery's capacity also implied the expansion of the cooling water channelling facility, leading to the construction of two new [[siphon]]s, one for water intake and another for elimination, thereby bringing the total to four siphons.

After approximately fifteen years undergoing construction and expansion, in its Low Pressure phase, the Tejo Power Station finally had three large manufacturing areas: [[boiler]]s, machinery and [[Electrical substation|substation]], located parallel to the river. The boiler room consisted of four large industrial naves that created a free space in the interior for housing eleven low pressure boilers, ten [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] (British technology) and one Humboldt (German origin). The machinery room is a longitudinal and also open space, perpendicular to the boiler room, accommodating five generating sets of varying capacities and brands: [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie]], [[AEG]], [[Stal-Asea]] and Escher Wyss/Thompson.

=== High Pressure ===
Despite having concentrated work on low pressure during the period between 1930 and 1938, a series of construction work was carried out in order to prepare the Tejo Power Station for future high pressure production, which implied constructing a new building.

The location chosen for this new building was plotted where the original Tejo Power Station still stood. Despite being made up of a combination of workshops and warehouses, before demolishing it, a new location had to be found to accommodate these roles that were complementary but indispensable to the plant's operation. Thus the decision was made to purchase the property and buildings where the old sugar refinery [[Senna Sugar Estates, Ltd.]] (owned by the "Companhia de Açúcar de Moçambique" - Mozambique Sugar Company¬) used to lie, located on the power station's east side.

From the beginning of that decade, [[AEG]] [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]] 2 and 3 began to cause problems and break down constantly, and in 1934 a request was issued to purchase and license the installation of two generators of the same brand but with double the capacity. It was the end of 1935 when the new turbo-alternator number 2 was installed and inaugurated; it was also at this time that installation of the new voltage transformation equipment was concluded, allowing the Tejo Power Station's [[Electrical substation|substation]] to supply the [[Lisbon]] and [[Lisbon District|Tejo Valley region]] all the way to [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]. At the end of the following year, [[Electrical generator|generator]] number 3 was also replaced.

The installation of new generating sets with greater capacity made it almost mandatory to set up the first high pressure [[boiler]]s (numbers 12, 13 and 14) in order to use the capacity provided by the turbo-alternator sets more efficiently due to the greater power the steam from the new boilers produced. The boilers were once again ordered from manufacturer [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], and their large size dictated the construction of the largest building in the industrial complex, the High Pressure Boiler Building.

In 1938, dismantled and without use, demolition began on what remained of the old original power plant to build in its place the new Tejo Power Station manufacturing space. Building was contracted out to several companies: for the coal mixer and increase in coal elevation, the [[Societé des Pieux Franki]] was selected, beginning work in September of that year. The metallic structure and construction work was given to Portuguese company [[Vulcano &amp; Colares]], beginning work on the first elements for the structure and the boilers in March 1939.
What was noteworthy about this new building was that its structure was entirely built in [[iron]], with the finishing following the same lines as the low pressure building, in other words, [[brick]] on the visible facades. The difference lay in the [[Ornament (architecture)|trimming]], which contrary to the rest of the complex, presented a markedly classicist character of renaissance palace influence.

During the time in which the High Pressure building began to take shape, work was also taking place on a new building of much smaller proportions destined for the Low Pressure Auxiliary equipment; in other words, to accommodate the water purification and treatment machinery. This annex also served to free up space in the boiler room since an Auxiliary High Pressure room was to be built at a later date. The auxiliary low pressure facility was completed in 1939 and adjoined the main building, next to boilers 8 and 10.

Once again the war, this time [[World War II]], caused delays in the assembly and installation of the high pressure building. The three boilers planned to begin operating in 1940 only began to work a year later when their facilities were finally in working condition; boiler 12 in March, boiler 13 the following month and boiler 14 in August 1941.

However, the boilers couldn’t reach a high output because they were operating under low pressure; the High Pressure auxiliary equipment had to be built and the turbines adapted. The auxiliary building grew within the low pressure boiler room, making it necessary to dismantle boilers 1 and 2 in 1943. On the other hand, making the turbines in sets 2 and 3 compatible with a  high pressure process was complicated, since the order placed with the German manufacturer encountered the commercial blockade that spread all over the [[Europe|European continent]] as a consequence of World War II.
The equipment finally arrived in 1942, allowing High Pressure [[electric power production]] to begin the following year. In 1943, boilers 12 and 13 began to supply [[Alternator|turbo-alternator]] number 2, and in 1944, boiler 14 began supplying turbo-alternator 3.

Because of the war, during the years of conflict the price of [[coal]] increased progressively while its quality dropped. Consequently, the rise in prices quadrupled in only six years (between 1939 and 1945). On the other hand, electricity production also rose progressively, reaching maximum rates year after year, peaking in 1950 at a record rate of 52 200&amp;nbsp;kW and 216 million kWh produced.

In 1948, due to the escalating price of coal, the three high pressure boilers were slightly altered to adapt them to burn [[naphtha]] (fuel oil), a petroleum by-product that at the time was cheaper than coal. It was also necessary to build an 8 000m3 reservoir near the ''Praça de Carvão'' (Coal Square) to store this flammable liquid.

==== Boiler 15 ====
Throughout the year of 1944, the [[CRGE]] made plans to replace the old alternators and boilers with equipment better suited to the reality of those times, a consequence of technological evolution. Later, and due to the increase in electricity consumption, that project evolved into an expansion plan to create a new production centre, in other words, a new thermoelectric power station. That same year the National Electrification Law was approved, indicating a turning point in Portuguese electric power policy, making [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric systems]] an absolute priority for power production. This meant that a project for a new [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] would be denied, since it opposed the law. After making several appeals to the government, in 1948 the CRGE were finally granted permission to proceed with a minimal expansion of the Tejo Power Station, which meant the acquisition and installation of a new [[boiler]], boiler number 15.

Once again supplied by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], it was installed beside boiler 12. In order to accomplish this, the existing facade had to be demolished, the new area cemented, and the metallic structure covered in brick built, always with the same technique and look. Construction work began at the beginning of 1950 and the boiler began operating when construction was concluded in mid-1951, a time when the power station was already acting as a reserve.

The almost ten-year difference between the installation of the first high pressure boilers and this final one results in differences between them. For instance, boiler 15 already came equipped with naphtha injectors (in the others, these were added progressively), the conveyor belt is lower, the control table is more advanced in registering and reading the boiler's operational data, the boiler dust (ash) pan has six coal hoppers to expel boiler dust and coal (in the other there were only three), and it is also slightly larger in size.

=== Integration into the National Electric Grid ===
The '''National Electrification Law''' made producing hydroelectric power an absolute priority, as was standardising electricity in the country through a national transport network. For those reasons, since 1950 the Tejo Power Station was classified as a reserve power station, occupying a secondary position to support the electric power production sector, inevitably beginning its decline.

Indeed, on 21 January 1951 the [[Castelo do Bode Power Station]] was officially inaugurated, the first of several large scale hydroelectric power plants that the National Electrification Law established in its project to supply [[electric power]] to the large consumption centres, such as [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]]. From that moment on, the Tejo Power Station became a reserve plant, limiting its operation to years of drought or complicated water situations, and as a support system for the national electric grid. However, it continued to produce power, although operating only one turbo set and two high pressure boilers.

From 1951 to 1968, it worked every year except in 1961. 1953 was an especially difficult year due to a lack of water supply, which meant the Tejo Power Station had to work for almost the entire year, often overburdened in order to satisfy demand not only from its own distribution network but also to support the national grid. It was also during the 1960s that all the low pressure equipment was shut down and dismantled.

The last record of the power station's operation dates 14 August 1972, and is related to the movement opposing the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|political regime]] in government at the time. On 9 August, the high voltage lines that supplied Lisbon with electricity were sabotaged and the city was left without power. The Tejo Power Station was called upon for one week to overcome the problem and produce electricity to supply Lisbon's distribution network. The power station's former workers that had been summoned, some already retired, with all their knowledge and experience, got the Tejo Power Station working once again, feeding coal into boiler number 15 for the last time. 1 200 678 kWh were produced, a residual value that only represented one fifth of the daily consumption demands on the CRGE grid. That is the record that marks the final day of the Tejo Power Station. The noise and vibrations that characterised the operation of this power plant for several generations, were permanently stilled.

Officially, the Tejo Power Station was shut down and declassified in 1975.

== The Electricity Museum ==
{{see also|Electricity Museum (Lisbon)}}
After nationalising the Portuguese electricity sector in 1975, the CRGE's assets were integrated into the new company established in 1976, [[Energias de Portugal|EDP – Electricidade de Portugal]], and the question arose regarding what to do with the old Tejo Power Station, where there was still a large amount of machinery tied to the impressive structure. The proposal was clear: reopen the space as a [[science]] and [[industrial archaeology]] museum.

In the same year the site was declared an '''Asset of Public Interest''', in 1986, the future Electricity Museum's founding team got to work, opening its doors to the general public for the first time in 1990.
The Museum's permanent exhibits tell the story of the Tejo Power Station's process, history and work, as well as relevant aspects in the evolution of [[electric power production]], from the first discoveries to current new forms of producing electricity. The Museum also has a Documentation Centre, a specialised library and a research and conservation service pertaining to a great variety of electricity-related equipment, thus consolidating the historic study of electricity in [[Portugal]] and perpetuating its memories and facts.

Between 2001 and 2005, as a response to its declining state of [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], the power station underwent restoration work. Its facades and interiors were cleaned, its iron structure reinforced, thousands of bricks were replaced and the [[Museology|museographic]] content was altered, as is visible today and can be confirmed by visiting the space, the old Tejo Power Station, now an Electricity Museum.

'''The Conference Board, Inc.''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] business membership and research group organization. It counts approximately 1,200 public and private corporations and other organizations as members, encompassing 60 countries. The Conference Board convenes conferences and peer-learning groups, conducts economic and business management research, and publishes several widely tracked [[economic indicator]]s.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1916 as the National Industrial Conference Board (NICB). At the time, tensions between labor and management in the United States were seen as potentially explosive in the wake of the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 and the [[Ludlow Massacre]] in 1914. In 1915 presidents of twelve major corporations in the United States and six leading industry associations met in Yama, New York to formulate the business community’s response to continued labor unrest and growing public criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Tranger, James. The New York Chronology: The Ultimate Compendium of Events, People and Anecdotes from the Dutch to the Present. {{ISBN|978-006052341-1}}. p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

After additional crisis meetings, the National Industrial Conference Board was officially founded May 5, 1916, at the Hotel Gramatan in [[Bronxville, New York]].&lt;ref name="conference-board.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conference-board.org/pdf_free/TCB_HistoryTimeLine.pdf|title=Conference Board timeline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of the organizations’ founders—including former [[AT&amp;T]] president [[Frederick Perry Fish|Frederick P. Fish]] and [[General Electric]] executive [[Magnus W. Alexander]], its first president—had supported the [[open shop|open-shop movement]], by 1916 they regarded national unions such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] as permanent fixtures of the American economy, and urged negotiation and concord.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;“History.” National Industrial Conference Board Records. Hagley Museum and Library. http://www.hagley.org/library/collections/manuscripts/findingaids/acc1057nic.htm#99bio&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] in 1917, the [[National War Labor Board (1918–1919)|National War Labor Board]] formed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked the NICB to formulate plans that would keep war industries running and strife-free. Its recommendations—based on cooperation between representatives of employers, employees, and government—were adopted in full.&lt;ref name="conference-board.org"/&gt; During and after the war, the NCIB conducted pioneering research into [[workers' compensation]] laws and the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], and established the U.S. [[Cost of Living Index]]. Though often mistrusted in its early years as an “employers union” funding studies against the labor movement,&lt;ref&gt;Laue, J. Charles. “Labor and Capital to Battle over Unionsm”. ''New York Times''. October 31, 1926. http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C16F83D5D13738DDDA80B94D8415B868EF1D3&lt;/ref&gt; the non-profit NICB was also seen “as a spokesman for the so-called progressive wing of the business community [and] produced hundreds of research reports on economic and social issues facing the United States.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The organization today remains funded by the contributions of members, often [[Fortune&amp;nbsp;500]] companies. By the 1930s, however, it had already lost most of its character as an industry lobby. [[Virgil Jordan]], a writer and economist who replaced Alexander as president on the latter’s death in 1932, established a Bureau of Economic Audit and Control to offer members and the public an independent source of studies on unemployment, [[pension]]s, healthcare, and related issues in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], when many questioned the credibility of the government’s economic statistics.&lt;ref name="conference-board.org"/&gt; Unions soon joined the NICB alongside corporations for access to its research, conferences, and executive network.

The organization is now considered an unbiased “trusted source for statistics and trends, second only to perhaps the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, Carol. “Conference Board: A Trusted Resource.” Chicago Tribune. March 8, 1987. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-08/news/8701180829_1_conference-board-labor-economist-fabian-linden&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], The Conference Board—the shortened name adopted in 1970—expanded to non-U.S. members for the first time. Today, it has offices in [[Brussels]], [[Beijing]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Singapore]]. [[The Conference Board of Canada]] was spun off as an independent non-profit in 1981.

==Economic indicators==
The Conference Board publishes a number of regular indicators for United States and international economies that are widely tracked by investors and policy makers. They include:

* '''[[Consumer Confidence Index|U.S. Consumer Confidence Index]]''' – Begun by The Conference Board in 1967, this monthly survey of 5,000 households is widely established as the leading measure of American consumer confidence.&lt;ref&gt;“Consumer Confidence: An Online NewsHour Special Report.” The Newshour with Jim Lehrer. PBS. May 2001. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/jan-june01/confidence_5-29.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from the household survey are tabulated to provide a barometer of the U.S. economy (currently indexed to the year 1985 = 100).
* '''[[Economic indicator#Leading indicators|Leading Economic Indexes]]''' – In the 1960s, the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Commerce]] began researching and releasing [[business cycle indicators]], which use composite data points (including manufacturing, construction, and stock market indicators) to time economic expansions, recessions, and recoveries. In December 1995, The Conference Board took over the business indicator program from the government and continues to publish leading, coincident, and trailing indexes for the U.S.&amp;nbsp;economy each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/conferenceboard/conferenceboard2.asp#axzz1tSSqJlKQ|title=Conference Board: Composite Index Of Leading Indicators|date=12 April 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After going private, the program was also expanded to other countries; The Conference Board currently publishes leading, coincident, and trailing indexes for the UK, France, Germany, Spain, [[South Korea]], Japan, China, Mexico, and the Euro Area.
* '''Employment Trends Index''' – Created in 2008, the Employment Trends Index aggregates eight separate indicators and “offers a short-term, forward look at employment [that] gives economists and investors a new forecasting tool. It also helps business executives sharpen their short- to medium-term hiring and compensation planning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conference-board.org/pdf_free/press/TechnicalPDF_4505_1338723525.pdf |title=Press release |website=www.conference-board.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Help Wanted OnLine''' – The Help Wanted OnLine program uses crawler technology to survey job openings posted on approximately 1,000 online job boards. The monthly data series compares labor supply (job vacancies) against demand (unemployed workers) to determine the tightness of the job market for individual metro areas and occupation categories.  The online program is the successor of the Help Wanted Advertising Index, which surveyed print newspaper ads.
* '''CEO Confidence Survey''' – The quarterly Measure of CEO Confidence gauges the outlook of chief executives in their own industries and the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceoconfidencesurvey.asp#axzz1zl8O7NeG|title=CEO Confidence Survey|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=19 June 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also releases regular global and regional growth outlooks and commentaries on economic news. In 2008, The Conference Board named Professor Bart van Ark of the [[University of Groningen]] as its first non-U.S. chief economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/corporate/nieuws/archief/archief2008/persberichten/038_08?lang=en|title=Bart van Ark named as Chief Economist of The Conference Board - News articles - News and Events - About us - University of Groningen|website=www.rug.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and services==
In addition to research reports, The Conference Board organizes conferences, leadership events, and professional peer networks. It is a leading source of knowledge about [[corporate governance]], corporate performance, [[business ethics]], corporate security, [[human resources management]] and [[corporate social responsibility|global corporate citizenship]], grouped into four major practice areas:

* '''Corporate Leadership''' including corporate governance,philanthropy &amp; citizenship, and sustainability. 
* '''Economy &amp; Business Environment''' including economic indicators, consumer dynamics, innovation, and global value chains.
* '''Human Capital''' including diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, analytics, labor markets, and strategic [[workforce planning]].

The Conference Board also published a magazine of ideas and opinion, which was called Across the Board from 1976 to 2006 and [http://www.tcbreview.com ''The Conference Board Review''] until June 2014, when production ceased. In 2003, The Conference Board's Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise, which included 12 prominent leaders from business and other sectors of society, issued a wide-ranging series of recommendations to help restore public trust in companies, their leaders and the capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/pdf/confboardcptpe.pdf |title=The Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these recommendations have been adopted. In 2009, The Conference Board convened a task force on executive compensation.

In February 2012, The Conference Board launched [[The Demand Institute]] in collaboration with [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]]. The Demand Institute is a non-profit, non-advocacy organization focused on helping business and government leaders understand how consumer demand is evolving and shifting around the world.

In January 2015, the [[Committee for Economic Development]] (CED) merged with The Conference Board, given the many synergies between the two organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-conference-board-to-merge-with-the-committee-for-economic-development-300020593.html|title=The Conference Board to Merge with the Committee for Economic Development|first=The Conference|last=Board|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are non-partisan, non-lobbying, and have members comprised mainly from the business community. CED's trusted policy voice in the nation's capital of Washington, D.C. expands the reach of The Conference Board's research; The Conference Board's economic data further strengthens CED's policy solutions.

'''''Trans World''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] computer game for the [[Commodore 64]] published by [[Starbyte Software]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

==Summary==
The player takes control of a new [[trucking company]] and competes against up to either three other human or computer players to make the most money. The game has two modes to choose from, a continuous play mode that plays indefinitely or a [[game mode|timed mode]] that runs a select number of turns. Players control all aspects of the company from purchasing new trucks to hiring [[mechanic]]s to building new [[office]]s. Each round of the game controls one day of game time with each player taking a turn. Periodically, a random event will happen which can either help or hinder the player's company. Some events are offers to have goods delivered while others are [[sick day]]s that skip the player's turn. The game ends when a player chooses to end it or when the selected number of rounds have been completed. The winner is the player with the most money at the game's end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">The '''Ukrainian Internet Association''' (UIA) was founded in November 2000 in [[Kiev]], the capital of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="ccrc-offence" /&gt; It currently owns the Ukrainian Internet Exchange Network ([[UA-IX]]) network, which is the biggest [[internet exchange]] network in Ukraine. Additionally, in February 2010 it has announced a bid for a company that would monitor Ukrainian internet users population, in addition to two other companies that also monitor it, namely [[Internet Advertisement Association of Ukraine]] and [[Bigmir.net]].

In June 2006 the UIA warned that proposed increased government regulation of the internet in Ukraine would amount to censorship.&lt;ref name="pr-censorship" /&gt; It had made similar complaints previously in October 2003.&lt;ref name="if-complains" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ifee-secret police" /&gt; On 17 July 2003 the government of Ukraine requested service providers to install equipment which would allow all internet traffic to be monitored. The UIA said this was an "unacceptable breach of privacy for Internet users" and that such action was, under then-existing law, illegal.&lt;ref name="rfe-concern" /&gt;

In March 2004 the UIA announced the formation of a committee that would "carry out development of recommendations on conscientious use of the Internet and methods of Internet offences prosecution on the basis of current Ukrainian law."&lt;ref name="ccrc-offence" /&gt;

EuropeMedia has called the UIA "the oldest and one of the most influential organisations in Ukrainian Internet".&lt;ref name="em-left out" /&gt;

A '''referendum on partially repealing the law on public enterprises''' was held in [[Uruguay]] on 13 December 1992.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=uy011992 Uruguay, 13 December 1992: Partial repeal of the law on public enterprises] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed repeal was approved by 73% of voters.

==Background==
On 10 January 1991 the [[General Assembly of Uruguay|General Assembly]] passed law 16,211 (Law on Public Enterprises), which allowed for the [[privatisation]] of some state enterprises.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Two attempts were made to gain enough support to force a referendum, with a quorum of 25% of registered voters required - equivalent to 589,823 voters. The first attempt gained 448,265 in favour for a partial repeal and 21,473 for a full repeal. The second effort obtained 693,668 for a partial repeal and 14,960 for a full repeal. On 15 October 1992 the [[Electoral Court of Uruguay|Electoral Court]] decided on a referendum on a partial repeal.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Unevaluated votes were those cast by voters outside of their local polling station. They would have been examined after a court had decided on their validity, but as the result was already clear, they were not counted.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4950">'''William Grant''' (18 December 1839 – 1923) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[distiller]] and [[entrepreneur]] who founded [[William Grant &amp; Sons]], the manufacturer of [[Glenfiddich]], as such, the first company in the world to market a true single malt whisky and a leading brand today.

==Life==
Grant was descended from [[Clan Grant]], which arrived in [[Strathspey, Scotland|Speyside]] after being rewarded with land for "services to the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grant's Story - Early Years |publisher=William Grant &amp; Sons Ltd  |url=http://www.grantswhisky.com/the_grants_story/fam_history_early.asp |accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1745, three brothers fought in the Jacobite rebellion against Hanover. Alexander Grant survived the [[Battle of Culloden]] but had to flee to [[Banffshire]] where he was hidden by a clan chief.

Alexander Grant's great-grandson, William Grant, was born in 1839 in [[Dufftown|Dufftown, Scotland]]. When he was seven he began herding the family cattle in the hills. He then worked as an apprentice shoemaker and a limeworks employee. He did, however, receive a good education. Consequently, in 1866 he became a bookkeeper at the local Distillery. He gained an appreciation for the production of whisky and became manager of the distillery, where he worked for 20 years. His wife, Elizabeth, had nine children.

Throughout this period of his life he saved money to set himself up as a distiller. In 1886, he quit his job, purchased the necessary land, materials and machines, and built the [[Glenfiddich]] Distillery with the help of his 9 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Discover our heritage |publisher=William Grant &amp; Sons Ltd |url=http://www.glenfiddich.us/distillery/index.html |accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Christmas]] day in 1887, his distillery began operation, pioneering single malt Scotch whisky. Until Glenfiddich only blended brands were common.

Glenfiddich whisky from [[William Grant &amp; Sons]] proved successful and so in 1892 he built a second distillery next door in Dufftown, known as the [[Balvenie]] Distillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Lord Cameron of Lochbroom |title= OPINION OF LORD CAMERON OF LOCHBROOM in the cause WILLIAM GRANT &amp; SONS LIMITED AND OTHERS, Pursuers; against GLEN CATRINE BONDED WAREHOUSE LIMITED AND OTHERS |publisher=Scottish Courts |date=1999-02-19 |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/Cam1501.html |accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Isabella married Charles Gordon, the company's first salesman.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} In 1909, Charles Gordon began travelling to export Glenfiddich around the world. By 1914, he had established distribution networks in 30 countries, and today the company exports to 180 countries.

==Death==
William Grant died in 1923. In the 2008 [[Sunday Times Rich List]], his family were ranked 86th richest in the UK, and 3rd richest in Scotland. In the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2013]], the Grant and Gordon family were listed as the second richest family in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;http://features.thesundaytimes.co.uk/richlist/2013/live/richlist/view/group17#list&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yrjö Waldemar Vesa''' (12 April 1898 — 4 December 1967) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Vesa was born and he did his studies in [[Helsinki]]. Following his graduation as [[Mechanical Engineer]] in 1921 he worked in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and United States in [[engineering]] and [[automotive]] companies. He returned in Finland in 1927 working for the following five years for [[Tampella|Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy]] in [[Tampere]].

Yrjö Vesa started his career in Helsinki-based engineering company [[Kone ja Silta]] in 1932. The company was taken over by [[Wärtsilä]] and by time Vesa became manager of Kone ja Silta, and subsequently he was Deputy Director of Wärtsilä until 1947.

During the 1930s and 1940s Vesa was board member and later chairman of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). His most difficult time as negotiator was after the [[World War II]], when [[communist]]s organised several [[Strike action|strikes]] and reached for weight in companies.

Yrjö Vesa became the first manager of state-owned [[Valmet]]. He was involved at starting [[Valmet tractor|tractor]] and [[paper machine]] production, which later grew flourishing businesses. The company's [[shipyard]]s created problems, and when the board wanted to produce ships unprofitably due to employment reasons, Vesa was against it, and became subsequently fired. For the rest of his career he managed an [[insurance company]].

== Early years and studies ==
Vesa's parents were Matti Viktor Vesa and Maria Theresia [[née]] Gustafsson. He did studied in [[Helsingin normaalilyseo|Helsinki Finnish Normal Lyceum]] and did his [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation exam]] in 1917. Vesa continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Finnish University of Technology]] and graduated [[Diplomi-insinööri|MSc]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Already during his studies, in 1919–1920, Vesa had worked as manager of Motor Battalion workshop; he worked as depot manager in 1921–1922. At the same time he worked in patent office under [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]]. In 1922 Vesa moved to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] where he worked as workshop engineer for [[Siemens-Schuckert|Siemens-Schuckert-Werke GmbH]] and [[Protos of Nonnendamm|Protos Automobile GmbH]] in 1922–1924. In 1925 Vesa moved to the United States where he first worked as [[mechanic]] at H. Drexler in [[New York City]], then he became [[draftsman]] at [[American Machine and Foundry|American Machine &amp; Foundry Co.]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Still in the same year he changed to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Co.]] where he worked as draftsman until 1926. During 1926–1927 he was employed by Columbus Die &amp; Tool Co. in [[Columbus, Ohio]] as special tool designer. Vesa returned in Finland in 1927. During 1927–1932 Vesa worked as workshop engineer for [[Tampella|Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy]] in [[Tampere]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== Kone- ja Siltarakennus and Wärtsilä ===
In 1932 Vesa changed to [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] (Kone ja Silta), a Helsinki-based engineering company. He started as manager of [[Separator (milk)|separator]] workshop. Vesa was appointed [[Technical Manager]] in 1934. In 1935 the company was taken over by [[Wärtsilä]]. The Wärtsilä manager [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]] trusted Vesa who had a similar vivid temper and style of making decisions quickly. Wahlforss first made him Deputy Director and in the end of 1936 Vesa was appointed Manager of Kone ja Silta. In spring 1939 Vesa participated in Wärtsilä trade negotiations with [[Soviet Union]]. The negotiations were successful, the company was to get orders for [[steamships]], [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] [[Boiler (power generation)|boilers]] and steam boilers, but the [[Winter War]], that bursted out in the same year, cancelled the agreement.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In 1942, during the [[Continuation War]], Wahlforss appointed Vesa Deputy Manager of Wärtsilä Group. Running up and managing military supply production kept Vesa busy. After the war ended to [[Moscow Armistice]], Vesa negotiated about [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]] as representative of the Finnish war reparation industry.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== Employers' organisation ===
During 1937–1941 Vesa had been deputy chairman in Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and Deputy Board member of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). Wahlforss had been member of board of STK since 1931 and Deputy Chairman in 1937–1942. Despite of requests, he did not want to become chairman. In 1941 Vesa became actual board member of STK and in 1942 he was selected as a chairman. The association manager, [[Antti Hackzell]], was a close friend of Wahlforss and Wärtsilä board member. The strong presence of engineering industry, and Wärtsilä in particular, caused concern amongst the STK [[Forest industry in Finland|forest industry]] representatives, who accused the engineering industry about coup d'état.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In January 1940 STK and the [[trade union]] [[Finnish Federation of Trade Unions]] (SAK) officially recognised each other as representative, negotiating parties. Since then, the employers' side had been expecting initiatives from the union. In spring 1943 SAK proposed a general agreement. The negotiations began with meetings between chairmen of both parties. At the beginning of the process Vesa tried to exclude [[collective agreement]] from the package, but eventually failed; the pressure from the union side was high, and finally, in spring 1944, Vesa had to sign the general agreement, which included a collective agreement.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

After the war against Soviet Union ended in September 1944, labour disputed bursted out as number of legal and illegal [[Strike action|strikes]]. This created challenges to the war reparations industry which had to follow the strict schedule set in the armistice. Moreover, the strikes often included volatile [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]], which were feared to escalate [[riot]]s leading communists rising to power.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

A critical occasion took place in [[Turku]] in spring 1945 when workers of [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard started [[overtime ban]]. According to the armistice, the yard capacity was prioritised to [[Soviet Navy]] vessels which were needed in the Soviet [[East Pomeranian Offensive]]. Many of the Soviet vessels brought to the yard, mostly [[submarine]]s, were severely damaged. The yard workers were tired because of the intense workload and required a such increase to their salaries that it would assure livelihood by normal working hours.&lt;ref name="Knorring: s.119-125"&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Knorring |first1=Nils |title= Aurajoen veistämöt ja telakat |trans-title=Aurajoki boatworks and shipyards |year=1995 |publisher=Schildts Förlags Ab |location=Espoo, Finland |language=Finnish |isbn=951-50-0735-6 |pages=119–125 |chapter=Sodan jälkeen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet military leadership had no understanding towards Finnish labour disputes. [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime minister]] [[Paasikivi]] was afraid that Soviet Union would even occupy Finland if the dispute would not be resolved; he called Vesa into his office and told him that the union action must be ended at any cost. Vesa went directly to meet the communist [[Minister of the Interior (Finland)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Yrjö Leino]], who had been his classmate in the Normal Lyceum. Leino made him a document that included an order to end the action. After Vesa showed the paper in Turku&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt; the overtime ban was withdrawn in March 1945.&lt;ref name="Knorring: s.119-125"/&gt;

Communist minister [[Yrjö Murto]] suggested creating production committees at workplaces. The employers saw it as an attempt to promote [[socialism]]. The employers started countermeasures under Vesa's lead, and finally the Production Committee Act introduced in 1946 defined the committees purely advisory.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

The intense war reparation industry required professional leadership, which was not sufficiently available. Vesa initiated founding of industrial management institute in STK board meeting in 1945. STK collected the funding and the Management Institute of Industry was started already in the following year when it organised ten management courses. Vesa also criticised the contemporary [[Education in Finland|Finnish school system]] in which the children were put to select the line of their studies at an early stage. He suggested creating a such school which would give basic education for the whole generation.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In 1947 Vesa was awarded [[vuorineuvos]] title due to his contribution as company and employers' association. He worked as STK chairman until 1947 when he started as manager in newly formed [[Valmet|Valtion Metallitehtaat]] (State Metalworks) company and he was forced to give up his position in STK; this was due to demand of the political left wing, which at first did not accept membership of employers' association for managers of the state owned companies.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== From State Metalworks to Valmet ===
When Yrjö Vesa started as manager of Valtion Metallitehtaat, it was a miscellaneous group of small companies which had been collected together in 1946. The companies had produced military supplies during the wartime after which they had focused on war reparations. Management and administration of a such arrangement turned out to be problematic, and therefore the state put them under one company, Valmet Oy, which was founded at the end of 1950.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

Vesa was involved at starting [[Valmet tractor|tractor]] and [[paper machine]] production; these divisions grew later successful lines of business.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

The Valmet shipyards caused a lot of problems. During the war they had operated as repairs yards and for the war reparations they had built such ships which other yards had refused to produce. After the war reparations were paid off the yards did not have enough of orders. The government pressed Valmet to produce ships to Soviet Union with unprofitable prices due to employment reasons. The company board decided that the Helsinki yard must get enough of orders from Soviet Union even if they would not be profitable, or cover all the costs. Vesa stood against such business and subsequently he was removed from office in 1954.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

After Valmet, Vesa worked for over ten years as manager for Teollisuuden Auto- ja vastuuvakuutus (Vehicle and Liability Insurance Company of Industry) in 1954–1965.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;
