      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2916">The '''archival bond''' is a concept in [[archival theory]] referring to the relationship that each archival record has with the other records produced as part of the same transaction or activity and located within the same grouping. These bonds are a core component of each individual record and are necessary for transforming a document into a record, as a document will only acquire meaning (and become a record) through its interrelationships with other records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duranti|first=Luciana|title=The Archival Bond|journal=Archives and Museum Informatics|year=1997|volume=11|pages=213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archival-bond|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology, Entry for Archival Bond|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The concept of the archival bond is primarily associated with the work of [[Luciana Duranti]], who first proposed the concept, along with [[Heather MacNeil]], as part of research into the integrity of electronic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duranti|first=Luciana|author2=Heather MacNeil|title=The Protection of the Integrity of Electronic Records|journal=Archivaria|year=1996|volume=42|pages=46–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the archival bond emerges from the fact that electronic records are not physically arranged like traditional records. For traditional, analog records, their bond is implicit in their arrangement. But for electronic records, this bond must be made explicit due to the lack of a single sequential order of records in a digital environment.

The archival bond was one of the core concepts of the subsequent International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems |url=http://www.interpares.org/ |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103050624/http://www.interpares.org/ |archivedate=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found in the InterPARES glossary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The InterPARES Glossary |url=http://www.interpares.org/documents/InterPARES%20Glossary%202002-1.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023647/http://www.interpares.org/documents/InterPARES%20Glossary%202002-1.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Duranti notes, the archival bond is not to be confused with the broader term "context" as context exists independent of a record while "the archival bond is an essential part of the record, which would not exist without it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duranti|title=The Archival Bond|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashrita Furman''' (born '''Keith Furman''', September 16, 1954) is a ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' record-breaker. As of 2017, Furman has set more than 600 official Guinness Records and currently holds 226 records. His most recent record is 26 watermelons sliced on his stomach in one minute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/contact/record-enquiry|title=Record enquiry|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus holding the record for the most Guinness world records.&lt;ref name="GBR-2015" /&gt; He has been breaking records since 1979.&lt;ref name="GBR-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/15/2009-04-15_100th_simultaneous_guinness_world_record_for_ashrita_furman_for_mass_poetry_reci.html |title=New York News, Local Video, Traffic, Weather, NY City Schools and Photos – Homepage |publisher=[[NY Daily News]] |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and records==

===Early life===
Furman was born in 1954 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He was fascinated with the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as a child but never thought he could ever break a record, since he was very nonathletic.&lt;ref name="sc" /&gt;

That all changed when, as a teenager, he became interested in [[spirituality]] and in 1970 became a devout follower of the spiritual leader [[Sri Chinmoy]].&lt;ref name="Kilgannon" /&gt;

Sri Chinmoy inspired Furman to participate in a 24-hour bicycle race in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] in 1978. With only two weeks' training, Furman tied for third place, cycling {{convert|405|mi|km}}.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Around this time, he changed his first name to Ashrita ("protected by God" &lt;ref name="most" /&gt; in [[Sanskrit]]).&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

[[Image:GreatWallAshrita.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Ashrita at the [[Great Wall of China]] in January 2005 breaking the Guinness record for the fastest mile on a [[kangaroo ball]].]]

===First record===
In 1979, Furman set his first official record by doing 27,000 [[jumping jack]]s.&lt;ref name="GBR-2015" /&gt; In 1986, Furman invented and set the record for underwater [[pogo stick]] jumping and introduced it on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on [[April Fools' Day]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Records around the world===
Furman has managed a [[health food store]] in [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="health" /&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] since 1982. He is also a tour manager for his meditation group and is therefore able to travel extensively. As of 2014, Furman has set records in 40 countries. He completed his goal of breaking a record in all seven continents when he set the mile [[hula hoop]] record at [[Uluru]] (also known as Ayers Rock) in the Australian desert in 2003.&lt;ref name = "theage" /&gt; Furman has also set records at such famous landmarks as the [[Egyptian pyramids]] (distance [[pool cue]] balancing), [[Stonehenge]] (standing on a [[Swiss ball]]), the [[Eiffel Tower]] (most sit ups in an hour), the [[Great Wall of China]] (hopping on a [[kangaroo ball]]), [[Borobudur]] (Fastest time to run a mile while balancing a milk bottle on the head) and [[Angkor Wat]] ([[jumping rope]] on a pogo stick). While in [[China]], Furman broke the record for running 8&amp;nbsp;km (4.97&amp;nbsp;mi) on [[stilts]] in the fastest time (39 min. 56 sec.), a record which had stood since 1982.

[[Image:Stone henge.jpg|thumb|500px|left|Furman breaking the record for balancing on a [[Swiss ball]] (2 hours 16 mins 2 seconds) at [[Stonehenge]], July 22, 2003.]]

===Creating new records===

Furman  has also been a pioneer in setting records in several new activities including landrowing. Using a converted [[indoor rower]] with wheels and brakes, Furman rowed {{convert|1500|mi|km}} in 16 days in [[Bali]] in 1991. Furman also developed the sport of gluggling, underwater juggling, which he did for 48 minutes at [[Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium|Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 2002 and distance sack racing, which Furman did for a mile while racing against a [[yak]] in [[Mongolia]] in 2007. On January 30, 2008, Furman unveiled his giant [[pencil]] – {{convert|76|ft|m}} long,  22,000 pounds (with 4,000 solid pounds of [[Pennsylvania]] [[graphite]]). The pencil was built in three weeks as a birthday gift for teacher [[Sri Chinmoy]] on 27 August 2007. Longer than the {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} pencil outside the [[Malaysia]] HQ of stationers [[Faber-Castell]], it was transported from [[Queens, New York]], to the [[City Museum]] in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=87830&amp;in_page_id=34 |title=metro.co.uk, 'World's biggest pencil' draws in a crowd |publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)]] |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009 Furman became the first person to hold 100 Guinness World Records at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5808">'''Ask a Librarian''' is a live [[virtual reference]] service that offers online reference assistance to residents in the state of Florida. Ask a Librarian is an official service of the Florida Electronic Library and is administered by the [[Tampa Bay Library Consortium]] (TBLC).

Participating libraries provide users with virtual reference services via [[live chat]] software, text messaging, and e-mail forms which users can access through embedded links and widgets on their library’s official website. Live chat and text messaging are available from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to midnight EST from Sunday through Thursday, and from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on Friday and Saturday; the e-mail form is available to patrons 24 hours per day, seven days per week.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.askalibrarian.org/about|title=AskALibrarian.org: About|work=Ask A Librarian News and Information|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Ask a Librarian has 133 participating institutions including public libraries and library systems, K-12 libraries, and university and college libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.askalibrarian.org/participating-libraries/|title=Participating Libraries|website=Ask a Librarian News and Information|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ask a Librarian began as a partnership between the [[College Center for Library Automation]] (CCLA) and TBLC in the interest of creating a statewide virtual reference service that would increase the presence of librarians on the internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sachs|first=Diana|date=2005|title=Ask a Librarian: Florida’s Virtual Reference Service|url=|journal=Community &amp; Junior College Libraries|volume=12|issue=4|pages=51–52|doi=10.1300/J107v12n04_06|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=2016-03-18--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the organizations successfully applied for a joint grant through the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA) and were awarded $339,000 for the development and implementation of their pilot project as a service of the [[Florida Electronic Library]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ask a Librarian virtual reference service was officially activated on July 28, 2003.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay-area]] libraries were the first to participate, with [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] libraries joining shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:TTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FCC97A666F1382A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Librarians' Help Offered On Web|last=Richardson|first=Rachel|date=4 August 2003|newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|page=4|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first year of operation, nearly 7,500 Floridians had used the service to get answers from a reference librarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:PBPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104BB78A4408DBED&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Library offering live, on-line help with research|last=Haase|first=Linda|date=25 August 2004|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|page=1 (Neighborhood Post)|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, J. 2010"&gt;Ward, J., &amp; Barbier, P.

Ask a Librarian has made several efforts meet user reference needs on smartphones and other mobile devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="834">'''''Business Aviation Corporation (Pty) Ltd and Another v Rand Airport Holdings (Pty) Ltd''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], dealt with the lessee's entitlement in respect of improvement of lease property. The issue was whether Article 10 of the Rental Housing Act (RHA) applied: Specifically, did it apply in respect of urban and rural property?

The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the RHA applies only to rural tenements; therefore, it was a question of use.

=== Operating system support ===
The [[operating system]]s the archivers can run on without emulation or compatibility layer. Linux Ubuntu's own GUI ''Archive manager,'' for example, can  open and create many archive formats (including Rar archives) even to the extent of splitting into parts and encryption and ability to be read by the ''native program''. This is presumably a "compatibility layer."

'''Notes:'''
# {{note|decompress-only}} Application is only for decompression.
# {{note|tar-compression}} [[GNU]] tar calls the external programs gzip and bzip2 to perform compression; these external programs usually come with systems that contain GNU tar.
# {{note|features-WinRAR}} Allows adding a variable amount of [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] for much better error recovery. See also [[RAR (file format)]].
# {{note|unicode-names}} Extracting/adding file and/or directory names into archive in either [[UTF-7]], [[UTF-8]] or [[UTF-16/UCS-2]] encoding to support single file/directory name which contains characters from different languages.  More recent versions of the zip file format have support for Unicode filenames.
# {{note|winrar-7z}} In WinRAR 3.60, when opening 7-Zip archives which contains Unicode file/directory names, they will not be displayed correctly. There will be no problem extracting them, however.
# {{note|powerarchiver}} Does support Unicode names, but not under the default (initial) option settings: the user must tick "Use OEM conversion for filenames" under "General" on the "Miscellaneous" tab in the Configuration dialog to enable Unicode name support. Full support for Unicode files names by default is supported only for 7-Zip and RAR archive formats.
# {{note|features-ALZip}} Commandline batch compression is available only for ZIP and ALZ formats.
# {{note|unicode-peazip}} UTF-8 file/path-names support was completed in release 3.0.1 on Unix systems, and in release 5.8.0 on Windows systems. GUI UTF-8 support for full internationalization of the application was completed in release 2.2.0. Optionally, extended characters can be set to be replaced by jolly "?" character for exporting scripts to legacy systems; scripts creation screen informs if commands are ANSI-safe, OEM-codepage-safe (on Windows), or requires UTF-8 compliant environment to run (system, command interpreter, etc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peazip.sourceforge.net/peazip-free-archiver.html|title=Learn more - PeaZip free file archiver utility|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{note|batch-winzip}} Commandline batch compression and expansion requires free add-on software downloaded from the WinZip website.{{ref}}
# {{note|peazip-encryption}} Peazip supports file encryption and file name encryption, although only in certain types of archives, including its own Pea format, 7-zip, zip and Arc.
# {{note|infozip-shell}} Many shells have built-in zip file support. [[Windows Explorer]] has "Send To"-&gt;"ZIP-compressed folder".
# {{note|infozip-since30}} Since version 3.0 (2008).

=== Archive format support ===

==== Reading ====
Information about what [[List of archive formats|archive formats]] the archivers can read. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the archiver or extensions that provide such functionality. Note that gzip, bzip2 and xz are rather compression formats than archive formats.

'''Notes:'''
# {{note|reading-7zip}} Used to, but no longer does, due to technical and legal issues.
# {{note|tar-compression}} Tar implementations call external programs (like [[compress]], [[gzip]] or [[bzip2]] or any other programs working with [[Stream (computing)|abstract streams]] and supporting the "-d" option) to perform (de)compression, and allowing you to implement your own filters{{ref|tar-custom}}. These external programs may be shipped with your Operating System.
# {{note|tar-custom}} GNU tar lets you implement your own filters [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#index-use_002dcompress_002dprogram-460], allowing you to use other compression programs (p7zip, ...) and filters (GPG, ...).
# {{note|reading-winzip}} Starting from version 11.
# {{note|reading-winzip}} Requires external program. [http://www.winzip.com/wzdifs.htm More info]
# {{note|ArchiveUtility-ISO}} Archive Utility itself is unable to open ISO files, but [[Disk Utility]], which also comes with Mac OS X, is able to mount them as virtual disks.
# {{note|ZipGenius-external}} Requires external program.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003103/http://www.zipgenius.it/eng/?page_id=3]
# {{note|Unarchiver-SITX}} Only partial support for reading proprietary SITX format. [http://wakaba.c3.cx/sup/kareha.pl/1151796773/]
# {{note|reading-arc}} FreeARC uses &lt;tt&gt;.arc&lt;/tt&gt; as its filename extension, but this format is not the same as the [[ARC (file format)|traditional ARC file]].
# {{note|stream-compression}} Supports these formats as compression stream of other archive formats like tar.bz2 or iso.xz but does not support the format as an archive itself.
# {{note|B1 Free Archiver-ARJ}}B1 Free Archiver for Android and B1 Online Archiver support ARJ format.

Information about what [[List of archive formats|archive formats]] the archivers{{Ref label|Extractor|5}} can write and create. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the archiver or extensions that provide such functionality. Note that gzip, bzip2 and xz are rather compression formats than archive formats.

'''Notes:'''
# {{note|tar-compression-w}} Tar implementations call the external programs gzip and bzip2, 7z, xz, ... to perform compression; these external programs usually come with systems that contain tar.
# {{note|writing-tugzip}} Requires rar.exe from WinRAR.
# {{note|writing-winzip}} Requires external program(if you are using WinZip 11.1 or earlier). [http://kb.winzip.com/kb/entry/107 More info]
# {{note|writing-tugzipace}} Requires Ace32.exe from WinAce.
# {{note|Extractor}} The Extractor and XAD are not included in this list because they only expand archives.
# {{note|ALZip}} ALZip can also write to the following formats: BH, JAR, and LZH
# {{note|zipgenius-updating}} Updating archives is not supported.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003103/http://www.zipgenius.it/eng/?page_id=3]
# {{note|zipgenius-external}} Requires external program.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003103/http://www.zipgenius.it/eng/?page_id=3]
# {{note|StuffIt}}Stuffit supported file formats [https://web.archive.org/web/20081227045316/http://my.smithmicro.com/stuffitcompression/fileformats.html]
# {{note|writing-ark}} Ark is a [[front end processor (program)|front-end]] only and requires appropriate command-line programs be installed. Programs like bzip2, gzip, tar, zip usually come with systems that contain Ark; writing in [[.rar]] format requires a [[non-free software|commercial]] program. [http://utils.kde.org/projects/ark/]
# {{note|writing-xarchiver}} Xarchiver is a front-end only and requires appropriate command-line programs be installed. Programs like bzip2, gzip, tar, zip usually come with systems that contain Xarchiver; writing in .rar format requires a commercial program. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629200239/http://xarchiver.xfce.org/doc/ch01.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20090629195522/http://xarchiver.xfce.org/doc/ch03s03.html]
# {{note|writing-archivemanager}} Archive Manager is a front-end only and requires appropriate command-line programs be installed. Programs like bzip2, gzip, tar, zip usually come with systems that contain Archive Manager. writing in .rar format requires a commercial program.[http://fileroller.sourceforge.net/features.html]
# {{note|writing-7-Zip}} If there are more than one, files must be grouped in a .tar before being compressed.
# {{note|writing-bsdtar}}  supports the formats as stream compression of  other archive format and can create compressed format like tar.bz2 or iso.xz but cannot create an archive in these formats
# {{note|writing-war}} it is possible to open war and jar files to extract e add/replace file; files war and jar are still valid after that

==== Uncommon archive format support ====
PeaZip has full support for various LPAQ and [[PAQ]] formats, QUAD and BALZ (highly efficient [[ROLZ]] based compressors), [[FreeArc]] format, and for its native [[List of archive formats|PEA]] format.
 
7-Zip includes read support for [[.msi]], [[cpio]] and [[xar (archiver)|xar]], plus Apple's [[Apple Disk Image|dmg]]/[[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] disk images and the [[deb (file format)|deb]]/[[RPM Package Manager|.rpm]] package distribution formats; beta versions (9.07 onwards) have full support for the LZMA2-compressed .[[xz]] format.&lt;ref name="7zipHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.7-zip.org/history.txt | title =HISTORY of the 7-Zip | publisher =www.7-zip.org | date =2010-04-15 | accessdate =2010-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33986">This is a list of [[free and open-source software]] for [[geophysics|geophysical]] data processing and interpretation. The list is split into broad categories, depending on the intended use of the software and its scope of functions.

Notice that 'free and open-source' requires that the source code is available. Simple being 'free of charge' is not sufficient—see [[gratis versus libre]]. The reader interested in freeware (just free of charge) software is referred to the [[list of freeware geophysics software]].

==Reflection seismic processing packages==
These are full-featured [[reflection seismology]] processing packages, with support for modeling, imaging, and inversion. They are relatively low-level and in some cases have their own data formats and involve learning an extensive syntax or meta-language.

The following projects are not [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]]. They have unknown licensing, licenses which place some restriction on use or redistribution, or depend on non-open-source software like [[MATLAB]], and thus do not meet the [[Open Source Definition]] from the [[Open Source Initiative]]. (For example, the license may rule out use by certain people or for certain purposes, e.g., in a commercial context.) They are included here because they may be of interest for those in an academic environment or access to tools like MATLAB.

'''''Diceman''''' was a short-lived British comic which ran for five issues in 1986. It was a spin-off from ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and was devised by [[Pat Mills]], who also wrote almost all of the stories. It was edited by [[Simon Geller (comics)|Simon Geller]], but purported to be edited by a monster called Mervyn. The stories were designed to be played like [[gamebook]]s. Each issue contained two or three such stories and was published every two months.

==Stories==

The comic mostly contained stories based on characters who already appeared regularly in ''2000 AD''. Its [[eponymous]] character Diceman, also known as Rick Fortune, was created specially for the comic (by Pat Mills and [[Graham Manley]]), but did not appear until the second issue. Fortune was a "psychic investigator", a 1930s American private detective with [[psionics|psionic powers]]. He also had a pair of stone dice, recovered from the ruins of [[Atlantis]], which he could use to summon various powers including a three-headed lizard demon called Astragal to assist him. The ''Diceman'' strip was different from the others in that the reader not only had to avoid being killed, he also ran the risk of being driven insane (if his "sanity score" dropped to zero).

The only other story in the comic which was not derived from ''2000 AD'' was "You are [[Ronald Reagan]] in: ''Twilight's Last Gleaming''", a satirical spoof in which the reader, playing the part of the American president, must prevent nuclear war breaking out. In contrast to the strip Diceman, this strip also had a sanity score, but if it got too ''high'', then the Secret Service assume that the president must have been replaced with an imposter (a comment on Reagan's perceived intellectual limitations). This game was exceptionally difficult compared with the others in the comic, as the player must make irrational decisions to avoid arrest and execution, while trying to make the right decisions to prevent a nuclear launch by either side. In fact the player transpires to have very little control over the outcome, and almost every option inevitably results in [[World War III]], suggesting that nuclear diplomacy is very difficult to control once [[Cold War]] tensions have begun.

The other strips which appeared in ''Dice Man'' were ''[[Judge Dredd]], [[Nemesis the Warlock]], [[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]], [[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]]'' and ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.

'''Ethel Tobach''' (November 7, 1921 – August 14, 2015)&lt;ref name=nabs/&gt; was a Soviet [[psychologist]] known for her work in [[comparative psychology|comparative]] and [[peace psychology]].&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenberg |first=Gary |date=2015-01-01 |title=Ethel Tobach, November 7, 1921 – August 15, 2015 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/86j6n2w8 |journal=International Journal of Comparative Psychology |language=en |volume=28 |issue=1 |issn=0889-3667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKay |first=Susan A. |last2=Roe |first2=Mícheál D. |last3=Wessells |first3=Michael G. |date=2008 |title=Pioneers in U.S. Peace psychology: Ethel Tobach. |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1080/10781910701839643 |journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology |language=en |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1080/10781910701839643 |issn=1532-7949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life and education==
Tobach was born on November 7, 1921 in Miaskovka, [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which was then part of the [[Soviet Union]]. Both of Tobach's parents were [[Jew]]ish, which led to them and their daughter having to flee the country to avoid [[pogrom]]s soon after Tobach was born. They initially fled to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], but after Tobach's father died when she was nine months old, she and her mother moved to [[Philadelphia]] in the [[United States]]. Tobach and her mother lived in Philadelphia until they moved to [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when Tobach was ten years old. She became interested in psychology after enrolling at [[Hunter College]] in 1937. She received her B.A. from Hunter College in 1949, graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She then enrolled at [[New York University]] (NYU), where she received her M.A. in 1952 and her Ph.D. in 1957 under the supervision of [[T. C. Schneirla]].&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=feministvoices&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.feministvoices.com/ethel-tobach/ |title=Ethel Tobach |last=Lewis |first=Rokisha |website=Psychology's Feminist Voices |language=en |access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After taking one of Schneirla's comparative psychology class at NYU, in which she got an A, Tobach persuaded Schneirla to give her a job at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. She would continue to work at the American Museum of Natural History for the rest of her career.&lt;ref name=feministvoices/&gt; During her career, she also served on the faculty of NYU, Hunter College, the [[CUNY]] [[Graduate Center, CUNY|Graduate Center]], and [[Yeshiva University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGAeCwAAQBAJ |title=Comparative Psychology: A Handbook |last=Greenberg |first=Gary |last2=Haraway |first2=Maury M. |date=September 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136794513 |pages=18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Positions in learned societies===
In 1964, she was a co-founder of the [[Animal Behavior Society]].&lt;ref name=nabs/&gt; In 1972, she became vice president of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=feministvoices/&gt; In 1983, she and Gary Greenberg founded the [[International Society for Comparative Psychology]]. She subsequently served as the Society's first president.&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt; In 1984, she was named president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA)'s Division of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, holding this position until 1985. She was the president of the [[Eastern Psychological Association]] from 1987 to 1988.&lt;ref name=feministvoices/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Tobach-Ethel |title=Ethel Tobach  |website=Jewish Women's Archive |language=en |access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she served as president of the APA's Division of Peace Psychology.&lt;ref name=feministvoices/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Tobach received the [[Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues]]' Kurt Lewin Award, the society's most prestigious award, in 1993. In 2003, she received the APA's Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Psychology in the Public Interest.&lt;ref name=feministvoices/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Tobach married Charles Tobach, a photojournalist, in 1947; he subsequently persuaded her to apply to the Ph.D. program in psychology at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenberg |first=Gary |date=January 2016 |title=Ethel Tobach (1921–2015) |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2016-00913-008 |journal=American Psychologist |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in her sleep on August 14, 2015 in [[Wayland, MA|Wayland]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=nabs&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.animalbehaviorsociety.org/NEWSLETTERS/60-4/memorial.php |title=Memorials |date=November 2015 |website=Newsletter of the Animal Behavior Society |access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frahang-i Ōīm-Ēwak'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA|[fɾaˈhaŋg iː oːˈiːm eːˈwakʰ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an old [[Avestan]]-[[Middle Persian]] [[dictionary]]. It is named with the two first words of the dictionary: ''ōīm'' in Avestan means 'one' and ''ēwak'' is its Pahlavi equivalent. It gives the Pahlavi meanings of about 880 Avestan words, either by one word or one phrase or by explaining it.

The '''''Gallia Christiana''''', a type of work of which there have been several editions, is a documentary catalogue or list, with brief historical notices, of all the Catholic dioceses and abbeys of France from the earliest times, also of their occupants.

== First efforts ==

In 1621 [[Jean Chenu]], an ''[[avocat]]'' at the [[Parlement of Paris]], published ''Archiepiscoporum et episcoporum Galliæ chronologica historia''. Nearly a third of the bishops are missing, and the episcopal succession as given by Chenu was very incomplete. In 1626, Claude Robert, a priest of [[Langres]], published with the approbation of [[André Fremiot]], Archbishop of Bourges, a ''Gallia Christiana''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana, in qua regni Franciae ditionumque vicinarum dioeceses et in iis praesules describuntur''; cura et labore Claudii Roberti,.... Felicibus auspiciis illustrissimi et reverendissimi D. Andreae Fremyot, archiepiscopi, patriarchae bituricensis, Aquitanarium primatis. Lutetiae, 1626 (BnF catalogue general)&lt;/ref&gt; He entered a large number of churches outside of [[Gaul]], and gave a short history of the [[metropolitan see]]s, cathedrals, and abbeys.

== The Samarthani ==

Two brothers de Sainte-Marthe, Scévole (1571–1650) and Louis (1571–1656), appointed [[historiographer royal|royal historiographers]] of France in 1620, had assisted Chenu and Robert. At the [[assembly of the French Clergy]] in 1626, a number of prelates commissioned these brothers to compile a more definitive work. They died before the completion of their work, and it was issued in 1656 by the sons of [[Scévole de Sainte-Marthe (1571–1650)|Scévole de Sainte-Marthe]], [[Pierre de Sainte-Marthe]] (1618–90), himself historiographer of France, [[Abel de Sainte-Marthe]] (1620–71), theologian, and later general of the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]], and [[Nicolas-Charles de Sainte-Marthe]] (1623–62), prior of [[Claunay]]. On 13 September 1656, the Sainte-Marthe brothers were presented to the assembly of the French Clergy, who accepted the dedication of the work on condition that a passage suspected of [[Jansenism]] be suppressed. The work formed four volumes [[in folio]], the first for the [[archdiocese]]s, the second and third for the dioceses, and the fourth for the abbeys, all in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;The title was ''Gallia Christiana, qua series omnia archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et abbatum Franciæ vicinarumque ditionum ab origine ecclesiarum ad nostra tempora per quattor tomos deducitur, et probator ex antiquæ fidei manuscriptis Vaticani, regnum, principum tabulariis omnium Galliæ cathedralium et abbatarium''.&lt;/ref&gt; It reproduced a large number of manuscripts. Defects and omissions, however, were obvious. The Sainte-Marthe brothers themselves announced in their preface the early appearance of a second edition corrected and enlarged. 

As early as 1660 the Jesuit [[Jean Colomb]] published at Lyons the ''Noctes Blancalandanæ'', which contains certain additions to the work of the Samarthani, as the brothers and their successors are often called. "The name of Sainte-Marthe", wrote Voltaire, "is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud." The edition promised by the Sainte-Marthe brothers did not appear.

== Revision by the Maurists ==

In 1710 the Assembly of the French Clergy offered four thousand livres to [[Denys de Sainte-Marthe]] (1650–1725), a Benedictine monk of the [[Congregation of Saint-Maur]], renowned for his polemics against the Trappist [[Abbé de Rancé]] on the subject of monastic studies, on condition that he should bring the revision of the ''Gallia Christiana'' to a successful conclusion, that the first volume should appear at the end of four years, and that his Congregation should continue the undertaking after his death. Through his efforts the first volume appeared in 1715, devoted to the ecclesiastical provinces of Albi, Aix, Arles, Avignon, and Auch. In 1720 he produced the second volume dealing with the provinces of Bourges and Bordeaux; and in 1725 the third, which treated Cambrai, Cologne, and Embrun. 

After his death the Benedictines issued the fourth volume (1728) on Lyons, and the fifth volume (1731) on Mechelen and Mainz. Between 1731 and 1740, on account of the controversies over the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'', Dom [[Félix Hodin]] and Dom [[Etienne Brice]], who were preparing the latter volumes of the ''Gallia Christiana'', were expelled from [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. They returned to Paris in 1739 and issued the sixth volume, dealing with Narbonne, also (1744) the seventh and eighth volumes on Paris and its [[suffragan see]]s. [[Père Duplessis]] united his efforts with theirs, and the ninth and tenth volumes, both on the [[province of Reims]], appeared in 1751. The eleventh volume (1759) dealing with the [[province of Rouen]] was issued by Père [[Pierre Henri]] and Dom [[Jacques Taschereau]]. In 1770 the twelfth volume on the [[province of Sens]] and [[province of Tarentaise]] appeared, and in 1785 the thirteenth, on the provinces of Toulouse and Trier. 

At the outbreak of the revolution, four volumes were lacking: Tours, Besançon, Utrecht, and Vienne. Barthélemy Hauréau published (in 1856, 1860 and 1865), for the provinces of Tours, Besançon and Vienne, respectively, and according to the Benedictine method, the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the ''Gallia Christiana''. 

The province of Utrecht alone has no place in this great collection, but this defect has been remedied in part by the ''Bullarium Trajectense'', edited by [[Gisbert Brom]], and extending from the earliest times to 1378 (The Hague, 1891–96). 

The new ''Gallia Christiana'', of which volumes I to V and XI to XIII were reprinted by Dom [[Paul Piolin]] between 1870 and 1877, and volumes VI to IX and XII by the publisher H. Welter, places after each metropolitan see its suffragan sees, and after each see the abbeys belonging to it. The original documents, instead of encumbering the body of the articles, are inserted at the end of each diocese under in a section titled ''Instrumenta''. This colossal work does great honour to the Benedictines and to the Sainte-Marthe family. "The name of Sainte-Marthe", wrote Voltaire, "is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud."

== Later works ==

In 1774 the Abbé [[Hugues du Temps]], vicar-general of Bordeaux, undertook in seven volumes an abridgement of the ''Gallia'' under the title "Le clergé de France" of which only four volumes appeared. About 1867 [[Honoré Fisquet]] undertook the publication of an episcopal history of France ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/Catalogue/noticesInd/FRBNF34044240.htm]''La France Pontificale''), in which, for the early period, he utilized the ''Gallia'', at the same time bringing the history of each diocese down to modern times. Twenty-two volumes appeared. 

[[Canon Albanès]] projected a complete revision of the ''Gallia Christiana'', each ecclesiastical province to form a volume. Albanès, who was one of the first scholars to search the Lateran and Vatican libraries, in his efforts to determine the initial years of some episcopal reigns, found occasionally either the acts of election or the Bulls of provision. He hoped in this way to remove certain suppositious bishops who had been introduced to fill gaps in the catalogues, but died in 1897 before the first volume appeared. Through the use of his notes and the efforts of Canon [[Ulysse Chevalier]] three addition volumes of this "Gallia Christiana (novissima)", treating Arles, Aix, and Marseilles, appeared at Montbéliard.

'''Haines v Carter''' [2001] 2 NZLR 167 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the defence of duress, that the party must raise this issue soon after the event, otherwise such a defence will fail due to [[wikt:affirmation|affirmation]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrows, Finn &amp; Todd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Burrows |first1=John |last2=Finn |first2=Jeremy |last3=Todd |first3=Stephen |publisher=[[LexisNexis]] |ISBN=978-192714-954-6 |year=2012 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Haines and Carter were in a relationship, that ended in 1999. The parties agreed for the division of the relationship property be decided by arbitration.

After the arbitrators had made their decision, after Mr Haines had transferred some of the property to Ms Carter, Mr Haines subsequently claimed he was subject to duress at the time, as he claimed Ms Carter had threatened to lodge a complaint against him with the Inland Revenue Department. Mr Haines now disputed any liability for the balance remaining under the arbitration award.

In the High Court, the court refused to consider Haines claim of duress, on the basis that the initial transfer of property under the award, constituted [[affirmed in law|affirmation]].

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that by completing part of the award, he had affirmed the award, and so could not legally claim duress.

The '''Declaration of Independence of Panama''' (Acta de Independencia de Panamá) is the document through which Panama declared its independence from the Spanish Empire on 28 November 1821. It was proclaimed in the Cathedral plaza of [[Panama City]] after a council of leaders had met and drafted twelve points calling for severing Panama's relationship with the Spanish Crown and joining with the newly formed [[Republic of Gran Colombia]].

==Background==
{{main|Independence of Panama from Spain}}

After rebels in the small provincial town of [[Villa de los Santos]] issued the "Primer ''Grito de Independencia de la Villa de Los Santos''" (Shout for Independence),&lt;ref name="Navarro (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Navarro|first1=Dayana|title=El Primer Grito de Independencia|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/panama/nacional/grito-independencia/23819615|accessdate=21 May 2015|publisher=La Estrella de Panamá|date=10 November 2014|location=Panama|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 November 1821, rebels throughout the Panamanian countryside began demanding independence. Using bribes to quell resistance from the Spanish troops and garner their desertion, the rebels gained control of [[Panama City]] without bloodshed.&lt;ref name="McGuinness (2007)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuinness|first1=Aims|title=Path of Empire: Panama and the California Gold Rush|date=2007|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-8014-4521-7|page=19|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=b-ECpNQ66V4C&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open meeting was held with merchants, landowners, and elites, who fearing retaliation from Spain and interruption of trade decided to join the [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] and drafted the Independence Act of Panama.&lt;ref name="Martínez Garnica (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez Garnica|first1=Armando|last2=Quintero Montiel|first2=Inés|title=Actas de Declaración de Independencia|journal=Actas de formación de juntas y declaraciones de independencia (1809-1822)|date=2007|url=http://admonpublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1821_11_28_Actas_Declaraci%C3%B3n_Independencia_Ciudad_de_Panam%C3%A1.pdf|publisher=Reales Audiencias de Quito, Caracas y Santa Fe|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Declaration"==
The Declaration of Independence was drafted on 28 November 1821 by the educator and diplomat [[Manuel José Hurtado]]&lt;ref name="Díaz Villa (1998)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Díaz Villa|first1=Tomás Ernesto|title=November 28, 1821|url=http://portal.critica.com.pa/archivo/112898/opi1.html|website=Critica|publisher=Critica|accessdate=21 May 2015|location=Panama City, Panama|language=Spanish|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consisted of twelve articles. The text is as follows:

:"In a general meeting of all civilian, military and ecclesiastical corporations held today 28 November 1821 at the invitation of the City Council, after more arrested discussions before a large village meeting and under the highest order and harmony were agreed and decreed by common agreement the following items:

#Panama, spontaneously and under the general vote of the people of understanding, is declared free and independent of the Spanish government.
#The territory of the provinces of the Isthmus belongs to the ''Republic of Gran Colombia'', to whose Congress our deputy will promptly go to represent us. 
#Individuals of the troops garrisoned in this place have the absolute freedom to make the choice that suits them, and if they want to return to Spain, they will be provided all the necessary aid for transport to the island of Cuba; in keeping with the honors of war, those that will remain at the ports of Chagres or Portobelo, then shall make the garrisons the possessions of the new government; putting under obligation all the officers, sergeants and soldiers, under due oath, to remain calm, to not accept any bribes, nor to take up weapons against the independent states of America during the present war.
#Spanish patients who are in hospital will be assisted by the government, and once they return to health will presented with the necessary assistance in accordance with Article 3.
#The Head of State of the Isthmus is stated to be Don José de Fábrega, who was colonel with the Spanish armies; all corporations and authorities, civil and ecclesiastical shall be on the same footing that they are currently.
#The Head of State shall take all economic measures that may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace.
#The authorities will give at once the oath of independence, distinguishing next Sunday for its publication with the due solemnity.
#The Head of State, together with the commanders of the troops, will notify the fortress of Chagres and detachment of Portobelo so that the official who presents the orders delivers these points in military style.
#The Isthmus, by means of its representatives, will form the suitable economic regulations for its internal government; and in the meantime they will govern according to the current laws in those parts that do not contradict the current state. 
#For necessary expenses, the political Head of State will create a loan to be recognized as part of the public debt.
#The public debt is recognized by the Treasury and shall be paid under the covenants set forth in its principle. 
#The preceding chapters will be printed and circulated to all the peoples of the Isthmus to cease the disagreements agitating them; sending the help that this capital needs to carry out this glorious undertaking, as they have offered.

[[José Vallarino Jiménez]] was chosen to inform the people gathered in the Cathedral Plaza of Panama City of the Declaration of Independence. The news was received with jubilation. A letter advising [[Simón Bolívar]] of the declaration and Panama's voluntary decision to join with [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] was sent. In his acknowledgement, dated 1 February 1822, Bolívar replied:&lt;ref name="Díaz Villa (1998)" /&gt;

{{cquote|''El Acta de Independencia de Panamá es el monumento más glorioso que pueda ofrecer a la Historia ninguna provincia americana.

[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px| A Jamaican Ital breakfast consisting of [[ackee]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], boiled food, [[breadfruit]], and [[mango]]-[[pineapple]] juice.]]
'''Ital''', also spelled '''I-tal''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɑː|l}}), is food often celebrated by those in the [[Rastafari movement]]. It is compulsory in the [[Nyabinghi]] mansion though not in the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] or [[Mansions of Rastafari#Remi|Remi mansions]]. The word derives from the [[English language|English]] word "vital", with the initial "v" removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eatjamaican.com/ital-recipes/rastafarian-cooking.html Ital Cooking] - EatJamaican.com&lt;/ref&gt; This is done to many words in the [[Rastafari vocabulary]] to signify the unity of the speaker with all of nature. The expression of Ital eating varies widely from Rasta to Rasta, and there are few universal rules of Ital living.
{{Rastafari}}
The primary goal of adhering to an Ital diet is to increase [[Livity (spiritual concept)|Livity]], or the life energy that Rastafari generally believe lives within all human beings, as conferred from the Almighty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robert |first=Shepherd |title=Rastafari Livity: A Basic Information Text: Amazon.co.uk: Kwende Anbessa-Ebanks: 9781872121048: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |id= {{ASIN|1872121047|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common tenet of Rastafari beliefs is the sharing of a central Livity among living things, and what is put into one's body should enhance Livity rather than reduce it.  Though there are different interpretations of ital regarding specific foods, the general principle is that food should be natural, or pure, and from the earth; Rastafari therefore often avoid food which is chemically modified or contains artificial [[food additive|additives]] (e.g., [[food colouring|colour]], [[flavouring]]s, and [[food preservation|preservative]]s). Some also avoid added [[salt]] in foods, especially salt with the artificial addition of [[iodine]], while pure sea or [[kosher salt]] is eaten by some. In strict interpretations, foods that have been produced using chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizer are not considered ital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/rasta/ital_food.shtml |title=Ital Food (Jamaica) |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early adherents adopted their dietary laws based on their interpretation of several books of the [[Bible]], including the [[Book of Genesis]] ("Then God said, "I give you every Seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food." (Genesis 1:29)), the books of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. Along with growing [[dreadlocks]] and the sacramental smoking of [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]], observing a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]] is one of the practices early Rastafari adopted from [[Indian people|Indian]] [[indentured servants]] living in Jamaica. Rastafari's founder [[Leonard Howell]], affectionately called "Gong" and "Gyangunguru Maragh", though not of Indian descent, was fascinated with Hindu practices and was instrumental in promoting a plant-based diet in the Rastafari community of Pinnacle.

==Vegetarianism==
Most expressions of the Ital diet include adherence to a strict [[vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]]. This is based in part on the belief that since meat is dead, eating it would therefore work against Livity elevation. It is also practiced because as strict adherents to natural living, Rastafarian often believe the human being is a natural vegetarian based on human physiology and anatomy. Some adherents to Ital diets are strict [[veganism|vegans]], as they do not consider dairy to be natural for human consumption either.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A., Logan, J. and Rose, J., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BSxNwCzMZ3wC&amp;pg=PA81 Movement and Change: Movement and Change]'', Nelson Thrones, 1997. {{ISBN|0-17-437067-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-17-437067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most strict interpretations also avoid the consumption of rock salt (sea salt can be substituted), and food that has been preserved by [[canning]] or [[drying]], and even prohibit the use of [[metal]] [[cooking utensil]]s. In this case, only [[clay]] and [[wood]] [[cooking pot]]s, [[crockery]], and [[cutlery]] are used. Few adherents of ital follow the strictest interpretation; some Rastafarian do not adhere to them at all.

[[Rastafarians]] do not approve of excessive [[alcohol]] consumption.&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=0892819332 |title=0892819332: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they can drink alcohol in moderation as long as it does not reach a level that clouds the mind or reduces their livity.  Most Rastafari disapprove of [[cigarettes]] due to the serious health concerns associated with their use, and many Rastafari avoid [[coffee]] and other caffeinated beverages, though this is less common. In fact some Rastafari grow their own coffee, sugar, and [[chocolate]].

'''Jolly Jack's Lost Mine''' is a legend about a hidden [[Placer mining|placer mine]] supposed to be located in the [[Boundary Country]] of [[British Columbia]].  The mine has been written about by local historians and various magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| title = "Jolly Jack’s Placer,"Canada West Magazine. Canada West Publications.  Vol. 5, No. 1, Pages 14-23
| date = Winter 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have searched for the lost placer mine of Jolly Jack.  It is a local legend in the Boundary Country.

==Legend==

A prospector named '''Jack Thornton''' had been prospecting many creeks around the city of [[Greenwood, British Columbia]]. Jack Thornton was also known as "Jolly Jack" and had been in the US Navy at one time.  Thornton lived in a cabin located near [[Boundary Creek (British Columbia)|Boundary Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = Geological Survey of Canada
| title = Summary report of the Geological Survey Department
 | year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton discovered a source of placer gold somewhere near Greenwood around 1900.  The gold discovered was coarse and heavy with nuggets weighing an ounce.  This gold was red and heavily oxidized like dark copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = N.L. Barlee 
| title = Gold Creeks and Ghost Towns. Hancock House Publishers.
| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton never revealed the location of the source of his placer gold.  In 1967, May Jones, one of Thornton's surviving daughters left an account at the Greenwood Museum.  May states  "My mother told me that my father really had found something very rich, but where it was he took to the great beyond with him.  It was in the spring of the year. He left home in the morning and was back at night and he had a baking powder can full of nuggets when he came home.  He was old and so was his horse so he could not have gone far.  She said he told her that they had struck it rich at last, but he never told mother where it was, or anyone else. Many have looked for it but none have ever found the place yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = Jones May
| title = Recorded account at the Greenwood Museum Archive of records
| year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

Thornton lived on Boundary Creek and mined many creeks in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = Basque, Garnet
| title = Ghost Towns &amp; Mining Camps of the Boundary Country. Heritage House.
 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local historian [[Bill Barlee]] speculates the [[lost mine]] could not have been Rock Creek or its tributaries such as Jolly, McKinney and Baker because that round trip would require two days travel from Jack's Cabin.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L200&gt;N.L Barlee (1976). Historic treasures and Lost Mines of British Columbia. Canada West Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kettle River and Boundary Creek could not be the location because the gold was too fine and sparse when compared to Thornton's gold.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L200 /&gt;  [[Bill Barlee]] believes the area where Jack found his gold was Fourth of July Creek with its tributaries.  A local prospector in Greenwood named Peter den Hartog claimed he found Jolly Jack's lost mine.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L300&gt;Basque Garnet (2000) Lost Bonanzas of Western Canada. Heritage House.&lt;/ref&gt;    The gold Hartog found in [[Skeff Creek]] matched the characteristics of Jack's gold.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L300 /&gt;  [[Skeff Creek]] is a tributary of Fourth of July Creek and is the reputed location of Jolly Jack's lost mine.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L200 /&gt;

==Skeptics==
Some skeptics claim Thornton did not have a lost source of placer gold.  E. Jacobs wrote about Thornton following his death.  The account was written in the May, 1903 issue of the ''Mining Record''. The article does not indicate that Jack ever had any secret placer location or "lost mine".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = Jacobs E.
| title = The Mining Record. May edition.
| year = 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton lived on a periodical pension allowance from the US government.  Ms. Thornton took in daywork and washing to support the family.  This account does not indicate someone who had an unlimited amount of gold at their disposal.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L300 /&gt; Some local prospectors believe Jolly Jack had gold stashed from older claims he once worked.  This cache was to keep prospectors from spying on his tunnel operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation 
| author = Smith, F. Western
| title = "The Legend Lives on - Jolly Jack Thornton" in Boundary Historical Society 8th report. page 68.
| year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 Jolly Jack wing-dammed a location where Salmon Creek emptied into the Pen d’Oreille near junction with Columbia at Fort Shephard.  Jack recovered a lot of gold from this location and may have cached some it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Matsya''' ({{lang-sa|मत्स्य}}, lit. ''fish''),&lt;!--Do not remove, WP:INDICSCRIPT doesn't apply to WikiProject Hinduism--&gt; is the fish [[avatar]] in the [[Dashavatara|ten primary avatars]] of [[Hindu god]] Vishnu. Matsya is described to have rescued [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] and earthly existence from a great deluge. 

The earliest accounts of Matsya as a fish-saviour equates him with the Vedic deity [[Prajapati]]. The fish-savior later merges with the identity of [[Brahma]] in post-Vedic era, and still later as an avatar of [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=33}}&lt;ref name="Rao124"&gt;Rao pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britmatsya&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Matsya | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369611/Matsya | accessdate=May 20, 2012 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legends associated with Matsya expand, evolve and vary in Hindu texts. These legends have embedded symbolism, where a small fish with Manu's protection grows to become a big fish, and the fish saves earthly existence.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}{{sfn|George M. Williams|2008|pp=212-213}}

Matsya iconography sometimes is zoomorphic as a giant fish with horn, or anthropomorphic in the form of a human torso connected to the rear half of a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}

==Etymology==
''Matsya'' is a Sanskrit word and means "fish".

===Vedic===
The section 1.8.1 of the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' (''Yajur veda'') is the earliest extant text to mention Matsya and the flood myth in Hinduism. It makes no mention of Vishnu, instead identifies the fish with Prajapati-Brahma.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}&lt;ref name="sheth186"&gt;{{cite book|author=Surabhi Sheth|title=Religion and Society in the Brahma Purana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FspAAAAYAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-0-8426-1102-2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central characters of this legend are the fish (Matsya) and [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]. The character Manu is presented as the legislator and the ancestor king. One day, water is brought to Manu for his ablutions. In the water is a tiny fish. The fish states it fears being swallowed by a larger fish and appeals to Manu to protect him.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}} In return, the fish promises to rescue Manu from an impending flood. Manu accepts the request. He puts the fish in a pot of water where he grows. Then he prepares a ditch filled with water, and transfers him there where it can grow freely. Once the fish grows further to be big enough to be free from danger, Manu transfers him into ocean.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}&lt;ref name="Daniélou1964p166"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|authorlink=Alain Daniélou|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C&amp;pg=PA166 |year=1964|publisher=Inner Traditions  |isbn=978-0-89281-354-4|pages=166–167 with footnote 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish thanks him, tells him the date of the great flood, and asks Manu to build a boat by that day, one he can attach to its horn. On the predicted day, Manu visits the fish with his boat. The devastating floods come, Manu ties the boat to the horn. The fish carries the boat with Manu to the high grounds of the northern mountains (interpreted as [[Himalayas]]). Manu then re-establishes life by performing austerities and by performing [[yajna]] (sacrifices).{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}

According to Bonnefoy, the Vedic story is symbolic. The little fish alludes to the Indian "law of the fishes", an equivalent to the "[[law of the jungle]]".{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}} The small and weak would be devoured by the big and strong, and needs the [[dharma|dharmic]] protection of the legislator and king Manu to enable it to attain its potential and help later. Manu provides the protection, the little fish grows to become big and ultimately saves all existence. The boat that Manu builds to get help from the savior fish, states Bonnefoy, is symbolism of the means to avert complete destruction and for human salvation. The mountains are symbolism for the doorway for ultimate refuge and liberation.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}

===Mahabharata===
[[File:The fish avatara of Vishnu saves Manu during the great deluge.jpg|thumb|Matsya pulling Manu's boat]]
The tale of Matsya appears in chapter 12.187 of the Book 3, the ''[[Vana Parva]]'', in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref name="Rao124"/&gt;{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}&lt;ref name="sheth186"/&gt; The legend begins with Manu performing religious rituals on the banks of the Cherivi River. A little fish called ''Matsyaka''&lt;ref name=mmwmatsya/&gt; comes to him and asks for his protection, promising to save him from a deluge in the future.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=33}} The legend moves in the same vein as the Vedic version. Manu places him in the jar. Once it outgrows it, the fish asks to be put into tank which Manu helps with. Then the fish outgrows the tank, and with Manu's help reaches the [[Ganges River]], finally to the ocean. Manu is asked by the fish, in the Mahabharata version, to build a ship and be in it with [[Rishi]]s (sages) and all sorts of grains, on the day of the expected deluge.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}} Manu accepts the fish's advice. The deluge begins, the fish arrives to Manu's aid. He ties the ship to the fish, who then steers the ship to the Himalayas, carrying Manu through a turbulent storm. The danger passes. The fish then reveals himself as [[Brahma]], and gives the power of creation to Manu.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=33}}

The key difference between the Vedic version and the Mahabharata version of the allegorical legend is the latter's identification of Matsya with Brahma, more explicit discussion of the "law of the fishes" where the weak needs the protection from the strong, and the fish asking Manu to bring along sages and grains.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}}&lt;ref name="Daniélou1964p166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1991p177"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=The cult of Draupadī: Mythologies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VncomfRVVhoC&amp;pg=PA177 |year=1991 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1000-6|pages=177–178, 202-203 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puranas===
{{Vaishnavism}}
According to George Williams, there are many versions of the Matsya mythology in the Puranas. The names of the characters, the details, the plot and the message diverge in this genre of texts.{{sfn|George M. Williams|2008|p=212}}&lt;ref name="Glucklich2008p155"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtLScrjrWiAC&amp;pg=PA155 |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971825-2|pages=155–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matsya Purana====
The ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' evolves the legend further, by identifying the fish-savior (Matsya) with Vishnu instead of Brahma.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}} The Purana derives its name from Matsya.

The legend as it appears in section 1.12 states that when a little fish appears to Manu,{{refn|group=note|Manu is presented as the ancestor of two mythical royal dynasties (solar or son-based, lunar or daughter-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Inden|author2=Jonathan Walters|author3=Daud Ali|title=Querying the Medieval: Texts and the History of Practices in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GyRBXRdiOwC |year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535243-6|pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bibek Debroy|author2=Dipavali Debroy|title=The history of Puranas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6oQlAQAAIAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Bharatiya Kala |isbn=978-81-8090-062-4|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} he recognizes Vishnu Vasudeva in the fish. The fish tells him about the impending fiery end of ''kalpa'' accompanied with a deluge. The fish once again has a horn, but Manu does not need to build a boat or ship in this Purana. The gods build it. They build it big enough to carry and save all life forms, and Manu needs to just carry all types of grain seeds to produce food for everyone after the deluge is over. When the great flood begins, Manu ties the Ananta Sesha (cosmic serpent) to the fish's horn. The fish carries everyone to safety.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}}&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=12 January 2013|year= 2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bonnefoy, the Matsya Puranic story is also symbolic though quite different. The fish is divine to begin with, and needs no protection, only recognition and devotion. It also ties the story to its cosmology, connecting two kalpas through the cosmic symbolic residue in the form of ''Sesha''.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}}

In another version of the ''Matsya Purana'', the story is closer to the Mahabharata version. At the end of Kalpa, Brahma is resting and a demon Hayagriva steals the Vedas.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=35}} Vishnu discovers the theft. He descends to earth in the form of a little fish, or the Matsya avatar. One day, the king of Dravida desha (South India) named Satyavrata cups water in his hand to offer it to his ancestors. There he finds a little fish.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=35}} The fish asks him to save him from predators and let him grow. Satyavrata is filled with compassion for the little fish. He puts the fish in a pot, from there to a well, then a tank, and when it outgrows the tank, he transfers the fish finally to sea. The fish rapidly outgrows the sea.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=35}}&lt;ref name="Glucklich2008p155"/&gt; Satyavrata realizes this is no ordinary fish, and asks the fish, "who are you?" The fish identifies itself as Vishnu, and informs the king of the impending deluge. The king is asked to save one member of every species of animal, plant and seeds in a boat and along with all this, a copy of the Vedas. The fish asks the king to tie the boat to its fins with the help of ''Sesha'' serpent. The deluge comes. The fish avatar saves existence. A new cycle of life restarts after the great deluge ends.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=35}}{{refn|group=note|The list of things that Manu carries in the boat varies with the version of ''Matsya Purana''.&lt;ref name="Glucklich2008p155"/&gt;}}

[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|left|Matsya preparing to slay the demon.]]

====Bhagavata Purana====
The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' presents a modified version for the Matsya mythology. The story is presented through a character named Badarayani.&lt;ref name="Rao124"/&gt; At the end of a ''kalpa'', as the world dissolved and was overwhelmed by a flooding ocean, the demon [[Hayagriva]] ("horse-faced" [[asura]]) steals the [[Vedas]] from sleepy Brahma.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}} Vishnu takes the avatar of ''saphari'' fish, dives down to locate the Vedas and the demon, recovers the Vedas from the ocean.&lt;ref name="Rao124"/&gt;

In another version of the ''Bhagavata Purana'' text, the man-fish avatar of Vishnu not only recovers the Vedas from the demon Hayagriva who stole and tried to destroy it, but the avatar also saves the sage Satyavrata, the ''Saptarishis'' (seven sages), animals, seeds of all plant species. In this version of the legend, while swimming and carrying them all to safety, the fish avatar teaches the highest knowledge to the ''[[rishi]]s'' and Satyavrata to prepare them for the next cycle of existence.{{sfn|George M. Williams|2008|p=213}}

====Agni Purana====
The ''[[Agni Purana]]'' version presents the legend through [[Agni]] (fire deity) describing the story to sage [[Vasishtha]].&lt;ref name="Rao125"&gt;Rao pp. 125-6&lt;/ref&gt; Agni describes how god Hari (Vishnu) saved the good from the evil through his fish avatar. As Brahma starts to sleep, an asura steals the Vedas. Meanwhile, Vaivasvata Manu was making his religious offering in Kritamala River, when a small fish appeared in his hand.&lt;ref name="Rao125"/&gt; The fish asked Manu to protect him from larger fishes. Manu accepts the request, puts the fish in a jar. When the fish outgrows it, Manu puts it in a pond, then a lake, finally into the sea. Once there, the fish instantly expands to a gigantic size. Manu then realizes that the fish is Vishnu Narayana, and accepts he was deluded previously. The fish then informs the king that a flood is coming in seven days, to go collect all kinds of seeds and the seven sages, then board the boat that has been made for him.&lt;ref name="Rao125"/&gt; Manu does so. The fish with horn appears. They tie the boat to the horn and the fish saves them. The fish then finds the [[asura]] Hayagriva, slays him, recovers the Vedas and gives it to seven sages and Manu.&lt;ref name="Rao125"/&gt;

[[File:Matsya Raja Ravi Varma Press.jpg|thumb|Matsya with the Vedas as infants]]

==Vishnu avatar==
Matsya is generally enlisted as the first avatar of Vishnu, especially in [[Dashavatara]] (ten major avatars of Vishnu) lists. However, that was not always the case. Some lists do not list Matsya as first, only later texts start the trend of Matsya as the first avatar.&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"/&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Matsya Avatar, ca 1870.jpg|thumb|Matsya pulls Manu's boat after having defeated the demon (circa 1870)]]

Matsya is depicted in two forms: as a [[zoomorphic]] fish or in an [[anthropomorphic]] form. In the latter form, the upper half is that of the four-armed man and the lower half is a fish. The upper half resembles Vishnu and wears the traditional ornaments and the ''kirita-makuta'' (tall conical crown) as worn by Vishnu. He holds in two of his hands the ''[[Sudarshana chakra]]'' (discus) and a ''[[shankha]]'' (conch), the usual weapons of Vishnu. The other two hands make the gestures of ''[[varadamudra]]'', which grants boons to the devotee, and ''[[abhayamudra]]'', which reassures the devotee of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In another configuration, he might have all four attributes of Vishnu, namely the ''Sudarshana chakra'', a ''shankha'', a [[gada (weapon)|gada]] (mace) and a lotus.&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"/&gt; 

In some representations, Matsya is shown with four hands like Vishnu, one holding the chakra, another the shankha, while the front two hands hold a sword and a book signifying the Vedas he recovered from the demon. Over his elbows is an angavastra draped, while a ''dhoti'' like draping covers his hips.&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7|pages=78, 117, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare representations, his lower half is human while the upper body (or just the face) is of a fish. The fish-face version is found in a relief at the [[Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/mysore/kes09.html Hindu Temple, Somnathpur]&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsya may be depicted alone or in a scene depicting his combat with a demon. A demon called Shankhasura emerging from a conch is sometimes depicted attacking Matsya with a sword as Matsya combats or kills him. Both of them may be depicted in the ocean, while the god Brahma and/or manuscripts or four men, symbolizing the Vedas may be depicted in the background.&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"/&gt;

==Comparative mythology==
{{main|Flood myth}}
The story of a great Deluge is found in many civilizations across the earth. It is often related to the [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis narrative]] of the flood and [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"/&gt; The fish motif reminds readers of the Biblical 'Jonah and the Whale' narrative as well;  this fish narrative, as well as the saving of the scriptures from a demon, are specifically Hindu traditions of this style of the flood narrative.{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=35}} Similar flood myths also exist in tales from ancient [[Sumerian creation myth|Sumer]] and Babylonia, [[Deucalion|Greece]], the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] of Americas and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of Africa.&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"/&gt;

[[File:15th-16th century Vaishnavism Vitthala temple Matsya avatar, Hampi Hindu monuments Karnataka.jpg|thumb|Matsya temples are relatively rare, but the iconography is found in Hindu temple reliefs. Above: Matsya on a mandapa pillar in [[Hampi]].]]
Matsya is believed to symbolise the aquatic life as the first beings on earth.&lt;ref name = "Krishna36"&gt;Krishna p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbolic interpretation of the Matsya mythology is, states Bonnefoy, to consider Manu's boat to represent [[moksha]] (salvation), which helps one to cross over. The Himalayas are treated as a boundary between the earthly existence and land of salvation beyond. The protection of the fish and its horn represent the sacrifices that help guide Manu to salvation. Treated as a parable, the tale advises a good king should protect the weak from the mighty, reversing the "law of fishes" and uphold [[dharma]], like Manu, defines an ideal king.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}} In the tales where the demon hides the Vedas, dharma is threatened and Vishnu as the divine Saviour, rescues dharma, aided by his earthly counterpart, Manu - the king.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}}

==Worship==

There are very few temples dedicated to Matsya. Prominent ones include the Shankhodara temple in [[Bet Dwarka]] and [[Vedanarayana Temple, Nagalapuram|Vedanarayana Temple]] in [[Nagalapuram]].&lt;ref name = "Krishna36"/&gt; The [[Koneswaram temple|Koneswaram Matsyakeswaram temple in]] [[Trincomalee]] is now destroyed. [[Matsya Narayana Temple, Bangalore]] also exists.

'''Joseph Maurice Régis Vachon''' (September 1, 1929 − November 21, 2013) was a Canadian [[professional wrestler]], best known by his [[ring name]] '''Mad Dog Vachon'''. He was the brother of wrestlers [[Paul Vachon|Paul]] and [[Vivian Vachon]], and the uncle of wrestler [[Luna Vachon]].

Vachon started his career as an amateur wrestler, participating in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] and winning a gold medal at the [[1950 British Empire Games]]. He made the switch to professional wrestling and spent time in various promotions in the United States while occasionally teaming with his brother Paul. In Portland, Oregon, he received the name "Mad Dog" Vachon. In the early 1960s, Vachon became a main eventer in the [[American Wrestling Association]]. He was one of the promotion's all-time great [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], known for his wild style and intense interviews. He was a five-time [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]]. Starting in the 1970s, Vachon became a fan favourite, particularly in his home province of Quebec.

After a stint in the [[World Wrestling Federation]], Vachon retired from the business in 1986. The following year, he was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. Vachon was highly influential, especially in Canada, and was inducted into numerous professional wrestling Halls of Fame.

==Early life==
Joseph Maurice Régis Vachon was born on September 14, 1929. The godfather was Maurice Picard, his uncle and the godmother was Victoria Ouellet, his maternal grandmother; he was the second child of 13 children of [[Montreal]] policeman Ferdinand Vachon and Marguerite Picard.&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt;  He grew up in the district of [[Ville-Émard]], a working-class borough southwest of Montreal, Quebec.&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; As a child, he regularly attended wrestling shows at the nearby [[Montreal Forum]], where he grew up idolizing local ring legend [[Yvon Robert]]; and at just 12 years old, he had already begun grappling at the area's [[YMCA]]. At the YMCA he was coached by Frank Saxton, a former coach of the Canadian amateur team.&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt; Vachon entered a wrestling course advertised at the back of a comic book, and he began training under Chief [[Jim Crowley]]. He trained hard and even worked in the docks and on the canal to build up his muscle. By age 14, Vachon eventually established himself among Canada's premier amateur grapplers.

At the age of 18, he competed in the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], where he pinned the Indian champion in 58 seconds. Vachon ultimately finished in seventh place at 174 pounds after losing to eventual silver medalist [[Adil Candemir]] of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt; Moreover, it was at the 1948 Olympics where Vachon first encountered an American [[Greco-Roman]] competitor named [[Verne Gagne]]. He rebounded to win the gold medal at the 1950 [[British Empire Games]] in [[New Zealand]]. He then spent several years working as a bouncer at a Montreal nightclub, where he gained a reputation of being willing to fight anyone, before he was encouraged to join the pro wrestling circuit in 1951.&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Wrestling debut===
Vachon initially debuted as a junior heavyweight for Ontario booker Larry Kasaboski; and during his first year as a pro, he won a tournament in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] to claim the North American Junior Heavyweight Title. However, Vachon soon encountered a roadblock when powerful Montreal promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] was hesitant to use him for fear that Vachon would dethrone [[Yvon Robert]], who was still his top drawing card.&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt; Consequently, Vachon then took to the road; and in April 1955, he teamed with Pierre LaSalle to capture the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] Texas Tag Team Titles.

==="Mad Dog" Vachon===
Despite his exceptional grappling ability, Maurice Vachon nonetheless struggled to distinguish himself from the myriad of image-less grapplers during his early years. As a result, he soon took radical measures to differentiate his persona, bulking up to a more plausible 225 pounds while also shaving his head bald and growing a long goatee.&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt; In addition, Vachon would frequently buy local TV time prior to a weekend event, which he then used to boldly proclaim his supremacy while also deprecating his opponent. Such acts of bravado were considered revolutionary at the time, though it was successful in that it attracted attention to Vachon’s new character as well as drawing additional fans to the arena. As a result, Vachon subsequently established himself as a major heel while also portraying a wrestling beast inside the ring who would freely stomp, bite, and pound his opponent into submission. According to Vachon, the name "Mad Dog" was given to him in 1962 by [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] promoter [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]] after a particularly violent match. "During the match I went outside the ring and started to turn everything upside down. A policeman tried to stop me and I hit him too," said Vachon. Afterwards Owen told him, "You just looked like a real mad dog out there."&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt;

Before long, "Mad Dog" Vachon consequently developed a reputation as perhaps the most feared rulebreaker in all of wrestling. Furthermore, Maurice's younger brother Paul - ultimately known as "The Butcher" - soon also made his debut and on February 17, 1959 the Vachon brothers teamed to defeat Chico Garcia and Chet Wallick for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Titles. Vachon's tendency to hurt his opponents with foreign objects, filed fingernails and teeth, and the multiple use of his signature finishing move, the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|Piledriver]], to end matches made him notorious in the business and caused him to be banned in three U.S. states. But it also made his popularity soar among the fans.&lt;ref name="Oliver2007"/&gt;

He also met his future wife Kathie Joe at a wrestling event, after spitting a shoe string he had used for choking his opponent at her, as she was sitting in the audience.

===AWA World Heavyweight Champion===
In the early 1960s, Mad Dog Vachon was then recruited to the [[Minnesota]]-based [[American Wrestling Association]] by his old Olympics acquaintance [[Verne Gagne]], who had replaced Tony Stecher as the region’s chief promoter in 1960 and who also served as its centerpiece champion. Upon debuting, Vachon immediately established himself among the promotion’s top box-office draws as fans despised his vicious, mauling tactics; and he thus made the perfect opponent for the All-American Gagne, as the two rivals soon commenced an ongoing battle that would persist on for nearly 20 years. On May 2, 1964, Vachon stunned audiences when he upset Gagne for the AWA World Heavyweight Title, and although Gagne regained the belt just two weeks later, Mad Dog again recaptured the title when he defeated Gagne on October 20 in Minneapolis. Between 1964-67, Mad Dog Vachon would ultimately hold five reigns as the AWA World Champion while taking on all comers within the promotion's massive territory, including Gagne, [[Mighty Igor Vodic]], as well as the legendary powerhouse duo of [[The Crusher (wrestler)|Crusher Lisowski]] and [[Dick the Bruiser]].&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt;

Mad Dog Vachon’s final AWA title reign came to an end on February 26, 1967, at the hands of his nemesis [[Verne Gagne]]; and he then briefly left the promotion in order to return to his native Montreal territory, where he captured two reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion while feuding against [[Johnny Rougeau]] and [[Hans Schmidt (wrestler)|Hans Schmidt]]. Moreover, Vachon would also leverage his close friendship with [[Montreal Canadiens]] legend [[Jean Béliveau|Jean Beliveau]] to convince the authorities of the Montreal Forum to grant him a promoting license (despite the protests of [[Johnny Rougeau]] and Bob Langevin, who had taken over the region from Eddie Quinn during the mid-1960s). Nevertheless, Vachon would soon return to the AWA, where he resumed his fierce battles with [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]] and [[Dick the Bruiser]], regarded by some as the greatest tag team of all-time, while forming a highly successful and dangerous tandem with his brother [[Paul Vachon|Paul "Butcher" Vachon]]. On August 30, 1969, the Vachons defeated Crusher &amp; Bruiser for the AWA World Tag Team Titles; and the following year, the two battled again in a famous steel cage match at Chicago’s [[Comiskey Park]] (where the Vachons again emerged victorious), as their violent fights ultimately served as the precursor for a new brand of sadistic and vicious brawling that would spawn future mayhem stars like [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Stan Hansen]], and others.

On July 14, 1973, Vachon had a match with [[Killer Kowalski]] for [[Grand Prix Wrestling]] at Montreal's [[Jarry Park]]. The match drew a crowd of 29,127, which is the largest wrestling crowd in Quebec history.&lt;ref name="CBC News"/&gt; Prior to the match, Vachon had vowed to commit suicide if he didn't win. Following Vachon's victory, the headline of a Montreal newspaper read "Vachon triumphs in front of 30,000 people and gives up on suicide!"&lt;ref name="Laprade60"&gt;[[#Laprade|Laprade]], pp. 60–67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
The [[Vachon family]] became prominent in the AWA with sister [[Vivian Vachon|Vivian]] dominating the women's scene, while Maurice and Paul ruled the men's division. In the early 1970s he even appeared alongside Vivian in the motion picture ''Wrestling Queen''. After two decades as one the wrestling's most evil characters, the fans began to rally behind the "Mad Dog" in the late 1970s when he formed an unexpected and odd friendship with ex-archrival [[Verne Gagne]]. The unlikely partners made for an impressive tag team, and on June 6, 1979, they beat [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] &amp; [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]] to capture the AWA tag titles, which they held for over a year before losing to [[Jesse Ventura]] &amp; [[Adrian Adonis]].&lt;ref name="Laprade60"/&gt; When the AWA began looking to younger stars like [[Rick Martel]] and [[Curt Hennig]], Vachon jumped to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1983.  While his age and lack of size did not make for a good mix in the emerging "Hulkamania" era, the now-face (fan favorite) Vachon was usually included at WWF house shows (wrestling cards) in the Midwest and Quebec. He wrestled for the WWF in Canada regularly until 1986, and even contributed to the WWF's French programming by doing a weekly interview segment in French titled ''Le Brunch a Mad Dog''. While contracted with the WWF, Vachon was allowed to participate in events not featuring the WWF while in Canada.

In 1985, he appeared as cornerman for AWA World Champion [[Rick Martel]] when Martel was challenged by [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]] in several title bouts in Canada, getting involved in one match on September 19, 1985 in [[Winnipeg]] and fighting off Zhukov and his manager, Chris Markoff, after Markoff interfered and helped Zhukov attack Martel,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jutzr9ily98 Rick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov - September 19, 1985, Winnipeg] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; while in a later rematch between Martel and Zhukov held in a steel cage on November 14, 1985 in the same city, Markoff was neutralized by being handcuffed to Vachon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI6XqcLPwqk Rick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov Cage Match Part 1 - November 14, 1985, Winnipeg] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UA1bIyJY3c Rick Martel vs. Boris Zhukov Cage Match Part 2 - November 14, 1985, Winnipeg] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Vachon received a retirement show in his native Montreal in September 1986, and he left the sport as one its most beloved fan favorites after spending almost his entire career as a sadistic villain. His innovative portrayal of a snarling, bloodthirsty monster would inspire a myriad of future "psychotic" wrestlers. According to the WWE, "In later years, Mad Dog's legacy was carried on by his niece, the memorably twisted Luna Vachon, and notable brawlers who adopted Vachon's wild ring style like [[Bruiser Brody]] and [[George Steele|George "The Animal" Steele]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/mauricevachon|title=Maurice "Mad Dog" Vachon|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Vachon was known for his wild personality and uncontrollable character, as well as his unique interview style. "He was the first wrestler to understand the power of television. He was the first wrestler to speak to the camera. That was never done before." said Yves Theriault, who directed a documentary on Vachon in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Maurice (Mad Dog) Vachon dies at the age of 84 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/maurice-mad-dog-vachon-dies-at-the-age-of-84/article15545175/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-23|author=Wyatt, Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vachon was also very influential in his home province of Quebec. Pat LaPrade, author of the ''Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs'', a book on Quebec wrestling history, considers Vachon one of the two most important Quebec wrestlers along with [[Yvon Robert]]. He added, "[Vachon is] the best-known Quebec wrestler outside of Quebec. A legend."&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec wrestler Maurice 'Mad Dog' Vachon dies at 84|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-wrestler-maurice-mad-dog-vachon-dies-at-84-1.2435046|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Canadians'', author Greg Oliver ranks Vachon fourth amongst Canadian wrestlers, behind [[Whipper Billy Watson]], Yvon Robert and [[Killer Kowalski]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"&gt;[[#Oliver|Oliver]], 2003, pp. 16–21&lt;/ref&gt; Vachon was also included in Oliver's book on villainous wrestlers and was ranked fourth.&lt;ref name="Oliver2007"&gt;[[#Oliver|Oliver]], 2007, pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and personal life==
Upon retiring, Vachon settled in [[Carter Lake, Iowa]] with his third wife Kathy Joe. Tragedy struck in 1987 when Vachon was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. It was later revealed that he had been struck by a developmentally challenged male driving the country roads looking for cans to recycle while Vachon was out for a morning jog. The man apparently had no insurance and was never charged.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; The Vachons moved to Omaha shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Oliver2007"/&gt; He later turned to acting in beer commercials and was a restaurant critic for a [[Quebec City]] television station.

He appeared at the WWF pay-per-view [[In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies|In Your House 7]], that was held in Omaha. He was sitting in the front row near ringside, when his artificial leg was ripped off by wrestler [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] and used as a weapon&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=194|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Shawn Michaels]]. In addition, he and longtime rival The Crusher made an appearance at the 1998 [[WWF Over the Edge|Over the Edge]] pay-per-view, in a segment where the two legends were mocked by [[Jerry Lawler]], including Lawler trying to steal the artificial leg. Crusher and Mad Dog then punched Lawler out of the ring. He had knee surgery in 2008. On March 27, 2010, he was inducted into the 2010 [[WWE Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

Vachon died in his sleep on November 21, 2013, at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maurice 'Mad Dog' Vachon passes away|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/mad-dog-vachon-passes-26165455|accessdate=2013-11-21|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/sports/mad-dog-vachon-pro-wrestler-dies-at-84.html|title=Mad Dog Vachon, Pro Wrestler, Dies at 84|author=The Associated Press |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-11-23|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had six children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Slam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingVachon/vachon_99may17b.html|title=Mad Dog Vachon has his day on Comedy Network |accessdate=2009-01-19|publisher=SlamWrestling.com|date=1999-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/11/21/maurice-mad-dog-vachon-montreal-born-hall-of-fame-wrestler-dies-at-age-84/|title=Maurice (Mad Dog) Vachon, Montreal-born Hall of Fame wrestler, dies at age 84|publisher=Canadian Press|author=Wyatt, Nelson|work=[[National Post]]|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2013-11-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131129141926/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/11/21/maurice-mad-dog-vachon-montreal-born-hall-of-fame-wrestler-dies-at-age-84/|archivedate=2013-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were cremated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Vachon&amp;GSfn=Maurice&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=2013&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=120639562&amp;df=all&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9203">In [[computer networking]], the '''multicast DNS''' ('''mDNS''') protocol resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local [[name server]]. It is a [[zero configuration networking|zero-configuration]] service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). Although [[Stuart Cheshire]] designed mDNS as a stand-alone protocol, it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.&lt;ref name="rfc6762"&gt;
{{Cite IETF
| rfc = 6762
| title = Multicast DNS
| publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The mDNS protocol is published as {{IETF RFC|6762}}, uses IP multicast [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) packets, and is implemented by the Apple [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] and open source [[Avahi (software)|Avahi]] software packages. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] contains an mDNS implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd.html |title=Using Network Service Discovery |publisher=[[Google]] |access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; mDNS has also been implemented in [[Windows 10]], but its use there is limited to discovering networked printers.&lt;ref name="mdnswin"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://ctrl.blog/entry/windows-mdns-dnssd | title = mDNS and DNS‐SD slowly making their way into Windows 10 | publisher = Ctrl blog | accessdate = 2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

mDNS can work in conjunction with [[DNS Service Discovery]] (DNS-SD), a companion zero-configuration technique specified separately in RFC 6763.&lt;ref name="rfc6763"&gt;
{{Cite IETF
| rfc = 6763
| title = DNS Service Discovery
| publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Kvng RTH--&gt;

== Protocol overview ==
When an mDNS client needs to resolve a host name, it sends an [[IP multicast]] query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself. That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address. All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches.

Any host can relinquish its claim to a domain name by sending a response packet with a [[time to live]] (TTL) equal to zero.

By default, mDNS only and exclusively resolves host names ending with the &lt;code&gt;[[.local]]&lt;/code&gt; top-level domain (TLD). This can cause problems if that domain includes hosts which do not implement mDNS but which can be found via a conventional unicast DNS server. Resolving such conflicts requires network-configuration changes that violate the [[Zero configuration networking|zero-configuration]] goal.

== Packet structure ==

An mDNS message is a multicast UDP packet sent to the following locations:
* When using [[Ethernet frame]]s, the [[Multicast_address#Ethernet|standard multicast]] [[MAC address]] {{MACaddr|01:00:5E:00:00:FB}} (for [[IPv4]]) or {{MACaddr|33:33:00:00:00:FB}} (for [[IPv6]]).
* [[IPv4 address]] {{IPaddr|224.0.0.251}} or [[IPv6 address]] {{IPaddr|FF02::FB}}.
* UDP [[Port_(computer_networking)|port]] 5353.

The payload structure is based on the [[Domain Name System#DNS message format|unicast DNS packet format]], consisting of two parts—the header and the data.&lt;ref name=rfc1035&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=1035|title=DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION|author=P. Mockapetris|date=November 1987|publisher=Network Working Group, [[IETF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The header is identical to that found in unicast DNS, as are the sub-sections in the data part: queries, answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records.

The number of records in each sub-section matches the value of the corresponding *COUNT field in the header.
=== Queries ===
The wire format for records in the query section is slightly modified from that in unicast DNS, adding one single-bit field.&lt;ref name="rfc6762" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ mDNS Query section fields
|-
! Field !! Description !! Length [[bit]]s
|-
| QNAME || Name of the node to which the query pertains || Variable
|-
| [[List of DNS record types|QTYPE]] || The type of the query, i.e. the type of RR which should be returned in responses. || 16
|-
| UNICAST-RESPONSE || Boolean flag indicating whether a unicast-response is desired || 1
|-
| QCLASS || Class code, 1 a.k.a. "IN" for the Internet and [[Internet protocol|IP networks]] || 15
|}

As in unicast DNS, the QNAME field consists of a series of length/value sub-fields called "labels". Each label represents one of the dot-separated substrings in a [[Fully qualified domain name|fully qualified domain name (FQDN)]]. The list is terminated by a single null-byte, representing the "root" of the DNS.

The UNICAST-RESPONSE field is used to minimize unnecessary broadcasts on the network: if the bit is set, responders SHOULD send a directed-unicast response directly to the inquiring node rather than broadcasting the response to the entire network.

The QCLASS field is identical to that found in unicast DNS.

=== Resource Records ===
All records in the answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records sections have the same format and are collectively known as "Resource Records" (RR).

Resource Records in mDNS also have a slightly modified general format from unicast DNS:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ mDNS Resource Record fields
|-
! Field !! Description !! Length [[bit]]s
|-
| RRNAME || Name of the node to which the record pertains || Variable
|-
| [[List of DNS record types|RRTYPE]] || The type of the Resource Record || 16
|-
| CACHE-FLUSH || Boolean flag indicating whether outdated cached records should be purged || 1
|-
| RRCLASS || Class code, 1 a.k.a. "IN" for the Internet and [[Internet protocol|IP networks]] || 15
|-
| TTL || Time interval (in seconds) that the RR should be cached || 32
|-
| RDLENGTH || Integer representing the length (in octets) of the RDATA field || 16
|-
| RDATA || Resource data; internal structure varies by RRTYPE || Variable
|}

The CACHE-FLUSH bit is used to instruct neighbor-nodes that the record should overwrite, rather than be appended onto, any existing cached entries for this RRNAME and RRTYPE.

The formats of the RDATA fields are the same as those found in unicast DNS. However, [[Zero configuration networking#Service discovery|DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)]], the most common use-case for mDNS, specifies slight modifications to some of their formats (notably TXT records).

== Example ==

Trying to &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;appletv.local&lt;/code&gt; host would cause an mDNS client computer to multicast the following UDP packet:
 00 00                      Transaction ID
 00 00                      Flags
 00 01                      Number of questions
 00 00                      Number of answers
 00 00                      Number of authority resource records
 00 00                      Number of additional resource records
 07 61 70 70 6c 65 74 76    "appletv"
 05 6c 6f 63 61 6c          "local"
 00                         Terminator
 00 01                      Type (A record)
 00 01                      Class

The appletv.local host would respond by multicasting its mDNS response packet. For example:
 00 00 84 00 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 02 07 61 70 70
 6c 65 74 76 05 6c 6f 63  61 6c 00 00 01 80 01 00
 00 78 00 00 04 99 6d 07  5a c0 0c 00 1c 80 01 00
 00 78 00 00 10 fe 80 00  00 00 00 00 00 02 23 32
 ff fe b1 21 52 c0 0c 00  2f 80 01 00 00 78 00 00
 08 c0 0c 00 04 40 00 00  08

In its header, the non-zero fields are the &lt;code&gt;Flags&lt;/code&gt; word (84 00), the &lt;code&gt;ANCOUNT&lt;/code&gt; word (00 01), and the &lt;code&gt;ARCOUNT&lt;/code&gt; word (00 02). The data again begin with the FQDN (hex 07 61 70 70 6c 65 74 76 05 6c 6f 63 61 6c 00 for appletv.local), followed by that host's DNS information:

* the A/IPv4 address type code (hex 00 01),
* the IPv4 class code (hex 80 01),
* the IPv4 TTL (hex 00 00 78 00 for 30720 seconds),
* the IPv4 length (hex 00 04),
* the four IPv4 address bytes (hex 99 6D 07 5A, or 153.109.7.90 in dotted-decimal notation),
* the FQDN offset (hex C0 0C for byte 12),
* the AAAA/IPv6 address type code (hex 00 1C),
* the IPv6 class code (hex 80 01),
* the IPv6 TTL (again hex 00 00 78 00),
* the IPv6 length (hex 00 10),
* the 16 IPv6 address bytes (hex FE 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 23 32 FF FE B1 21 52),
* the FQDN offset (hex C0 0C for byte 12),
* the NSEC type code (hex 00 2F),
* the NSEC class code (hex 80 01),
* the NSEC TTL (again hex 00 00 78 00),
* the NSEC length (hex 00 08, for an 8-byte name section record), and
* the 8 NSEC block and bitmap bytes (hex C0 0C 00 04 40 00 00 08)

The '''Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia''' ''' (CANTIC)'''  is an authority union catalogue within the Union Catalogue of Universities of Catalonia (CCUC), that it is led by the [[Biblioteca de Catalunya]]. Its goals are to standardize the access points in bibliographic catalogues, to improve communication among catalogues and mainly, to make easier the information research and retrieval. CANTIC gives a special treatment to name and title authorities related with Catalan culture. These authorities receive a complete authority work and provide, eventually, access to the [[Enciclopèdia Catalana]].

== Definition and aims ==
CANTIC has the aim&lt;ref&gt;FERRAN, Imma. «El Catàleg d'autoritats de noms i títols de Catalunya (CÀNTIC) ». BiD : textos universitaris de biblioteconomia i documentació, Núm. 22 (juny 2009) [Consulta: 1 gener 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; to be the catalogue of authority records created cooperatively by Catalan libraries. These records have to be generated from the authority control of name, name-title and title access points of Catalan bibliographic records. This guarantees the standardization and uniqueness of access points of catalogues, which makes it easier the exchange and a more efficient communication of bibliographic records and, in the end, enables users to carry out assisted, precise and exhaustive searches. 
CANTIC  is a national service that allows to standardize and give consistency to the catalogues of the Catalan library system; it is the tool that facilitates the creation of the future Unique Catalogue of Catalonia (CUC), devised in the frame of the Agreement of the Catalan Government of 20 July 2004, for the improvement and modernization of Catalan Library System&lt;ref&gt;Acord per a la millora i modernització del Sistema Bibliotecari de Catalunya en el període 2004-2007, aprovat pel Govern de la Generalitat de Catalunya el 20 de juliol de 2004.&lt;{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Biblioteques/Tematic/Documents/Arxiu/acordmillora.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412210617/http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Biblioteques/Tematic/Documents/Arxiu/acordmillora.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }}&gt;. [Consulta: 21 gener 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and evolution ==
At a meeting held on 16 September 2002, the Advisory Commission of Cataloguing, the advisory body of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in terms of cataloguing, talked about the need of creating a list of authorities in Catalonia. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to study the technical feasibility of the project and to prepare the requirements and functionality of the list of name and title authorities, taking into account the real needs of the Catalan Library System. The Subcommittee met for the first time on 27 March 2003 and finished the job in October 2003. In the report prepared by them&lt;ref&gt;[http://cantic.bnc.cat/infotec Informe per a la creació de la Llista d’Autoritats de Catalunya de noms i títols: requeriments i funcionalitats, octubre 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; are presented:
# The definition and aims of the list.
# It provides an overview of the state of art in and out Catalonia, and ascertains that the current situation of the authority control of the Catalan Library System does not satisfy the existent needs neither avoids the duplication of tasks, efforts and costs. Following the model of other international experiences, it is stated that a unique authority list in Catalonia, prepared cooperatively, is a feasible project that favours the exchange of bibliographic records and the information research and retrieval. 
# They give the bases for the creation of the Catalan Name and Title Authority List, and comment in brief the cooperative model of a subject authority list, since its operation and organization differ substantially of the name and title list. 
# They specify the requirements and functionalities of the software of Catalan Name and Title Authority List. 
The Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia was created following the Catalan Library System Act,  Llei 4/1993 “La Biblioteca de Catalunya supervisa, valida i unifica en un sol llistat el catàleg d’autoritats"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/CulturaDepartament/SID/Documents/Arxiu/LLEI 4_1993, de 18 de març, del sistema bibliotecari de Catalunya.pdf Llei 4/1193, de 18 de març, del sistema bibliotecari de Catalunya]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==
The participants are the [[Biblioteca de Catalunya]], the Casa Àsia, the Centre de Lectura (Reus), the Consorci de Bibliothèques de les Universitats de Catalunya, the Il•lustre Col•legi d'Advocats de Barcelona, the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art|Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona]], the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona|Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]], the [[University of Barcelona|Universitat de Barcelona]], the [[University of Girona|Universitat de Girona]], the [[University of Lleida|Universitat de Lleida]], the Universitat de Vic, the [[James I University|Universitat Jaume I]], the [[Open University of Catalonia|Universitat Oberta de Catalunya]], the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia|Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya]], the [[Pompeu Fabra University|Universitat Pompeu Fabra]] and the [[Rovira i Virgili University|Universitat Rovira i Virgili]].

== Maintenance and updating ==
The authority records of CANTIC are created following the international cataloguing principles&lt;ref&gt;Regles angloamericanes de catalogació. 2a ed. rev. de 2002, actualització de 2005. Barcelona : Biblioteca de Catalunya, cop. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the specifications of the Biblioteca de Catalunya, which were approved by the CCUC.&lt;ref&gt;Concrecions a les AACR2 Part II (Encapçalaments, títols uniformes, referències), Ed. 2008. Barcelona : Biblioteca de Catalunya, 2008-&lt;/ref&gt; Records are encoded with MARC 21.&lt;ref&gt;Format Marc 21 per a dades d’autoritat Ed. anglesa, Ed. concisa catalana&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a CANTIC guide with the procedure for elaborating the authority records by the entities involved.&lt;ref&gt;Manual CANTIC, actualització 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Bibliographic Standardization Service is responsible for providing training and support to all participants while ensuring the quality of authority records. The constant introduction of new authority records turns CANTIC into a living organism in a permanent process of transformation and change. Updating the content of the database is done monthly and is available on the website of the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Open catalogue''' is an [[open content]] catalogue or [[free content]] catalogue, a structured database with information about products or other stored items in a standardized format. A catalogue implies [[categorization]] or classification of the items involved, and [[database normalization]] to increase the usability of the catalogue for searching &amp; finding, and comparing items within the same category on their main attributes. 

The term was first used by Dr. Martijn Hoogeveen of the [[Open University (Netherlands)]] for the [[Open ICEcat]] project, which resulted in an open catalogue for product information, often used by merchants as input for their [[mail-order catalogue]]. A DTD for  the [[Open Catalog Exchange Format]] is developed by Sergey Shvets and Dimitry Mitko.

'''PowerWord''' ({{zh|s=金山词霸|t=金山詞霸|p=jīnshān cíbà|l=[[Kingsoft]] Word Master}}) is a collection of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], English and bilingual [[dictionaries]] and supporting [[proprietary software]], published on [[CD-ROM]] in [[China]] by [[Kingsoft]], which claims to have 20 million users including 50,000 organisations. Originally produced for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform, it is [http://www.kingsoft.com/download/ now available] for [[Mac OS X]], [[iPhone]], [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java]] for [[S60 (software platform)|Nokia smartphones]], and is available [http://iciba.com/ online]. The CD-ROM often prominently carries the label "CIBA" as well as Chinese characters.

== Basic usage ==

The [[user interface]] can be set to be either Chinese or English. The installer seems to use the system default location. 

Pointing the mouse at any word on the screen cause a small box to pop up with a brief definition and links to access a more expanded definition in the main program, to search the Web for that word using the company's search engine, or to hear the word spoken. The main program contains a text box at the top, into which may be typed (or pasted) an English or Chinese-character word or phrase to access the dictionary entries. If an exact match is not found, then the nearest entry is shown.

A [[speech synthesizer]] is available to read many of the English entries (in an American accent) by clicking on the small loudspeaker. There are natural recordings of some words, while others are synthesized. The Chinese words can also be spoken by using recordings of single syllables (which means there is a problem with fluency when reading words of more than one syllable).

== Problems and criticism ==

The 2002 version of PowerWord contained some [[obscenity|obscene]] English words as default translations of common Chinese terms.  PowerWord corrected this in later versions, but many users failed to upgrade, so the obscene English words were commonly seen in Chinese shop [[signage]] as late as 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005195.html|title=The Etiology and Elaboration of a Flagrant Mistranslation|author=[[Victor H. Mair|Victor Mair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations in the PowerWord dictionaries are in general very brief, and a word's full connotations are not always explained. In some newer versions of PowerWord this situation can be improved by selecting better dictionaries from the main program window.

Text can be copied from a dictionary and pasted elsewhere. However, when running the 2002 edition on non-Chinese versions of Windows (even ones that are Unicode-aware), the characters become [[mojibake]]d when pasted, and the resulting text must be explicitly re-interpreted as [[GB2312]] using a character set translation utility. This problem does not exist when pasting text into the application.

The font size of the program cannot be changed, which is an [[computer accessibility|accessibility]] problem.

== Coverage ==

Because the translations in PowerWord's dictionaries are brief, the application works best when dealing with well-defined, unambiguous technical words rather than normal words.  It is supplied with several additional dictionaries of technical words in specific fields.

The choice of fields is biased toward areas of high commercial profit, as can be seen from the list of dictionaries below.

=== List of dictionaries ===

The 2002 edition of the CD-ROM contains a total of 83 dictionaries, as follows:

* The basic dictionary, which is always installed with the program (the others can be selected or de-selected in the advanced installation options).
* Eight additional general-purpose dictionaries: "Kingsoft Detailed English–Chinese Dictionary", "A Modern English–Chinese Comprehensive Dictionary", "[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]" (English–English), "An English–Chinese Graphic Dictionary", "A Senior Chinese Dictionary", "A Great International Standard Dictionary of Chinese Characters", and "American Heritage Dictionary (two-direction)"
* Eight "computer and communication" dictionaries (including the "Longman English–Chinese Computer Dictionary" and the "Longman Chinese–English Computer Dictionary")
* 11 dictionaries dealing with specialist vocabulary in various fields of [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]]
* 14 dictionaries dealing with specialist vocabulary in various fields of [[STEM fields|science and technology]]
* 10 dictionaries dealing with the specialist vocabularies of various aspects of [[business]]
* 9 dictionaries dealing with the specialist vocabularies of various aspects of [[transportation]]
* 5 dictionaries dealing with the specialist vocabularies of [[medicine]] (including [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[psychology]])
* 11 dictionaries dealing with the specialist vocabularies of various aspects of energy production and similar resources (mining, water)
* 6 other specialist dictionaries on [[architecture]], [[agriculture]]/[[animal husbandry|husbandry]]/[[forestry]] and [[firefighting]]

==Controversy==
In 2007, PowerWord was blamed by a furniture company for a racial slur printed on the label of a couch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/04/19/canada.couch.ap/ | title= Chinese translation error blamed for slur on sofa label | publisher= CNN | accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804015040/http://cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/04/19/canada.couch.ap/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Chinese characters for "dark brown" (simplified: 黑褐, pinyin: hei1 he4) are typed into a version of Kingsoft's Chinese-English translation software, it produces, among other translations, the words "[[nigger]] brown".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18228652/ Offensive furniture label traced to China firm]&lt;/ref&gt; The company has corrected this in the 2007 release of PowerWord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/racial/business/sofa.asp|title=Hue &amp; Cry|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|date=2007-05-15|publisher=snopes.com|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Road To Bali (1952).webm|thumb|thumbtime=23|upright=1.5|''Road To Bali'']]
'''''Road to Bali''''' is a 1952 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Hal Walker]] and starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on November 1, 1952, the film is the sixth of the seven ''[[Road to …]]'' movies. It was the only such movie filmed in [[Technicolor]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sheldontimeshall.com/films-on-tv-at-christmas-part-1-1957-1966/&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day.

==Plot==
George ([[Bing Crosby]]) and Harold ([[Bob Hope]]), American song-and-dance men performing in [[Melbourne]], Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], where they take jobs as deep sea divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to [[Bali]], Indonesia. They vie for the favors of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala ([[Dorothy Lamour]]), a cousin of the Prince (Murvyn Vye). A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own.

After escaping from the Prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up on another island. Lala is now in love with both of the boys and can't decide which to choose. However, once the natives find them, she learns that in their society, a woman may take multiple husbands, and declares she will marry them both. While the boys are prepared for the ceremony, both thinking the other man lost, plans are changed. She's being unwillingly wed to the already much-married King ([[Leon Askin]]), while the boys end up married to each other.

Displeased with the arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three end up on yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted Harold conjures up [[Jane Russell]] from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen next.

==Cast==
* [[Bing Crosby]] as George Cochran
* [[Bob Hope]] as Harold Gridley
* [[Dorothy Lamour]] as Princess Lala McTavish
* [[Murvyn Vye]] as Prince Ken Arok
* Peter Coe as Gung
* [[Ralph Moody (actor)|Ralph Moody]] as Bhoma Da
* [[Leon Askin]] as King Ramayana
* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Eunice
* [[Michael Ansara]] as Guard
* [[Harry Cording]] as Verna's father

===Cameo appearances===
Among the celebrities who made token "gag" appearances in this film are bandleader [[Bob Crosby]] (Bing's brother), [[Humphrey Bogart]], by way of a clip from ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Dean Martin]], and [[Jane Russell]], as her character from the 1952 film ''[[Son of Paleface]]''. The cameo by [[Martin and Lewis]] was part of a 'comedy trade' whereby they made an appearance in this movie while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis's ''[[Scared Stiff (1953 film)|Scared Stiff]]'' the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Image:Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|right|Bing Crosby and Bob Hope]]
''Road to Bali'' was the first ''Road to...'' picture since 1947's ''[[Road to Rio]]'', and was known during production as ''The Road to Hollywood''. It was the sixth film in the series, the next to last, as well as the final ''Road'' film in which Dorothy Lamour's role would be the female lead. Nine years later, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' instead featured [[Joan Collins]], with a cameo by Lamour. Filming started on April 21, 1952 and continued until July of the same year.

''Road to Bali'' was a co-production of Bing Crosby Enterprises, Hope Enterprises and Paramount.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes&gt;TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=88411&amp;category=Notes Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The giant [[squid]] that threatens Bob Hope in an underwater scene was previously seen attacking [[Ray Milland]] in the Paramount production ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]'' (1942), directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. The erupting [[volcano]] climax was taken directly from the Paramount production ''[[Aloma of the South Seas (1941 film)|Aloma of the South Seas]]'' (1941), also starring Lamour.

===Writing===
[[Image:Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|right|Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour]]
In keeping with the film's initial setting of Melbourne, Australia, many of the jokes contain references to Argyle socks, Australian opera singer [[Dame Nellie Melba]], [[Tasmania]]n-born [[Errol Flynn]], and a dance routine featuring [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]].

As with the other Road movies, Bob Hope breaks the "[[fourth wall]]" several times to make side comments to the audience. For example, as the music for a song sung by Bing Crosby begins, Hope looks to the camera and says, "He's gonna sing, folks. Now's the time to go out and get the popcorn."

Crosby breaks the fourth wall after Hope "notices" the audience is paying attention when he's about to tell Crosby how he escaped from the giant squid. Hope and Crosby walk away from the camera and Hope tells his story in exaggerated pantomime (out of earshot). Crosby then walks back toward the audience and shrugs at the camera, indicating Hope's description was indecipherable.

===Sets===
Hope Enterprises owned one-third of the film and Bob Hope wrote about this in his book ''This Is on Me''. "There are other pleasant things about owning part of a picture. In the ''Road to Bali'' there was a beach scene for which tons of beautiful white sand had been trucked in from Pebble Beach. I had just put in a one-hole golf course at my house on Moorpark Street in North Hollywood. I had four sand traps standing empty, with nothing in them in which my friends could leave their hoof prints. When I saw that sand a light switched on in my head.
“We own two-thirds of this sand, don’t we?” I asked.
“Sure,” Bing said. “Why?”
“Well,” I replied, “I’d like some of it for my course at home.”
When he said, “Why not?” I called the prop man and said, “Take ten truck-loads of this sand out to my house when we’re done with it.”
“No dice,” he said. “This is Paramount’s sand.”
Bing and I had another talk with the boys in the front office. As a result, part of the ''Road to Bali'' is in my back yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope|first1=Bob|title=This Is on Me|date=1954|publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd|isbn=9780025970304|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The New York premiere of the film took place at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] on January 29, 1953.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was very enthusiastic in his review of January 30, 1953.  "...it is apparent that this veteran and camera-scarred team is the neatest, smoothest combo of comics now working the fun side of the screen. Apart, they may be very funny or clever or quaint or what you will, according to where you are sitting and what sort of picture they’re in. But together, and in a “Road” picture, with the consequent freedom of style and reckless impulse that goes with it, they are pretty nigh nonpareil. At least, that’s the word of this reviewer who spent a small part of yesterday falling out of a seat at the Astor while desperately clutching his sides. The reason? Quite simply, “Road to Bali” is a whoopingly hilarious film, full of pure crazy situations and deliciously discourteous gags, all played with evident relish and split-second timing by the team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03E0DB1F3DE03ABC4850DFB7668388649EDE|website=The New York Times|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was more cautious having seen a preview and their comments may have resulted in the removal of a couple of scenes. "Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour are back again in another of Paramount’s highway sagas, this time in Technicolor, with nonsensical amusement it’s only destination. That end is reached eventually, but the road isn’t a smooth highway and the entertainment occasionally falters. Overall, however, it serves its intended purpose satisfactorily and the grossing prospects are okay...Hal Walker’s direction is geared to the free-wheeling spirit that dominates the script and does well by it, as do the three stars and the featured cast." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=November 19, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extended choreographed version of "The Road to Bali" song which was cut from the final print has surfaced in recent years and Paramount chief [[Adolph Zukor]] revealed in his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zukor|first1=Adolph|title=The Public Is Never Wrong: My 50 Years in the Picture Industry|date=1953|publisher=G. P. Putnam|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; that an expensive water ballet sequence was cut from the film too.

==Soundtrack==
The music for all songs was written by [[Jimmy Van Heusen]] and [[Johnny Burke (lyricist)|Johnny Burke]]. Van Heusen's birth name was Edward Chester Babcock. For the final ''Road'' picture, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', Hope's character was called Chester Babcock. 

When [[Decca Records]] was recording the songs from the movie, they did not use Dorothy Lamour. [[Peggy Lee]] recorded the Lamour vocals.

* "Chicago Style" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope
* "Moonflowers" by Dorothy Lamour
* "Hoot Mon" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope
* "To See You Is to Love You" by Bing Crosby&lt;ref&gt;Crosby's version of "To See You Is to Love You" is featured without credit in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Merry-Go-Run-Around" by Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour and Bing Crosby
* "The Road To Bali" by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope (recorded commercially, but only used in the opening credits as sung by a chorus).

Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Peggy Lee recorded all of the songs for [[Decca Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=A Bing Crosby Discography|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these were issued on a [[Road to Bali (album)|10" LP]].  Crosby's songs were also included in the [[Bing's Hollywood vols.1-15#Zing_a_Little_Zong|Bing's Hollywood]] series.

==Legacy==
''Road to Bali'' was parodied in 1953 in the animated short ''[[Alley to Bali]]'', with [[Woody Woodpecker]] and [[Buzz Buzzard]] in the Hope and Crosby roles. The cartoon was released by [[Universal Studios]], which [[EMKA, Ltd.|currently owns the first four ''Road to...'' films]].

===Copyright status===
The film was copyrighted under registration LP2200 1 January 1953. That registration entry also shows "in notice: 1952", meaning that is the year in the copyright notice on the film. The copyright was renewed under RE105899 dated 1 September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Film Superlist|Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain]] (1950-1959)'', page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to copyright law, when the "in notice" year is earlier than the calendar year of the official registration, the [[copyright term]] begins in the earlier year (1952 in this case).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Film Superlist|Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain]] (1940-1949)'', page viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, for films registered for copyright in 1950 and later, the window for a valid renewal was the 28th calendar year of the original copyright term.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Film Superlist|Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain]] (1950-1959)'', page 509.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Road to Bali'', the 28th year was 1980, which means the film had already fallen into the public domain when the copyright was renewed in 1981.

==Home media==
[[Columbia Pictures Television]] (in joint venture with [[LBS Communications]] through what was then [[Colex Enterprises]]) once had the television rights to this film in the 1980s, along with other Bob Hope movies from the 1940s and 1950s. This is evident in a home video release from the mid-1990s, where a CPT logo can be seen at the beginning and end of the film.

Because the film is in the public domain, there have been at least a dozen DVD releases from a variety of companies over the years. However, [[FremantleMedia]] now holds ancillary rights to this film (as the successor in interest to [[LBS Communications]]), and official video releases have been issued under license from Fremantle, with DVD and HD-DVD releases coming from [[BCI Eclipse]]. A Blu-Ray was released on July 5, 2017 by the [[Kino International (company)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="796">In '''''S v Pretorius''''', an important case in South African criminal law, the accused had exceeded the speed limit when taking his child, whom he believed to be in mortal danger, to hospital for treatment. The court held that the onus of proof in a defence of necessity, as in self-defence, rests on the State, which must rule out the reasonable possibility of an act of necessity. It is not for the accused to satisfy the court that he acted from necessity. The conviction of Pretorius was accordingly set aside.

'''''Spaceballs''''' is a 1987 American [[comic science fiction]] film co-written, produced and directed by [[Mel Brooks]]. Starring Brooks, [[Bill Pullman]], [[John Candy]] and [[Rick Moranis]], the film also features [[Daphne Zuniga]], [[Dick Van Patten]], and the voice of [[Joan Rivers]]. In addition to Brooks in a supporting role, the film also features Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Rudy De Luca]] in [[cameo appearance]]s.

The film's setting and characters [[parody]] the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises including ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' films. It was released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/spaceballs-45901 |title=Spaceballs - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1987-06-24 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; on video and one of Brooks's most popular films.

==Plot==
Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob schemes to force King Roland of the neighboring planet Druidia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess Vespa on the day of her [[Arranged marriage|pre-arranged wedding]] to the [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Prince [[Diazepam|Valium]]. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with ''Spaceball One'', an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] spaceship with her droid of honor, Dot Matrix.

Roland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his ''mog'' (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] spaceship, the ''Eagle 5'', Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before ''Spaceball One'', rescue both her and Dot, then escape. ''Spaceball One'' tries to follow, but Helmet orders the ship to "ludicrous speed," causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance.

Out of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby "desert moon of Vega". The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named Yogurt. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to "The Schwartz", a [[metaphysics|metaphysical power]] similar to [[the Force]]. Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.

Helmet and Sandurz break the [[fourth wall]] by using a [[VHS]] copy of the film to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders ''Spaceball One'' to the moon. The Spaceballs capture Vespa and Dot, and return with them to planet Spaceball. Their captors threaten to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take ''Spaceball One'' to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, the ''Spaceball One'' ship transforms into ''Mega Maid'', a robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum is then turned on, sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.

Once the air is returned to the planet, Lone Starr and his allies enter the ''Mega Maid'' to attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with [[lightsaber]]-like "Schwartz rings" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. Subsequently, they land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''-like population.

With Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner, and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt informing him that he is a prince and thus eligible to marry Vespa. He reaches Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, then marries Vespa.

==Development==
When Brooks developed ''Spaceballs'', he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Even though the Yogurt character (Mel Brooks) mentions merchandising in the film, Brooks' deal with [[George Lucas]] on parodying ''[[Star Wars]]'' was that no ''Spaceballs'' action figures be made. According to Brooks, "[Lucas] said, 'Your [action figures] are going to look like mine.' I said OK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxim.com/comedians/interview-icon-mel-brooks|title=Interview: Icon Mel Brooks|date=2013-02-06 |first=Patrick |last=Carone|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mel-brooks-on-how-to-play-hitler-and-how-he-almost-89843|title=Mel Brooks on how to play Hitler, and how he almost died making Spaceballs |date=2012-12-13|first=Steve |last=Heisler|website=www.avclub.com |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks also had Lucas' company handle the post-production, saying, "I was playing ball with the people who could have said no." Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved ''Spaceballs'' and that he "was afraid [he] would bust something from laughing".&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt;

Pullman got the part of Lone Starr when Brooks and his wife [[Anne Bancroft]] saw him in a play—he had never seen ''Star Wars'' prior to filming.&lt;ref name="pullmanws"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spaceballs-at-30-bill-pullman-says-crew-worried-blue-screen-would-make-go-blind-1011687 |title=''Spaceballs'' at 30: Bill Pullman Says Crew Worried Blue Screen Would Make Them Go Blind |last=Parker |first=Ryan |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Tom Hanks]] for the film. Pullman said, "I think [Mel] was hurt that they didn't take him up on it&amp;nbsp;... but then it attract[ed] two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. Once that was secured, then he said, 'Heck, I'll get somebody nobody knows!' And I got a chance to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/1/13/qa-with-actor-bill-pullman-spaceballs-an-independence-day-se.html|first=Ben |last=Pearson|title=Q&amp;A with Actor Bill Pullman|website=geektyrant.com|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuniga initially found Brooks' film parodies "too crass and not too funny", but after working with Brooks, she said, "I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he's also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=142229%7C33753 |title=Spaceballs|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An official soundtrack was released on [[Atlantic Records]] on [[Compact Disc|audio CD]] and [[Compact Cassette]], featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by frequent Brooks collaborator [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]].

For the "19th Anniversary", La-La Land Records released a "limited edition" CD, presenting the score in its entirety for the first time, with bonus tracks featuring alternate takes and tracks composed for, but not used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpaceBalls.html |title='&amp;#39;Spaceballs'&amp;#39; press release at La-La Land Records |publisher=Lalalandrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054357/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpaceBalls.html |archivedate=September 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film had an estimated $22.7 million budget, and ultimately grossed $38,119,483 during its run in the United States, taking in $6,613,837 on its opening weekend, finishing behind ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006| title=Spaceballs | work=boxofficemojo.com| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spaceballs.htm | accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[File:Spaceballs helmet.JPG|thumb|A helmet from the film at a convention in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].]]
The film received mixed reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 58% of critics gave positive reviews based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spaceballs/ | title=Spaceballs Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] | work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 46%, based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref name="Spaceballs 1987: Reviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/spaceballs | title=Spaceballs (1987): Reviews | website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics agreed that, while it was funny, doing a ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody ten years after the original film had been released seemed pointless. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked "I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival…it should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for ''Star Wars'' satires had been completely exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870624/REVIEWS/706240301/1023|title= Spaceballs&amp;nbsp;— rogerebert.com | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Spaceballs'' was first made available on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] in February 1988; they were re-released in the late 1990s. The VHS edition was issued twice; the latter edition was presented in widescreen. The laserdisc, meanwhile, also gained a [[audio commentary|commentary track]] with Brooks; this was transferred over to the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases. The film was first released on DVD on April 25, 2000. This version also contained "the making of..." documentary and a collectible "making-of" booklet. The film was then released in the "Collectors Edition" on May 3, 2005. This edition contained more extras including the documentary and the video conversation about the making of the film with Brooks and Thomas Meehan. On August 7, 2012, the "25th Anniversary Edition" was released on Blu-ray containing many of the same bonus features as the 2005 DVD release with the addition of a new featurette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Josh|title=Spaceballs: 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8879|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=September 18, 2012|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel and animated series==
''Spaceballs'' was developed into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as ''[[Spaceballs: The Animated Series]]'' on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] (US) and [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Guider | first=Elizabeth | title='Spaceballs' rolls to TV | url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/spaceballs-rolls-to-tv-1117916598/ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January 19, 2005 | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Vozick-Levinson | first=Simon | title=Mel Brooks readies a ''Spaceballs'' cartoon for TV | url=http://ew.com/article/2006/09/26/mel-brooks-readies-spaceballs-cartoon-tv/ | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=September 26, 2006 | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moranis claimed in a 2013 interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential [[sequel]], with Moranis pitching the title ''Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II''. However, he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Abrams | first=Brian | title="You Don’t Do Liner Notes With The Dead Sea Scrolls": Rick Moranis In Conversation | url=http://heebmagazine.com/exclusive-rick-moranis-on-spaceballs-2-ghostbusters-3-and-my-mothers-brisket/45895 | work=Heeb | date=June 23, 2013 | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|next ''Star Wars'' film]] and hopes that Moranis would reprise his role. A sequel with the whole cast is not possible since Candy, Rivers, Van Patten and DeLuise have passed away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ward | first=Rachel | title=Mel Brooks hints at Spaceballs sequel to spoof new Star Wars | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11399104/Mel-Brooks-hints-at-Spaceballs-sequel.html | work=The Telegraph | date=February 8, 2015 | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called [[q:Spaceballs#Dialogue|''Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Heller | first=Corinne | title=Spaceballs 2 a Go?

==Impact==
''Spaceballs'' has made an impact on popular culture and been used as a referent and inspiration in other properties.

[[Tesla Motors]] has used Spaceballs' starship speeds (Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) as inspiration for naming their acceleration modes. In homage to ''Spaceballs'', Tesla has ''Ludicrous Mode'' for acceleration beyond its Insane Mode, and ''Plaid Mode'', overtop Ludicrous.&lt;ref name=Jalopnik-2017-11-17&gt;{{cite news |url= https://jalopnik.com/watch-the-new-tesla-roadsters-plaid-mode-rocket-the-c-1820542817 |title= Watch The New Tesla Roadster's "Plaid" Mode Rocket The Car From Zero To 81 MPH In An Instant |first=David |last=Tracy |date= 17 November 2017 |website= Jalopnik }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune-2016-04-30&gt;{{cite news |url= http://fortune.com/2016/04/30/teslas-model-3-ludicrous-mode/ |title= Tesla's Model 3 Will Come in Ludicrous Mode |first=Kirsten |last=Korosec |date= 30 April 2016 |work= Fortune Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysOrg-2015-07-17&gt;{{cite news |url= https://phys.org/news/2015-07-ludicrous-mode-tesla-power-already-fast.html |title= 'Ludicrous Mode'?

A '''sticker''' is a type of  [[label]]: a piece of printed paper, [[Polyvinyl chloride|plastic]], vinyl, or other material with [[pressure sensitive adhesive]] on one side. They can be used for decoration or for functional purposes, depending on the situation. 

Stickers can come in many different shapes and sizes and also vary widely in [[colour]] and design. They are often adhered to items such as lunchboxes, paper, lockers, notebooks, walls, cars, windows, and so on. Temporary [[name tag]]s for example are frequently stickers.

Stickers are very widely used when an object requires with a word or idea. [[Brand]] stickers may be attached to products to label these products as coming from a certain company. They may also be used to describe characteristics of the products that would not be obvious from simple examination. A [[label dispenser]] is often used as a convenient way to separate the sticky label from its liner or backing tape.

Stickers placed on [[automobile]] bumpers, called ''[[bumper stickers]]'', are often used by individuals as a way of demonstrating support for political or ideological causes. Identification of vehicle registration and last service details are two examples of stickers on the inside of most car windscreens. The term "window sticker" is generally used for vinyl labels which are stuck to the inside of a vehicle's window, as opposed to water-resistant stickers that are stuck to the outside of a vehicle but can be affixed to anything.

Stickers are also used for embellishing [[scrapbooking]] pages. Kinds of stickers sold for this purpose include acrylic, 3D, cardstock, [[epoxy]], fabric, flocked, sparkly, paper, puffy, and vellum. While in the earlier days of scrapbooking stickers were sold mostly on 2"x6" sheets, now{{When|date=July 2017}} 6"x12" and even 12"x12" size sheets are very common.

Stickers applied to guitars are called [[guitar decal]]s. [[Post-it note]]s are removable stickers having glue on only part of the back, and are usually sold blank.  
{{Commons category|Stickers}}
They are frequently distributed as part of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al, and [[political campaign]]s; for example, in many [[voting]] [[districts]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], stickers indicating an individual has voted are given to each voter as they leave the [[polling station|polling place]], largely as a reminder to others to vote.  Observers may clap hands, honk a horn or otherwise applaud a good sticker.

Forming a partnership with [[FIFA]] in 1970, [[Panini Group|Panini]] first produced a World Cup [[sticker album]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brand collaborations |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/licensing/brand-collaborations.html |accessdate=8 September 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini World Cup 2018 stickers: When is the iconic sticker album release date?

Some people put stickers (magnetic and permanent) on their cars to advertise their business, or to show support for sports teams or political views.

Stickers placed on tires, usually called [[tire lettering]], can be temporary or permanent. These spell out names or have graphics on them, to enhance the look of the car.

'''TPC-W''' was a web server and database performance benchmark, proposed by [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]].

This benchmark defined the complete Web-based shop for searching, browsing and ordering books. The system under testing needed to provide the implementation of this shop. TPC-W standard describes all pages that must be present in the shop (including sample HTML code), interaction graphs (how the user navigates between the pages), transition tables (that is the probability that the user will move from page A to page B) and database schema. In addition, the standard provided generator to produce synthetic images (book covers) that the system under testing needed to show in the virtual shop. Standard also describes how random strings and random numbers must be generated.

During testing, the server was visited by a growing number of web-bots, each simulating individual customer. The pause between web interactions from the single customer and the number of total pages each customer visits per session are random numbers that must follow asymmetric distribution, specified by the standard. The navigation pattern is defined by three transition tables that differ in accordance with the preferred plans of the user (shopping mix, browsing mix and ordering mix). The main measured parameter was [[web application testing|WIPS]], the number of web interactions per second that the system is capable to deliver.

It was also possible to visit and actually use the virtual shop with the ordinary browser.

The official TPC-W page in the past included performance comparisons, providing information, how well the virtual shop performs when implemented with various development platforms and running on various web servers and operating systems. This is information that is no longer available from the web site.

While discontinued, TPC-W is still used in universities for teaching, requiring students to implement TPC-W - compliant shop and perform benchmarking [https://www-old.systems.ethz.ch/education/past-courses/hs08/eai/ex/project/project.pdf].

There is a movement by scholars to change the English name of the Tripiṭaka Koreana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Tong-hyung|title='Tripitaka Koreana' may be renamed|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2016/07/317_145614.html|website=The Korea Times|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Buswell Jr., a leading scholar of Korean Buddhism, called for the renaming of the Tripiṭaka Koreana to the Korean Buddhist Canon, indicating that the current nomenclature is misleading because the Tripiṭaka Koreana is much greater in scale than the actual Tripiṭaka, and includes much additional content such as travelogues, Sanskrit and Chinese dictionaries, and biographies of monks and nuns.&lt;ref name="Yun"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yun|first1=Suh-young|title='Name of Tripitaka Koreana should be changed'|url=http://www.ktimes.com/www/news/nation/2016/09/116_142218.html|website=The Korea Times|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tripiṭaka Koreana was designated a [[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasure of South Korea]] in 1962, and inscribed in the [[Memory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific|UNESCO Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printing Woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana in Haeinsa Temple, Hapcheon|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,00320000,38&amp;queryText=&amp;requery=0|website=Cultural Heritage Administration|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tripitaka Koreana sutra page.jpg|thumb|left|Tripiṭaka Koreana sutra page in 1371.]]
The name '''Goryeo ''Tripiṭaka''''' comes from "[[Goryeo]]", the [[Names of Korea|name of Korea]] from the 10th to the 14th centuries.

Work on the first Tripiṭaka Koreana began in 1011 during the [[Goryeo–Khitan War]] and was completed in 1087.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Sang-jin|title=Under the Microscope: The Secrets of the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443867320|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRZQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of carving the woodblocks was considered to be a way of bringing about a change in fortune by invoking the Buddha's help.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Tripiṭaka Koreana was based primarily on the Northern Song Tripiṭaka completed in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="park 451"&gt;[[Jin Y. Park|Park, Jin Y.]] article "Buddhism in Korea" in Keown and Prebish 2010 : 451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; but other scriptures published until then, such as the Khitan Tripiṭaka, were also consulted in order to identify items in need of revision and adjustment.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; The first Tripiṭaka Koreana contained around 6,000 volumes.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;

The original set of woodblocks was destroyed by fire during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] in 1232, when Goryeo's capital was moved to [[Ganghwa Island]] during nearly three decades of Mongol incursions, although scattered parts of its prints still remain. To once again implore divine assistance with combating the Mongol threat, King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] thereafter ordered the revision and re-creation of the Tripiṭaka; the carving began in 1237 and was completed in 12 years,&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt; with support from [[Choe Woo|Choe U]] and his son [[Choe Hang (military official)|Choe Hang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Sang-jin|title=Under the Microscope: The Secrets of the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443867320|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRZQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involving monks from both the [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon and Gyo]] schools. This second version is usually what is meant by the Tripiṭaka Koreana.&lt;ref name="Buswell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jr|first1=Robert E. Buswell|last2=Jr|first2=Donald S. Lopez|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400848058|pages=442–443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1398, it was moved to [[Haeinsa]], where it has remained housed in four buildings.

The production of the Tripiṭaka Koreana was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower, according to [[Robert Buswell Jr.]], perhaps comparable to the US missions to the Moon in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bae|first1=Ji-sook|title=Scholar suggests name change for Tripitaka Koreana|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130903000773|website=The Korea Herald|publisher=Herald Corporation|accessdate=30 September 2016|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of scholars and craftsmen were employed in this massive project.&lt;ref name="Buswell" /&gt;

The Tripiṭaka Koreana is the 32nd [[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasure]] of South Korea, and [[Haeinsa]], the depository for the Tripiṭaka Koreana, has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO 1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=737 |title=Haeinsa Temple Janggyeong Panjeon, the Depositories for the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO committee describes the Tripiṭaka Koreana as "one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world".&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom95.htm#737 |title= CONVENTION CONCERNING THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE |author=WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=4–9 December 1995|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the work invaluable, it is also aesthetically valuable and shows a high quality of workmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Park Sang-jin : ''[http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=1746 „Printing Blocks Remain in Perfect Condition after 760 Years“]'' . Koreana - a Quarterly on Korean Art &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeinsa, the temple in which the Tripiṭaka Koreana is stored, is notable for its scientific design to ensure the optimum condition to best preserve the woodblocks, which have remained in pristine condition for more than 750 years.&lt;ref name="condition" /&gt;

The historical value of the Tripiṭaka Koreana comes from the fact that it is the most complete and accurate extant collection of Buddhist treatises, laws, and scriptures.&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt; The compilers of the Korean version incorporated older Northern Song Chinese, [[Khitan_people|Khitan]], and [[Goryeo]] versions, and added content written by respected Korean monks.&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ocp.co.kr"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tripitaka Koreana at Haeinsa Temple |url=http://www.ocp.go.kr/english/treasure/dom_hae.html |publisher=Cultural Properties Administration |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506052257/http://www.ocp.go.kr/english/treasure/dom_hae.html |archivedate=6 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars can get an idea of the older Chinese and Khitan versions of the Tripiṭaka from the Korean version today. The quality of the wood blocks are attributed to the National Preceptor Sugi, the Buddhist monk in charge of the project,&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt; who carefully checked the Korean version for errors.&lt;ref name="ocp.co.kr" /&gt; Upon completing the Tripiṭaka Koreana, Sugi published 30 volumes of ''Additional Records'' which recorded errors, redundancies, and omissions he found during his comparisons of the different versions of the Tripiṭaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Sang-jin|title=Under the Microscope: The Secrets of the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443867320|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRZQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the accuracy of the Tripiṭaka Koreana, the Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese versions of the Tripiṭaka are based on the Korean version.&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt;

The Tripiṭaka Koreana was one of the most coveted items among Japanese Buddhists in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="Herald" /&gt; Japan never managed to create a woodblock Tripiṭaka, and made constant requests and attempts to acquire the Tripiṭaka Koreana from Korea since 1388.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Sang-jin|title=Under the Microscope: The Secrets of the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443867320|pages=6–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRZQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 complete printings of the Tripiṭaka Koreana were gifted to Japan since the [[Muromachi period]].&lt;ref name="Herald" /&gt; The Tripiṭaka Koreana was used as the basis for the modern Japanese [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]].&lt;ref name="Buswell" /&gt;

[[File:Korea-Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana woodblock 2770-06a.jpg|thumb|right|Copy of a Tripiṭaka Koreana woodblock at Haeinsa complex grounds used to allow visitors to make an inked print of the [[Heart Sutra]] while at the temple. See: for [[:File:Prajnyaapaaramitaa Hridaya.png|image of woodblock print.]]]]
Each block was made of birch wood from the southern islands of Korea and treated to prevent the decay of the wood. The blocks were soaked in sea water for three years, then cut and then boiled in salt water. Next, the blocks were placed in the shade and exposed to the wind for three years, at which point they were finally ready to be carved. After each block was carved, it was covered in a poisonous lacquer to keep insects away and then framed with metal to prevent warping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=David A.|title=Tripitaka Koreana: ural Treasure|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/03/293_61805.html|website=The Korea Times|accessdate=30 September 2016|date=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every block was inscribed with 23 lines of text with 14 characters per line. Therefore, each block, counting both sides, contained a total of 644 characters. The consistency of the style, and some sources, suggests that a single man carved the entire collection but it is now believed that a team of 30 men carved the Tripiṭaka.&lt;ref name="UNESCO_PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ocp.co.kr" /&gt;

'''Twenga'''.com is an online open shopping search engine. In 2006, Bastien Duclaux and Cédric Anès created Twenga, meaning "straight to the goal" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] according to the company's website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twenga.com/about.php&lt;/ref&gt; to bring together "all online products and stores in one place." Twenga's 14 websites in ten different languages display nearly 300 million products for 200,000 online shops. The company states it is the "open shopping platform with the largest selection online."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twenga.com/about.php |title=About Twenga |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Twenga |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Twenga co-founders Bastien Duclaux and Cédric Anès met in 2000 at the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications]]. The company's "crawl" technology enables Twenga to scan tens of millions of pages of the Internet every day, automatically categorizing hundreds of millions of products in ten languages including Russian, Japanese and Chinese. This proprietary technology allowed Twenga to raise nearly [[€]]7 million from [[venture capital]] firms [[3i]], [[Sofinnova]] and others. By 2010, Twenga employed 120 people, including 50 research engineers.&lt;ref name="echos"&gt;{{cite news |title=Twenga chasing deals on the Internet |author=Chantale Houzelle |url=http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/tech-medias/actu/020892295962.htm |newspaper=[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]] |date=12 January 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its headquarters in Paris, Twenga runs 14 websites for markets in the United States, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Brazil, Russia, Australia, China and Japan. The sites display 300 million products from more than 200,000 online shops.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The websites do not sell directly; instead they redirect users to online shops where they purchase products. Twenga itself generates revenue primarily by "advertising and business partnerships which give interested companies and retailers greater visibility than that provided by organic listing."&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twenga.com/faq.php |title=FAQ Twenga |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Twenga |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Twenga joined other e-commerce companies and filed an antitrust complaint to the European Commission claiming that Google abuses its dominant position by promoting their own products such as Google Shopping while penalizing competitors in the search results.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Faces EU Antitrust Complaint From French Shopping Website |author=Aoife White |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-24/google-faces-eu-antitrust-complaint-from-french-shopping-website.html |newspaper=[[Businessweek]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product expansion==
Since 2008 Twenga has been developing mobile apps to make all its B2C services available via smartphone and tablets.&lt;ref name="telecompaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/twenga-launches-price-comparison-app-for-iphone--651332 |title=Twenga launches price comparison app for iPhone |author= |date= 23 December 2008 |work= |publisher=Telecompaper |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company currently offers apps for iPhone, iPad and Android.&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twenga.com/mobile/|title=Twenga Mobile|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Twenga|accessdate=1 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630121214/http://www.twenga.com/mobile/|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2010, Twenga has launched its own merchant partner program Twenga Ready to Sell in seven countries including France, Germany and the UK. The program allows e-tailers to directly index their products on Twenga to gain additional visibility and traffic.&lt;ref name="realwire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realwire.com/releases/Twenga-Ready-to-Sell-launches-for-e-tailers-in-United-Kingdom |title=Twenga Ready to Sell launches for e-tailers in United Kingdom |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Realwire |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Twenga expanded its activities by creating affinitAD, a program that offers contextual monetization solutions for publishers.&lt;ref name="affinitad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.affinitad.fr/2011/09|title=Passez à la monétisation contextuelle avec affinitAD by Twenga|author=|date=24 September 2011|work=|publisher=affinitAD Blog|accessdate=1 June 2013|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719000014/http://blog.affinitad.fr/2011/09/|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the company launched Showcase, a social shopping platform that allows users to share their favorite products with others and follow the recommendations of fellow shoppers.&lt;ref name="showcase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journaldunet.com/ebusiness/commerce/twenga-lance-showcase-1112.shtml |title=Twenga lance sa plateforme de social shopping Showcase |author=Flore Fauconnier |date=26 November 2012 |work= |publisher=Journal Du Net |accessdate=1 June 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2010, Twenga won the [[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]] 100 Global Award, the France Young Technology Leader Award and the [[Ernst &amp; Young]] Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the "Company of the Future" category for France.&lt;ref name="internetretailer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/04/15/twenga-announces-one-click-access-between-shopping-and-social |title=Twenga Announces One Click Access between Online Shopping and Social Networks |author= |date=15 April 2011 |work= |publisher=Internet Retailer |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WikiPilipinas''' (formerly known as '''Wikipiniana''') was an [[World Wide Web|online]], [[free content]] [[website]] which bills itself as a combination "non-academic [[encyclopedia]]", [[web portal]], [[web directory|directory]] and [[almanac]] for [[Philippines|Philippine]]-based knowledge. Like [[Wikipedia]], it contains various articles on Philippine-related topics. Unlike Wikipedia, many of the articles cover topics that would otherwise be deemed [[unencyclopedic]] by the stricter Wikipedia. The service for example, promotes the concept of [[original research]] and eschews the larger encyclopedia's [[WP:NPOV|neutral point-of-view]] principle.

Conceived in late 2006 by Philippine publishing magnate [[Gaspar Vibal]], WikiPilipinas (as Wikipiniana) officially went live on June 12, 2007 with several thousand Philippine-related articles [[fork (software development)|fork]]ed from the English Wikipedia. Its name was officially changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas a few weeks later on the 7th of July. The service was formally launched at the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August of the same year.

==Overview==
While it started as a [[WP:FORK|fork]] of [[Wikipedia]], WikiPilipinas does not fancy itself an "[[academic]] [[encyclopedia]]" as stated in its official policies and guidelines page. Despite this, the online resource does contain articles on encyclopedic topics such as history, culture, sports, and politics. In addition to those mentioned, WikiPilipinas styles itself as a mash-up of several entities; a "Who's Who" of prominent Filipinos, a directory of institutions and companies, an [[almanac]] of the Philippines and a [[web portal|community portal]] for the different ethnic groups in the Philippines. As an online resource using the [[wiki]] model, it bills itself as a [[Collaborative writing|collaborative effort]]-content provider. The most major goal that the wiki has stated is "to build the largest Philippine knowledge database". Like Wikipedia, the contents of WikiPilipinas are open to editing by anyone with access to the [[Internet]]. However, editors must register before they are allowed to edit.&lt;ref name="WPnasAbout"&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiPilipinas: About |publisher=WikiPilipinas |date=2007-08-23 |url=http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Wikipiniana:About |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiPilipinas was particularly launched by the Vibal Foundation, a nonprofit organization which previously created Filipiniana.net, and WikiPilipinas.org (a reference guide on the Philippines). Conjunctively, the Vibal Foundation (per Gaspar Vibal and his mother) made a historical move in [[Education in the Philippines|Philippine education]], when it also launched on June 12, 2008, the 110th [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] day, e-turo.org, as [[wikt:conduit|conduit]] of these 3 landmark education tools. Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which "seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]]-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dizon|first=David|title=RP e-learning portal launched on Independence Day|url=http://beta.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/06/12/08/rp-e-learning-portal-launched-independence-day|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=abs-cbnnews.com|date=12 June 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130407160830/http://beta.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/06/12/08/rp-e-learning-portal-launched-independence-day|archive-date=2013-04-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from Wikipedia===
Although it is modeled after Wikipedia, WikiPilipinas differs from it in distinct ways. Founder Gaspar Vibal describes "improvements" including a [[web directory|directory]] of [[web portal]]s based on those of [[Yahoo!]], Inc., and community portals for Filipino ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="MT20070827"&gt;{{cite news |last=Suarez |first=Mike |title=Wiki comes to the Philippines - Bringing along ‘copyleft’ IPR model popularized by Wikipedia |work=Tech Times Online |publisher=[[Manila Times]] |date=2007-08-27 |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110222952/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html |archivedate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiPilipinas guidelines explicitly encourage, "''balanced presentation, but not a neutral point of view.''", state that WikiPilipinas, "''does not believe that any view can ever be neutral''" and that fair discussion of an issue is expected. One of the key pillars of Wikipedia is that articles be written from a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], a major difference in [[encyclopedia]] models. WikiPilipinas supports the concept of [[original research]], something Wikipedia forbids. WikiPilipinas encourages users to, "''present their own research and findings on the site''" and expects adequate references from editors for factual information. In addition, the site does not have the [[Wikipedia:Notability|notability]] concept that is another cornerstone of Wikipedia. Articles about practically anything are allowed on the site.&lt;ref name="MST20070904"/&gt; Also, WikiPilipinas' conceptualization is far removed from that of an [[academic]] [[encyclopedia]]. The site's policy and guideline page states, "''WikiPilipinas is not an academic encyclopedia.''"&lt;ref name="WPnasPolicy"&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiPilipinas Policies and Guidelines |publisher=WikiPilipinas |date=2007-08-24 |url=http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=WikiPilipinas:_Help:_Policies_and_guidelines |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MB20070827"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Ronald S. |title=WikiPilipinas stirs Pinoy knowledge revolution |work=Youth &amp; Campus |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=2007-08-27 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/YTCP20070827101328.html |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031053115/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/YTCP20070827101328.html |archivedate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Wikipedia with its strict [[conflict of interest]] [[WP:COI|policy]], WikiPilipinas has no rule preventing one from writing about oneself or one's family.&lt;ref name="BM20070823"&gt;{{cite news|last=Estopace |first=Dennis |title=Book trader building Pinoy online encyclopedia |work=Headlines |publisher=Business Mirror |date=2007-08-23 |url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/08232007/headlines04.html |accessdate=2007-08-29 |quote=Indeed, anybody with access to the Internet, has the time and temerity to write about, say, his or her clan, could contribute article/s to the WikiPilipinas’s reservoir of knowledge. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111055835/http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/08232007/headlines04.html |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The contents of WikiPilipinas were originally [[WP:FORK|aggregated]] from a selection of around 15,000 Philippine-related articles of Wikipedia. The addition of original articles began soon after, created by WikiPilipinas volunteers and its editorial team.&lt;ref name="MST20070904"/&gt; All text in WikiPilipinas was originally licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL),&lt;ref name="WPnasAbout"/&gt; but on March 26, 2011, it migrated to the [[Creative Commons license#Types of licenses|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License]].

==History==
WikiPilipinas was originally conceived as Wikipiniana, an [[open content]] [[management system]] for volunteer members of the Philippine online resource [[Filipiniana|Filipiniana.net]]. The site initially used the [[Plone (software)|Plone content management system]] the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the [[wiki]]-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and [[webmaster]] Richard Grimaldo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yehey.com/News/print.aspx?id=177982 www.yehey.com, Wiki comes to the Philippines]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of [[Vibal Publishing House, Inc.]] (VPHI), and mother of Gaspar Vibal learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world’s biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business lessons from an octogenarian|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20080426-132901/Business-lessons-from-an-octogenarian|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=26 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209035622/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20080426-132901/Business-lessons-from-an-octogenarian|archive-date=9 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, [[MediaWiki]] was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the [[Wikipedia]]. Instead of a complete [[WP:FORK|fork]] of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a "hipper" and "freer" version, including [[almanac]] lists and [[web directory|directories]].&lt;ref name="BM20070823"/&gt; The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/ |title=isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com, WikiPilipinas Profile |access-date=2008-04-07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110707075903/http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/ |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project officially began on March 15, 2007. It was first made available online three months after on June 12 to coincide with the country's official [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]].&lt;ref name="Inq20070827"&gt;{{cite news |last=Casiraya |first=Lawrence |title=Wikipilipinas founder aims for ‘long tail’ effect |work=Breaking News/Infotech |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=2007-08-23 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84296 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515150906/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84296 |archive-date=2010-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ20070823"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikipilipinas founder aims for ‘long tail’ effect |work=Technology |publisher=Asian Journal |date=2007-08-23 |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=190&amp;a=22423 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after going live, the official name of the service was changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas on July 7. WikiPhilippines was the term decided upon for the section of the site with articles in English and WikiFilipinas for the section in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. A press-oriented [[sneak preview]] of the site was hosted for the local media on August 22 of the same year. The event was attended by major Philippine media outlets such as [[GMA-7]] and [[RPN-9]], print media like the [[Manila Bulletin]], the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], and the [[Manila Times]] and dozens of Philippine bloggers.&lt;ref name="WPnasAbout"/&gt; In a press release on August 23, the site's publicists claimed to be "''the fastest online startup in Philippine history''" due to the site receiving 100,000 visitors during the slew of accesses that occurred after the site was covered by the media the previous day.&lt;ref name="SEO100000th"&gt;{{cite press release|title=WikiPilipinas reaches 100,000 visitor mark in 24 Hours |publisher=SEO Resources |date=2007-08-23 |url=http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-reaches-100000-visitor-mark-in-24-hours/ |accessdate=2007-09-01 }}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiPilipinas had its official launch during the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August 2007.&lt;ref name="WPnasLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiPilipinas Schedule of Activities at the 28th Manila International Book Fair from August 29 to September 2, 2007 |publisher=WikiPilipinas |date=2007-08-26 |url=http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=WikiPilipinas_Schedule_of_Activities_at_the_28th_Manila_International_Bookfair_from_August_29_to_September_2%2C_2007. |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project itself is owned by the Vibal Foundation, which bills itself as the "corporate social arm" of Vibal Publishing House. It is a sister-project to Filipiniana.net, a Philippine-oriented research portal.&lt;ref name="MB20070827-2"/&gt;

==Technical specifications==
As a Philippine company, the site's physical [[server (computing)|server]]s are situated in [[Metro Manila]] in the Philippines. The site was originally hosted on the servers of its sister project, Filipiniana.net. However, a surge of viewers following intense media coverage on August 21, 2007 prompted the site's owners to turn to VConnect Inc. to upgrade the site's hardware. WikiPilipinas is now hosted on an [[IBM System x|IBM System x 3850]] with dual 3 [[gigahertz]] Intel [[Xeon]] [[CPU]]s, 16 [[gigabyte]]s of [[RAM]] and 1.4 [[terabyte]]s of combined [[hard drive]] space. The site's [[internet connection]] is provided by IP Converge with a total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] allocation of 10 [[Mbit/s]].&lt;ref name="MB20070827-2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ong |first=Edison D. |title=Pinoy online encyclopedia WikiPilipinas aims high to break in into top 10 wikis |work=Info Tech |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=2007-08-27 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/INFO20070827101364.html |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192050/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/INFO20070827101364.html |archivedate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and public reaction==
WikiPilipinas has been the subject of several articles by major [[broadsheet]] newspapers in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="MST20070904"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Chin |title=A wiki for Filipinos |work=Digital Life |publisher=Manila Standard Today |date=2007-09-04 |url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=business6_sept4_2007 |accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inq20070827"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MB20070827-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star20070831"&gt;{{cite news |last=Buensalido |first=Monique |title=Wikipilipinas: Join the knowledge revolution |work=Young Star |publisher=Philippine Star |date=2007-08-31 |url=http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Young%20Star&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=45&amp;aid=2007083054 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233939/http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Young%20Star&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=45&amp;aid=2007083054 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service itself has been covered by [[GMA Network]] news in segments on two of the station's daily news programs.&lt;ref name="Inqnet20070822"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Mike Enriquez]] (newscaster) |date=August 22, 2007 |title=WikiPilipinas gives online info on RP |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/largevideo/latest/10733/WikiPilipinas-gives-online-info-on-RP |format=streaming video |medium=television production (''[[24 Oras]]'') |publisher=GMANews.TV |location=Manila, Philippines |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inqnet20070823"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Sheryl Yao]] (reporter), [[Arnold Clavio]] (newscaster) |date=August 23, 2007 |title=First online encyclopedia on RP launched |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/10745/First-online-encyclopedia-on-RP-launched |format=streaming video |medium=television production (''[[Unang Hirit]]'') |publisher=GMANews.TV |location=Manila, Philippines |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its observers on the blogging community and [[Wikipedia:Tambayan Philippines|Tambayan Philippines]], the Philippine Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Regional notice boards|regional notice board]], have observed that it is "trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia talk:Tambayan Philippines]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of its inception, a few Filipino bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a [[WP:FORK|fork]] of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Activism20070827"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dong B. |last=Calmada |authorlink=Dong Calmada |title=Wikipilipinas: From a Wikipedia subset to one-stop hub on RP |work=Activism 102: An online personal track on activism of the new millennium |publisher=The Bayanihan Blog Network |date=2007-08-27 |url=http://activism102.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/wikipilipinas-from-a-wikipedia-subset-to-one-stop-hub-on-rp/ |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post entitled "''Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?''", a Filipino blogger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos.&lt;ref name="Bayanihan20070717"&gt;{{cite web |first=Rico |last=Mossesgeld |authorlink=Rico Mossesgeld |title=Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana? |work= |publisher=The Bayanihan Blog Network |date=2007-07-17 |url=http://www.bayanihanblogs.com/119/is-there-any-point-to-wikipiniana/ |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731005831/http://www.bayanihanblogs.com/119/is-there-any-point-to-wikipiniana/ |archive-date=2007-07-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipino blogger and [[Wikipedian#Users and editors|Wikipedian]] Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the "hip and free encyclopedia"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia "by Filipinos, for Filipinos," Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to [[pagerank|rank]] higher than those of the [[English Wikipedia]] in [[web search engine|web searches]], making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref name="Vaes20070719"&gt;{{cite web |last=Villar |first=Eugene Alvin |authorlink=Eugene Alvin Villar |title=There is Currently No Point to Wikipiniana (aka WikiPilipinas) |work=Vaes9 |publisher= |date=2007-07-19 |url=http://vaes9.codedgraphic.com/posts/no_point_to_wikipiniana |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the [[Manila Bulletin]] in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines.&lt;ref name="MB20070903"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jusay |first=Annalyn S. |title=Wikipedia or WikiPilipinas? : the debate continues |work=Tech News: Blog-O-Rama |pages= |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=2007-09-03 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/09/03/TECH20070903102006.html |accessdate=2007-09-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021091509/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/09/03/TECH20070903102006.html |archivedate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it "''came up with its own set of content''".&lt;ref name="Yuga20070815"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olandres |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Olandres |title=Rainy Day Friday Round-up |work=Blogosphere |publisher=YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews |date=2007-08-15 |url=http://www.yugatech.com/blog/blogosphere/rainy-day-friday-round-up/ |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.&lt;ref name="Yuga20070831"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olandres |first=Abe |authorlink=Abe Olandres |title=Will WikiPilipinas redefine what is notable? |work=Daily Dose |publisher=YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews |date=2007-08-31 |url=http://www.yugatech.com/blog/daily-dose/will-wikipilipinas-redefine-what-is-notable/ |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine [[literacy]] [[advocacy]] group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as "the online version of an ''omnium gatherum''… a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies."&lt;ref name="RoD20070822"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mandigma |first=Kristine |authorlink=Kristine Mandigma |title=Wikipilipinas |work=Read or Die weblog |publisher=read-or-die.org |date=2007-08-22 |url=http://read-or-die.org/blog/2007/08/22/wikipilipinas/ |accessdate=2007-08-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033928/http://read-or-die.org/blog/2007/08/22/wikipilipinas/ |archivedate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to Vibal Publishing House, a local [[publishing house|publishing service]] that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, Gaspar Vibal. In an interview with the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other.&lt;ref name="Inq20070826-2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Casiraya |first=Lawrence |title=Wikipilipinas founder answers credibility issues |work=Breaking News/Infotech |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=2007-08-26 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84783 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829010904/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84783 |archive-date=2007-08-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Sturgis Bigelow''' (1850–1926), son of [[Henry Jacob Bigelow]], was a prominent American collector of [[Japanese art]].&lt;ref name=AMB1&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Bigelow, Henry Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first Americans to live in Japan {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, and, through his donations to Boston area museums, helped to form the standards by which  Japanese art and culture were appreciated in the west. 

==Early career==
Bigelow received his degree in medicine from [[Harvard University]] in 1874, and continued his medical studies in Europe for five years, under [[Louis Pasteur]]. His primary interest was  [[bacteriology]], but when his father, a [[surgeon]],  pressured him to follow in that profession, Bigelow abandoned a medical career.

==Bigelow and Japan==
Bigelow began collecting Japanese art as a student in Paris. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Christopher|title=Bachelor Japanist, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities|date=2017|publisher=New York Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, inspired by lectures on Japan delivered by [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Sylvester Morse]], Bigelow traveled to Japan. There he subsidized the scholarly work of Morse and another young Harvard graduate [[Ernest Fenollosa]], both of whom were teaching at Japanese universities.  Bigelow remained in Japan for seven years, traveling with Morse and Fenollosa to parts of the country off limits to other foreigners. With the special authorizations of the Japanese government, Bigelow, Fellonosa and Morse were able to explore parts of Japan closed to outside viewers for centuries. The group visited the [[Shōsō-in (Tōdai-ji)|Shōsō-in]] (Treasure House) of [[Tōdai-ji]], viewing hidden treasures of [[Emperor Shōmu]], and were granted a few shards of pottery, the only items belonging to the Shōsō-in known to currently reside outside of it. Among the many other items he obtained during his time in Japan were a set of gilt bronze statues from [[Hōryū-ji]], of the historical Buddha and attendants, known as the Shaka Trinity statues, and a [[mandala]] from the [[Hokke-do]] (Lotus Sutra Hall) of Tōdai-ji, one of the oldest Japanese paintings to ever leave Japan. Morse collected ancient ceramics, Bigelow collected armor, and Fenollosa, often with Bigelow's financial help, collected paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017).

Returning to the United States, Bigelow donated approximately 75,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Christopher|title=Bachelor Japanist, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities|date=2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; objects of Japanese art to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. His collections, along with those of Morse and Fenollosa (the latter paid for by [[Charles Goddard Weld]]) Okakura, and a handful of others, made the newly founded Department of the Art of Asia at the Museum of Fine Arts the largest collection of Japanese art anywhere outside Japan; a distinction it still holds today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/asia|title=Art of Asia|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Bigelow's enthusiasm for the elite male camaraderie he enjoyed in Japan is reflected in the nature of these collections. Where Parisian collections emphasized Japanese domestic objects, including women's kimonos and allied textiles, modern decorated ceramics, and prints associated with the pleasure quarters famed for their bawdy entertainments and stylized forms of prostitution, the Boston collectors focused on the elite all-male aspects of Japanese society: the tea ceremony, the samurai, and elite communities of Buddhist monks.

With Fenollosa, Bigelow converted to [[Tendai Buddhism]], about which he taught and lectured back in Boston. There he used Episcopalian terms, such as bishop, to describe senior monks&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;, and dismissed simpler forms of Buddhism, such as Zen and Shin, referring to the latter as a "very big and popular and easy-going sect...the Salvation Army of Buddhism"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  

In traveling through Japan and forming their collections, Bigelow and his Boston colleagues were helped by one of Fenollosa's students, [[Okakura Kakuzō]]. Inspired by these Westerners' admiration for the traditions of the Japanese aristocracy, Okakura, with Bigelow's financial backing, founded an art school, the ''[[Nihon Bijutsuin]]'' (Japan Fine Arts Academy), to preserve and promote traditional forms of Japanese art.

When in 1898 Okakura was ousted by faculty and students at the school who objected to his rigid focus on traditional art, Bigelow hired him to oversee the Japanese art collections at the Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Okakura sustained his patron's emphasis on transforming the Western image of a tea house filled with women and domestic utensils to that of a temple filled with religious scroll paintings and sculptures. When in 1909 the museum moved to a new building, a gallery and courtyard garden designed to mimic a temple and its forecourt was built to display Japanese sculpture.  This very popular space became a model for other American museums displaying East Asian art. &lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 171-178&lt;/ref&gt;


== Spiritual Evolution ==
Bigelow's publicity for his vision of Japan extended to his teachings on Buddhism. He delivered the annual Ingersoll Lecture on the Immortality of Man at Harvard in 1908, which was published as book ''Buddhism and Immortality'' (1908). There Bigelow used the scientific language of nature selection to explain spiritual evolution as when an individual emerges from "unconditioned consciousness" and "moves up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection." Next the individual moves to a level of celestial experience and finally is able to "return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge. In his view, familial ties were created by reincarnaton and what he called "thought transference."&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck (1962), Fenollosa and His Circle, with Other Essays in Biography. New York: Dutton&lt;/ref&gt; Bigelow's contemporaries compared his relationship o the Japanese monk who instructed him in Buddhism as that of "a filial child" to a "benevolent father." &lt;ref&gt;Murakata, Akiko (1971). Selected Letters of Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow, Ph.D. Dissertation, George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt; Historian T.J. Jackson Lears has analyzed Bigelow's embrace of Buddhims as "leaving a stern father for a benign Ajari [teacher]." &lt;ref&gt;Jackson Lears, T.J. (1994). No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture, 1880-1920, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Bigelow accepted both material and [[spiritual evolution]] and believed Buddhism and [[science]] were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;American encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912: Victorian culture &amp; the limits of dissent, Thomas A. Tweed, 2000, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bigelow in Boston ==

Biglow's preference for the company of men was manifest nowhere more clearly than on his island retreat of Tuckernuck, off Nantucket. There he invited other men to enjoy the pleasures of dining and swimming in a world without women. Bigelow was heart-broken when [[George Cabot Lodge]], the young poet he had chosen as his spiritual son to inherit his island estate, died there at the age of thirty-five. Lodge's 1906 poem "Tuckanuck" celebrates the island as a place "to dream an Eastern dream, starred by the cry/ of sea-birds...." &lt;ref&gt; Lodge, George Cabot (1896). "Tuckanuck." Harper's New Monthly Magazine, 93, no. 554, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 164&lt;/ref&gt; A more exuberant letter from Lodge to Bigelow anticipating a trip to the island reads "kind Sir! Surf Sir! And sun, Sir! And Nakedness! -Oh Lord! How I want to get my clothes off-alone in natural solitudes."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The line between [[homosexuality]] and [[homoeroticism]] blurs in Bigelow's biography; he has been described as "at once an epicure and a mystic, who professed an ascetic religion and wore beautiful [[List of Charvet customers#Other clients with a notable interest in Charvet|Charvet]] haberdashery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

   }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also reported to have proposed marriage in 1899 to the Croatian soprano Milka Ternina, who was at the time singing at the Metropolitan Opera. He gave her a 38-carat diamond named “Cleveland”, while a week later he presented her a letter with his marriage proposal. She rejected the proposal but from then on their relationship became more intimate. During their relationship, he gave her a number of Japanese objects which she donated in 1930 to the Etnografski Muzej in Zagreb.&lt;ref&gt;Renata Santo, "Legacy of Milka Trnina in the Collection of Non-European Cultures

Bigelow was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. Upon his death, in accordance with his final requests, Bigelow's remains were cremated; half the ashes were buried at [[Mii-dera]], just outside Kyoto, along with those of Fenollosa, and half were interred in the Sturgis family plot at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Lot #310 Catalpa Path; lot card on file at Mount Auburn Cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;
