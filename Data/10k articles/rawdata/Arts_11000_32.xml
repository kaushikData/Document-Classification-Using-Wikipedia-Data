[[File:Drury lane facade 1775.png|right|thumb|The Theatre Royal during the 18th century.]]
The '''Actor Rebellion of 1733''' was an event that took place at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in [[London]], England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, attempted to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers [[Theophilus Cibber]], John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the [[lease]]. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.

The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors, though they were less experienced and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre, Haymarket]], though a few remained loyal. [[Henry Fielding]] sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made an agreement with the actors that secured their return.

==Background==
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Colley Cibber |alt=Black and white image of a man facing center. He is wearing a shoulder length whig, has an elaborate coat with a cloth around his neck. He has a hat under his left arm and both a glove and a watch in his left hand. He is holding up his right hand with the thumb and pointer pressed together.]]
The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was run by the holders of one of the two official licenses, or [[letters patent]], established by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660. It was operated by [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, [[Colley Cibber]], [[Thomas Doggett]], and [[Robert Wilks]]. After Doggett died, [[Barton Booth]] took over his share.&lt;ref&gt;Styan 1996 p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 1730, a notice in the ''Daily Journal'' stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the [[patent theatre|official government license]] to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of his share to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus, an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 142–144&lt;/ref&gt;

The new management group had two members, Highmore and Ellys, who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber was known to be both arrogant and volatile.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 144&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of [[Charles Johnson (writer)|Charles Johnson]]'s ''Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover'' on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 ''[[Grub-Street Journal]]'' seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management:&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; "how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors of our public entertainments."&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters were complicated by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, reduced the number of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play ''The Miser'', which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. ''The Miser'' was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, ''Deborah: or, a Wife for You All'', lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with [[Thomas Arne]]'s ''The Opera of Operas'', Fielding's ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' set to music.&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 163–167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management changes==
Highmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, insisted on actively participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Koon 1986 p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play ''The Harlot's Progress'' instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance from both the epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play ''The Mock-Officer'' failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 ''The Harlot's Progress'', based on [[William Hogarth]]'s [[A Harlot's Progress|painting of the same name]], proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.&lt;ref&gt;Shevelow 2005 pp. 157–159&lt;/ref&gt;

While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, [[Aaron Hill (writer)|Aaron Hill]] became interested in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot that took place in June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to [[Benjamin Victor (theatre manager)|Benjamin Victor]], a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore,&lt;ref&gt;Koon 1986 p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; criticised the fact that he was kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hester Booth]], widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of [[Goodman's Fields Theatre]], just few days after her husband died on 10 May.&lt;ref name=k134/&gt;

By this time, many of the partners, including Wilks, Ellys, and Colley Cibber, no longer wanted to be a part of the theatre and sought to sell their shares. When Colley sought to rent out his share to his son for 300 pounds a year, Highmore approached Colley in order to buy. News of Colley's selling of the shares to Highmore first appeared in the ''[[Daily Post (London newspaper)|Daily Post]]'' of 27 March 1733. The sale price was around 3000 guineas and 3500 pounds. Theophilus was upset that his father sold the share to Highmore instead of continuing to rent it out to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; The share, as Theophilus believed, was his "Birthright".&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
Theophilus first tried to work with Highmore and asked to run the operations of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion.&lt;ref name=h157/&gt; Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half.&lt;ref name=k134&gt;Koon 1986 p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.&lt;ref name=h157&gt;Hume 1988 p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

When the actors tried to rent the building, the remaining shareholders found out about it. They responded by refusing admittance to the actors. The building was shut down and no plays were performed.&lt;ref name="Hume p. 158"&gt;Hume 1988 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Daily Post'' of 29 May 1733:
&lt;blockquote&gt; the Occasion we are inform'd was, that at Midnight on Saturday last several Persons arm'd took Possession of the same, by Direction from some of the Patentees, and lock'd up and barricado'd all the Doors and Entrances thereunto, against the whole Company of his Majesty's Comedians, as also against Mr. Cibber,&amp;nbsp;jun. notwithstanding he had paid to one of the Patentees several Hundred Pounds for one third Part of the Patent, Cloaths, Scenes, &amp;c. and all Rights and Privileges thereunto annexed, for a certain Term not yet expired.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 qtd. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The actors petitioned [[Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton]], the [[Lord Chamberlain]], and requested that he settle the dispute, but he refused to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system was slow to respond.&lt;ref name="Hume p. 158"/&gt;

The management continued to cause problems for various actors, including Benjamin Griffin. Griffin was fired from the theatre on 4 June 1733.&lt;ref&gt;Shevelow 2006 p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He responded in the ''Daily Post'' on 11 June 1733 with a history of the events since he first started in 1721 until his removal. He accused the management of bad treatment and wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could give the Publick a great many Instances of the ''Gentlemen's'' Mismanagement and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their Direction. But when I affirm that they have no Experience, no Knowledge, no Capacity, ''For Gathering together, Forming, Entertaining, Governing, Privileging, and Keeping a Company of Comedians'' ... more than the being able to purchase the ''Patent'' [...] it is a Truth that if any one does not now believe, I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly convinced of.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 qtd. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contemporary response==
Many of the local newspapers were quick to respond to the rebellion. An article in ''The Craftsman'' dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as "malecontent Players" who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the ''Grub-Street Journal'' stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the ''Grub-Street Journal'', by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work. The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors responded later in June with ''A Letter from Theophilus Cibber, {{sic|hide=y|Comm|edian}}, To John Highmore, Esq''. Within the response, Theophilus Cibber emphasised the inability of the management to effectively run the theatre, claimed that they were acting like tyrants, and alleged that they unjustly refused the offer by the actors to rent out the patent. This did not calm the dispute; instead, the ''Grub-Street Journal'' of 14 June 1733 printed parts of [[John Vanbrugh]]'s ''Aesop'', a play that criticised the actor rebellion that took place in 1695. On 26 June, the ''Grub-Street Journal'' in an article by Musaeus claimed that many of the problems that the actors complained about were caused by previous managers, who were also actors, and not by the current management that was composed of outsiders. Additionally, Musaeus claimed that actors in general were unfit to run the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 159–162&lt;/ref&gt;

A pamphlet titled ''An Impartial State of the Present Dispute Between the Patent and Players'' was published during the late summer that attacked the actors. It claimed that "all Men of Sense and Integrity seem to be entirely convinced that the ''Patentees'' of the ''Theatre-Royal'' in ''Drury-Lane'', have had great Injustice done them by the late Attempt of Part of their own Company to defraud them of their Property".&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 qtd p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The actors responded in an article published in the ''Daily Journal'' of 26 September. Also during the summer, Edward Phillips produced ''The Stage-Mutineers'', a play that started on 27 July and ran for twelve nights. The play made fun of actors, writers, and the management as a whole. Even though it was attacked in the ''Grub-Street Journal'' of 9 August, theatre historian Robert Hume described the play as "harmless stuff".&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Fielding was personally mocked as Crambo, one of the characters within the play, and was offended by the portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reopening==
The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors. The majority of the rebellious actors joined the [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre in Haymarket]] and started producing plays on 26 September. Although the Theatre Royal had replacement actors of a lesser talent and a few loyal experienced members, Henry Fielding joined the management's side of the dispute. Of the 15 loyal actors that stayed with the Theatre Royal, only a few, including [[Kitty Clive]], [[Christiana Horton]], William Mullart, and Charles Stoppelaer, were of note.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Highmore was losing 50–60 pounds a week.&lt;ref&gt;Koon 1986 p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Victor, in his account of the time, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; for a very middling Company of Players could be expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the ''Haymarket''. The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every ''Saturday'' Morning in the Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency every Week with the utmost Exactness.&lt;ref&gt;Victor 1761 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In such conditions, Giffard sold his shares and turned over full control of the theatre to Highmore. Hill was brought in to work with the actors at Drury Lane by Autumn 1733, but the theatre was still declining by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 166–168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Fielding - Jonathan Wild.png|right|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=Monochrome sketch of a man in head-dress looking left. He is wearing a black jacket.|Henry Fielding]]
In order to aid the theatre, Fielding revised his ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''The Intriguing Chambermaid''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding's ''The Miser'' was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King, the Queen, and many noble families in attendance. After this, Fielding produced ''The Universal Gallant: or, The Different Husbands'', which didn't run until February 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with the management of the Theatre Royal because they were "people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized".&lt;ref&gt;Woods 1966 p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his ''The Author's Farce'' which ran on 15 January 1734. This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute, and it was harder for him to stage plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus, through his father, applied to the Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking to have a new license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the [[Master of the Revels]], and received a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the ''Daily Post'' dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 173–176&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial, in which the rebellious actors sued the management at the [[Queen's Bench|King's Bench]] over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Chief Justice Philip Yorke]] was in favour of the actors, and they were to be granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against [[John Harper (actor)|John Harper]], one of the rebellious actors, for being a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]], and Harper was sent to [[Bridewell Palace]] prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the ''Daily Post'' of 16 November. Eventually, a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the ''Daily Courant'' announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ArtForo''' is an art fair, staged annually, that exhibits works by acclaimed [[Latin America|Latin American]] artists. Artforo also features lectures and symposiums dedicated to the understanding and promotion of [[Latin American art]].

==History==
ArtForo was started in 2016 in [[New York City]] by painter [[Oscar Abreu]] and curated by gallerist [[Karima Boutaleb]]. In its inaugural year, the Artforo show featured works by visual artists Mariano Sanchez, Joaquin Rosario, Pedro Gallardo, Pablo Palasso, Van Robert and Oscar Abreu. Writer Adrian Cabreja gave a lecture on [[Psycho-Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/on-thursday-washington-heights-will-host-the-first-ever-fair-of-dominican-art-040416|website=timeout.com|title=On Thursday, Washington Heights will host the first-ever fair of Dominican art|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnainfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160401/washington-heights/first-ever-art-fair-exclusively-for-dominicans-coming-washington-heights|title=First-Ever Art Fair Exclusively for Dominicans Coming to Washington Heights - Washington Heights - New York|website=DNAinfo|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ArtForo expanded into a multi-art fair that featured [[visual arts]], [[Culinary art|culinary arts]], and [[music]]. Musical performances were given by Emi Antonio, Alvaro, Gabbano, Roy Tavare and Zeo Munoz. David Nunez was the chef of the fair’s opening gala and provided a selection of Japanese/ Dominican fused foods. Lectures were provided by art critic Gamal, Michelen Stefan, art critic Odalis G. Perez, writer Ramon Dario Jimenez, producer Armando Guareno and Councilmember [[Ydanis Rodriguez]].&lt;ref name="elcaribe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2017/04/05/celebran-feria-arte-dominicano-artforo-nueva-york|author=Marcos A.

[[Image:Bella Goodall.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Bella Goodall]]&lt;/center&gt;
'''Isabella Goodall''' (10 August 1851 – 2 February 1884)&lt;ref&gt;Dates are from Goodall's obituary notice in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 9 February 1884, p. 11. According to the obituary section of ''Who's Who in The Theatre'' (which gives the date of her death as ''3'' February 1884) she was aged 32 when she died, which accords with ''The Era''. If these sources are correct, she was only 13 when she was given the benefit performance in Liverpool, and 14 when she made her London debut&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[soubrette]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre. She made her name on the stage in her native city, [[Liverpool]], and later became a star of the London theatre, both in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] and comic plays.

==Biography==
Goodall was born in [[Liverpool]]. By 1865, she was a star at the city's Theatre Royal, [[Williamson Square]]. In February 1865 she was granted a benefit performance in which she acted and sang. Works played on that occasion included [[Dion Boucicault]]'s [[burletta]] ''A Lover by Proxy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 6 February 1865, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; She also starred in productions in other Liverpool theatres at about this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 16 February 1865, p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The author and journalist [[William Henry Rideing]] reminisced in 1912 about his boyhood in Liverpool, where he remembered Goodall as the reigning soubrette: "Then the orchestra would tune up and Miss Goodall, smiling and bowing, would open the most beautiful mouth in the world .... It bowled me over."&lt;ref&gt;Rideing, William H. [https://archive.org/stream/manycelebritiesa00riderich/manycelebritiesa00riderich_djvu.txt ''Many Celebrities''], Doubleday, 1912. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her London debut in April 1865 at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in J P Wooler's ''The Winning Hazard'', attracting favourable reviews from ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', London's leading theatre journal,&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 16 April 1865, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Daily News.''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'', 17 April 1865, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In July of the same year, also at the Prince of Wales's, she made a success as a comic [[Lancashire|Lancastrian]] housemaid in a new farce, ''The Mudborough Election.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 16 July 1865, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1865 she was cast in [[pantomime]] in ''King Chess'' at the [[Surrey Theatre|New Surrey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Era,'' 24 December 1865, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two years she continued to establish herself as a leading [[West End theatre|West End]] player in comic plays and burlesques. In 1866 she was cast as one of two "squabbling schoolgirls intent on marriage" in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''One Hundred Thousand Pounds''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper'', 13 May 1866, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent performances in this period included Byron's classical burlesque, ''Pandora's Box'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 3 February 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magic Toys'' at the Prince of Wales's with [[Marie Wilton]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily News'', 26 April 1867, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the farces, ''Mr and Mrs White'' and ''The Rendezvous''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era,'' 28 July 1867, p. 8; and 17 November 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In pantomime she was "a very dashing and prepossessing Princess Eglantine" in a version of ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'' for the 1867 Christmas season,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 26 December 1867, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and she successfully took a ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' (male) role in Boucicault's ''The Flying Scud'' at the Holborn Theatre, playing Lord Woodbie,&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 19 January 1868, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; followed by another trousers role, the valet Max, in Gilbert's burlesque, ''[[The Merry Zingara]]'', a parody of ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/merry_zing.doc Text of ''The Merry Zingara'',] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001011421/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/merry_zing.doc |date=1 October 2009 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 she joined the company of the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in the burlesque ''The Field of the Cloth of Gold'' and appeared with the company mainly in London but also on tour during the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 1 September 1869, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 she appeared as "a spirited [[St Patrick]]" in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''Sir George and a Dragon'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 3 April 1870, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; in which her dancing was "a marvellous tour de force – perhaps more vigorous than graceful, but her Irish jig is decidedly one of the most attractive features in the burlesque."&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 10 April 1870, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; During her time with the Strand company the repertoire mixed burlesques and straight plays, including comedies such as ''Up in the World'', by Arthur Sketchley, in which she appeared in 1871 as a riotous page-boy.&lt;ref&gt;''Pall Mall Gazette'', 13 February 1871, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

She was evidently not only a practitioner of the theatre but also a teacher. In November 1868, ''The Era'' reported, "Miss Ada Arnold, a pupil of Miss Bella Goodall, made a successful debut at the Holborn Theatre on Saturday last in the burlesque of [[Lucrezia Borgia]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 22 November 1868, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

She died at [[Pentonville Road]] and was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;West Norwood Cemetery, Burial index and Purchase register, Grave 12,361, square 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Basic taste qualities like sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami serve specific functions in identifying food components found in the diet of humans and animals, and are recognized by proteins in the oral cavity. Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 670 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds.

==Database overview==

===Bitter compounds===
[[File:Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB.jpg|frame|right|alt=|Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB]]
'''BitterDB''' currently contains more than 670 compounds that were cited in the literature as bitter. For each compound, the database offers information regarding its molecular properties, references for the compound’s bitterness, including additional information about the bitterness category of the compound (e.g. a ‘bitter-sweet’ or ‘slightly bitter’ annotation), different compound identifiers (smiles, CAS registry number, IUPAC systematic name), an indication whether the compound is derived from a natural source or is synthetic, a link to the compound’s [[PubChem]] entry and different file formats for downloading (sdf, image, smiles).
Over 200 bitter compounds have been experimentally linked to their corresponding human bitter taste receptors. For those compounds, BitterDB provides additional information, including links to the publications indicating these ligand–receptor interactions, the effective concentration for receptor activation and/or the [[EC50]] value and links to the associated bitter taste receptors entries in the '''BitterDB'''.

====Querying and browsing====
Bitter compounds can be queried and browsed in different ways. For example, 'advanced search' option allows user to retrieve compounds that fit different criteria, such as a combination of specific physical properties or a combination of associated human bitter taste receptors.
In addition to the querying options the user can browse through a sort-able table with all the '''BitterDB''' compounds.

===Bitter taste receptors===
In addition, '''BitterDB''' contains data about the 25 known human bitter taste receptors. Several properties are displayed for each receptor. The bitter taste receptors can be searched using different criteria: name, known ligands and [[UniProt]] accession number. Using a table that presents all the bitter taste receptors and some information about them, the user can browse and also sort by various options, such as the number of bitter ligands associated with the receptor.

===Local BLAST service and global alignment===
'''BitterDB''' offers two additional features: a local [[BLAST]] service to determine the local similarity between a query sequence and the different human bitter taste receptors, and a global alignment of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. The alignment was generated using [[Clustalw|ClustalW2]], and displays the secondary structure of each receptor, as predicted by the TOPCONS server.

===Users can upload bitter compounds===
'''BitterDB''' offers an ‘upload’ option, by which the users are encouraged to submit information about bitter compounds. These data will be reviewed by the authors and uploaded to the database accordingly. The users can join the mailing list in order to receive database updates.

[[File:Libros de Eloísa Cartonera 2.jpg|thumb|Cartonera books from Eloísa Cartonera.]]
'''Cartonera''' is a social, political and artistic [[publishing]] movement that began in [[Argentina]] in 2003 and has since spread to countries throughout [[Latin America]] and, more recently, to [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The founders, [[Washington Cucurto]], Javier Barilaro, and Fernanda Laguna started [[Eloísa Cartonera]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in response to the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|2001 economic crisis]] during which the [[Argentine peso]] plummeted to one third of its value. The tough economic conditions led to an increase in the number of [[Waste picker|cartoneros]], people who make their living collecting and selling salvaged materials to recycling plants.

Cartonera books are made from cardboard bought from cartoneros at three to five times the price set by recycling plants. The cardboard is then used to create covers for short books of prose or poetry. Each book cover is hand painted and sold on the streets at the cost of production in order to increase access to literature. This method of publication has provided the opportunity for unknown authors to be published, as well as for renowned authors to reach a more diverse audience. Beyond selling affordable books, the cartoneras promote literacy and the democratization of literature through workshops and book fairs which bring the greater public in contact with literature. The cartonera publishers also involve the community in the process of book creation and distribution through a cooperative learning experience which pushes aside educational and socioeconomic divides among participants. The books are generally published in small editions of 100 or fewer; however, popular texts are kept in print or printed through neighboring cartoneras.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna, Fernanda. "No hay cuchillo sin rosas: Historia de una editorial latinoamericana". Buenos Aires: Eloísa Cartonera. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilbija"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.meiotom.art.br/AkademiaCartoneraArticles.pdf |year=2009 |title=Akademia Cartonera: A Primer of Latin American Cartonera Publishers |publisher=Parallel Press / University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries |editor-last=Bilbija |editor-first=Ksenija |editor2-last=Celis Carbajal |editor2-first=Paloma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cartoneras publish books in print form, information about the publishing houses themselves is often available electronically through their webpages, blogs, and wikis, or through online newspaper stories, interviews, and journal articles. While digital mediums are often used to write about cartonera, the books themselves are art-objects steeped in the smells and smudges of tempera paint and rough scissor-cut edges. Some cartonera books are now being preserved, most notably through the [https://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/arts/eloisacart/ University of Wisconsin-Madison's Cartonera Publishers library collection and database], but the majority of the editions continue to circulate (as they are intended to do) and will disintegrate within ten years due to acid in the cardboard. As with other digitized databases and guides, the list below includes some of the presently known cartoneras, a number which is always shifting.

During the international 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour]] of the Irish rock band [[U2]], the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", the group would play politically-themed songs.  During the opening portion of "[[Love and Peace or Else]]", [[Bono]] wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonobaltimore/18007038/|others=Kurman, Mike|accessdate=2015-10-20|title=Bono, 5\28\05, Boston, MA, TD Banknorth Garden

The image and variations of it are used as automobile [[bumper sticker]]s.&lt;ref name=TDB&gt;{{cite web|work=The Daily Beast|date=2014-12-21|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|title=COEXIST's Bonehead Bumper-Sticker Politics: America's simplistic adoption of the COEXIST bumper sticker signals a dangerous inability to understand the roots of religious conflict.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224214154/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|archivedate=2014-12-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] which began after the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.&lt;ref name = "Wrasman" /&gt;

One common version of the bumper sticker spells "COEXIST" using an Islamic crescent moon for the "C", a [[peace sign]] for the "O", a combination of the [[male symbol]] and [[female symbol]] for the "E", a [[Star of David]] for the "X", a [[pentagram]] for the dot of the "I", a [[yin-yang symbol]] for the "S", and a Christian cross for the "T".&lt;ref name = "Wrasman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrasman|first=Andy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Contradict|year=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|pages=2–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043909/https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBGoVChMIk5L4mL7MyAIVQvI-Ch2mqQEN#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781490819297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Lance|editor-last=Gharavi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0wjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Religion, Theatre, and Performance: Acts of Faith|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136483400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal disputes==
In 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other.  They were also unaware that a company in [[Indiana]] already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003.  At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own.  The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image.  Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

==Parodies==

The popularity of the bumper stickers has spawned several anti-Muslim responses, including one with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi" /&gt;

There are several anti-religious parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction' and 'Contradict'.

Other parodies include a Communist [[hammer and sickle]] for the "E" and a [[swastika]] for the "X", indicating the dangers inherent in all ideologies.&lt;ref name=Bowen&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Jack|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=If You Can Read This: The Philosophy of Bumper Stickers|publisher=Random House|year=2010|page=193|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044358/https://books.google.com/books?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiA2vu7uc3IAhUENz4KHY60Ano|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781588369505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cordelia Chase''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Joss Whedon]] for the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''; she also appeared on ''Buffy's'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. Portrayed by [[Charisma Carpenter]], the character appears as a series regular in the first three seasons of ''Buffy'', before exiting the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of ''Angel''. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in ''Angel''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s one hundredth episode. Cordelia also appears in both [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] and [[apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]] ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' material such as [[comic book]]s and [[novel]]s.

Cordelia is introduced in "[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]" as one of [[Sunnydale High]]'s popular [[cheerleader]]s, attending school alongside [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampire slayer]] [[Buffy Summers]]. Through her interactions with Buffy and [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|her friends]], she comes to accept the existence of supernatural forces and helps Buffy fight against them. In the television series ''Angel'', Cordelia joins [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], a heroic [[vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampire]] with a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], in forming a detective agency dedicated to stopping supernatural forces and helping the helpless. After Cordelia acquires the ability to see visions of those in need, she becomes a more compassionate and heroic character. In the middle of the third season, she becomes a love interest of the protagonist Angel. In the fourth season of ''Angel'', she appears to take on a villainous role before it is revealed that she is possessed by a [[Jasmine (Angel)|malevolent deity]]; this storyline eventually leads to her death and subsequent exit from the series. The character makes further [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] appearances in the comic books ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Buffy Season Eight]]'' and ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'', in a dream [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and as a [[spirit guide]].

Created as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for ''Buffy''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s titular heroine, Cordelia was initially characterized as "shallow", "vain" and "self-centered", and was used in the series to create conflict for the other characters. The character went through changes as she gradually redeemed herself throughout the course of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'', and has received attention in academic texts related to [[gender studies]] and [[social status]].

== Appearances ==

=== Television ===
Cordelia Chase first appears in the premiere episode of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', titled "[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]". Introduced as a potential friend for Sunnydale High's newest student, [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), Cordelia reveals her true colors by cruelly mocking [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), whom Buffy befriends instead.&lt;ref name="Welcome to the Hellmouth"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]|series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]|credits=Joss Whedon (writer and executive producer), [[Charles Martin Smith]] (director)|network=[[The WB]]|airdate=1997-03-10|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorant of the supernatural, Cordelia shows up regularly throughout the first season of ''Buffy'' to insult and ridicule the other characters. She plays a larger role in the episode "[[Out of Mind, Out of Sight (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Out of Mind, Out of Sight]]", in which she falls victim to a social outcast who wants revenge on popular students for ignoring her so much that she turned invisible.&lt;ref name="Out of Mind, Out of Sight"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Out of Mind, Out of Sight (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Out of Mind, Out of Sight]]|series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]|credits=Joss Whedon (story and executive producer), Ashley Gable and Thomas A.

In "[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]", dating someone of Xander's social status causes Cordelia's ostracism from her popular peers and she reluctantly breaks up with him. However, when Xander performs a love spell to pay her back for hurting him, Cordelia realises how much he cares about her and takes him back, rejecting her superficial friends in the process.&lt;ref name="BBB"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]|series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]|credits=[[Marti Noxon]] (writer), [[James A.

Cordelia later attempts an unsuccessful relationship with [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] ([[Alexis Denisof]]) and makes peace with Xander at the [[prom]].&lt;ref name="The Prom"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Prom (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Prom]]|series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]|credits=Marti Noxon (writer), [[David Solomon (producer)|David Solomon]] (director), Joss Whedon|network=[[The WB]]|airdate=1999-05-11|season=3|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season three finale, she rallies alongside Buffy and her friends at graduation against the demonic [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor of Sunnydale]] ([[Harry Groener]]), where Cordelia slays her first vampire.&lt;ref name="Graduation Day"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Graduation Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Graduation Day, Parts One and Two]]|series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]|credits=Joss Whedon (writer and director)|network=[[The WB]]|date=18 May – 13 July 1999|season=3|number=21 and 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three seasons on ''Buffy'', Cordelia left the series to move over to star in ''Angel'', a spin-off series focusing on Buffy's vampire ex-lover [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]). The first season of ''Angel'' sees Cordelia move to [[Los Angeles]], in the hopes of escaping her new-found poverty by becoming an actress. After Angel saves her life in the series pilot, Cordelia helps him found the supernatural detective agency [[Angel Investigations]], working in an administrative position.&lt;ref name="City of"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[City of]]|series=[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]|network=[[The WB]]|credits=Joss Whedon &amp; [[David Greenwalt]] (writers), Joss Whedon (director)|airdate=1999-08-05|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also becomes close to half-demon co-worker [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle]] ([[Glenn Quinn]]), but their budding romance is ended by his death nine episodes into the series.

In season three's "[[Birthday (Angel)|Birthday]]", Cordelia learns from the demon [[Skip (Angel)|Skip]] ([[David Denman]]) that her visions are slowly killing her because human beings are not strong enough to control them. To save her life, Cordelia accepts Skip's offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A., instead landing her big break as an actress. However, even in this alternate timeline, Cordelia feels compelled to help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again, who received the visions in her place and is now insane.

Cordelia falls into a post-natal [[coma]] for the remainder of season four. Following an eleven-episode absence, Cordelia returns to ''Angel'' in season five, in the 100th episode "[[You're Welcome (Angel)|You're Welcome]]". Having apparently awoken from her coma, Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations, who she discovers have taken over Wolfram &amp; Hart since their defeat of Jasmine. She chastises Angel for accepting W&amp;H's "[[Deal with the Devil|deal with the devil]]", and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling. Together, they face and defeat their old enemy [[Lindsey McDonald]] ([[Christian Kane]]), who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel. In the episode's closing moments, Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him, shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning in the hospital. When Angel turns around, Cordelia is gone. It is later revealed that this encounter—[[The Powers That Be (Angel)|the Powers That Be]] repaying their debt to Cordelia—allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel, giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the [[Circle of the Black Thorn]].&lt;ref name="You're Welcome"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[You're Welcome (Angel)|You're Welcome]]|series=[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]|credits=[[David Fury]] (writer and director), Joss Whedon|airdate=2004-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] developed a 4-minute pilot episode for ''[[Buffy the Animated Series]]'', which was set during the show's first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Cordelia (voiced by Charisma Carpenter) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 [[internet leak|leak]] of the pilot to [[YouTube]], Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/26/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-animated-series-to-be-resurrected/|title='Buffy The Vampire Slayer' Animated Series To Be Resurrected?|accessdate=2008-09-05|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=2008-08-26|work=[[MTV|MTV Movies Blog]]|publisher=MTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
Cordelia also appears in [[comic book]]s and novels based on the ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' television series. ''The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1'' by Nancy Krulik is a [[novelization]] of the ''Buffy'' episodes "[[Out of Mind, Out of Sight (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Out of Mind, Out of Sight]]", "[[Some Assembly Required (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Some Assembly Required]]" and "[[Homecoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Homecoming]]". These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted: by a scorned classmate, to become a [[zombie]]'s bride and by [[The Most Dangerous Game|hunters]] in a case of mistaken identity.&lt;ref name=Collection&gt;{{cite book|last=Krulik|first=Nancy|authorlink=Nancy Krulik|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon Spotlight Entertainment]]; [[Pocket Books]]|year=2002|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-7434-2746-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appears in numerous [[List of Angel novels|''Angel'' novels]] as a member of Angel Investigations, but some feature Cordelia more prominently; in ''[[Not Forgotten (Angel novel)|Not Forgotten]]'' she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants, while in ''[[Haunted (Angel novel)|Haunted]]'' she appears as a contestant on a supernatural-themed [[reality television]] show when she has a vision about another applicant. Cordelia appears in the majority of ''Angel'' comics, published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] during 2000–2002 and set between episodes of the television series. She appears less frequently in those by [[IDW Publishing]] between 2005 and 2011, mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season. Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse ''Angel'' comics. However, issue seventeen was a "Cordelia Special", in which demonic items are stashed in Cordelia's apartment. In the ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' story "Lovely dark and deep", Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie. Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini-series ''[[The Curse (Angel comic)|Angel: The Curse]]'', set after season five, in flashback scenes.&lt;ref name=TheCurse&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariotte|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Mariotte|title=[[The Curse (Angel comic)|Angel: The Curse]]|publisher=[[IDW Publishing]]|year=2006|location=[[San Diego]], [[California]]|isbn=1-933239-79-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently reappears in the mini-series ''[[Old Friends (Angel comic)|Angel: Old Friends]]'', which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends. Cordelia claims to be the genuine article, having returned from the dead, but Angel is unconvinced and kills her; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones.&lt;ref name=OldFriends&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariotte|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Mariotte|title=[[Old Friends (Angel comic)|Angel: Old Friends]]|publisher=[[IDW Publishing]]|year=2006|location=[[San Diego]], [[California]]|isbn=1-933239-76-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'', a canonical comic book continuation of the television series plotted by Joss Whedon and written by [[Brian Lynch (writer)|Brian Lynch]], features the characters of ''Angel'' and all of Los Angeles condemned to Hell after the events of the series finale "[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|Not Fade Away]]". Cordelia does not appear until the twelfth issue, in which she acts as a guide to Angel in his dying moments; it is revealed she serves in some capacity as a higher power now. The character departs in issue thirteen. Cordelia also appears in a dream sequence within the twentieth issue of ''Buffy''{{'}}s canonical continuation, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', titled "[[After These Messages... We'll Be Right Back!]]". Buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at Sunnydale High; Cordelia's physical appearance is based on the art style of Loeb and Whedon's unproduced ''Buffy'' animated series.

== Conception and casting ==
Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the series' main character Buffy Summers. Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series, Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy. The shallow cheerleader of the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|1992 ''Buffy'' film]], as played by [[Kristy Swanson]], had grown more mature and open-minded. Buffy now identified with the social outcasts, such as Willow and Xander. As a result, Cordelia Chase was created to embody the traits of that shallower Buffy.&lt;ref name=Welcomecomm&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]]|title=Commentary for ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]"|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite portraying a shallow, [[valley girl]] [[stock character]], actress Charisma Carpenter felt that Cordelia in early seasons was not "one-dimensional", nor was she "as superficial as people thought". At the same time, Carpenter was critical of her frequent role as the [[damsel in distress]].&lt;ref name=Zap2itCordy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7c75376%7c1%7c,00.html |title='Angel's' Cordelia Speaks the Truth |accessdate=2008-10-04 |work=Zap2it.com |date=2002-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825172252/http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1%2C1002%2C271%7C75376%7C1%7C%2C00.html |archivedate=August 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel'' co-creator and [[executive producer]] [[David Greenwalt]] describes Cordelia in her ''Buffy'' years as "a somewhat shallow, somewhat vain, somewhat self-centered but [a] lively and honest character who spoke her mind".&lt;ref name="I'm Cordelia"&gt;{{cite video|people=Joss Whedon, Charisma Carpenter, Kelly A.

Charisma Carpenter had originally planned to read for the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Carpenter, who had dressed casually for the role of Buffy—who she believed "could really be herself"—felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she "was definitely a character to dress for". Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were "really responsive" to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part.&lt;ref name=WG1&gt;{{cite book|last=Golden|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Golden|author2=[[Nancy Holder]] |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Watcher's Guide Vol. 1|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1998|location=[[New York City|New York]]|pages=203–206|isbn=0-671-02433-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Carpenter's audition, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. [[Bianca Lawson]] originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations.

== Characterization ==

=== Characteristics and analysis ===
Cordelia's representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in ''Buffy'' has been commented on in several academic texts, particularly in [[gender studies]], such as "Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls", or ''[[Sex and the Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan|Sex and the Slayer]]''. In the latter, Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia's initial place in the series where "At first glance, Cordelia seems to have the 'normal life' Buffy often longs for. She is a familiar character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Furthermore, Cordelia's exceptionalism is based on 'real' material privilege rather than supernatural power. She represents in more exaggerated form the unnamed [[white people|white]] [[American middle class|middle-class]] [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] qualities (read privilege) of the other characters (to the point that it becomes visible)."&lt;ref name="SatS"/&gt; Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia's status is highlighted by her nickname, "Queen C", and Harmony's remark to her, "Cordy, you reign."&lt;ref name="The Wish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Queen C in Boys' Town"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rambo |first=Elizabeth |title="Queen C" in Boys’ Town: Killing the Angel in Angel’s House |journal=Slayage |volume=6 |issue=3 |url=http://slayageonline.com/PDF/Rambo2.pdf |date=Spring 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807131240/http://slayageonline.com/PDF/Rambo2.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters."&lt;ref name="SatS"/&gt;

"Praising Cordelia" argues that both Buffy and Cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women, who "represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls". The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters. Buffy's initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive, socially competent Buffy as a threat to her. Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy's friend, theirs is not a friendship of "mutual support, warmth and intimacy" but rather one of "mutual antipathy". The authors opine that Cordelia, unlike Buffy, is a "representation of the archetypal 'feminine type'", one who conforms to the "pervasive stereotypes of femininity while, at the same time, dominating the other girls in the school" and commanding the attention of the boys.&lt;ref name="Praising Cordelia"&gt;

{{cite book|chapter=Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls|title=Aggression and Adaptation: The Bright Side to Bad Behaviour|editor=ed. Patrica H. Hawley, Todd. D Little and Phillip C. Rodin|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc|year= 2007|pages=157–185|author=Lorrie K. Sippola, Jamie Paget and Carie M. Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing her character arc in ''Buffy'', Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed ''Buffy'' characters, one who "reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits."&lt;ref&gt;Money, Mary Alice. ''The Undemonization of Supporting Characters in Buffy.'' ed. Rhonda V. Wilcox and David Lavery. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000: pp. 98-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Jowett argues that Cordelia's assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander, and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the [[peer pressure]] from her old friends. She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her, because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer. After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him, and instead retains her autonomy.&lt;ref name="SatS"/&gt;

Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer note how Cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes, describing "Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to the stereotype of the insensitive bitch", what she actually does is "offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in "[[Earshot (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Earshot]]", where Buffy temporarily develops [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, "her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical" and because of this she embodies an "antithesis of female self-sacrifice" in these years but also "the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women".&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Kord, Elisabeth Krimmer. "Vamp(ire)s and Those Who Kill Them", ''Hollywood Divas, Indie Queens, and TV Heroines''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (December 28, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Jennifer Crusie]] interprets this as Cordelia's "lack of depth" becoming "her strength". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however, pointing out "Cordy's [[solipsism]] could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible."&lt;ref name="Assassination"&gt;Crusie, Jennifer. "The Assassination of Cordelia Chase." Yeffeth. 187-97&lt;/ref&gt; Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, "bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal", as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.&lt;ref name="SatS"/&gt;

In early seasons of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', Cordelia was often used both as [[comic relief]] and occasionally for the damsel in distress [[plot device]], which would require series' heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential.&lt;ref name=ThrilloftheChase&gt;{{cite journal|date=Feb–March 2007|title=The Thrill of the Chase|journal=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Magazine incorporating Angel Magazine]]|issue=92|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about the psychology of characters in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', Steven C. Schlozman writes about how "Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and her father was prosecuted for income [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]]. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander." He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and "all the characters of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlozman|first=Steven C.|date=Spring 2000|title=Vampires and Those Who Slay Them: Using the Television Program Buffy the Vampire Slayer in Adolescent Therapy and Psychodynamic Education|journal=Academic Psychiatry|volume=24|issue=1|pages=49–54|issn=1042-9670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Discussing Cordelia's relationship with Xander, Carpenter says, "A lot of Cordy's conflict, and a lot of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [Nicholas Brendon]." However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [try] not to lose her edge, her honesty." Carpenter claims that Cordelia's "rough edges" made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character.&lt;ref name=WG1/&gt; Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final ''Buffy'' appearance, "[[Graduation Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)#Part 2|Graduation Day, Part Two]]".&lt;ref name=Zap2itCordy/&gt;

Over the course of her appearances in ''Angel'', Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." &lt;ref name=ThrilloftheChase/&gt; Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing &lt;blockquote&gt;The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because there have been so many chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny &amp;ndash; I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/angel/interviews/carpenter/page2.shtml |title= Interviews: Charisma Carpenter: From bitch to hero|accessdate=2008-10-04 |work= BBC Cult |publisher= BBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", which turned out to be her "trial by fire".&lt;ref name="Assassination"/&gt;

Executive producer David Greenwalt was very keen to acquire the character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, "I desperately wanted her to come to ''Angel'' because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile." At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of ''Buffy'' where "All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?", leading him to introduce [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]) to the cast to accommodate her absence.&lt;ref name=IntroducingSpike&gt;{{cite video |people=Joss Whedon, James Marsters (interviews)|date=2002-05-20|title=Introducing Spike|medium= DVD (Region 2)|publisher=Twentieth Century Fox}} (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season Four featurette)&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a "rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of ''Angel'', Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually." Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins "finding within herself a new level of humanity".&lt;ref name="Assassination"/&gt;

Greenwalt discusses how Cordelia "is sort of forced to become a deeper character" when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, "She's sort of living with one foot in the world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'"&lt;ref name="I'm Cordelia"/&gt; Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress.&lt;ref name=Zap2itCordy/&gt; From the tenth episode, "[[Parting Gifts]]", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The [[To Shanshu in L.A.|first-season finale]] saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over.&lt;ref name=ThrilloftheChase/&gt; The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." Carpenter explains, "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life."&lt;ref name="I'm Cordelia"/&gt;

Carpenter pleaded to the producers to let her cut her hair in the second season of ''Angel'', but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a "dark edge of Cordelia" which wasn't as "warm and effervescent as she usually is", so for the third season they wanted her to "go shorter and blonder".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/angel/interviews/carpenter/page9.shtml BBC Cult Interviews | Charisma Carpenter A hairy problem], BBC Cult.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel'''s third season demonstrates Cordelia's development into a fully-fledged heroine. The episode "[[Birthday (Angel)|Birthday]]" saw her being offered the chance to live a life where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries.&lt;ref name=Birthday/&gt; In "[[Billy (Angel)|Billy]]", Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show's stunt co-ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry.&lt;ref name=Zap2itCordy/&gt; In the episode "[[Waiting in the Wings (Angel)|Waiting in the Wings]]", both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the "point that the [[Mutant Enemy Productions]] writers evidently lost their minds". She goes on to describe how Cordelia's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character.&lt;ref name="Assassination"/&gt; Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when "the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit ''Angel'', and as an overwhelmingly positive force" where later [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] ([[Amy Acker]]), "the character who is conflicted about her privilege" in season five "ends up being possessed by a [[Illyria (Angel)|millennia-old demon]]".&lt;ref name="Blood Relations"&gt;"Demonic Maternities, Complex Motherhoods: Cordelia, Fred and Illyria." ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Angel'' season four played with audience's expectations of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's [[Big Bad]]; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy."&lt;ref name=ThrilloftheChase/&gt; She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though;  director [[Terrence O'Hara]] commented that he thought Carpenter had "a lot of fun" playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode "[[Orpheus (Angel)|Orpheus]]" because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new "[[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] madwoman" characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Terrence O'Hara, Jeffrey Bell|date=2004-03-01|title=Commentary for ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode "[[Orpheus (Angel)|Orpheus]]"|medium=DVD (Region 2)|publisher=Twentieth Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a  2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline "freaked him out."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060527032006/http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts5/halloweenHapps.html&lt;/ref&gt; The episode "[[Inside Out (Angel)|Inside Out]]" saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite the birth of the child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] ([[Julie Benz]]) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. [[Steven S. DeKnight]], who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Steven S. DeKnight|date=2004-03-01|title=Commentary for ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode "[[Inside Out (Angel)|Inside Out]]"|medium=DVD (Region 2)|publisher=Twentieth Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy;&lt;ref name="Reading Angel"/&gt; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode "Inside Out" she is left in a coma for the remainder of the fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, &lt;blockquote&gt;It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.&lt;ref name="Assassination"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also discuss the treatment of Cordelia (and Darla) in "''Angel'''s Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from ''[[Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul]]'' by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered "elaborated abjection" seen in ''Angel''. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: "More so than other characters in [''Buffy''] and ''Angel'', Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" and recounts the demon impregnation in "[[Expecting (Angel)|Expecting]]", and similarly in "[[Epiphany (Angel)|Epiphany]]", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in "[[Through the Looking Glass (Angel)|Through the Looking Glass]]". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, "If you ever figure out how to get us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in "Inside Out", to what [[Barbara Creed]] called the 'monstrous womb' in her book ''The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis''.&lt;ref name="Reading Angel"&gt;Hills, Matt and Williams, Rebecca. "Angel's Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", ''Reading Angel: The TV Spin-Off With a Soul''. ed. Stacy Abbot. I. B. Tauris (September 22, 2005): pp. 203-221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creed, Barbara. "Woman as Monstrous Womb: The Brood". ''The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (December 28, 2004): pp. 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the "real" Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes &lt;blockquote&gt;Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.&lt;ref name="Blood Relations"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For ''Angel''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fifth season, as with ''Buffy''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fourth, Spike steps in to replace Cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not".&lt;ref name="Blood Relations"/&gt; Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in ''Angel'''s fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used [[You're Welcome (Angel)|the 100th episode]] to reinforce the "mission statement" of the show,&lt;ref name="O'Hare"&gt;{{Cite book |title=At 100 (episodes), Angel bites into a new future while remembering the past |publisher=[[Sci Fi Weekly]] |date=February 2, 2004 |first=Patrick |last=Lee |accessdate=2007-09-26 |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw10665.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126040803/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw10665.html |archivedate = November 26, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began.

The scene was never shot because "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," says Fury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristy |last=Bratton |accessdate=2007-10-16 |title=ANGEL Season Five DVD Collection REVIEW |url=http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts5/S5dvdReview1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020164640/http://www.cityofangel.com/behindTheScenes/bts5/S5dvdReview1.html |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragutin Aleksić''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Драгутин Алексић; 8 March 1947 – 8 October 2011), Serbian [[naive art]] and [[outsider art]] (also used terms: marginal art, brut art) sculptor.

== Biography ==
Dragutin Aleksić was a famous Serbian naïve and marginal art sculptor. He was born in Sladaja near Despotovac (Serbia) in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;М. Бошковић; М. Маширевић, ''Самоуки ликовни уметници у Србији'', Торино, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ото Бихаљи-Мерин; Небојша – Бато Томашевић, ''Енциклопедија наивне уметности света'', Београд, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Krstić, ''Outsider Art in Serbia'', MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;He began doing sculpture in 1968. He died in Sladaja, near Despotovac (Serbia) in 2011.

== Artistic style ==
His preoccupation with existential problems of farmers, highlanders, miners is visible in the structures of extraordinary expressive force, achieved by a specific manner of procession, more with forceful cuts in the wood by an axe than by a sculptor’s chisel. Led by a strong instinct and robust character, he processed the wood rustically, transmitting his raw energy into a wooden mass, emphasizing a predominant force of a man – highlander, who seizes from the nature in his fight for survival. In his sculptures with multiplied figures, central figures or events are rare. While doing sculpture Aleksić liberates a thought, not a tale, hence the intensity of expression is most pronounced in the mere procedure of cutting, quick and capricious, in order to make his idea visible as soon as possible. With deeper, abrupt, unexpected incision in wood he creates dynamic light effects in which the dance of light and shadow provides an additional dynamics to the whole work. He is an artist of action and instinct without pictorial deliberation. Therefore, his idea is raw, uncultivated, but direct, suggestive, sometimes schematically given but intensive and complete. From whole mass of monumental logs, heads and busts emerge, rarely whole human and animal figures and vegetation. In sculptural treatment, Dragutin Aleksić’s work has a touch of art brut, or more precisely, is on the borderline between naïve art and art brut.

== Exhibitions and awards ==
He had his first exhibition in 1970 and he participated in individual and group shows in the country and abroad. The greatest collection of his sculptures is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia. He received many domestic and international awards for his work.

[[Image:Dürer-Hieronymus-im-Gehäus.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'' (1514), an engraving by [[Northern Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
[[File:Engraving.jpg|thumb|Artist and engraver [[Chaim Goldberg]] at work]]

'''Engraving''' is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called "engravings". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.

"Engraving" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.

Traditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.

==Terms==
[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]

Other terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, "engraving" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. "Hand engraving" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.

Each graver is different and has its own use. '''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.

In addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.

===Tools and gravers or burins===
Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as "wriggle" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.

Musical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is "walked" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for "walking" the graver may also be referred to as "wriggle" or "wiggle" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.

===Tool geometry===
[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]
Tool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a "face", which is the top of the graver, and a "heel", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.

===Tool sharpening===
Sharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on "feel" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.

===Artwork design===
Design or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.

===Handpieces===
Originally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.

===Cutting the surface===

The actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional "hand push" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the "hand push" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.

Hand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create "bulino" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.

===Finishing===
Finishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called "burrs" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.

===Modern hand engraving===
[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]

Because of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.

The modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.

In most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.

===Machine engraving===
[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]
In some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.

===Computer-aided machine engraving===
[[Image:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]
Engraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&amp;nbsp;µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.

It is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.

Retail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.

With state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.
The engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.

Today laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.

==History==
''For the printing process, see [[intaglio (printmaking)]]. For the Western art history of engraved prints, see [[old master print]] and [[line engraving]]''

The first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/12/worlds-oldest-engraving-discovered/ World's oldest engraving discovered], Australian Geographic, 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] and dated to the [[Middle Stone Age]] around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA''. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}} {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], and larger engraved [[petroglyph]]s on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.
[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]
However the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,&lt;ref name="Caron"&gt;Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl. Metropolitan Museum Journal, 1993. 28: p. 47–55.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S.J., Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change. 1999, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Caron" /&gt;

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]
Thereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.

Before the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.

Many classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more "elegant" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.

[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] 
Modifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. 

===Music engraving===
{{main|Music engraving}}
The first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.

The first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article "Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.

==Applications today==
[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]

Examples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&amp;nbsp;µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.
Some schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[École Estienne]] in Paris.

==Creating tone==
[[Image:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]

In traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) – see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.

==Biblical references==
The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: "Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]]." [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.

'''''Euthanasia: Opposing Viewpoints''''' is a 2000 book in the ''[[Opposing Viewpoints series]]''.

It presents selections of contrasting points of view on four central questions about [[euthanasia]]: whether it is [[ethical]]; whether it should be legalized; whether legalizing it would lead to involuntary killing; and whether physicians should assist in [[suicide]].

It was edited by James D. Torr.

      <comment>/* Design */The author incorrectly states that train could reach 360 km/h, close to terminal velocity. Terminal velocity at low altitude is approximately 195 km/h. I reduced the speed by 15 km/h to estimate the additional friction that would exist due to a poor wind profile and the track.</comment>

The '''Euthanasia Coaster''' is an art concept for a [[steel roller coaster]] designed to kill its passengers.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/human-plus-science-gallery | title=The Future of the Human Species Explored | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=WIRED Science | date=6 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Solon, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was designed and made into a [[scale model]] by Julijonas Urbonas, a [[PhD candidate]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]]. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5793305/the-euthanasia-coaster-the-last-roller-coaster-youll-ever-ride | title=The Euthanasia Coaster, the Last Roller Coaster You'll Ever Ride | publisher=Gawker Media | date=18 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Lamar, Cyriaqe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned "[[euthanasia]]" or "[[execution]]".&lt;ref name="urbonas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://julijonasurbonas.lt/euthanasia-coaster/ | title=Euthanasia Coaster | date=2 October 2010 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Allen, who served as president of the [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]], inspired Urbonas with his description of the "ultimate" roller coaster as one that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news/34579/A-Rollercoaster-Designed-to-Kill-Humanely/?page=4 | title=A Rollercoaster Designed to Kill Humanely | publisher=Halls Create Arts Pte Ltd. | work= [[DesignTaxi]] | date=20 April 2011 | accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The concept design of the layout begins with a steep-angled [[lift hill|lift]] to the {{convert|510|m|ft|adj=on}} (0.317 mile) top, which would take two minutes for the 24-passenger [[train (roller coaster)|train]] to reach. Any passengers that wished to get off could then do so. &lt;ref name=wired/&gt; From there, a {{convert|500|m|ft|adj=on}} drop would take the train to {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h}}, close to its [[terminal velocity]], before flattening out and speeding into the first of its seven slightly [[clothoid]] [[Roller coaster inversions|inversions]].&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Each inversion would have a smaller [[diameter]] than the one before in order to maintain the lethal 10 [[g-force|g]] to passengers while the train loses speed. After a sharp right-hand turn the train would enter a straight, where unloading of corpses and loading of new passengers could take place.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster.jpg|thumb|Julijonas Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster at HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]].]]
The Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged [[cerebral hypoxia]], or insufficient supply of [[oxygen]] to the brain.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with [[greyout (medical)|gray out]] through [[tunnel vision]] to [[syncope (medicine)|black out]] and eventually [[g-LOC]] (g-force induced [[loss of consciousness]]).&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

==Exhibition==
Urbonas's concept drew media attention when shown as part of the HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]] from April through June 2011.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The display, designated as its 2011 '[[Flagship#Flagship as metaphor|flagship exhibition]]' by the Science Gallery,&lt;ref name="sciencegallery"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/humanplus/ | title=HUMAN+ The Future of Our Species | publisher=Trinity College Dublin | date=1 February 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to show the future of humans and technology.&lt;ref name="culturelab"&gt;{{cite web

==Popular culture==
In 2013, Norwegian rock group [[Major Parkinson]] released "Euthanasia Roller Coaster", a digital single with lyrics alluding to Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ba.no/puls/major-parkinson-er-tilbake/s/1-41-6773136 "Major Parkinson er tilbake"] Bergensavisen. Bergensavisen AS 23 July 2013. Retrieved 6 August 
2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lavie Tidhar]]'s short story ''Vladimir Chong Chooses to Die'' incorporates Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster into the ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=15551] Analog Science Fiction and Fact –September 2014 – Vol. CXXXIV No. 9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Paton’s short film ''H Positive'' explores the motivations of a wealthy man who, upon discovering that he is dying, commissions an architect to build a Euthanasia Coaster identical to Urbonas's design.  Although Urbonas is not mentioned during the film, the end credits affirm that the film was based on Urbonas's project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/dark-short-film-shows-off-theoretical-suicide-roller-coaster/|title=Dark Short Film Shows Off Theoretical Suicide Roller Coaster|publisher=[[Nerdist Industries]]|last=Hart|first=Matthew|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">'''Figurative Constructivism''' is an art movement that arose principally in Germany. The term was introduced by [[Franz Seiwert]] in 1929 using the phrase "gegenständlichen constructive", and this was subsequently taken up by [[Gerd Arntz]] and then by art historians more generally.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]. As Seiwert wrote "From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism".&lt;ref name=Kap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapounová|first1=Eliška|title=Grafická tvorba Augustina Tschinkela v kontextu moderního designu (1928 – 1940)|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/110838/ff_b/bak_Tschinkel_muni.pdf|publisher=Masarykova univerzita|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''a bis z''==
In October 1929 Seiwert, [[Heinrich Hoerle]] and [[Walter Stern (art critic)|Walter Stern]] produced the first issue of ''A bis Z'', subtitled "organ of the progressive artists group". It featured five artists from four towns: Seiwert and Hoerle ([[Cologne]]), [[Augustin Tschinkel]] ([[Prague]]), [[Peter Alma]] [[Amsterdam]] and Arntz ([[Vienna]]).&lt;ref name=BB/&gt; Tschinkel and Alma were both colleagues of Arntz at the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] run by [[Otto Neurath]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

== Annual conference ==
In 2017, the Folk Art Society of America celebrates its 30th conference. The conferences are open to all who register. They include a symposium, a benefit art auction, studio tours, home tours, and museum visits. Local museums usually plan an exhibition to coincide with the occurrence of the Society's conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One Hundred Miles: The 100th Anniversary of Miles Carpenter|date=1989|publisher=The MIles B.

== ''Folk Art Messenger'' ==
The ''Folk Art Messenger'' is a journal that includes a variety of articles from writers on topics important to the folk art and self-taught art world including articles about folk artists, auctions, exhibitions, fairs, collectors and book reviews, as well as artists' obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claire|first1=Jean-Claude|title=Calendar of Events|journal=Bulletin De L’Association Les Amis De Francois Ozenda|date=October 1993|volume=50|pages=97–98|language=French|issn=1164-3331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is known for its inclusive approach, focusing on the artists' struggles and successes, rather than hotly debated issues like what to call this type of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maizels|first1=John|title=Raw Creation Outsider Art and Beyond|date=1996|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|location=London|isbn=0-7148-3149-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the first ''Messenger'' was a black-and-white, 6-page fold out, but began to be published in color in 1997 with the 38th issue. Currently, the 40-page magazine carries no advertising and is the only American publication of its type published three time a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sellen|first1=Betty-Carol|title=Self Taught, Outsider, and Folk Art A Guide to American Artists, Locations and Resources|date=2016|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.

While the Folk Art Messenger focuses mainly on American artists, the two have much in common and previously referenced each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk Art Messenger|url=https://rawvision.com/search/rawvision/messenger|publisher=Raw Vision|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folk art environments ==
A folk art environment is a large-scale work of art created by a folk or self-taught artist. These works are identified and recorded by [[Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments]], a non profit arts organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Art Environment?|url=http://www.spacesarchives.org/about/what-is-an-art-environment/|publisher=SPACES|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Art Society has awarded 12 plaques of recognition to various folk art environments. The plaque from FASA identifies the site as worthy of preservation and protection. Recipients of this plaque include the [[Watts Towers]], [[Howard Finster]]'s Paradise Garden, the [[Miles B. Carpenter House|Miles B. Carpenter Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Miles B. Carpenter Museum|url=http://milesbcarpentermuseum.com/History_Of_The_Miles_B_Carpenter_Museum.shtml|publisher=Miles B. Carpenter Folk Art Museum|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village]].

Bottle Village, located in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley, Calif.]] was created by folk artist Tressa Prisbrey beginning in 1956. Following her death in 1988, the future of the village was uncertain. Many residents of the area found the site to be garish and wanted it demolished, however recognition from the Folk Art Society of America as well as the state's historic landmark program prevented its  destruction after it was damaged in the Simi Valley earthquake in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catania|first1=Sara|title=Weathered Work of Folk Art May Face Demolition : Simi Valley: Whimsical collection of structures may be leveled unless shored up.

== Location ==
The Folk Art Society was founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, Va]] and held its first conference in the city as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halle Saint Pierre|author2=Martine Lusardy|author3=John Maizels|title=Raw Vision 25 Ans d’Art Brut|date=2013|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organization strives to span the nation and now holds conferences throughout the US, the headquarters remain in Richmond since the founding except for a brief interlude. In 2014, the Society became a part of Longwood University, renamed the Folk Art Society of America at Longwood Center for the Visual Arts or FASA@LCVA. The FASA office and archives were moved to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville, Va]] for two years as a part of this transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohmann|first1=Bill|title=Folk Art Society Transferring to Longwood University|url=http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/folk-art-society-transferring-to-longwood-university/article_23931272-6e49-58d9-869c-c28fa0fcfd6d.html|access-date=11 March 2017|publisher=Richmond Times Dispatch|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this relationship was later discontinued and the Society returned to Richmond in March 2016. Currently the Society is in the process of turning its archives over to the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va., and will be working with Lee Shepard, the Vice President for Collections, in order to create a permanent archive that will be digitized and available for scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Staff: E.

The '''Folly Theatre''' was a [[London]] theatre of the late 19th century, in William IV Street, near [[Charing Cross]], in the [[City of Westminster]]. It was converted from the house of a religious order, and became a small theatre, with a capacity of 900 seated and standing. The theatre specialised in presenting [[music hall]], [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] and [[opera bouffe]]. The [[Beefsteak Club]] had quarters above the theatre.

As a stock company, under the direction first of Alexander Henderson and [[Lydia Thompson]] and then of [[John Lawrence Toole]], the theatre was significant for beginning the professional careers of many [[Victorian era]] actors, writers and actor-managers. The theatre was demolished in 1895, possibly due to disturbance caused to the neighbouring [[Charing Cross Hospital]].

==History==

===Early years===
The building opened as the ''Lowther Rooms''&lt;ref&gt;Named for the nearby popular ''Lowther Arcade'', a covered market for fancy goods, some 250 feet long and considered at that time ''one of the sights of London'' in [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45140 ''Charing Cross, the railway stations, and Old Hungerford Market'', Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 123-134] accessed: 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in 1840. It was the residence of the ''[[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Fathers of the London Oratory of St. Philip Neri]]'' from 1848–56 and was used for lectures.  Here, in 1850, [[John Henry Newman]] delivered his ''Lectures on Anglican Difficulties'', after his conversion to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume1/index.html ''Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Catholic Teaching'' John Henry Newman] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the departure of the religious order, which moved to the ''[[Brompton Oratory]]'', the hall became ''Woodin's Polygraphic Hall'' in 1855, where William S. Woodin gave monologue entertainments.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Toole.htm ''Toole's Theatre-Polygraphic Hall-Charing Cross Theatre-The Folly'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, the building was converted to a small [[Music hall]] and playhouse called the ''Royal Charing Cross Theatre'' and, in 1872 was renamed the '''Charing Cross Theatre''' and was advertised as the Theatre Royal, Charing Cross, in 1874-75.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/follytheatre.htm "Victorian London - Entertainment and Recreation" from VictorianLondon.org] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre opened on 19 June 1869 with [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s  [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', called ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'', on the bill,&lt;ref name=Druidess&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/pretty_druidess/review.html Review of the theatre's opening night,] ''[[The Times]]'' (republished at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1870 it held Gilbert and [[Frederic Clay]]'s ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]''.  In 1872, it hosted J. S. Clarke's revival of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'', featuring Mrs Stirling in the role that was to make her famous as ''[[Mrs Malaprop]]''.&lt;ref name=theatre&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html ''Theatres in Victorian London'' Philip V. Allingham (The Victorian Web)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''[[Charing Cross Music Hall]]'' was also adopted in the late 1880s by the brothers Carlo and Giovanni Gatti for their ''Gatti's-Under-the-Arches Music hall''.  This became the Hungerford Music Hall in 1883, later returning to the former name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=014EVA000000000U04008000 ''Advertisement for the Grand Star Company for Xmas at the Charing Cross Music Hall'' Collect Britain (British Library)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folly Theatre===
After some rebuilding, by architect [[Thomas Verity]], the theatre was renamed ''The Folly Theatre'' in 1876, when it was bought by Alexander Henderson, and it became a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] house, with his wife, [[Lydia Thompson]], in the lead roles. The first piece was a successful burlesque of ''Blue Beard''.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. ''Lydia Thompson, Queen of Burlesque'' (2002) Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-93766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, ''Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea'', by [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]] played at the theatre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 Information from the Operetta Research Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081746/http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 |date=27 July 2011 }} accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as did a Farnie and Reece adaptation of Offenbach called ''The Creole''.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama (1904)'' 1904 Chatto &amp; Windus, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the theatre had a tremendous success with [[Violet Cameron]] in [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', adapted by Farnie and Reece, which (after transferring to the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] and returning to the Folly), held the record for long runs in [[musical theatre]] for a decade. [[Florence St. John]] got her start in the piece on tour and then in the theatre. Farnie and Reece's burlesque ''Stars and Garters'' then played. Reece's successful burlesque, ''Carmen; or Sold for a Song'', and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''After Long Years'' both played at the theatre in 1879.  [[T. W. Roberton]]'s ''Dublin Bay'' played here in 1880.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; The theatre was described in ''[[Charles Dickens, Jr.|Dickens Dictionary of London]]'' (1879) as ''A little bandbox of a place, very prettily fitted up, and with a decided speciality for burlesque and opera bouffe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/follytheatre.htm Charles Dickens (Jr.), ''Dickens's Dictionary of London'', 1879] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farr Florence.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Florence Farr]] at the theatre]]
On 7 November 1879, [[John Lawrence Toole]] (1830-1906) took over the management, with a stock company.  Presentations included [[farces]], burlesques and travesties of popular plays, beginning with [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]'s ''A Fool and His Money''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1_MgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22toole's+theatre%22+london&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RswaSeZitb&amp;sig=1nXzaz8MkEHRr1BPfdbu6LkOdb0 MacMichael, J.

He spent much of the next few years touring, but also produced plays at the theatre, including [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s ''Hester's Mystery'' (1880) and Byron's ''Upper Crust and Auntie'' (1880),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/04/26/98896595.pdf NY Times review of ''The Upper Crust and Auntie'' 26 April 1880] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dion Boucicault]]'s play, ''Dot'', starring Toole, was produced here in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/Programmes/boucprog.htm Information from the play's programme] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toole's Theatre===
In 1882, after further rebuilding, Toole re-opened the theatre as '''Toole's Theatre''', becoming the first actor to have a [[West End theatre]] named after him.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary: John Lawrence Toole, ''[[The Times]]'', 31 July 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted actress [[Florence Farr]] (1860-1917) began her professional career with an apprenticeship at Toole's theatre, débuting with a juvenile role in Byron's ''Uncle Dick's Darling'', in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://drum.umd.edu/dspace/handle/1903/1530 | author = Boisseau, Robin Jackson | title = The Women of the Abbey Theatre, 1879-1925 | publisher = University of Maryland | date = 2004-05-05 | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, ''Stage Dora; or, Who Killed Cock Robin'', a burlesque by [[F. C. Burnand]] of Sardou's ''Fédora'', premiered at Toole's, starring Toole.  Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'' (1884) was a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama 'Claudian' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills.  ''Mr. Guffin’s Elopement'' and ''The Great Tay-Kin'', two shows with words by [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]] and music by [[George Grossmith]], starring Toole, played at the theatre in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London|publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;  The last play by [[John Maddison Morton]] to be produced in his lifetime, a three-act farcical comedy called ''Going It'', played at Toole's in 1885 and kept the house in a continual roar of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Scott|Scott, Clement]], "Biographical Introduction" to [[John Maddison Morton|Morton, John Maddison]], ''Plays for Home Performance''. London: Ward, Lock and Co., 1889, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinero's ''Girls and Boys'' played here in 1885, as did ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in  1886 and ''The Butler'', by [[Herman Charles Merivale]], starring Toole, also in 1886. ''Pepita'', an operetta by [[Charles Lecocq]], premiered at the theatre in 1888.  ''The Don'', by Merivale, also starred Toole in 1888.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

[[File:Bungalowtoole.jpg|left|350px]]''The Bungalow'', by Fred Horner, played at the theatre in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21citizen.org.uk/catalogues/evanion/results.asp?key=Toole's+Theatre&amp;source=showlist.asp&amp;type=Heading&amp;searchtype=&amp;id=234 Notices and posters for Toole's Theatre pieces]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ibsen's Ghost'', a one-act parody on ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', starring [[Irene Vanbrugh]] and Toole, was [[J. M. Barrie]]'s first London play, running for just 27 performances at Toole's Theatre from 30 May 1891. In 1892, Toole directed the première of Barrie's first hit play, ''Walker, London'', which ran for 497 performances.&lt;ref name=Pan&gt;[http://www.c20th.com/ppjmbarrie.htm Peter Pan exhibition site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220200635/http://www.c20th.com/ppjmbarrie.htm |date=20 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toole retired in 1893, due to increasing ill health, brought on by the deaths within a few years of his family.  His last piece was ''Thoroughbred'' by Ralph Lumley, and upon his retirement [[Rutland Barrington]] replaced him in the role.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Rutland (1908).  ''Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage, By Himself'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre was taken over by [[Violet Melnotte]], who had made her début at the Folly Theatre in October 1876 as ''Fezz'' in ''[[Bluebeard]]'' with Lydia Thompson's Company.  She had many interests and at the same time was building the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], with her husband [[Frank Wyatt (singer)|Frank Wyatt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/M/MelnotteViolet.htm ''Violet Melnotte (1855-1935)'' D'Oyly Carte, Who Was Who (Boise State University)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The lease expired in 1895 and plans were drawn up by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]] to  rebuild the theatre, but they were opposed, apparently because the noise at the theatre disturbed patients at the [[Charing Cross Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The theatre was demolished in 1896&lt;ref&gt;Earl, John and Michael Sell. ''Guide to British Theatres 1750-1950'', pp. 250 (Theatres Trust, 2000) {{ISBN|0-7136-5688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the site used to extend Charing Cross Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=1169 ''Papers: Toole, John Lawrence'' (University of Rochester)] accessed 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now a part of the Charing Cross Police Station.

[[File:Freitag der 13. im Kalender.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friday the 13th in a [[calendar]]]]
'''Friday the 13th''' is considered an unlucky day in [[Western culture|Western]] [[superstition]]. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the [[Gregorian calendar]] falls on a [[Friday]], which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year,&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/weekday-friday-13|title=Months and Years having Friday the 13th|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;for example in 2015, on 13 Feb, 13 March and 13 October. In 2017, it occurred twice, on 13 January and 13 October. In 2018, it also occurred twice, on 13 April and 13 July.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2" /&gt; There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020; 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence each.

A Friday the 13th occurs during any month that begins on a Sunday.

==History==
The fear of the number 13 has been given a scientific name: "[[triskaidekaphobia]]"; and on analogy to this the fear of Friday the 13th is called  ''paraskevidekatriaphobia'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''Paraskeví'' (Παρασκευή, meaning "Friday"), and ''dekatreís'' (δεκατρείς, meaning "thirteen").&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Triskaidekaphobia.html |title=Triskaidekaphobia on MathWorld |accessdate=14 August 2010 |author=Weisstein, Eric W |publisher=[[MathWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci]]

The superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the [[Middle Ages]], "originating from the story of Jesus' [[last supper]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]" in which there were 13 individuals present in the [[Upper Room]] on the 13th of Nisan [[Maundy Thursday]], the night before his death on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=DellaContrada&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2004/02/6576.html |title=Fear of "Friday the 13th may likely have originated from Jesus' Last Supper and Crucifixion", Says UB Anthropologist |last=DellaContrada |first=John |date=9 February 2004 |publisher=[[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] |accessdate=13 July 2014 |quote=There were 13 people at the [[upper room|table]] (at the [[Last Supper]]) and the 13th was [[Jesus]]. The Last Supper was on a [[Maundy Thursday|Thursday]], and the next day was [[Good Friday|Friday]], the day of [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].

Despite these origins, the Friday the 13th superstition dates back only to the Middle Ages.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 July 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While there is evidence of both [[Friday]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Friday]] has been considered an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects at least since the 14th century, as witnessed by Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number 13 being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/13.html?id=sDXJ1s0YNAgC Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, ''13: The Story of the World's Most Popular Superstition''] ch. 5 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clar, Mimi |journal=Western Folklore |year=1957 |title=Friday the 13th |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early documented reference in English occurs in [[Henry Sutherland Edwards]]' 1869 biography of [[Gioachino Rossini]], who died on a Friday 13th:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sutherland Edwards, ''The Life of Rossini'', Blackett, 1869, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rossini by Grevedon.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] by Henri Grevedon]]
It is  possible that the publication in 1907 of [[Thomas W. Lawson (businessman)|Thomas W. Lawson]]'s popular novel ''Friday, the Thirteenth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas W. Lawson |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12345/12345-h/12345-h.htm |title=Thomas W. Lawson, '&amp;#39;Friday, the Thirteenth'&amp;#39; (1907) |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to disseminating the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous [[broker]] takes advantage of the superstition to create a [[Wall Street]] panic on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer/&gt;

A suggested origin of the superstition—Friday, 13 October 1307, the date [[Philip IV of France]]  [[Knights Templar#Arrests, charges and dissolution|arrested]] hundreds of the [[Knights Templar]]—may not have been formulated until the [[20th century]]. It is mentioned in the 1955 [[Maurice Druon]] historical novel ''[[The Iron King]]'' (''Le Roi de fer''), [[John J. Robinson]]'s 1989 work ''Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry'',  [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]]'s ''[[The Templar Legacy]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=mathworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/luck/friday13.asp |title=Friday the 13th |accessdate=26 March 2007 |work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_4.htm |title=Why Friday the 13th Is Unlucky |publisher=Urbanlegends.about.com |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuesday the 13th in Hispanic and Greek culture==
In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking countries]], instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (''martes trece'') is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref name="Falcón"&gt;Rafael Falcón, Christine Yoder Falcón [https://books.google.com/books?id=os7DMzXq1rcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Tuesday+the+13th+is+considered+bad+luck&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Tuesday%20the%2013th%20is%20considered%20bad%20luck&amp;f=false ''Salsa: a taste of Hispanic culture''], p. 64, Praeger (1998), {{ISBN|0-275-96121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greece|Greeks]] also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.&lt;ref name=GR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chrysopoulos |first1=Philip |title=Why Superstitious Greeks Fear Tuesday the 13th |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/10/13/why-superstitious-greeks-fear-tuesday-the-13th/ |publisher=Greek Reporter |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war ([[Mars_(mythology)|''Mars'']] in Roman mythology). The fall of Constantinople to the [[Fourth Crusade]] occurred on [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Tuesday, April 13, 1204]], and the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] happened on Tuesday, 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in [[Greek language|Greek]] the name of the day is '''Triti''' (''Τρίτη'') meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to "come in threes".&lt;ref name=GR/&gt;

Tuesday the 13th occurs in a month that begins on a Thursday.

==Friday the 17th in Italy==
In [[Italy|Italian]] popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lastampa.it/domande-risposte/articolo/lstp/442871/|title=Venerdì 17 porta davvero sfortuna?|publisher=La Stampa|date=17 February 2012|author=Carlo Grande|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of number 17, in [[Roman numerals]]: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can easily get the word VIXI ("I have lived", implying death in the present), an omen of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/bad-omen-for-italy-as-their-unlucky-number-comes-up-400380.html |title=Bad omen for Italy as their unlucky number comes up |author=Nick Harris |date=15 November 2007 |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.it/article/24987/venerdi-13-17-fortuna-sfortuna-italia.html|title=Venerdì 13 porta (s)fortuna?

The 2000 parody film ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth]]'' was released in Italy with the title ''Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17?'' ("''Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?''").

Friday the 17th occurs on a month starting on Wednesday.

==Social impact==
According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the [[United States]] are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. "It's been estimated that [[United States dollar|[US]$]]800 or $900 million is lost in business on this day".&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0212_040212_friday13.html |title=Friday the 13th Phobia Rooted in Ancient History |accessdate=29 October 2008|date=12 August 2004|author=Roach, John |work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, representatives for both [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Continental Airlines]] (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Sens, "[http://www.viamagazine.com/travel-tips/friday-13th-lucky-or-unlucky Some Don't Count on lucky]", ''Via Magazine'', January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the [[National Accident Day (Finland)|National Accident Day]] (''kansallinen tapaturmapäivä'') to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045702/http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kotitapaturma.fi/mika-on-tapaturmapaiva/|title=Mikä on Tapaturmapäivä?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kotitapaturma.fi|language=fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They compared these numbers to data collected on Friday the 6th of the same months, and found that although there are consistently fewer vehicles on the road during the 13th — possibly as a result of superstitious people choosing not to drive that day, the researchers proposed — "the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent" on the 13th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/1998/03/er_and_the_triple_hex.html|title=When a full moon and a lunar eclipse collide with Friday the 13th, do more accidents really happen?|date=20 March 1998|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|language=English|accessdate=13 April 2018|author=[[Atul Gawande]]|quote=The 1993 study, published in the British Medical Journal, compared hospital admissions for traffic accidents on a Friday the 13th with those on a Friday the 6th in a community outside London.

On the contrary, the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics on 12 June 2008 stated that "fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the [[Netherlands]]; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/friday-13th-is-no-longer-unlucky-313210 Mirror.co.uk], "Friday 13th is no longer unlucky".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKL1268660720080613|title=Friday 13th not more unlucky, Dutch study shows|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
In years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (that is, whether they are a [[common year]] or [[leap year]]), Friday the 13th occurs in the same months.

This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the [[Dominical letter]] (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. There can be as many as three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March and November in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (such as 2009, 2015 or 2026) [[Dominical letter|(D)]], or January, April and July in a [[leap year starting on Sunday]] (such as 2012) [[Dominical letter|(AG)]].

The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] [[Dominical letter|(F)]] (e.g. 2001/02, 2012/13 and 2018/19), or from August to October the following year being a [[leap year starting on Saturday]] [[Dominical letter|(BA)]] (e.g. 1999/2000 and 2027/28).

The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] [[Dominical letter|(D)]] (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026).

Each [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] 400-year cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 [[leap year|leap days]]) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Therefore, each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and thus the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://x42.com/datelab/daydist.shtml|title=About the date+day-distribution along the epoch |date=13 November 1998 |author=Bodin, Magnus |work=x42 |access-date=30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.H.

In Finland one F13 is chosen as [[National Accident Day (Finland)|National Accident Day]] to raise awareness about automotive safety, this is possible because there is at least one F13 each year.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com1" /&gt;

'''''Young Girls at the Piano''''' (French: '''Jeunes filles au piano''') is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], a leading painter in the development of the [[Impressionist]] style. The painting was completed in 1892 as an informal commission for the [[Musée du Luxembourg]]. Renoir painted three other variations of this composition in oil and two sketches, one in oil and one in pastel. Known by the artist as repetitions, they were executed to fulfill commissions from dealers and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art By Gary Tinterow, {{ISBN|0-8709-9457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is on public display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris.

==Description==
Renoir depicts two young girls at a piano in a [[bourgeois]] home, one in a white dress with blue sash seated playing and one in a pink dress standing. Renoir completed three additional versions of this composition in oil for collectors; the Luxembourg version is now housed at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=17865 Jeunes filles au piano at the Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Robert Lehman Collection]] version is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/150000160 Two Young Girls at the Piano at the Met]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Caillebotte version and one other are in private collections. An oil sketch of the composition is on display at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris and a pastel sketch is in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/young-girls-at-the-piano/ZAGwT97hbG0-sg?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en Young Girls at the Piano at Google Cultural Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting in the Musée d'Orsay is 116&amp;nbsp;cm high and 90&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The version at the Met is 111.8 x 86.4&amp;nbsp;cm. The oil sketch at the Musée de l'Orangerie is 116.0 x 81.0&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/orangerie/renoirimage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pissarro]] and [[Monet]] routinely painted series of variations on a single theme, but their works were intended to be shown together to chronicle the effects of light and atmosphere, while Renoir’s repetitions were independent essays in [[composition (visual arts)|composition]].&lt;ref&gt;Nineteenth and Twentieth-century Paintings By Richard Robson Brettell, Paul Hayes Tucker, {{ISBN|1-5883-9349-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, details and poses changed subtly, and the sketches eliminate most of the background elements.

Renoir explored a similar composition with his earlier 1888 work ''[[The Daughters of Catulle Mendès]]'', now in the Annenberg Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110002470 The Daughters of Catulle Mendès at the Met]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heinrich der Löwe und Mathilde von England.jpg|thumb|Henry the Lion at his wedding to [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda of England]]. Illumination from the Gospel Book.]]

The '''Gospels of Henry the Lion''' were intended by [[Henry the Lion]], [[Rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]], for the altar of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the church of St. Blaise's Abbey, [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], better known as [[Brunswick Cathedral]]. The volume is considered a masterpiece of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] book illumination of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages:The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIdTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT382|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-63394-0|pages=382–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel Book|gospel book]] was made for the duke on commission at the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[Helmarshausen Abbey]]. As for its date, the church in Brunswick was built in 1173, and the altar of the Virgin Mary was dedicated in 1188. The creation of the gospel book was formerly placed by most authorities at about 1175 ("early dating") but today the balance of opinion puts it at about 1188 ("late dating").

The manuscript, containing 266 pages with the text of the four [[gospel]]s, 50 of them full page illustrations, was sold by auction on 6 December 1983 at [[Sotheby's]] in [[London]] for £8,140,000.&lt;ref name="Jones2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Jones|title=Dictionary of World Biography: Second edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMqMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388|date=17 March 2015|publisher=ANU Press|isbn=978-1-925022-25-4|pages=388–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase price was raised, in the context of a German national initiative for the preservation of national treasures, by the [[German government]], the ''Bundesländer'' of [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Bavaria]], the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz]] and private donors (largely from Brunswick). It was the most expensive book in the world until 1994, when [[Bill Gates]] bought the [[Codex Leicester]], a manuscript by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The gospel book, preserved completely intact, with 50 full page miniatures, is kept in the [[Herzog August Bibliothek]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]], and for security reasons is displayed only once every two years.&lt;ref name="Jeep2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John M.

&lt;!-- first para – definition, science and nature--&gt;
'''Green''' is the color between [[blue]] and [[yellow]] on the [[visible spectrum]]. It is evoked by light which has a [[dominant wavelength]] of roughly 495{{ndash}}570 [[Nanometre|nm]]. In [[subtractive color]] systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and [[cyan]]; in the [[RGB color model]], used on television and computer screens, it is one of the [[additive primary colors]], along with [[red]] and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is [[chlorophyll]], the chemical by which plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as [[camouflage]]. Several [[minerals]] have a green color, including the [[emerald]], which is colored green by its [[chromium]] content.

&lt;!-- 2nd para – history and culture --&gt;
During [[Post-classical history|post-classical]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the benches in the British [[House of Commons]] are green while those in the [[House of Lords]] are red.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=98}} It also has a long historical tradition as the color of [[Ireland]] and of [[Gaelic culture]]. It is the historic color of [[Islam]], representing the lush vegetation of [[Paradise]]. It was the color of the banner of [[Muhammad]], and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=94-98}}

&lt;!-- 3rd para – symbolism and associations--&gt;
In surveys made in [[Americas|American]], European, and [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], green is the color most commonly associated with [[nature]], [[life]], [[health]], [[youth]], [[spring (season)|spring]], [[hope]] and [[envy]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87–104}} In the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], green is also sometimes associated with [[toxicity]] and poor health,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=96-97}} but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87–104}} Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the [[environmental movement]]. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], some naming themselves [[Green party|Green parties]]. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or [[environmentally friendly]], products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] permits permanent residence in the United States.

== Etymology and linguistic definitions ==
[[File:Leavessnipedale.jpg|thumb|right|The word ''green'' has the same Germanic root as the words for ''grass'' and ''grow'']]

The word ''green'' comes from the [[Middle English]] and [[Old English]] word ''grene'', which, like the German word ''grün'', has the same root as the words ''grass'' and ''grow''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', The World Publishing Company, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from a [[Common Germanic]] ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/grōniz|*gronja]]-'', which is also reflected in [[Old Norse]] ''grænn'', [[Old High German]] ''gruoni'' (but unattested in [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]]), ultimately from a [[PIE root]] ''*{{PIE|ghre-}}'' "to grow", and root-cognate with ''[[:wikt:grass|grass]]'' and ''[[:wikt:grow|to grow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Harper| first =Douglas| title =Online Etymology Dictionary| date =November 2001| url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=green&amp;searchmode=none| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca. AD 700.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul (1930). ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw-Hill p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin]] with ''[[:wikt:viridis|viridis]]'' also has a genuine and widely used term for "green". Related to ''virere'' "to grow" and ''ver'' "spring", it gave rise to words in several [[Romance languages]], French ''vert'', Italian ''verde'' (and English ''[[wikt:vert|vert]]'', ''[[:wikt:verdure|verdure]]'' etc.).&lt;ref name="Pastoureau"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastoureau|first=Michel |title=Green: The History of a Color|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2014|pages=20–21|isbn=978-0-691-15936-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eRHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=green+colour#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20colour&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the [[Slavic languages]] with ''[[:wikt:зелёный|zelenъ]]''. [[Ancient Greek]] also had a term for yellowish, pale green – [[:wikt:χλωρός|χλωρός]], ''chloros'' (cf. the color of chlorine), cognate with χλοερός "verdant" and χλόη "the green of new growth".

Thus, the languages mentioned above (Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Greek) have old terms for "green" which are derived from words for fresh, sprouting vegetation.
However, [[comparative linguistics]] makes clear that these terms were coined independently, over the past few millennia, and there is no identifiable single [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] or word for "green". For example, the Slavic ''zelenъ'' is cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[hari]]'' "yellow, ochre, golden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=/data/ie/vasmer&amp;text_number=++4332&amp;root=config |title=Vasmer's dictionary of Slavic etymology |publisher=Starling.rinet.ru |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Turkic languages]] also have ''jašɨl'' "green" or "yellowish green", compared to a Mongolian word for "meadow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Calt%5Cturcet&amp;first=1&amp;off=&amp;text_proto=&amp;method_proto=substring&amp;ic_proto=on&amp;text_meaning=&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;ic_meaning=on&amp;text_rusmean=&amp;method_rusmean=substring&amp;ic_rusmean=on&amp;text_atu=&amp;method_atu=substring&amp;ic_atu=on&amp;text_krh=&amp;method_krh=substring&amp;ic_krh=on&amp;text_trk=&amp;method_trk=substring&amp;ic_trk=on&amp;text_tat=&amp;method_tat=substring&amp;ic_tat=on&amp;text_chg=&amp;method_chg=substring&amp;ic_chg=on&amp;text_uzb=&amp;method_uzb=substring&amp;ic_uzb=on&amp;text_uig=&amp;method_uig=substring&amp;ic_uig=on&amp;text_sjg=&amp;method_sjg=substring&amp;ic_sjg=on&amp;text_azb=&amp;method_azb=substring&amp;ic_azb=on&amp;text_trm=&amp;method_trm=substring&amp;ic_trm=on&amp;text_hak=&amp;method_hak=substring&amp;ic_hak=on&amp;text_shr=&amp;method_shr=substring&amp;ic_shr=on&amp;text_alt=&amp;method_alt=substring&amp;ic_alt=on&amp;text_khal=&amp;method_khal=substring&amp;ic_khal=on&amp;text_chv=&amp;method_chv=substring&amp;ic_chv=on&amp;text_jak=&amp;method_jak=substring&amp;ic_jak=on&amp;text_dolg=&amp;method_dolg=substring&amp;ic_dolg=on&amp;text_tuv=&amp;method_tuv=substring&amp;ic_tuv=on&amp;text_tof=&amp;method_tof=substring&amp;ic_tof=on&amp;text_krg=&amp;method_krg=substring&amp;ic_krg=on&amp;text_kaz=&amp;method_kaz=substring&amp;ic_kaz=on&amp;text_nogx=&amp;method_nogx=substring&amp;ic_nogx=on&amp;text_bas=&amp;method_bas=substring&amp;ic_bas=on&amp;text_blkx=&amp;method_blkx=substring&amp;ic_blkx=on&amp;text_gagx=&amp;method_gagx=substring&amp;ic_gagx=on&amp;text_krmx=&amp;method_krmx=substring&amp;ic_krmx=on&amp;text_klpx=&amp;method_klpx=substring&amp;ic_klpx=on&amp;text_sal=&amp;method_sal=substring&amp;ic_sal=on&amp;text_qum=&amp;method_qum=substring&amp;ic_qum=on&amp;text_reference=&amp;method_reference=substring&amp;ic_reference=on&amp;text_any=green&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=proto&amp;ic_any=on |title=Sergei Starostin, Turkic etymology |publisher=Starling.rinet.ru |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages where green and blue are one color ===
{{Main|Color term}}

In some languages, including old [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], old [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the same word can mean either blue or green.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi, "Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons", ''American Anthropologist'', March 1999 [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/color.app.evol.ps]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese character]] [[wikt:青|青]] (pronounced ''qīng'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], ''[[Ao (color)|ao]]'' in Japanese, and ''[[wikt:thanh|thanh]]'' in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]]) has a meaning that covers both [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|blue and green]]; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of "[[wikt:青|青]]". In more contemporary terms, they are [[wikt:藍|藍]] (''lán'', in Mandarin) and [[wikt:綠|綠]] (''lǜ'', in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, [[wikt:緑|緑]] (''midori'', which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb ''midoru'' "to be in leaf, to flourish" in reference to trees) and グリーン (''guriin'', which is derived from the English word "green"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, ''aoi'', because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green ''[[perilla|shiso]]'' (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word ''aoi''. Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, ''[[wikt:xanh|xanh]]'', with variants such as ''xanh da trời'' (azure, lit. "sky blue"), ''lam'' (blue), and ''lục'' (green; also ''xanh lá cây'', lit. "leaf green").

"Green" in modern European languages corresponds to about 520–570&amp;nbsp;nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450–530&amp;nbsp;nm ("blue/green") and another for ca. 530–590&amp;nbsp;nm ("green/yellow").{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the comparative study of [[color term]]s in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution |first=Brent |last=Berlin |author2=Paul Kay |edition=new, revised  |location=Stanford, Cal. |publisher=CSLI Publications |series=The David Hume Series of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences Reissues |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57586-162-3 |oclc=807758450 |pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See distinction of green from blue)&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Paul and Martha Ratliff (2001).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-66937-5}}. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote "green", but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the English adjective [[:wikt:orange|orange]] being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit). Thus, the [[Thai language|Thai]] word เขียว ''kheīyw'', besides meaning "green", also means "rank" and "smelly" and holds other unpleasant associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Search for 'เขียว' |website=English: Thai Dictionary OnLine| publisher =4M System| year =2007| url=http://english-thai-dictionary.com/index.php?q=%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A7&amp;sa=Dictionary-search&amp;fields%5B%5D=related&amp;siteurl=english-thai-dictionary.com%2Findex.php| accessdate = November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic languages]] had a term for "blue/green/grey", [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*glasto-'', which gave rise to [[Old Irish]] ''glas'' "green, grey" and to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''glas'' "blue". This word is cognate with the Ancient Greek γλαυκός "bluish green", contrasting with χλωρός "yellowish green" discussed above.

In modern Japanese, the term for green is [[:wikt:緑|緑]], while the old term for "blue/green", {{Nihongo|blue|青|Ao}} now means "blue". But in certain contexts, green is still conventionally referred to as 青, as in {{Nihongo|''blue [[traffic light]]''|青信号|ao shingō}} and {{Nihongo|''blue [[leaves]]''|青葉|aoba}}, reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old Japanese (more accurately, the [[Traditional colors of Japan|traditional Japanese color terminology]] grouped some [[shades of green]] with blue, and others with yellow tones).

The [[Persian language]] is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction. The Persian word سبز ''sabz'' can mean "green", "black", or "dark". Thus, Persian erotic poetry, dark-skinned women are addressed as ''sabz-eh'', as in phrases like سبز گندم گون ''sabz-eh-gandom-gun'' (literally "''dark'' wheat colored") or سبز مليح ''sabz-eh-malih'' ("a ''dark'' beauty").&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Steingass]], ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'' s.v. سبز&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Sudanese Arabic]], dark-skinned people are described as أخضر ''akhḍar'', the term which in [[Standard Arabic]] stands unambiguously for "green".&lt;ref name="Greenness in the Field"&gt;Carla N.

In optics, the [[perception]] of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a [[wavelength]] of roughly 495{{ndash}}570{{nbsp}}[[Nanometre|nm]]. The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507{{nbsp}}nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555{{nbsp}}nm, a yellow-green; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone (scotopic and photopic, respectively) [[luminosity function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/lightandcolor/humanvisionintro.html | title = Human Vision and Color Perception | website = Olympus Microscopy Resource Center | accessdate = September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of greenness (in opposition to redness forming one of the [[opponent process|opponent]] mechanisms in human [[color vision]]) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength ''M'' [[cone cell]]s in the eye more than the long-wavelength ''L'' cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487{{ndash}}570&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;More specifically, "blue green" 487–493 nm, "bluish green" 493–498 nm, "green" 498–530 nm, "yellowish green" 530–559 nm, "yellow green" 559–570 nm {{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Kenneth L. | year = 1943 | title = Color Designations for Lights | url = | journal = [[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] | volume = 33 | issue = 11| pages = 627–32 | doi=10.1364/josa.33.000627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells, of which there are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause [[color blind]]ness, including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as [[deuteranopia]] or red{{ndash}}green color blindness.&lt;ref name = brit&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2002. {{ISBN|0-85229-787-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Donald A. "Fatigue: Public Enemy Number One: What It Is and How to Fight It." ''The American Journal of Nursing'' (Sep 1933) 33.9 pp. 835–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[subtractive color]] system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and [[cyan]]; in the [[RGB color model]], used on television and computer screens, it is one of the [[additive primary colors]], along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.    On the [[HSV color space|HSV color wheel]], also known as the [[:File:RBG color wheel.svg|RGB color wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of green is [[magenta]]; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[blue]] light (one of the [[purple]]s). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.&lt;ref name = wheel&gt;{{cite web| title =Glossary Term: Color wheel| publisher =Sanford Corp.| year =2005| url =http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html| accessdate = November 22, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021215/http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions, one of the [[primary colors|primary]] light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550{{nbsp}}nm; this "green" primary is combined with an orangish-red "red" primary and a purplish-blue "blue" primary to produce any color in between{{snds}}the RGB color model. A [[unique hues|unique green]] (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.

=== Lasers ===
[[Laser]]s emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532{{nbsp}}nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state ([[DPSS]]) technology to create the green light.&lt;ref name="laserglow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/page/greenlaserpointer |title=Laserglow – Green Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An infrared [[laser diode]] at 808{{nbsp}}nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064&amp;nbsp;nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532{{nbsp}}nm ("green").&lt;ref name="Sams Laser FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donklipstein.com/laserssl.htm |title=Sams Laser FAQ |publisher=Sam Goldwasser |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501&amp;nbsp;nm to 543&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="laserglow2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/int-labOEM.htm |title=Laserglow – DPSS Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green wavelengths are also available from [[gas laser]]s, including the [[helium–neon laser]] (543{{nbsp}}nm), the Argon-[[ion laser]] (514{{nbsp}}nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521{{nbsp}}nm and 531{{nbsp}}nm), as well as liquid [[dye laser]]s. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, [[laser light shows]], [[spectroscopy]], [[interferometry]], [[fluorescence]], [[holography]], [[machine vision]], [[non-lethal weapons]] and [[bird control]].&lt;ref name="laserglow3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/page/golfcoursebirdcontrol |title=Laserglow – Green lasers for Bird Control / Abatement |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid-2011, direct green laser diodes at 510{{nbsp}}nm and 500{{nbsp}}nm have become generally available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laserpointerforums.com/f45/review-510nm-direct-green-diodes-build-photos-dgh-n1-dgh-n2-69678.html|title=Review: 510nm Direct Green Diodes / Build Photos (DGH-N1, DGH-N2) – Laser Pointer Forums – Discuss Laser Pointers|date=|website=laserpointerforums.com|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use. The efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} compared to that of DPSS green lasers (peak 35%){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.

=== Pigments, food coloring and fireworks ===
[[File:Chicago River dyed green, focus on river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chicago River]] is dyed green every year to mark [[St. Patrick's Day]]]]

Many minerals provide [[pigment]]s which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through [[luminescent]] or [[phosphorescent]] qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the [[emerald]], which is colored green by trace amounts of [[chromium]] and sometimes [[vanadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurlbut, Cornelius S. Jr, &amp; Kammerling, Robert C., 1991, ''Gemology'', p. 203, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(III) oxide (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is called [[Chromium(III) oxide|chrome green]], also called [[viridian]] or institutional green when used as a pigment.&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001" /&gt; For many years, the source of [[amazonite|amazonite's]] color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to [[copper]] because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of [[lead]] and water in the [[feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hoffmeister and Rossman | title=A spectroscopic study of irradiation coloring of amazonite; structurally hydrous, Pb-bearing feldspar | journal=Am. Mineral. | year=1985 | volume=70 | pages=794–804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is the source of the green color in [[malachite]] pigments, chemically known as basic [[copper(II) carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/malachite.html | title = Malachite | publisher = WebExhibits | year = 2001 | accessdate = December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Verdigris]] is made by placing a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, slightly warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable [[chrome green]].{{sfn|Varichon|2000|pp=214–15}} Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. [[Vincent van Gogh]] used it, along with [[Prussian blue]], to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting [[Cafe terrace at night]].&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001" /&gt;

[[Green earth]] is a natural pigment used since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. It is composed of clay colored by [[iron oxide]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminum silicate]], or [[potassium]]. Large deposits were found in the South of France near [[Nice]], and in Italy around [[Verona]], on [[Cyprus]], and in [[Bohemia]]. The clay was crushed, washed to remove impurities, then powdered. It was sometimes called Green of Verona.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|pp=210–11}}

Mixtures of oxidized [[cobalt]] and [[zinc]] were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/cogreen.html | title = Cobalt green | publisher = WebExhibits | year = 2001 | accessdate = December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cobalt green]], sometimes known as [[Cobalt green#Rinman's green|Rinman's green]] or zinc green, is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt (II) oxide and zinc oxide. [[Sven Rinman]], a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;'''Green Pigment Spins chip promise.''' August 2006, news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4776479.stm&lt;/ref&gt;
Green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named Pannetier in Paris in about 1835. Emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide. It was also known as Guignet green.&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001"&gt;A. F. Holleman and E. Wiberg "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press, 2001, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in [[photosynthesis]]. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = If the sun's light peaks in the green, why do plants prefer to reflect green light (giving them their green color)?

Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, A.

Animals typically use the color green as [[camouflage]], blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. [[Turacoverdin]] is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of [[porphyrin]] pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are [[flavins]] (lychochromes) and hemanovadin.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Ancient Egypt]], green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile. For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]]. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue [[azurite]]. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from [[saffron]] and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the [[woad]] plant.&lt;ref name="Anne Vachiron 2000 pg. 196" /&gt;

For the ancient Egyptians, green had very positive associations. The [[hieroglyph]] for green represented a growing [[papyrus]] sprout, showing the close connection between green, vegetation, vigor and growth. In wall paintings, the ruler of the underworld, [[Osiris]], was typically portrayed with a green face, because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth. Palettes of green facial makeup, made with malachite, were found in tombs. It was worn by both the living and the dead, particularly around the eyes, to protect them from evil. Tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of [[scarab beetles]] made of malachite, which would protect and give vigor to the deceased. It also symbolized the sea, which was called the "Very Green."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Greece, green and blue were sometimes considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees. The philosopher [[Democritus]] described two different greens: ''cloron'', or pale green, and ''prasinon'', or [[leek]] green. [[Aristotle]] considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.{{sfn|Gage|1993|p=12}}

The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green; it was the color of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Lyon]], [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.{{sfn|Gage|1993|pp=11–27}}

File:Pietro Perugino cat67a.jpg|In this 1503 painting by [[Perugino]], malachite pigment was used to paint the bright green garments of the worshippers, while the background greens were painted in green earth pigments.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the color of clothing showed a person's social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The [[Mona Lisa]] wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by [[Jan van Eyck]].

Unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green, there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight. Green dyes were made out of the [[fern]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], [[buckthorn]] berries, the juice of [[Urtica|nettles]] and of [[leeks]], the [[digitalis]] plant, the [[broom (shrub)|broom]] plant, the leaves of the [[fraxinus]], or ash tree, and the bark of the [[alder]] tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with ''[[Reseda luteola]]'', also known as yellow-weed.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|p=128}}

The pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.

During the early Renaissance, painters such as [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.&lt;ref&gt;Pigments Through the Ages, http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/antiquity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
==== In the 18th and 19th century ====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The 18th and 19th century brought the discovery and production of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of [[arsenic]], and were eventually banned.

In the 18th and 19th century, green was associated with the [[romantic movement]] in literature and art. The French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher [[Goethe]] declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as [[John Constable]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.

The second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. One of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the American artist [[James McNeil Whistler]], who created a series of paintings called "symphonies" or "noctures" of color, including ''Symphony in gray and green; The Ocean'' between 1866 and 1872.

The late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The ''Night Cafe'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In the 20th and 21st century ====
In the 1980s green became a political symbol, the color of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party in Germany]] and in many other European countries. It symbolized the [[environmental movement]], and also a new politics of the left which rejected traditional socialism and communism. (See ''Politics'' section below.)

== Symbolism and associations ==
=== Safety and permission ===

[[File:Feuvert2.jpg|thumb|left|110px|A green light is the universal symbol of permission to go]]
[[File:John Deere, 9560R.jpg|thumb|left|An agriculture company chooses green and yellow for their products. Three wheels on each hub enables this tractor to work wetter land.]]

Green can communicate safety to proceed, as in traffic lights.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 in front of the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both [[Health (gaming)|health]] and completed objectives, opposite red.

=== Nature, vivacity, and life ===
Green is the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with nature, vivacity and life.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 90. 47 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''nature'' and ''natural'', 18 percent choosing white. 32 percent associated green with ''vivacity'' (20 percent chose yellow), and 40 percent with  ''good health'' (20 percent with red)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the color of many environmental organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]], and of the [[Green Parties]] in Europe. Many cities have designated a garden or park as a green space, and use green trash bins and containers. A green cross is commonly used to designate pharmacies in Europe.

In China, green is associated with the east, with sunrise, and with life and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Hong-Key. ''The Culture of Feng-Shui in Korea.'' Lexington: Lexington Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7391-1348-8}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, the color green is considered [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] for those born on a Wednesday day (light green for those born at night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Springtime, freshness, and hope ===
Green is the color most commonly associated in the U.S. and Europe with springtime, freshness, and hope.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=91–92}}{{efn|1= 62 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''springtime'', (18 percent choosing yellow); 27 percent associated green with ''freshness'' (24 percent choosing blue.)   48 percent associated green with ''hope'' (18 percent choosing blue){{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=91–92}} }} Green is often used to symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality. In Ancient Egypt; the god Osiris, king of the underworld, was depicted as green-skinned.&lt;ref name="deVries76"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries |first=Ad |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |pages=226–28|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-7204-8021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime; hope represents the faith that things will improve after a period of difficulty, like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=94}}

=== Youth and inexperience ===
Green the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often is used to describe anyone young, inexperienced, probably by the analogy to immature and unripe fruit.&lt;ref name = diction&gt;{{cite web| title =Results for "green"| website =Dictionary.com| publisher =Lexico Publishing Corp.| year =2007| url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=92}}{{efn|1= 22 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''youth'', (16 percent choosing yellow){{sfn|Heller|2009|p=92}} }} Examples include [[green cheese]], a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and [[Cowboy#Symbolism|greenhorn]], an inexperienced person.

=== Calm, tolerance, and the agreeable ===
Surveys also show that green is the color most associated with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, is the color of neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Science Faculty building, UTS]].&lt;/ref&gt; Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=90}}

=== Jealousy and envy ===
Green is often associated with [[jealousy]] and [[envy]]. The expression "green-eyed monster" was first used by [[William Shakespeare]] in [[Othello]]: "it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on." Shakespeare also used it in the [[Merchant of Venice]], speaking of "green-eyed jealousy."&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;{{cite book | last = Hendrickson | first = Robert  | title = Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins | publisher =Facts on File Inc. | year = 1999 | location = | page = 6 | isbn = 978-0-8160-3266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Love and sexuality ===
Green today is not commonly associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=42, 55}} but in stories of the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] it sometimes represented love&lt;ref name = span&gt;Chamberlin, Vernon A.

''[[College English]].'' 20.2 (Nov 1958) pp. 61–65 {{DOI|10.2307/372161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the color of the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] who caused the downfall of [[Adam and Eve]]. However, for the [[troubadours]], green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=92–93}}

In Persian and Sudanese poetry, dark-skinned women, called "green" women, were considered erotic.&lt;ref name="Greenness in the Field" /&gt; The Chinese term for [[cuckold]] is "to wear a green hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sommer| first = Matthew Harvey| title = Sex, Law, and Society in Late Imperial China| publisher = Stanford University Press| year = 2002| location = Stanford| page = 218| url = https://books.google.com/?id=E6ClbegXuWUC| isbn = 978-0-8047-4559-8| accessdate = July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because in ancient China, prostitutes were called "the family of the green lantern" and a [[prostitute|prostitute's]] family would wear a green headscarf.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|p=205}}

In [[Victorian England]], the color green was associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pflagdetroit.org/story_of_the_rainbow_flag.htm | title=The Story of the Rainbow Flag | website=HALO Newsletter | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dragons, fairies, monsters, and devils ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In legends, folk tales and films, [[fairies]], [[dragons]], [[monsters]], and the devil are often shown as green.

In the Middle Ages, the devil was usually shown as either red, black or green. Dragons were usually green, because they had the heads, claws and tails of reptiles.

Modern [[Chinese dragons]] are also often green, but unlike European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength. The [[dragon dance]] is a popular feature of Chinese festivals.

In [[Irish folklore]] and [[English folklore]], the color was sometimes was associated with witchcraft, and with [[faeries]] and spirits.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;Williams, Margaret. The Pearl Poet, His Complete Works. Random House, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of Irish fairy known as a [[leprechaun]] is commonly portrayed wearing a green suit, though before the 20th century he was usually described as wearing a red suit.

In theater and film, green was often connected with monsters and the inhuman. The earliest films of Frankenstein were in black and white, but in the poster for the 1935 version ''[[The Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster had a green face. Actor [[Bela Lugosi]] wore green-hued makeup for the role of [[Dracula]] in the 1927–1928 Broadway stage production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Skal | first= David J. |year = 1990| title = Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen| page = 85 | publisher = Andre Deutch| isbn= 978-0-233-98766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Why The Devil Wears Green'', D.

=== Poison and sickness ===
Like other common colors, green has several completely opposite associations. While it is the color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health, it is also the color most often associated with [[toxicity]] and poison. There was a solid foundation for this association; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments, notably verdigris, vert de Schweinfurt and vert de Paris, were highly toxic, containing copper or arsenic.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=96}}{{efn|1=In a survey cited, 45 percent of respondents associated green with toxicity, while 20 percent associated yellow.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=96}} }} The intoxicating drink [[absinthe]] was known as "the green fairy".

A green tinge in the skin is sometimes associated with nausea and sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Mark. Self Improvement of Relationship Skills through Body Language. City: Llumina Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-932303-79-0}} p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John S. "Gawain and the Green Knight." ''College English.'' 21.1 (Oct 1959) pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In some Far East cultures the color green is used as a symbol of sickness or nausea.&lt;ref&gt;Kalb, Ira.

=== Social status, prosperity and the dollar ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px"&gt;

File:United States one dollar bill, reverse.jpg|The reverse of the [[United States one-dollar bill]] has been green since 1861, giving it the popular name greenback.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Green in Europe and the United States is sometimes associated with status and prosperity. From the Middle Ages to the 19th century it was often worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen and others who were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.

In the United States green was connected with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.&lt;ref&gt;"Currency Notes" on the website of the U.S. [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable uses of this meaning is found in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The [[Emerald City]] in this story is a place where everyone wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, [[L. Frank Baum]], to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G.; Sarah Babb. "The Color of Money and the Nature of Value: Greenbacks and Gold in Postbellum America." ''The American Journal of Sociology.'' (May 1996) 101.6 pp. 1556–91&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[flag of Italy]] (1797) was modeled after the French tricolor. It was originally the flag of the Cisalpine Republic, whose capital was [[Milan]]; red and white were the colors of Milan, and green was the color of the military uniforms of the army of the Cisalpine Republic. Other versions say it is the color of the Italian landscape, or symbolizes hope.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana'' nº 174 del 28 luglio 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[flag of Brazil]] has a green field adapted from the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The green represented the royal family.
* The [[flag of India]] was inspired by an earlier flag of the independence movement of [[Gandhi]], which had a red band for Hinduism and a green band representing Islam, the second largest religion in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|title=India|accessdate= October 11, 2006|last=Heimer|first=Željko|date=July 2, 2006|website=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The flag of Pakistan symbolizes Pakistan's commitment to Islam and equal rights of religious minorities where the larger portion (3:2 ratio) of flag is dark green representing Muslim majority (98% of total population) while a white vertical bar (3:1 ratio) at the mast representing equal rights for religious minorities and minority religions in country. The crescent and star symbolizes progress and bright future respectively.
* The Flag of Bangladesh has a green field based on a similar flag used during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971. It consists of a red disc on top of a green field. The red disc represents the sun rising over [[Bengal]], and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh.
* The flag of the international [[constructed language]] [[Esperanto]] has a green field and a green star in a white area. The green represents hope (''"esperanto"'' means "one who hopes"), the white represents peace and neutrality and the star represents the five inhabited continents.

Green is one of the three colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of [[Pan-Africanism]]. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Benin]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. The [[Pan-African colours|Pan-African colors]] are borrowed from the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]], one of the oldest independent African countries.

Green is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the "Emerald Isle". The color is particularly identified with the [[Fianna Fáil|republican]] and [[nationalist]] traditions in modern times.

The first recorded green party was a political faction in [[Constantinople]] during the 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]]. which took its name from a popular [[chariot racing]] team. They were bitter opponents of the blue faction, which supported Emperor [[Justinian I]] and which had its own chariot racing team. In 532 AD rioting between the factions began after one race, which led to the massacre of green supporters and the destruction of much of the center of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Edward Gibbon 1960, pg. 553-559"&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Abridgement of D.M. Low, Harcourt Brace and Company, 1960, pp. 553–59&lt;/ref&gt;  (See [[Nika Riots]]).

Green was the traditional color of [[Irish nationalism]], beginning in the 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional [[gaelic harp]], became the symbol of the movement. It was the banner of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], which organized the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], calling for Irish independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.

In the 1970s green became the color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council political party, the [[Swiss People's Party]] SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCIdX54gWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809190734/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t%2Clnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCIdX54gWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |date=August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s green became the color of a number of new European political parties organized around an agenda of [[environmentalism]]. Green was chosen for its association with nature, health, and growth. The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the [[Bundestag]].

Green parties in Europe have programs based on [[ecology movement|ecology]], [[grassroots democracy]], [[nonviolence]], and [[social justice]]. Green parties are found in over one hundred countries, and most are members of the [[Global Greens|Global Green Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Global Greens Charter| publisher =Global Greens Conference| year =2001| url =http://www.global.greens.org.au/charter.htm| accessdate =November 22, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081813/http://www.global.greens.org.au/charter.htm| archivedate =October 12, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] is a non-governmental environmental organization which emerged from the anti-nuclear and peace movements in the 1970s. Its ship, the [[Rainbow Warrior (2011)|Rainbow Warrior]], frequently tried to interfere with nuclear tests and whaling operations. The movement now has branches in forty countries.

The Australian Greens party was founded in 1992. In the 2010 federal election, the party received 13% of the vote (more than 1.6 million votes) in the Senate, a first for any Australian minor party.

Green is the color associated with [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico's]] [[Puerto Rican Independence Party|Independence Party]], the smallest of that country's three major political parties, which advocates Puerto Rican independence from the United States.

Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'' (guest starring the [[X-Men]]) and ''[[New Avengers/Transformers]]'' (guest starring the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to ''Rom'' and ''Micronauts'' have occurred since.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Dreamwave Productions (2004) ===
On 2004, [[Dreamwave Productions]] published ''Transformers/G.I. Joe'', another crossover set in the time of [[World War I]], and including a one-shot titled ''Transformers/G.I. Joe: Divided Front''. This series only lasted six issues, due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

A '''hologram trademark''' is a [[non-conventional trademark|non-conventional]] [[trademark]] where a [[hologram]] is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services.

In recent times holograms have been increasingly used as trade marks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect holograms as trademarks through registration, as a hologram was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]{{ref|TRIPs}}, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to holograms trademarks in most countries in other fields of the art, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

==Registration of hologram marks in different jurisdictions==
===Canada===
In Canada, hologram trademarks are generally not acceptable if they cannot be represented graphically or if they are regarded as more than one mark, see first external link.

===European Union===
In the European Union, Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community Trade Mark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In Sieckmann v German Patent Office  (case C-273/00) [http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf] the EcJ states that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

This definition generally encompasses only very simply structured holograms, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use [[one photograph or some views]] to graphically represent their trade mark, see first external link.

===United States===
In the United States, the trademark manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not function as a mark in the absence of evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark.  See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 ([[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board|TTAB]] 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and there was no evidence that the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source.  The Board noted that "the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks."  59 USPQ2d at 1693.  
Therefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under §§1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under §§1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark.  In re Upper Deck, supra.  See [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure|TMEP]] §807.01.  
Provided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the hologram as a mark. the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed to refuse registration of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark.  During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.

'''''Legally Blonde''''' is a 2001 American [[comedy film]] based on [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]]'s [[Legally Blonde (novel)|novel of the same name]]. It was directed by [[Robert Luketic]], scripted by [[Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]], and stars [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Jennifer Coolidge]]. The film tells the story of [[Elle Woods]], a [[sorority]] girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend by getting a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. The title is a pun on the term "[[legally blind]]".

The film was released on July 13, 2001, and received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics' consensus states "though the material is predictable and formulaic, Reese Witherspoon's funny, nuanced performance makes this movie better than it would have been otherwise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legally Blonde|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/legally_blonde/|accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jamie Allen / CNN |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/20/golden.globe.nominations/index.html |title=CNN.com - Globes: 'Beautiful,' 'Moulin' golden - December 20, 2001 |publisher= Edition.cnn.com |date=2001 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked 29th on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] 2007 list of "100 Funniest Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefilmspectrum.com/?page_id=5769 |title=BRAVO 100 Funniest Movies |publisher=The Film Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], and the 2002 [[MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for [[2002 MTV Movie Awards#Best Female Performance|Best Female Performance]].

The box office success led to a 2003 [[sequel]], ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde]]'', and a 2009 [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Legally Blondes]]''. Additionally, ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde: The Musical]]'' premiered on January 23, 2007, in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and opened in [[New York City]] at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 29, 2007, starring [[Laura Bell Bundy]].

As of June 2018, Witherspoon has been in discussions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce a third instalment in the ''Legally Blonde'' film series. In addition to reprising her role as Elle Woods, Witherspoon is bringing back both Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith to pen the film's script.&lt;ref name="Variety cites MGM deal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/legally-blonde-3-reese-witherspoon-2-1202829366/ |title=Reese Witherspoon in Talks to Return for 'Legally Blonde 3' |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=June 4, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MGM later confirmed in a [[Twitter]] post that ''Legally Blonde 3'' is set to be released on February 14, 2020.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.--&gt;
[[Elle Woods]], an attractive, wealthy and popular fashion merchandising student and president of her Delta Nu sorority, is crushed when her boyfriend Warner Huntington III breaks up with her over a romantic dinner rather than proposing to her, as she was expecting. He argues that he needs a more serious woman in order to fulfill his political aspirations, which include attending Harvard Law. Encouraged by her sorority sisters, Elle decides to also enroll in Harvard Law in order to win Warner back. After much effort, Elle manages to gain admission but soon discovers that the personalities and atmosphere in Harvard are very different from hers and she is thrown out of class during her first day by the strict Professor Stromwell and a classmate named Vivian for not having prepared for the lecture. Elle is later horrified to discover that Vivian is Warner's fiancée.

None of Elle's classmates take her seriously and she is friendless at the university aside from Emmett, an associate at Harvard who gives her advice on handling each of her professors, and a beautician named Paulette who encourages her to try to win over Warner. Elle repeatedly tries to fit in with the others but is repeatedly rebuffed. Vivian even goes so far as to lie to Elle about a party invitation, falsely telling her that it was a costume party, humiliating her in front of her classmates. She is also ridiculed by Warner after informing him of her intent to apply for a prestigious internship with Professor Callahan, as Warner tells her that she is not smart enough and is wasting her time. This motivates Elle to prove herself, as she begins to study law seriously and even manages to use her knowledge to help Paulette reclaim her dog from an ex-boyfriend.

After several months of dramatic improvement, Elle, along with Warner, Vivian and another student Enid Wexler, is given an internship at Callahan's law office, where they will be working on a murder case, defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who refuses to produce an alibi for the murder. Recognizing her as a personal role model and former Delta Nu member, Elle manages to discover the alibi but keeps it secret due to a personal promise with Brooke, which impresses Vivian and leads to the two women beginning to bond after it was revealed that she was keeping the alibi confidential and that Warner blatantly said to sell out her friend for benefits; during their alone time, Vivian revealing to Elle that Warner only got into Harvard via a call from his father (a distinguished alumni) to the school board, because he was on the waiting list.

During the trial Elle manages to find holes in the prosecution's case such as proving that the prosecution's main witness was lying/perjuring about having an affair with Brooke, pointing out that he is gay. Seemingly impressed, Callahan invites Elle to his office later that evening, where he makes a sexual pass at her. Vivian witnesses the pass but not Elle angrily spurning his advances and angrily accuses Elle of using her looks to get ahead. Elle considers leaving Harvard and goes to Paulette's salon to let her know, but is encouraged by Professor Stromwell, who happened to be at the salon.

When the trial resumes, Emmett explains to Brooke how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, leaving Vivian to regret her actions towards Elle. Brooke then decides to fire Callahan and replace him with Elle, who is able to defend her due to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court rule 3.03, which allows Elle to legally appear on a defendant's behalf under Emmett's supervision, as he is a licensed attorney. Although nervous, Elle manages to catch Brooke's step-daughter [[Chutney]] in a lie during cross-examination, as she claimed that she could not have heard the gun shot because she was washing her hair after getting a perm earlier that day. Elle then points out that freshly permed hair cannot be washed within a 24-hour period without deactivating the perming chemical [[ammonium thioglycolate]], which Chutney should know as she had received over 30 perm treatments during her life. Upset, Chutney accidentally reveals that she hated Brooke for being the same age as her. She confesses that she intended to shoot Brooke but accidentally shot and killed her father by mistake, thinking it was Brooke who had entered the house. Chutney is then arrested for murder, with all charges against Brooke dismissed. After the trial, Warner unsuccessfully tries to persuade Elle to take him back, only for her to mock him by stating that he is not serious enough for her.

The story ends with Elle graduating from Harvard two years later and giving the graduation speech. Vivian broke off her engagement to Warner and is now Elle's best friend, while Warner graduates with no honors, no job offers and no girlfriend. Paulette ends up marrying a UPS guy she had been infatuated with throughout the film and is expecting a baby, to be named Elle. Emmett has started his own firm and he and Elle have been dating since the trial, with him planning to propose to her later that night.

==Production==
The film is based upon the [[Legally Blonde (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]], who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending [[Stanford Law School]], while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.&lt;ref name="sf-chronicle"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Blonde-Ambition-Author-Amanda-Brown-marvels-at-2565659.php |title=Blonde Ambition / Author Amanda Brown marvels at the industry surrounding 'Legally Blonde' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. "I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for "The Women of Stanford Law," so I was like, "I'll go and meet some nice girls. Whatever."&lt;ref name="sf-chronicle"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I went to the meeting, and these were not women. These were really angry people. The woman who was leading it spent three years at Stanford trying to change the name "semester" to "ovester." I started laughing and I realized everyone in the room took it very seriously. So I didn't make any friends there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brown wrote letters to her parents about these experiences, which she adapted into a manuscript and sent to an agent, who was initially drawn to it because it was the only manuscript written on pink paper.&lt;ref name="sf-chronicle"/&gt;

Producer [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]] was intrigued by the character of [[Elle Woods]] when an unpublished novel manuscript was delivered to him.&lt;ref name="marc-platt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/6934533.Film_Review__Legally__Blonde/ |title=Film Review: Legally Blonde |work=The Westmorland Gazette |date=2001-11-08 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "What I loved about this story is that it's hilarious, it's sexy and, at the same time, it's empowering," says Platt. "The world looks at Elle and sees someone who is blonde and beautiful but nothing more. Elle, on the other hand, doesn't judge herself or anybody else. She thinks the world's great, she's great, everyone's great and nothing can change that. She's truly an irrepressible modern heroine."&lt;ref name="marc-platt"/&gt;

Screenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith spent two days on Stanford's campus in the spring of 2000 doing research for their screenplay based on Brown's novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38510 |title=Blonde Ambition |work=Stanford Alumni |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both USC and Stanford refused to allow the producers to use their college names in the film.&lt;ref name="permission slip"&gt;{{cite news |last=Matsumoto |first=Jon |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/22/entertainment/ca-25120 |title=You'll Need a Permission Slip for That |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2001-07-22 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[The producers of the film] asked if they could set the film at USC, but the images of her as an undergraduate and being in a sorority ... we felt there was too much stereotyping going on," says Elijah May, campus filming coordinator at USC. The production settled on having Elle go to a fictional college called CULA.&lt;ref name="permission slip"/&gt;

Although the film is primarily set at [[Harvard University]], campus scenes were filmed at the [[University of Southern California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USC Campus Filming: USC in Film |url= http://www.usc.edu/pr/filming/usc_in_film/films.html |accessdate=November 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080423195344/http://www.usc.edu/pr/filming/usc_in_film/films.html |archivedate= April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/about/121reasons.html |title=Search - UCLA Undergraduate Admission |publisher=Admissions.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California Institute of Technology]], and Rose City High School in [[Pasadena, California]]. The graduation scene was filmed at [[Dulwich College]] in London, England, since Witherspoon was in that city filming ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest (2002 film)|The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. Harvard University appears in the film briefly in certain aerial shots.

Witherspoon researched the character by studying sorority girls on their campuses and associated hot spots. She went to dinner with them and joked she was conducting an "anthropological study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2001/07/26/reese-witherspoon-chats-about-legally-blonde/ |title=Reese Witherspoon chats about ''Legally Blonde'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2001-07-26 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I could have gone into this and been really ditsy and played what I would have thought this character was, and I would have missed a whole other side of her," Witherspoon added.&lt;ref name="chicago-tribune"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-07-16-0107160047-story.html |title=Reese Witherspoon is the opposite of the ditsy blond |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2001-07-10 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "But by going down to Beverly Hills, hanging out in [[Neiman Marcus]], eating in their cafe and seeing how these women walk and speak, I got into the reality of the character. I saw how polite these women are, and I saw how much they value their female friendships and how important it is to support each other."&lt;ref name="chicago-tribune"/&gt;

{{quote|You see so many beautiful people in this world, especially in the world that I live in and a lot of your first instincts is to discount women who put a lot of effort into their looks as maybe not serious about their job or maybe not serious about their relationships ... I think everyone naturally jumps to those conclusions ... I was interested in exploring the difference between [the way] someone looks and how people perceive them and how they really are.

I'm not necessarily perky and bubbly all the time, so it's been a lot of effort to stay up and the amount of care and energy she puts into a lot things has really been a challenge for me and trying to convey that lightness all the time is hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=2015 |title=Legally Blonde: Reese Witherspoon Interview |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbpF0mesaXQ |accessdate=2018-10-01 |time= |location= |publisher=ScreenSlam |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film's costume designer Sophie De Rakoff bonded with Witherspoon over [[Dolly Parton]].&lt;ref name="sophie"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a8376/costume-designer-sophie-de-rakoff-on-reese-witherspoon-37637/ |title=Costume Designer Sophie de Rakoff on Reese Witherspoon |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Rakoff said that Elle's iconic pink suit in the film "was all organic and intuitive. I designed costumes for Elle Woods that moved the story forward and fitted the moment. Reese and I actually went to visit a sorority house in the early prep, and it was just obvious that pink should be her signature color."&lt;ref name="sophie"/&gt;

===The "bend and snap" scene===
The "bend and snap" scene — where Elle explains to Paulette how to get her crush's attention — almost didn't make it into the movie.&lt;ref name="bend and snap"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/02/legally-blonde-bend-and-snap-story/ |title=Legally Blonde writers explain how the bend and snap was created |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2018-04-02 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"[Producer] Marc [Platt] wanted a B plot for Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge)," co-writer Karen McCullah told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. "At first we were like, 'Should the store be robbed?'" Co-writer Kirsten Smith observed, "I think we spent a week or two trying to figure out what the B plot and this big set piece should be. There were crime plots. We were pitching scene after scene and it all felt very tonally weird."&lt;ref name="bend and snap"/&gt;

Later, while brainstorming at a bar in Los Angeles, McCullah came up with a solution: "What if Elle shows [Paulette] a move so she can get the UPS guy?" In the spur of the moment, Smith invented a move, standing up and demonstrating what would become the bend and snap. Smith explains, "It was a spontaneous invention. It was a completely drunken moment in a bar." Director Robert Luketic later adapted the "bend and snap" move into a dance number for the film.

"... It was a fully choreographed number by [[Toni Basil]], and she was awesome," Witherspoon recalls. "She did the whole dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macke |first=Johnni |url=https://www.etonline.com/news/193152_reese_witherspoon_does_the_bend_and_snap_honor_of_legally_blonde_turning_15 |title=Reese Witherspoon Does the Bend and Snap in Honor of |work=Entertainment Tonight |date=2016-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I remember just reading it and thinking it was the most hysterical thing ever," she added. "That is still the most asked request I get from people. Even this past year, when I have been giving speeches or talking about whatever, they always ask me, 'Will you do the bend and snap?' I have a feeling I will be doing the bend and snap until I am 95."

'''Lou Kenton''' (1 September 1908 – 17 September 2012) was an English [[Proofreading|proofreader]] who served as a medical courier and ambulance driver with the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]] and was its oldest surviving member at the time of his death.

==Early life==
[[File:Battle-of-Cable-Street-red-plaque.png|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the [[Battle of Cable Street]]]]
Kenton was born in [[Stepney]], east London to a Jewish [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who had escaped from [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Tsarist pogroms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=Max |authorlink=Max Arthur |year=2009 |title=The Real Band of Brothers – First hand accounts from the last British survivors of the Spanish Civil War |place=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=9780007295098 |chapter=Section 1 – Lou Kenton |page=21}} – reference to Kenton's place and date of birth&lt;/ref&gt; His father died from [[tuberculosis]] when he was young.

Kenton left school aged 14 and started work in a paper factory. There he first encountered [[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom|anti-semitism]], which led him to join the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1929. He took part in the CPGB's disruption of the [[British Union of Fascists]]' rally at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in June 1934 and resistance to the BUF in the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9556423/Lou-Kenton.html |title=Lou Kenton |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Early in 1937 Kenton left Stepney and rode his [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle to [[Albacete]], where he join the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His first wife Lillian, an [[Austria]]n nurse who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, shortly followed him. When he arrived at the International Brigades headquarters in [[Albacete]], he applied to join the International Brigade's Medical Unit. It was from there that he spent nearly two years in action as medical courier on his motorcycle distributing medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and as an ambulance driver on the front lines. He returned to Britain late in 1938 on an 'Aid for Spain' mission to raise money for a new ambulance. By the time he had completed his tour, the [[International Brigades#Disbandment|International Brigades had been disbanded]].

==Later life==
After the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain, Kenton was hugely depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxell |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Baxell |year=2012 |title=[[Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism]] |place=London |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |isbn=9781781312339 |chapter=21, From Spanish War to World War |page=409}} – reference to Kenton's depression following the Republic's defeat&lt;/ref&gt; One of his missions was to repatriate to the Spanish authorities the [[Basque people|Basque]] refugees given asylum in the United Kingdom. It was "the first time I saw the fascist police in their three-cornered hats. All the children were in tears and all of them were hanging on to me as we checked each one and handed them over."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[File:Lidice shall live.jpg|thumb|upright|British "Lidice shall live" poster]]
Kenton then joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and in the first part of the Second World War served on an [[Antarctic]] [[whaler]], the ''Southern Princess''. He and Lillian were divorced and in 1941 Kenton married his second wife Raffa Ephgrave. He was wounded in [[The Blitz]], spent two years in hospital and then took a factory job.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; After the [[Lidice]] massacre in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1942, Kenton joined the British "Lidice Shall Live" organisation. He was an active member for many years and in the 1990s served as its Chairman.

After the Second World War, Kenton joined the Homes for Heroes campaign, which helped [[Squatting in England and Wales#Post World War II|homeless ex-servicemen and their families to squat in unoccupied properties]]. He joined the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as a [[proofreader]], and continued to work there until he was in his 70s.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Kenton remained a devout communist, working tirelessly on trade union organisation, unemployed marches and party activities until 1968 when the [[Prague Spring]] was suppressed by the [[Soviet Union]]. He then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and remained a member for the rest of his life.

===Commemorative potter===
From 1980 Kenton produced commemorative pottery for the trade union movement and for radical causes. His work was commissioned by [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen]], [[Amicus|Tobacco Workers' Union]], [[Society of Graphical and Allied Trades]], [[Trades Union Congress]], areas of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], the People's March for Jobs, the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]], [[Greater London Council]] Peace Year, [[Liberty (advocacy group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]], [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and the [[Greenham Common]] women's campaign.

Kenton had two children and two granddaughters.

===Spanish passport===
On 26 May 2009 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6360886.ece |last=Haynes |first=Deborah |title=Spanish Civil War volunteers are granted citizenship 70 years on |newspaper=[[The Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seven British pensioners were to be awarded Spanish passports at the Spanish Embassy in London on 9 June 2009. Kenton, then aged 101, was the eldest of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/BsTcLYuFxBY/Spain+Honours+Foreign+Veterans+Spanish+Civil/MoTbVbaCG2y/Lou+Kenton |title=Spain Honours Foreign Veterans Of The Spanish Civil War (Lou Kenton) |publisher=[[Livingly Media|Zimbio]] |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/BsTcLYuFxBY/Spain+Honours+Foreign+Veterans+Spanish+Civil/yYo3tJsy9na/Lou+Kenton |title=Spain Honours Foreign Veterans Of The Spanish Civil War (Lou Kenton) |publisher=[[Livingly Media|Zimbio]] |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13131">'''Michal Cole''' is a [[British Israeli|British-Israeli]] artist born in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]] in 1974 to parents who emigrated from [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturecolony.com/news/michal-cole-deserting-reality|title=Michal Cole: Deserting Reality {{!}} Culture Colony|website=www.culturecolony.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She works primarily with the mediums of photography, video, tapestry, sculpture, watercolour and uses money in her works.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.michalart.com/about|title=Michal Cole {{!}} About {{!}} Contemporary Artist|website=Michal Cole {{!}} Home {{!}} Contemporary Artist|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
After completing her service in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defence Forces]], Michal left Israel in the mid 1990s and travelled to [[Paris]] to take foundational art courses, while being homeless for a period of time. She settled in [[London]] in 1997, where she pursued her Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art from [[Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design|Central Saint Martin’s College of Art &amp; Design]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://young-masters.co.uk/2014/10/17/shortlisted-artist-michal-cole-tells-us-more-about-her-work/|title=Shortlisted artist Michal Cole tells us more about her work...|last=|first=|date=|website=Young Masters|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While attending university she created a number of works in which she used fragments of real money. A group of bankers were interested in buying many of her works and ended up becoming inappropriately sexual in their language with her. After they gave her their ties after believing she was flirting with them, she used them as inspiration and materials for her 2017 [[Venice Biennale]] Pavilion of Humanity exhibition ''Top Gun.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/11/hot-under-the-collar-venice-biennale-artist-uses-27000-neckties-for-installation|title=Hot under the collar: Venice Biennale artist uses 27,000 neckties for installation|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=2017-05-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole later completed her Master of Art in Fine Art from [[Chelsea College of Arts]] at the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Artistic career ==

=== Textiles ===
In Michal Cole’s textile pieces ''Inferno'', 2013 and ''Clamare'', 2013, Cole referenced famous art pieces such as [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''Mappa dell’Inferno'' and [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'' with lavish colours and cheerful compositions through textiles. She attempted to bring religious figurative paintings back to life through the more contemporary medium of tapestry that more accurately depicted current views and beliefs as a reflection of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Exhibited at the 2017 Venice Biennale, Michal Cole created a work titled ''Top Gun'' in the Pavilion of Humanity, which was made of tens of thousands of used men’s ties including those of men she knew and men who had either harassed her or her friends. The ties were strenuously tied together to cover the floor, walls, a fireplace, a sofa, a pipe, a mounted moose on the wall and a rifle which all encompass a traditionally masculine styled living room. Ties were specifically chosen as they represent a piece of clothing typically worn by men for historically masculine activities such as boardroom and workplace life, witnessing business deals, hiring employees, and winding down at a pub. Cole’s intention of the subject was to comment on the oppression of women that is more apparent under [[Donald Trump]]’s government than ever before; including issues such as the [[gender pay gap]], [[sexual harassment]] and a predominantly male political office. The piece similarly spoke to personal inequalities that were apparent in Cole’s life, such as her being a victim of sexual abuse, serving mandatory time in the military where hundreds of cases of sexual assault are disregarded, and her grandmother being a child bride.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michal Cole’s use of textiles has been exhibited in pieces such as ''After Caravaggio'' and ''Roses'' in a process where she replicated famous paintings and destroyed them before the paint had dried. The pieces were later transformed in to fabric textiles, which involved mapping out and recreating the paintings with materials such as Tibetan highland wool, Bikaner wool, Chinese silk and nettle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/property/michal-cole-knots-rugs-interview-1-5473924|title='It was a marriage made in heaven' - Michal Cole on working with Knots Rugs|last=McFadyen|first=Alex|work=Hampstead Highgate Express|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Installation art ===

==== ''Mute-Ululation'' ====
Michal Cole exhibited a site-specific video installation at Ex Bazzi Gallery at the 2015 Venice Biennale’s Pavilion of Humanity titled ''Mute-Ululation.'' This work addresses Cole’s identity as a resident of England who is of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] ethnicity. For this installation, Michal travelled to Morocco and Israel and filmed women’s mouths while performing the traditional celebratory [[ululation]]: a long, repetitive, high-pitched vocal sound that involves the rapid movement of the tongue side to side in the mouth. On three walls in a darkened room, the videos of these women assemble frame-by-frame until there are hundreds of mouths simultaneously performing the ululation at a loud volume. This work was used to showcase a unifying bond amongst women that transcends geographical borders, religions and ideologies, while empowering these women and showcasing their poetic happiness and expression. It similarly is a piece in which Cole grapples with her own identity as having significant elements of her life that are tied in Middle-Eastern and [[Moroccan culture]] while having adopted aspects of [[Western culture]] due to living in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artlyst.com/news/michal-cole-presents-ululation-video-installation-at-venice-biennale/|title=Michal Cole Presents Ululation Video Installation At Venice Biennale - Artlyst|work=Artlyst|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Objection'' ====
After numerous visits to [[Istanbul]], Michal Cole met Ekin Onat, a [[Turkish Muslims|Turkish Muslim]] artist who addresses female and political issues of contemporary [[Turkey]]. The two staged their joint project ''Objection'' in the Pavilion of Humanity at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The project revolved around the notion of the home, based on their independent yet complementary artistic interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlyst.com/reviews/pavilion-humanity-objection-exhibited-venice-biennale/|title=Pavilion of Humanity Where Objection is Exhibited At The Venice Biennale|last=|first=|date=|website=Artlyst|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, which featured a number of rooms in an artificial home included Cole’s textile room ''Top Gun and'' raised the question of the role of arts and culture in times of crisis, political upheaval and change while uniformly making an argument of compassion and non-violent protest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itsliquid.com/the-pavilion-of-humanity-objection.html|title=The Pavilion of Humanity – OBJECTION|date=2017-07-17|work=ITSLIQUID GROUP - Official website|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both women transformed the Venetian villa “to give an artistic home to women’s rights and free speech.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1992618197?accountid=6180|title=April 11, 2017 (Page SS1-14)|last=|first=|date=April 11, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the numerous rooms in the home, both artists contemplate with political oppression and the power of speech, which is shown in Cole’s ''Domestic Godless,'' a video installation in the kitchen which showcased different videos coming from screens inside cups, bowls and teapots, in which the subject is shown to be screaming. The videos are meant to be representative of a time in Cole’s life where she was left ‘howling like an injured dog’ and addresses the role of women across all planes of human existence. Specifically it showcases how inner frustrations at unrealistic pressures are universally placed upon women, such as being beautiful, smart, maternal, and sexual. In the traditionally feminized location of the kitchen, the screams and female outrage can be heard coming from the videos, giving the voice to the woman, where she would have traditionally taken on a role of servitude.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The upper floor of the home held collaborative works by the two artists titled ''The Journey Between Human Being'' and ''Being Human.'' Voices could be heard coming from behind a locked door and when the listener approached the keyhole in an attempt to get the clearest sound, the voices became increasingly overlapped making it apparent that different languages were being spoken between the women. The themes of speaking and silence continued in the master bedroom, where ''Absent Presence'' is a life-like model of the artist sitting with their backs facing one-another on the bed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
Apart from showcasing work twice at the Venice Biennale, in 2015 and 2017, as well as exhibiting in [[Sotheby's|Sotheby’s]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Michal Cole has exhibited her work worldwide to much acclaim. She is the winner of the My Art Space Scope Miami competition, the 2011 Signature Art Awards, the [[Saatchi Gallery]]’s Showdown competition award in London.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
After visiting London as a teenager, Cole built a group titled the ''Heavy Metalists'' in [[Tel Aviv]] which took over nightclubs and formed a mini revolution of anarchy and mayhem. The intention of the group was to challenge existing local beliefs, views, fashion and musical tastes by communicating new ideas of freedom, specifically artistic freedom, atheism and passion for challenging conformity. The group, led by Cole until the age of 18, grew in popularity and was featured in mainstream media. After running away to Paris when she was 17 in an attempt to avoid recruitment, Cole was recruited at age 18 to the Israeli Defense Forces to serve mandatory military service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Michal Cole’s parents are [[Moroccan Jews]] who trace their roots back to the [[Jews of Spain]] who migrated to Morocco after the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Her parents [[Migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel|left Morocco]] in the early 1950s, being deported by sea to Israel where they were placed in refugee camps and suffered poverty and racial discrimination as a new minority in Israel.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of Cole’s work involves the notions of displacement and exile – both internal and external. Due to the merging of her Moroccan-Israeli ethnicity and adopted Western cultural aspects, she explores the collisions of tradition and modernity while similarly delving in to the roles of women and the absurdity of global inequality in her work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Michal Cole uses her artworks as a form of celebration and examination of the human condition while inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty, joy, and humour of life set against the uncontrollable social, economic, political and religious injustices and hypocrisies that inevitably affect us. She is specifically fascinated by moments of transition – economical transitions, religious shifts, the collapse of beliefs and infrastructures and loss of faith. Cole attempts to envision the possibility of order born from chaos and mayhem, creativity out of destruction and inspiration derived from man’s fallibility and stupidity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The artist Cole is most inspired by is [[Caravaggio]] due to his rebelliousness and insanity, and the eroticism, drama and violence of his work. She spent a summer touring [[Italy]] in search of his original artworks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For much of its history '''Norwegian art''' is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Norwegian Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the [[Kalmar Union]] of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles.  

Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with [[landscape painting]], later with [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html Painting from Norway Cultural Profile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304022949/http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html |date=2009-03-04 }} Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though for the rest of the world [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures.

==The beginnings==
[[File:A Tidemand-Haugianerne.jpg|thumb| [[Adolph Tidemand]]'s ''Haugianerne'' ([[Haugean]]s). 1852]]

[[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857) is often said to be the "father of Norwegian landscape painting". After a period in [[Copenhagen]], he joined the [[Dresden]] school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.&lt;ref name="HFG"&gt;{{cite book | last = Haverkamp | first = Frode | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | others = trans. Joan Fuglesang | title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape | accessdate = 2008-01-07 | language = Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important early contributor was [[Johannes Flintoe]] (1787–1870), a [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of [[Bunad|folk costumes]]. He taught at the School of Drawing (''Tegneskolen'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as [[Hans Gude]] and Johan F. Eckersberg.&lt;ref name="HFG"/&gt;

[[Adolph Tidemand]] (1814–1876) studied in  [[Copenhagen]], in [[Italy]] and finally in [[Düsseldorf]] where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old [[Norwegian farm culture]]. His best known painting is ''The bridal procession in Hardanger'' (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and ''Haugianerne'' (''[[Haugean]]s'') painted in 1852.

Norway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Kielland]], 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and  [[Harriet Backer]], 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.

==Impressionists and neo-romanticists==
[[Image:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Krohg]], ''[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse]]'' (Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room, 1885&amp;ndash;87)]]
[[Frits Thaulow]], 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in [[Paris]] where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Erik Werenskiold]].

[[Christian Krohg]], 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html Norwegian Artists from ArtCyclopedia]. Retrieved 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thorolf Holmboe]] (1866–1935) studied under [[Hans Gude]] in [[Berlin]] between 1886 and 1887 and [[Fernand Cormon]] in [[Paris]] between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including [[naturalism (art)|Naturalism]], [[Neo-romanticism]], [[realism (art)|Realism]] and [[impressionism (art)|Impressionism]].

[[Nikolai Astrup]] (1880–1928) grew up in [[Jølster]] in the west of Norway. After studying art in [[Oslo]] and spending some time in [[Paris]] and in [[Germany]], he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest [[Norway|Norwegian]] artists from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikolai-astrup.com/ Nikolai Astrup from nikolai-astrup.com.] Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lars Hertervig]] (1830–1902) from  [[Tysvær]] in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in [[Ryfylke]]. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, [[Stavanger Museum]], in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously [[Rogaland Museum of Fine Art]]) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. 

[[Harald Sohlberg]], (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of [[Røros]], and the Norwegian "national painting" ''Winter's Night in Rondane''.

==Edvard Munch==
Norway's most famous artist is certainly [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), a [[symbolist]]/[[expressionist]] who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'', one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.&lt;ref&gt;Eggum, 1984, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names ==
[[File:Gunnar Berg Fra Svolvær havn.jpg|thumb|[[Gunnar Berg (painter)|Gunnar Berg]]'s ''From [[Svolvær]] harbour'', c. 1890. Being one of "the young dead", Berg is considered one of the finest painters of northern Norwegian nature.]]

{{redirect-multi|2|Cacophony|Euphony}}

'''Phonaesthetics''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|φωνή}} ''phōnē'', "voice-sound"; and {{lang-grc-gre|αἰσθητική}} ''aisthētikē'', "aesthetics") is the philosophical study of beauty ([[aesthetics]]) within the sounds of human speech ([[phonetics]]), or the scientific study of perceptions about beauty in such sounds. The term is not formally established in either philosophy or linguistics. According to Irish linguist Raymond Hickey, phonaesthetics is concerned with  "the possible connection between sound sequences and meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hickey |first1=Raymond |title=A Dictionary of Varieties of English |date=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=111858404X |page=514 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kWpXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT514 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly through [[sound symbolism]], and according to British linguist [[David Crystal]], it is "a term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study of the aesthetic properties of sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crystal |first1=David |title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444356755 |page=364 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;pg=PT364 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crystal: 

{{quote|Examples include the implication of smallness in the [[close vowel]]s of such words as ''teeny weeny'', and the unpleasant associations of the consonant cluster ''sl-'' in such words as ''slime'', ''slug'', and ''slush''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crystal|first1=David|title=A Dictionary of Language|date=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226122038|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GU5FWs1pBEC&amp;pg=PA260|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The application of said aesthetic properties of sound, phonaesthetics, and their meaning in [[Media (communication)|media]] has yet to be studied extensively. That being said, the study of sound [[aesthetics]] is a burgeoning field waiting to be studied by phonaestheticians everywhere.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sound has many qualitative aspects, some of which are subjectively regarded as euphony and cacophony.

== Euphony ==
Euphony is the effect of sounds being pleasant, rhythmical, or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_C.html|title=CACOPHONY, Literary Terms and Definition by Carson-Newman University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://literarydevices.net/cacophony/|title=Definition of Cacophony|date=|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElizabethPodhaizer2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elizabeth|first1=Mary|last2=Podhaizer|first2=Mary Elizabeth|title=Painless Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PL-Lpq-BbucC&amp;pg=RA1-PT186|year=2001|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-1614-8|chapter=Euphony}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of euphony is the poem ''Some Sweet Day''.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Some day Love shall claim his own
Some day Right ascend his throne,
Some day hidden Truth be known;
Some day—some sweet day.
&lt;/poem&gt;|"Some Sweet Day", [[Lewis J. Bates]]}}{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Cacophony ==
Cacophony is the effect of sounds being harsh and often discordant. These sounds are often meaningless and jumbled together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacophony|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cacophony?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A discordant series of harsh, unpleasant sounds helps to convey disorder. This is often furthered by the combined effect of the meaning and the difficulty of pronunciation. For example:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;My stick fingers click with a snicker
And, chuckling, they knuckle the keys;
Light-footed, my steel feelers flicker
And pluck from these keys melodies.&lt;/poem&gt;
|"Player Piano", [[John Updike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetic Devices|url=http://www.chaparralpoets.org/devices.pdf|website=chaparralpoets.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"'''Rip Rip Woodchip'''" is a song by Australian country singer [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]. The song was released in August 1989 as the second single from Williamson's eighth studio ''[[Warragul (album)|Warragul]]''. The song peaked at number 39 on the [[ARIA Charts]]. $1 from each sale went towards the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]].

At the 1990 [[APRA Awards (Australia)]], the song won Most Performed Australasian Country Work.&lt;ref name=apra90&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/apraawards/musicawards/history/19891990Winners.aspx | title = APRA Music Awards – 1989–1990 Winners | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association | accessdate = 16 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the logging industry  threatened to sue Williamson over the song. Williamson said "People say I'm a green, but I'm not. It's just how I feel and if you don't like it, too bad. I became a conservationist in 1980 when I woke up to it. I left farming in part because I'm so into trees. I think an old growth forest is more important than the Sydney Town Hall. Surely that heritage is more important than the other? Surely?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/john-williamson-sees-true-blue-people-all-over-the-world-20140917-10hzcz.html|title= John Williamson sees true blue people all over the world|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date= 17 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rubbing''' (''[[Frottage (art)|frottage]]'') is a reproduction of the [[Surface finish|texture]] of a surface created by placing a piece of paper or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly [[charcoal]] or [[pencil]], but also various forms of blotted and rolled ink, [[chalk]], [[wax]], and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the  technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowsky, D., ''Failure Analysis of Wood and Wood-Based Products'', McGraw-Hill Education; 1st edition (2015) {{ISBN|978-0-07-183937-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses for this technique include:
* [[Brass rubbing]], to make copies of [[monumental brass]]es
* [[Forensic]] uses, including finding out what was written on a sheet of paper removed from a pad by rubbing the impressions left on subsequent sheets or other backing materials
* [[Frottage (art)|Frottage]], a [[surrealist]] art form
* [[Stone rubbing]], to make copies of patterns and inscriptions of gravestones or other incised or textured stone surfaces

'''''She's Having a Baby''''' is a 1988 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]].

The film portrays a young newlywed couple, Kristy and Jake Briggs played by [[Elizabeth McGovern]] and [[Kevin Bacon]], who try to cope with married life and their parents' expectations.

==Plot==
This film looks at the lives of Jefferson "Jake" ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and Kristy Briggs ([[Elizabeth McGovern]]), from their wedding day until the birth of their first child, mostly through Jake's eyes, with his voiceover commentaries and several imaginary scenes. Jake asks his best friend, Davis McDonald ([[Alec Baldwin]]) before the wedding if he thinks he will be happy, to which his friend says, "Yeah, you'll be happy. You just won't know it."

After their wedding, Jake and Kristy head off for New Mexico, where Jake works towards gaining a Master's Degree, but leaves before finishing. They return to Chicago where Jake is hired as an advertising copywriter. Jake says he wants to be a writer, which amuses his boss. Kristy is hired as a research analyst, and they are able to buy a house in the suburbs.

Jake's best friend suddenly visits after not seeing him for two years. Davis tells them that his father has died, and Jake and Kristy are supportive, allowing him to stay the night. Things take a turn for the worse when Davis makes a pass at Kristy, by trying to get her bathrobe open and proclaiming his feelings, but Kristy turns him down, telling him that she is in love with Jake. Meanwhile, Jake begins fantasizing about having an affair with a mysterious young French model.

Jake and Kristy continue to adjust to their new lives until Kristy decides to stop taking contraceptives without telling Jake, until after several months, she informs him that he has been unable to impregnate her. Jake feels pressure from society and from his wife to have a child. The couple begins a fertility program, which eventually succeed. They tell their parents, and while all are overjoyed, Kristy's mother casually informs them that she had a difficult birth with Kristy and nearly died. During a traumatic labor, Jake realizes that his lack of satisfaction was due to his selfishness and immaturity.

The last scene of the film reveals that Jake's voiceover was the new father reading his novel entitled ''She's Having a Baby'' to his wife and son.

In ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder]]'' director [[Kevin Smith]] cites ''She's Having a Baby'' as his favorite John Hughes movie. He also cites it as a template for ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'', joking that both movies were financially unsuccessful.

'''Shiatzy Chen''' ({{zh|c=夏姿．陳|p=Xiàzī Chén}}) is a Taiwanese luxury fashion house, founded in 1978 by '''Wang Chen Tsai-Hsia''' (王陳彩霞), who is often referred to as the [[Chanel]] of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasso|first=Sheridan|title=China's new cultural revolution|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100034253/index2.htm|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=3 April 2014|author2=Wang Ting |author3=Zhang Dan |date=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They describe their style as "neo-Chinese chic", where the aesthetics of [[Chinese clothing]] and handicraft are combined with Western styles, using design features drawn from Chinese culture such as mandarin collars and Chinese patterns.&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;{{cite news|last=Quartly|first=Jules|title='Neo-Chinese chic' is in|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/01/27/2003221178/1|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=27 Jan 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked Wang as one of the 25 most influential Chinese in global fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flannery|first=Russell|title=25 Influential Chinese In Global Fashion -- 2010 (Full List)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2012/08/10/25-influential-chinese-in-global-fashion-2010-full-list/|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Wang Chen Tsai-Hsia was born in 1951 in [[Changhua]], [[Taiwan]]. She was not formally educated in the industry, learning her trade by working at her uncle's factory.

In 1978, she and her husband, Wang Yuan-hong (王元宏), a businessman in the textile trade, founded the Shiatzy International Company Limited in 1978.&lt;ref name=taipei/&gt; For over 30 years Wang worked to establish her name in the local market and build up an extensive client list.&lt;ref name=taipei/&gt; The company is one of the few homegrown designer labels in Taiwan with an international clientele including the President of Taiwan [[Ma Ying-jeou]], Taiwanese celebrities including [[Dee Shu]], [[Patty Hou]], [[Wang Leehom]] and [[Aska Yang]]; local politicians such as [[Jason Hu]], businesswomen such as [[Pansy Ho]] and [[Shaw-Lan Wang]]; and British celebrities such as [[Elizabeth Hurley]] and [[Victoria Beckham]].&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite news|last=Ho|first=Fiona|title=Shiatzy Chen trendier with time|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx/?file=%2f2012%2f2%2f9%2flifeliving%2f10547604|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=The Star|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Taiwan market is the company's major source of revenue. In Taiwan, Shiatzy Chen fashion shows, rather than showing upcoming collections, present the current season to their VIP clients, who purchase the clothes for their own use, rather than commercial buyers looking to buy upcoming styles.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

==Merchandise==
While predominantly a womenswear company, in 1987 the company added a menswear line. While not bespoke menswear, the range includes off-the-peg [[changpao]]s intended for weddings and traditional engagement parties. A popular line is their quilted, often reversible, winter jackets, available in a wide range of styles, fabrics, patterns and color combinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movius.us/articles/WWD-ShiatzyChen.html WWD-Shiatzy Chen Arrives on Bund]&lt;/ref&gt; In about 2007 they expanded their catalogue with accessories (sold in all stores) and a line of furniture available from their three flagship stores in Taipei, Shanghai and Paris.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;{{cite news|title=Sartorial elegance, oriental style|url=http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=49639&amp;CtNode=458&amp;htx_TRCategory=&amp;mp=4|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Taiwan Review|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Shiatzy Chen and the tea culture brand Cha Cha Thé (采采食茶文化) opened an exclusive sales area in the super upscale [[Galeries Lafayette]] department store in Paris, along with a tea lounge in Taipei, where customers could come for tea, and purchase tea-wares and other gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last="Cheer"|title=Shiatzy.

==Company history==
[[File:Shiatzy Chen Store Taipei.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Shiatzy Chen store (Taipei, Taiwan)]]

In 1990 Shiatzy Chen set up a studio in Paris to stay on top of fashion trends and to learn more about Western dressmaking techniques. This studio also serves as a training center for Taiwanese dressmakers and designers. They opened a flagship store in Paris in 2001.

The label has been listed on the London-based ''[[Financial Times]]'' pick of what is hot in 2004. It was also deemed the most popular fashion brand in Taiwan by ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=18&amp;post=24336 Sartorial elegance, oriental style&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the company entered the Chinese market, opening a third flagship store in [[Shanghai]], on [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in October 2005; with further stores in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Beijing]]. Restoration on the building began in late 2001. The interior was designed by Indonesian designer Jaya Ibrahim. The company aimed to have 50 stores in mainland China by 2010 in addition to their 48 outlets in Taiwan, 23 directly managed stores and 25 department store counters.

In 2007 they opened a second factory, measuring 6000 square meters, in Shanghai alongside the existing one in Taipei. This new factory was designed by German architect Johannes Hartfuss to accommodate a workforce of more than 1,000 employees, including dressmakers and embroiderers, producing tens of thousands of clothing items annually based on over 400 styles created by its designers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=20528&amp;CtNode=103 Fashion label too sexy for Taiwan, eyes global market/Taiwan Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2008 Shiatzy Chen debuted at [[Paris Fashion Week]], making Wang just the second Taiwanese design house (after YufengShawn, 馭風騷, in 2005) to have officially shown there. They presented their show at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] on the Left Bank in central Paris, and have shown there in subsequent years, including an [[Anna Wintour]] inspired collection for Fall-Winter 2010-11. On 9 November 2009, the company became a member of the Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2008/08/27/2003421493 Threading tradition and modernity together/Taipei Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Cha Cha Thé.jpg|thumb|100|left| Cha Cha Thé store (Taipei, Taiwan)]]

In 2010, they held a record-breaking exhibition of 100 flower-themed dresses at the [[Taipei International Flora Exposition]], presented on the longest catwalk seen in the Taiwan fashion business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chuang|first=Jimmy|title=A Hundred Dresses Create New Fashion Record for Flora Expo|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-print-cnt.aspx?cid=1104&amp;MainCatID=11&amp;id=20101105000005|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Want China Times|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company reported sales of about US$60 million.

{{Women and Spirituality Trilogy}}
'''''The Burning Times''''' is a 1990 [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] [[Documentary film|documentary]], presenting a [[feminism|feminist]] account of  the [[Early Modern European witchcraft trials]].&lt;ref name="kapica"&gt;Toronto Globe and Mail, June 12, 1991 ''"Religion"'' by Jack Kapica, "Review of The Burning Times" transcribed at http://www.debunker.com/texts/burning_times.html retrieved on August 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
It was directed by Donna Read and written by Erna Buffie, and features interviews with [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Neopagan]] notables, such as [[Starhawk]], [[Margot Adler]], and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]]. ''The Burning Times'' is the second film in the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''Women and Spirituality'' series, following ''[[Goddess Remembered]]'' and preceding [[Full Circle (1993 film)|Full Circle]].

The opening and closing theme music, composed by [[Loreena McKennitt]], was released as the track titled "Tango to Evora" on her album "[[The Visit (Loreena McKennitt album)|The Visit]]".

==Criticism==
===Numbers of witches killed===

In the film, Thea Jensen calls this period in history a "Women's Holocaust".  She notes that a total number of victims is unknown but that the high number often given is nine million deaths, over a period of 300 or more years.&lt;ref name="kapica"/&gt; Otherwise, scholarly "high" estimates range around 100,000, with estimates around 60,000 more common.&lt;ref&gt;See [[witchcraft trials]]: extrapolating from 12,000 attested executions, Brian Levac in ''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' estimates 60,000 deaths, Anne Lewellyn Barstow in ''Witch Craze'' has 100,000 and Ronald Hutton in an unpublished essay "Counting the Witch Hunt" estimates 40,000 total executions.&lt;/ref&gt;
The nine million figure, according to modern scholarship, originates with a 1784 article by [[Gottfried Christian Voigt]].&lt;ref&gt;Adler has since claimed that the figure is untenable:  "We now know that most persecutions of witches occurred during a 100-year period, between 1550 and 1650, and the total number hanged or burned probably did not exceed 40,000." [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/17/story_1744_1.html] he continues "...it serves no end to perpetuate the miscalculation; it's time to put away the exaggerated numbers forever." [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/40/story_4007.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of the Church===

According to [[William Donohue]] and [[Robert Eady]] of the [[Catholic Civil Rights League]], the movie is inaccurate in other respects, ''e.g.'', placing [[Trier]] in [[France]] instead of [[Germany]], and dating a stone cross there that is recorded to have been erected in 958 AD to 1132 AD without further explanation. The cross is shown as a "symbol of a new religious cult that was sweeping across Europe," despite Christian presence since 286.&lt;ref name="kapica"/&gt; Eady, a member of the League in Canada, has cited the film in a complaint to broadcast regulators, in particular mentioning offense at the movie's quote: "it took the Church two hundred years of terror and death to transform the image of paganism into devil worship, and folk culture into heresy."&lt;ref name="kapica"/&gt;  Eady describes the documentary as propaganda intended to represent the Christian Church as "a wicked, patriarchal, [[misogynist]] institution".&lt;ref name="kapica"/&gt;
Jack Kapica adds "Women have genuine grievances with the Church. ''The Burning Times'', however, is not going to help their cause."&lt;ref name="kapica"/&gt;

'''''The Defiant Ones''''' is a 1958 [[crime film]] which tells the story of two escaped prisoners, one white and one black, who are shackled together and who must co-operate in order to survive. It stars [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Sidney Poitier]].

The film was adapted by [[Harold Jacob Smith]] from the story by [[Nedrick Young]], originally credited as Nathan E. Douglas. It was directed by [[Stanley Kramer]].

The film was highly regarded at the time of its release; it won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematography (Black-and-White)]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]] and was nominated for seven others, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for both Poitier and Curtis. Poitier won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the [[8th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
The film starts with a truck driving at night. It swerves to miss another truck and crashes through a barrier. The rescuers clear up the debris and cover the people killed... mainly prisoners in the back. It is revealed that two are missing: a black man shackled to a white man, because "the warden had a sense of humor." They are told not to look too hard as "they will probably kill each other in the first five miles." Nevertheless, a large posse and many [[bloodhound]]s are dispatched the next morning to find them.

The setting is in the American South, the men are the black Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) and the white John "Joker" Jackson (Curtis). Despite their mutual hatred, they are forced to cooperate, as they are chained together. At first their cooperation is motivated by self-preservation but gradually, they begin to respect and like each other.

Cullen and Joker flee through difficult terrain and weather, with a brief stop at a turpentine [[Company town|camp]] where they attempt to break into a general store, in hopes of obtaining food and tools to break the chain that holds them together. Instead, however, they are captured by the inhabitants, who form a lynch mob; they are saved only by the interference of "Big" Sam (Chaney), a man who is appalled by his neighbors' bloodthirst. Sam persuades the onlookers to lock the convicts up and turn them in the next morning, but that night, he secretly releases them, after revealing to them that he is also a former chain-gang prisoner.

Finally, they run into a young boy named Billy. They make him take them to his home and his mother (Williams), whose husband has abandoned his family. The escapees are finally able to break their chains. When they spend the night there, the lonely woman is attracted to Joker and wants to run off with him. She advises Cullen to go through the swamp to reach the railroad tracks, while she and Joker drive off in her car. The men agree to split up. However, after Cullen leaves, the woman reveals that she had lied—she sent Cullen into the dangerous swamp to die to eliminate any chance he would be captured and perhaps reveal where Joker had gone. Furious, Joker runs after his friend; as he leaves, Billy shoots him.

Wounded, Joker catches up to Cullen and warns him about the swamp. As the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] led by humane Sheriff Max Muller (Bikel) gets close, the escapees can hear the dogs on their trail. They also hear a train whistle and run toward it. Cullen hops the train and tries to lift Joker aboard, but is unable to do so. Both men tumble to the ground. Too exhausted to run, they realize all they can do is wait for their pursuers. The sheriff finds Cullen singing defiantly and Joker lying in his arms.

==Production==
[[Robert Mitchum]], a veteran of a Southern chain gang, turned down the role of Jackson because blacks and whites would never be chained together in the segregated South. The story was corrupted into the claim, repeated by Curtis and others, that Mitchum refused to work with a black man. Kramer wrote that Poitier was initially unsure of Curtis' casting but became supportive. Curtis, however, denied this; he stated that he had contractual rights to approve who would play Cullen. However, despite Curtis' many later claims and stories, Kramer had originally cast Poitier and Marlon Brando as the two leads when a previous contractual obligation prevented Poitier from being able to accept the role. Kramer wanted Poitier for the role so badly that he delayed the film's production, which led to Brando having to decline because the delay caused shooting to overlap with another obligation he had. Curtis was cast afterwards. Curtis did request [[billing (filmmaking)#Main billing|Poitier's name appear with his]] above the movie title marking a first for Poitier in his career.&lt;ref name="tcmcurtis"&gt;''Private Screenings: Tony Curtis''.

[[Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer]], of the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies, has a small role. It was his last before his death.

==Reception==
The film made a profit of $1 million.&lt;ref name="tino"/&gt;

===Critical response===
When the film was first released, [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', lauded the production and the acting in the film, writing, "A remarkably apt and dramatic visualization of a social idea—the idea of men of different races brought together to face misfortune in a bond of brotherhood—is achieved by producer Stanley Kramer in his new film, ''The Defiant Ones''...&amp;nbsp;Between the two principal performers there isn't much room for a choice. Mr. Poitier stands out as the Negro convict and Mr. Curtis is surprisingly good. Both men are intensely dynamic. Mr. Poitier shows a deep and powerful strain of underlying compassion...In the ranks of the pursuers, Theodore Bikel is most impressive as a sheriff with a streak of mercy and justice, which he has to fight to maintain against a brutish state policeman, played by Charles McGraw."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0D61430E73BBC4D51DFBF668383649EDE Crowther, Bosley].  ''[[The New York Times]]'', film review, September 25, 1958. Last accessed: February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine likewise praised the acting and discussed the film's major theme, writing, "The theme of ''The Defiant Ones'' is that what keeps men apart is their lack of knowledge of one another. With that knowledge comes respect, and with respect comradeship and even love. This thesis is exercised in terms of a colored and a white man, both convicts chained together as they make their break for freedom from a Southern prison gang. The performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are virtually flawless. Poitier captures all of the moody violence of the convict, serving time because he assaulted a white man who had insulted him. It is a cunning, totally intelligent portrayal that rings powerfully true...Curtis delivers a true surprise performance. He starts off as a sneering, brutal character, willing to fight it out to-the-death with his equally stubborn companion. When, in the end, he sacrifices a dash for freedom to save Poitier, by saving him from the swamp, he has managed the transition with such skill that sympathy is completely with him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790341?refcatid=31 ''Variety''], film review, September 24, 1958.

==Remakes, tributes and parodies==

The basis of ''The Defiant Ones'' was revisited several times in popular media:

* [[Warner Brothers]] [[parody|parodied]] the film in [[Friz Freleng]]'s 1961 cartoon ''[[D' Fightin' Ones]]'', in which [[Sylvester the Cat]] escapes from captivity in a dogcatcher truck while chained to a [[bulldog]].
* In 1972, with gender reversal, as ''[[Black Mama, White Mama]]'', starring [[Pam Grier]] and [[Margaret Markov]].
* Another 1972 [[B-movie]] added a [[science fiction]] [[blaxploitation]] twist as ''[[The Thing with Two Heads]]'', in which a [[racist]] white man (played by [[Ray Milland]]) has his head [[grafting|grafted]] onto the body of a living black man (played by [[Rosey Grier]]).
* In 1984, in the season 1 episode "Some Like It Hot" of the American sitcom ''[[Night Court]]'', the movie plot was briefly alluded to by a maintenance man as Dan and Liz (white and black characters, respectively) are handcuffed together, as he says, "Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier...what was the name of that movie?"
* For [[television]] in 1986, as ''[[The Defiant Ones (1986 film)|The Defiant Ones]]'', starring [[Robert Urich]] and [[Carl Weathers]].
* Homage is paid to the film in the 1992 ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' episode "Unchained". Protagonist Sam Beckett lands in the body of a white Mississippi road gang worker chained to a wrongly convicted black man, and the two must escape together or be murdered by the corrupt warden.
* In the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' episode "[[The Inquisitor (Red Dwarf)|The Inquisitor]]", an altered-reality [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] says - in reference to [[Dave Lister|Lister]] and [[Kryten]] showing up on the ship chained together- "Look, they come here with some cock-and-bull story, they're chained together like Sidney Poiter and Tony Curtis -- I say open the door to oblivion and kick 'em through!"
* In 1996 action film ''[[Fled]]'', the film stars [[Laurence Fishburne]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]].
* In a ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' episode, Principal Edwards ([[Jason Alexander]]) cites the plot of the film for [[Chris Rock]], and then, he abandons it in a [[natural history museum]] in [[New York City]] with Joey Caruso ([[Travis T. Flory]]) for both practicing the "buddy system".
* Mentioned in season 4 of [[Archer (2009 TV series)|''Archer'']] in episode "Coyote Lovely". After handcuffing Lana and Cyril together Archer says "just like the defiant ones"

==Plot==

Nic ([[Annette Bening]]) and Jules ([[Julianne Moore]]) are a married same-sex couple living in the [[Los Angeles]] area. Nic is a lesbian [[obstetrician]], and Jules is a bisexual housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same [[sperm donation|sperm donor]].

The younger child Laser ([[Josh Hutcherson]]) wants to find his biological father, but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), to contact the [[sperm bank]] which identifies Paul ([[Mark Ruffalo]]) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea.

While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair.

Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle—which Nic has forbidden—and by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair. Nic is devastated, but Jules assures she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. Joni and Laser have overheard the arguments and are also upset at Jules. The household becomes tense and Jules is forced to sleep on the couch. Paul thinks he has fallen in love with Jules and suggests she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him. Jules declines, disgusted with Paul's lack of understanding about their relationship. The children are angry at both of them.

The night before Joni leaves home to go to college, Paul turns up at the house. Nic angrily confronts him and tells him that if he wants a family, he should make one of his own. Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser ignores him. Later that night, Jules tearfully admits her errors to her family and begs their forgiveness. The next morning, the family takes Joni off to college. While Nic and Jules together hug Joni to say goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other. During the ride home, Laser tells his mothers that they should not break up because they are too old. Jules and Nic giggle, and the film ends with them smiling at each other and holding hands.

'''"The Story of Kullervo"''' is a prose version of the [[Kullervo]] cycle in the Karelian and Finnish [[epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] when he was an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford, from 1914 to 1915.  That was an unsettled period for the author and this is thought to be reflected in the story's dark subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Story of Kullervo {{!}} Quadrapheme|url = http://www.quadrapheme.com/the-story-of-kullervo/|website = www.quadrapheme.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20151225115316/http://www.quadrapheme.com/the-story-of-kullervo/|archivedate = 25 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also marks "the first time that J.

Tolkien, who had been a poet until then, began writing prose".&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Ferre, quoted in {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/jrr-tolkien-new-story-darkest-work/|title=JRR Tolkien's first story is 'undeniably his darkest work' say experts|date=26 August 2015|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a source (among others) for [[Túrin Turambar]], "The Story of Kullervo" was the centre of Tolkien's efforts in 1914, as he was "trying to turn one of the stories [of the ''Kalevala''] — which is really a very great story and most tragic – into a short story" (''Letters'', October 1914, #1).

"The Story of Kullervo" was edited by [[Verlyn Flieger]], published in 2010 in ''Tolkien Studies'', and republished in book form in August 2015 by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/blog/2015/07/the-story-of-kullervo-and-the-brazilian-contribution-to-its-publication/ |publisher=[[Tolkien Society]] |title=The Story of Kullervo and the Brazilian contribution to its publication |first=Eduardo |last=Oliveira Ferreira |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Tilled Field.jpg|300px|thumb]]

'''''The Tilled Field''''' (French: ''La terre labourée''; Catalan: ''Terra llaurada'') is a 1923-4 oil-on-canvas painting by Catalan painter [[Joan Miró]], depicting a stylised view of his family's farm at [[Mont-roig del Camp]] in [[Catalonia]].  The painting shows development from Miró's earlier works, such as ''[[The Farm (Miró)|The Farm]]'', and is considered to be one of his first [[Surrealist]] works, created around the same time as the more abstracted ''[[Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)]]''.

The painting measures {{convert|66|x|92.7|cm}}.  It is dominated by muted tones of yellow and brown.  The image is divided into three areas by two horizontal lines, perhaps representing the sky, sea and earth; a diagonal line seems to put the top right corner of the painting in the dark of night, while the rest is in the light of day.  The painting is littered with a confused mixture of forms, many with aspects of humans, animals, and plants. The various animal forms are derived from Catalan ceramics, including a lizard wearing a conical hat.  A tree to the right of centre has a large eye in its green crown and a human ear on its brown trunk.  Hanging from the tree is a shape covered with more eyes, possibly a [[pinecone]], or perhaps a leaf or a spider; at the base of the tree is a folded newspaper with the French word ''jour'' (day).  Further right, in the background, is a human figure following a cattle-drawn plough, based on the [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira cave]] paintings.  Also in the background, towards the centre, is a ramshackle house with chimney, and further left a tree-like object bearing the flags of France, Spain and Catalonia.  Another plant-like object to the left bears a further flag, possibly French, perhaps symbolising the border between France (left) and Spain (right)

It is held by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York.

The '''Theater in der Josefstadt''' is a [[theater]] in [[Vienna]] in the eighth district of [[Josefstadt]]. It was founded in 1788 and is the oldest still performing theater in Vienna. It is often referred to colloquially as simply ''Die Josefstadt''. 

Following remodeling and rebuilding in 1822 — celebrated by the performance of the overture ''[[Consecration of the House Overture|Die Weihe des Hauses]]'' ('Consecration of the House') by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] — opera was staged there including [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. From 1858 onwards the theatre gave up opera and instead concentrated on straight theatre and comedy. 

==Major figures in musical and theatrical history connected with the house==
*[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]] conducted there. 
*[[Johann Nestroy]] and [[Ferdinand Raimund]] were connected to the theater as actors and poets.
*[[Johann Strauss I]] performed in the Sträußelsälen.
*In 1814, [[Ferdinand Raimund]] had his Vienna debut as [[Franz Moor]] in ''[[Die Räuber]]'' by [[Friedrich Schiller]].
*In 1822, ''[[Consecration of the House Overture|Die Weihe des Hauses]]'' composed and directed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].
*In 1829 [[Johann Nestroy]] debuted as an actor with the ''''Die Verbannung aus dem Zauberreich oder Dreißig Jahre aus dem Leben eines Lumpen''.
*From 1833 to 1836 [[Conradin Kreutzer]] was the theater conductor and on 13 January 1834, his romantic opera ''[[Das Nachtlager in Granada]]'' was first performed in the theater.
*On 20 February 1834, [[Ferdinand Raimund]]'s ''Der Verschwender'' was first performed with the poet in the roll of Valentin (with stage music by Kreutzer).
*Between around 1840 and 1860, famous dancers [[Fanny Elssler]] and the Spanish [[Pepita de Oliva]] performed in the theater.
*The first German-language performance of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s [[Liliom]] with [[Josef Jarno]] in the title role on 28 February 1913 played a key role in the piece's long-lasting appeal.

'''Tucking''' is a technique whereby an individual hides the [[wikt:Thesaurus:male crotch bulge|crotch bulge]] of the penis and testicles so that they are not conspicuous through clothing.

The practice is most commonly employed by [[transgender women]] in order to [[Methods of passing as female|pass as female]], as well as [[cisgender]] men that do [[Drag queen|drag]]. There are fertility-related side-effects to tucking, such as a reduced sperm count.&lt;ref&gt;Ducheny, Kelly M., and Randall D. Ehrbar. "Family creation options for transgender and gender nonconforming people." Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity 3.2 (2016): 173&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of clothing, such as gaffs and bloxers are purposefully designed to inadvertently conceal the male crotch bulge.

== Methods ==
One method of tucking involves pulling the penis backwards in between the legs while simultaneously pushing the testicles up into the [[inguinal canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, Jake. "Unsuitable bodies: Trans people and cisnormativity in shelter services." Canadian Social Work Review/Revue canadienne de service social 28.1 (2011): 129-137&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure this position in place, some trans women may use especially tight undergarments and a leotard that has a strap.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo, Maria San. "Female Trouble: Representing Transwomen in The Danish Girl and The New Girlfriend." Journal of Bisexuality 16.3 (2016): 403-407.&lt;/ref&gt; Another practice is the flattening or binding by using tape to fasten the genitalia along the perineum and if possible in between the buttocks. There are also improvised or home-made contrivances whereby an elastic waistband is cut off from an existing garment and then a pouch placed along the middle to then be pulled up.&lt;ref&gt;Conard, L. A. E. "Supporting and caring for transgender and gender nonconforming youth in the urology practice." Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Man|male]] [[cross-dresser]]s and pre- and non-op transgender women use purpose-made [[Panties|panty]]-like [[clothing|garment]]s, often called '''gaffs''', that serve to hide the genitalia and provide a feminine flat and smooth [[Groin|crotch]] area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=114 Penis - methods of concealment and obtaining a 'flat-look' for pre-op  male-to-female transgender people]," Samantha Johnson, Transgender Zone&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ==
The practice of tucking is also observed among cisgender men for reasons other than appearing female, done in different manners.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Jacki, and Nicola McCartney. "A look at ‘fishy drag’and androgynous fashion: Exploring the border spaces beyond gender-normative deviance for the straight, cisgendered woman." Critical Studies in Fashion &amp; Beauty 8.1 (2017): 99-122&lt;/ref&gt; Some men do it because they feel embarrassment, while others do it to hide an erection&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health24.com/Medical/Erectile-dysfunction/News/New-erection-hiding-underwear-unveiled-20141112&lt;/ref&gt;, to desexualize themselves out of a sense of prudishness or [[phallophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;Shawver, Lois. "Sexual Modesty, the Etiquette of Disregard, and the Question of Gays and Lesbians in the Military." Out in force: Sexual orientation and the military (1996): 226&lt;/ref&gt; or because the bulge is prominent at an inappropriate moment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bustle.com/articles/88760-10-weird-things-about-having-an-erection-according-to-guys-because-you-can-wiggle-it&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of tucking include placing the penis behind the waistband sometimes colloquially referred to as ''uptuck''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-15/get-the-boner-prone-man-in-your-life-bloxers-never-be-embarrassed-again/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uproxx.com/webculture/waistband-boner-trick-uptuck/&lt;/ref&gt; while some men may wear purposefully designed compressing underwear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/news/a36443/boner-blocking-boxers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-15/get-the-boner-prone-man-in-your-life-bloxers-never-be-embarrassed-again/&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of tucking may be used by macrophallic men when they perceive their crotch bulge to have an obscene appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Janet, David A. Frederick, and Letitia Anne Peplau. "Does size matter? Men's and women's views on penis size across the lifespan." Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity 7.3 (2006): 129&lt;/ref&gt; There are some types of [[boxer shorts]] and [[boxer briefs]] that are designed to conceal the male crotch bulge, such as bloxers.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, F. "revealing myself: a phenomenological approach to my underwear choices through the years." Critical Studies in Men's Fashion 1.2 (2014): 117-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bloxer-boxers-boners_us_55a51189e4b0a47ac15d5548&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmer's books have been described{{by whom|date=April 2016}} as being in the genre of [[chick lit]] or [[Matron literature|hen lit]]. Harmer wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/putting-the-chick-into-lit/2005/08/11/1123353432397.html|title=Putting the chick into lit - Books - Entertainment - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the genres were misunderstood for [[The Age]] newspaper.

"And if it's all just banal 'women's stuff? If children, marriage, friendship and happiness are just of marginal concern? Pass me the pastel-covered girlie book and break out the chocolate!"  They are popular light novels, and very humorous.

Harmer has also written a series of children's books called the ''Pearlie the Park Fairy'' series. There are 17 books in the ''Pearlie'' series published to date. They are bestsellers in Australia, and have been published in ten countries around the world.

==Political views==

In a 2015 article for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Harmer described herself as a "tragic lefty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/comment/a-way-of-shaming-that-leaves-no-room-for-compassion-20150618-ghraee.html#ixzz44NfHWO7A A way of shaming that leaves no room for compassion]; Wendy Harmer; smh.com.au; June 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2013 humorous piece for ''The Hoopla'', she described herself as an "old lefty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehoopla.com.au/lefty-shops/ A LEFTY GOES DOWN THE SHOPS]; The Hoopla; August 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Harmer told the ABC ''Q&amp;A'' program in November 2015 that her politics sounded "like an old fashioned socialist", that she objected to trends towards privatisation of public assets, and that the GST is not fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s4321172.htm Q&amp;A 2 November, 2015: GST, Gonski, Population and Diversity]; abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 piece for the ''Herald'', Harmer cautioned against being too dismissive of opposing political views: "right and left need each other to progress, we should be more humble about our supposedly deeply-held beliefs and not so quick to label our opponents as either carelessly ill-informed or purposefully evil. Although, don't expect any extremist wingnut or idiotic greenie near you to get that any time soon!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/comment/feeling-beats-thinking-when-fear-is-on-the-brain-20140925-10lvgz.html#ixzz45tLe84pS Feeling beats thinking when fear is on the brain]; September 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Harmer advocated against the election of Republican [[Donald Trump]] at the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US Presidential Election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/mps-slam-abcs-us-election-coverage-as-biased-against-trump/news-story/81fa6d25e53864831148e3d8f1ec3f7c MPs slam ABC’s US election coverage as biased against Trump]; The Australian; 14 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

; Gender fluidity

Harmer wrote in 2016 that acceptance of "gender fluidity" could be one of the "best things" to happen in her lifetime, and that "I believe, with all my heart, that we exist on a dynamic spectrum of sexuality and that labels are at best useless, at worst tragically destructive."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-22/wendy-harmer-sexual-fluidity/7188844 Wendy Harmer: Why gender and sexual fluidity could be one of the best things to happen in my lifetime]; Wendy Harmer; abc.net.au; 22 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

; Abbott-Turnbull Government

Following the first [[Australian federal budget, 2014|Budget]] of the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014, Harmer wrote: "The government we have now confounds me. It seems it is oblivious to all advice, evidence and entreaties. I just cannot understand how Joe Hockey has come up with a budget that offers no joy. At all. No carrot, all stick. All punishment and threats. No reward he’s able to articulate. No budget emergency that stands up to scrutiny."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/comment/wendy-harmer-why-is-tony-abbott-so-down-on-optimism-20140807-101ouj.html#ixzz44NhxZnkO Wendy Harmer: why is Tony Abbott so down on optimism?]; Wendy Harmer; August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

; Republicanism

Harmer is a [[Republicanism in Australia|republican]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2015/08/stirring-republican-crypt/ A Stirring in the Republican Crypt]; Quadrant Online; Michael Copeman, Aug 9 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, she tweeted that she is a member of the [[Australian Republican Movement]], and encouraged others to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wendy_harmer/status/651298339733012480|title=Bloody love it...

I'm a member, are you?|first=Wendy|last=Harmer|date=6 October 2015|website=twitter.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, she participated in a comic debate "Does Australia need the Royal Family", arguing the case for the negative alongside future [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Malcolm Turnbull]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] politician [[Graham Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-03-11/interview-wendy-harmer-abc-sydney Wendy Harmer interview with Malcolm Turnbull], ABC Radio, 11 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

; The Greens

Harmer described long term leader of the [[Australian Greens]] Bob Brown as "a good man prosecuting the good cause...".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Advocacy===
Harmer was one of 28 members of the National People with Disabilities and Careers Council (NPWDACC), created  to advise the [[Australian Government]] on the development of the National Disability Strategy. She was also the ambassador for [[Interplast]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 2014, Harmer wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' that her husband is a "dedicated greenie" and "Activism is now the core of our lives. Our kids have grown up behind protest banners."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Religion===

In an article written for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in March 2013, Harmer described herself as "born into an atheist household", but said she attended Church of England Sunday school for a time until her father declared himself "humanist".&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/comment/quiet-day-taps-yearning-for-sacred-space-20130328-2gx2i.html Quiet day taps yearning for sacred space]; Wendy Harmer; smh.com.au; March 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in 2016 that her father was a "a steadfastly non-religious man, a self-described humanist".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Nevertheless, she wrote, "I've remained deeply attracted to the tale of suffering and resurrection at the heart of the Christian narrative. Endlessly fascinated by accounts of religion, belief, myth, legend and fairytales... I'm one of those pathetic non-believers philosopher Alain de Botton bangs on about. The sad, godless orphans who can't pass a church or temple without entering to light a candle or offer a flower."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In an essay in ''Destroying The Joint: Why Women Have To Change The World'' edited by Jane Caro, Harmer wrote that her two children have been confirmed into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Personal==
Harmer is married to Brendan and has two children. 
She is a co-founder, of the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]'s Angels, the women supporters' group for the local [[Rugby League]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Proszenko|first1=Adrian|title=Eagles Angels supporters group considers parting with Manly|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/eagles-angels-supporters-group-considers-parting-with-manly-20150730-ginrao.html|accessdate=25 September 2016|work=The Eagles Angels, formed in 2002 by Wendy Harmer and Sarah Murdoch to support Manly|agency=SMH|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Erwin Eisner''' (March 6, 1917 – January 3, 2005) was an American [[cartoonist]], writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the [[American comic book]] industry, and his series ''[[The Spirit]]'' (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term "[[graphic novel]]" with the publication of his book ''[[A Contract with God]]''. He was an early contributor to formal [[comics studies]] with his book ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' (1985). The [[Eisner Award]] was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==

===Family background===

Eisner's father Shmuel "Samuel" Eisner was born March 6, 1886, in [[Kolomyia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and was one of eleven children.  He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in [[Vienna]].  To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=2}}  There he found getting work difficult as his English skills were poor.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=2–3}}  He made what living he could painting backdrops for [[vaudeville]] and the [[Jewish theater]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=3}}

Eisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to [[Jewish]] parents from Romania April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US.  Her mother died on her tenth birthday, and was quickly followed by her father.  An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=3}}

Family introduced Shmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=3–4}}  They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father's birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=4}}

===Early life===

[[File:Wow, What a Magazine! No. 3.jpg|thumb|left|''Wow, What a Magazine!'' No. 3 (Sept. 1936): Cover art by a teenage Eisner.]]

Eisner was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City.  He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=4}}  Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to [[antisemitism]] from his schoolmates.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=6}}  His family were not orthodox followers of [[Judaism]]; Eisner himself, while he prided his cultural background, turned against the religion when his family was denied entry to a synagogue over lack of money for admission.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=7–8}}

Young Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}  He was a voracious consumer of [[pulp magazines]] and film, including avant-garde films such as those by [[Man Ray]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|pp=8–9}}  To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=10}}

Eisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another.  Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=5}}  The family situation was especially dire following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] that marked the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=11}}  In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner's mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family's income.  He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010|p=12}}

Eisner attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist [[J. C. Leyendecker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cons: New York 1974! | publisher = | work=The Journal Summer Special | year=1974 | editor-first = Paul Kowtiuk | editor-last = Maple Leaf Publications | place = Box 1286, Essex, ON, CA N0R 1E0) | author=Lovece, Frank | authorlink= Frank Lovece}}&lt;/ref&gt; he drew for the [[school newspaper]] (''The Clintonian''), the literary magazine (''The Magpie'') and the [[yearbook]], and did [[stage design]], leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist [[George Brandt Bridgman]] (1864–1943) for a year at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-[[cartoonist]] for the ''[[New York American]]'' newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for [[pulp magazines]], including ''Western Sheriffs and Outlaws''.

In 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist [[Bob Kane]], of future [[Batman]] fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book ''Wow, What A Magazine!'' "Comic books" at the time were tabloid-sized collections of [[comic strip]] reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. ''Wow'' editor [[Jerry Iger]] bought an Eisner adventure strip called ''Captain Scott Dalton'', an [[H. Rider Haggard]]-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the [[pirate]] strip "The Flame" and the [[secret agent]] strip "Harry Karry" for ''Wow'' as well.

Eisner said that on one occasion a man who Eisner described as "a [[Mafia|Mob]] type straight out of [[Damon Runyon]], complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have "exclusive distribution rights for all [[Brooklyn]]" asked Eisner to draw [[Tijuana bible]]s for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as "one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life".&lt;ref name="Spiegelman2"&gt;[[Art Spiegelman|Spiegelman, Art]].

==Eisner &amp; Iger==
{{Main|Eisner &amp; Iger}}

''Wow'' lasted four issues (cover-dated July–September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book "packagers", their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to [[Fox Comics]], [[Fiction House]], [[Quality Comics]] (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as [[Doll Man]] and [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]), and others.
Turning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he "got very rich before I was 22,"&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Marilyn, "The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter," ''New York'' (Sunday supplement, ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''), January 9, 1966; reprinted ''Alter Ego'' No. 48, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; later detailing that in [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] 1939 alone, he and Iger "had split $25,000 between us",&lt;ref&gt;Heintjes, Tom, ''The Spirit: The Origin Years'' #3 (Kitchen Sink Press, September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; a considerable amount for the time.

Among the studio's products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, ''Hawks of the Sea'', that initially reprinted Eisner's old strip ''Wow, What A Magazine!'' feature "The Flame" and then continued it with new material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/hawkseas.htm ''Hawks of the Sea''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/66BzKll86 Archived] from the original on March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner's original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937 issue of [[Boardman Books]]' comic-strip reprint tabloid ''Okay Comics Weekly.''{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]] for [[Fox Publications#Victor Fox|Victor Fox]], an accountant who had previously worked at [[DC Comics]] and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox's instructions to create a [[Superman]]-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of ''Wonder Comics.'' Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after [[National Periodical Publications]], the company that would evolve into [[DC Comics]], sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox's case;&lt;ref name=spirited44-45&gt;Andelman, Bob. ''Will Eisner: A Spirited Life'' (M Press: [[Milwaukie, Oregon]], 2005) {{ISBN|978-1-59582-011-2}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel ''[[The Dreamer (graphic novel)|The Dreamer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dreamer (graphic novel)|The Dreamer: A Graphic Novella Set During the Dawn of Comic Books]]'' ([[DC Comics]] : New York City, 1986 edition) {{ISBN|978-1-56389-678-1}}.

Norton &amp; Company]] : New York City, London, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-393-32808-0}}, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, a transcript of the proceeding, uncovered by comics historian Ken Quattro in 2010, indicates Eisner in fact supported Fox and claimed Wonder Man as an original Eisner creation.&lt;ref&gt;Quattro, Ken.

==''The Spirit''==
{{Main|The Spirit}}
[[File:TheSpiritNo21.jpg|260px|thumb|Eisner's cover for ''The Spirit'', Oct 6, 1946.]]
In "late '39, just before Christmas time," Eisner recalled in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;"Art &amp; Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner." ''Panels'' #1 (Summer 1979), pp. 5–21, quoted in {{cite web|last=Quattro|first= Ken|url= http://www.comicartville.com/rareeisner.htm |title=Rare Eisner: Making of a Genius| publisher=Comicartville Library |year= 2003| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5mAYF8MXe |archivedate=December 20, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Comics publisher [[Everett M. "Busy" Arnold]] "came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom," In a 2004 interview,&lt;ref name="ae48"&gt;Will Eisner interview, ''Alter Ego'' No. 48 (May 2005), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; he elaborated on that meeting:
{{blockquote|"Busy" invited me up for lunch one day and introduced me to Henry Martin [sales manager of [[The Des Moines Register|The Des Moines Register and Tribune Syndicate]], who] said, "The newspapers in this country, particularly the Sunday papers, are looking to compete with comics books, and they would like to get a comic-book insert into the newspapers." ... Martin asked if I could do it. ... It meant that I'd have to leave Eisner &amp; Iger [which] was making money; we were very profitable at that time and things were going very well. A hard decision. Anyway, I agreed to do the Sunday comic book and we started discussing the deal [which] was that we'd be partners in the 'Comic Book Section,' as they called it at that time. And also, I would produce two other magazines in partnership with Arnold.}}

Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright ''The Spirit,'' but, "Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold&amp;nbsp;— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership&amp;nbsp;— Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership".&lt;ref name="ae48" /&gt; This would include the eventual backup features "[[Mr. Mystic]]" and "[[Lady Luck (comics)|Lady Luck]]".

Selling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000,&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Kitchen|Kitchen, Denis]].

"They gave me an adult audience", Eisner said in 1997, "and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'"&lt;ref&gt;Will Eisner interview, [http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/16eisner.html ''Jack Kirby Collector'' #16 (June 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Spirit'', an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features "Mr. Mystic" and "Lady Luck" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called "The Spirit Section") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, ''The Dreamer'', "About the Author", p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952.&lt;ref name=gcd1940series&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/10295/|title=GCD :: Series :: The Spirit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisner has cited the Spirit story "Gerhard Shnobble" as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/eisner-wide-open/|title=Eisner Wide Open|work=Hogan's Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and ''Joe Dope''==

[[File:PSJune1951.jpg|thumb|Premiere issue of the [[U.S. Army]] publication ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly|PS]]'' (June 1951), designed to be a "postscript" to related publications. Art by Eisner.]]
Eisner was [[military conscription|drafted]] into the [[U.S. Army]] in "late '41, early '42"&lt;ref name=tcj46p45&gt;"Will Eisner Interview", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' No. 46 (May 1979), p. 45. Interview conducted October 13 and 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and then "had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off" to fight in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=tcj46p37&gt;Eisner interview, ''The Comics Journal'' No. 46, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the camp newspaper at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], where "there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]], which involved taking a test – that way you didn't have to go through [[Officer Candidate School]]."&lt;ref name=tcj46p45 /&gt;

En route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the [[Fort Holabird|Holabird Ordnance Depot]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where a [[mimeograph]]ed publication titled ''Army Motors'' was put together. "Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance."&lt;ref name=tcj46pp45-46&gt;Eisner interview, ''The Comics Journal'' No. 46, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character ''Joe Dope'' for ''Army Motors'', and spent four years working in [[The Pentagon]] editing the [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]] magazine ''Firepower'' and doing "all the general illustrations – that is, cartoons" for ''Army Motors''. He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]'' until 1971.&lt;ref name=tcj46pp45-46 /&gt; Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called ''The M16A1 Rifle'' specifically for troops in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to help minimize the [[M-16 rifle]]'s notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_M16A1_Rifle.html?id=RyzonQEACAAJ |title=The M16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventive Maintenance |author1=[[United States Department of the Army]] |author2=Robert A. Sadowski |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |isbn=9781616088644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|url=http://journalstar.com/entertainment/arts-and-culture/books/unl-professor-s-new-book-explores-the-weird-world-of/article_f153acdc-1aa3-50cd-a0e1-edf49148e8d3.html|title=UNL professor's new book explores the weird world of government comics|date=November 5, 2011|first=Micah|last=Mertes|quote=Will Eisner should be credited for using sequences of cartoon images to teach people how to do things, rather than merely as a way to dramatize a story or illustrate text. One of the last military projects he worked on dealt with the use and care of the problematic M16 rifle. The weapon was issued in the mid-'60s to great fanfare but soon developed a reputation for unreliability. Full of double entendres, ''Operation and Preventive Maintenance The M16A1 Rifle'' is a classic example of Eisner's incredible ability to combine effectively informational/instructional design with graphic design.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on ''The Spirit''. In particular, [[letterer]] [[Abe Kanegson]] came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue.&lt;ref name="sim1"&gt;[[Dave Sim|Sim, Dave]], "My Dinner With Will &amp; Other Stories," ''Following Cerebus'' No. 4 (May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner's most trusted assistant on ''The Spirit,'' however, was [[Jules Feiffer]], later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their working methods "You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending&amp;nbsp;— I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree".&lt;ref name="sim1" /&gt;

So trusted were Eisner's assistants that Eisner allowed them to "ghost" ''The Spirit'' from the time that he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited [[Lou Fine]] and [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]], with future ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'' artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]] drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included [[Manly Wade Wellman]] and [[William Woolfolk]]. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in [[DC Comics]]' hardcover collections ''The Spirit Archives'' Vols. 5 to 11 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 – December 1944.

==Post-war comics==

On Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the ''Spirit'' stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series ''Baseball,'' ''John Law,'' ''Kewpies,'' and ''Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;'' none succeeded, but some material was recycled into ''The Spirit''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

''The Spirit'' ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers  reprinted the adventures often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.

==American Visuals Corporation==
During his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication ''Army Motors'', for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of [[preventive maintenance]] of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do ''The Spirit'' and seeing television and other post-war trends eat at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.{{sfn|Schumacher|2010}}

One of his longest-running jobs was ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]],'' a [[digest size]]d magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with [[Klaus Nordling]], [[Mike Ploog]], and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, ''[http://www.ep.tc/problems/25/index.html The M-16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventative Maintenance]'', which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the [[M16 Rifle]] during the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Schumacher|2010}}

Other clients of his Connecticut-based company included [[RCA Records]], the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[NFL]] [[American football|football]] team, and [[New York Telephone]].

==Graphic novels==
[[File:Contractwithgod.png|thumb|[[Trade paperback (comics)|Trade paperback]] edition of ''A Contract with God''; the concurrent 1,500-copy hardcover release did not use the term "graphic novel" on its cover.]]
In the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. ''[[A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly [[Jew]]s, including ''[[The Building (comics)|The Building]]'', ''A Life Force'', ''Dropsie Avenue'' and ''To the Heart of the Storm''. He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice&amp;nbsp;— once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Dave, "Advice &amp; Consent: The Editing of Graphic Novels" (panel discussion with Eisner and [[Chester Brown]]) and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] interview, both ''Following Cerebus'' No. 5 (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his last work was the retelling in [[sequential art]] of novels and [[Mythology|myth]]s, including ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. In 2002, at the age of 85, he published ''[[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]]'', based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, "The Lion of [[Mali]]". ''[[Fagin the Jew]]'' is an account of the life of Dickens' character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.

His last graphic novel, ''The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', an account of the making, and refutation, of the [[anti-semitic]] [[hoax]] ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'', was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.

In 2008, Will Eisner's ''The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel'' was published, with [[Bruce Foster]] as paper engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=Heidi|title=When the Gift is a Graphic Novel|journal=PublishersWeekly.com|date=Oct 20, 2008|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/11219-when-the-gift-is-a-graphic-novel.html|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==

In his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York City, where he published ''Will Eisner's Gallery'', a collection of work by his students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930648436|title=Will Eisner : champion of the graphic novel|last=Levitz|first=Paul|publisher=Abrams|others=|year=2015|isbn=9781613128640|location=New York|pages=|oclc=930648436}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote two books based on these lectures, ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' and ''[[Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative]]'', which are widely used by students of cartooning.
