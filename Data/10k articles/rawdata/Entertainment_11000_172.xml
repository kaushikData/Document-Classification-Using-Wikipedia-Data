'''''AirAttack''''' is a {{vgy|2010}} [[action video game]] developed and published by Slovak studio Art In Games.

==Design==
Touch Arcade notes "AirAttack departs from the traditional 2D platform of vertical shoot-em-ups and opts for a fully realistic 3D world", creating a point of difference from other similar games of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2010/07/19/air-attack-review-a-punchy-3d-shmup-spectacle/|title='Air Attack' Review -- A Punchy 3D Shmup Spectacle|date=19 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''AirAttack'' is an action video game played from top-down perspective and three-dimentional environment. At the beginning of the game, the player starts with three planes, resembling the F4U Corsair, P-38 Lightning and P-40 Tigershark. They must choose one from the three and start their fight. The latter planes also use flamethrower and fireball. A flamethrower is used to burn all types of enemies while the fireball serves the plane as deflection from crashing into another planes with swift pivotal circulation. The player's plane has a primary weapon that fires continuously at a constant velocity that can attack aerial enemies, land enemies except the train, and certain buildings. The plane is manipulated by moving it along screen, possibly using mouse, tilting the device, joypad and relative touch (manual input sensitivity). Double tapping the screen drops a bomb that can destroy land enemies and buildings in order to collect coins. Shop also appears throughout the level. Player can enter it to buy gadgets such as homing rockets, super rockets, turrets, shields, side planes, lightnings, bombs that can destroy wider area, extra lifes, cannons, and timewraps (provides [[slow motion]] technique).

''Bermudadreieck'' or ''Bermuda3Eck'' (Bermuda Triangle) is the designation for an area in the center of [[Bochum]], Germany, with a high density of bars and restaurants, bounded by (clockwise from top) the streets Südring, Brüderstraße, Kortumstraße and Viktoriastraße. The number of gastronomic establishments has increased since the beginning of the 1980s, spurred by the short distance to the [[Schauspielhaus Bochum|Bochum Theater]], [[Union Theater]] and the main train station. It is served by Engelbert-Brunnen/Bermudadreieck [[Trams in Bochum/Gelsenkirchen|U-Straßenbahn]] Station, on lines 308 &amp; 318.

== Culture and cuisine ==
There are over 60 catering establishments in the Bermuda Triangle. The area has expanded to approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km² with seating for over 8,000, including 4,200 seats outdoors. Over 3 million visitors are served per year. On sunny, summer weekends, there are often up to 30,000 visitors a day, including tourists from all across Germany. During major events, such as [[Bochum Total]], numbers can reach up to 300,000 a day.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;Günter Ermlich. [http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1543 "The Flower of the Coalfield"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023332/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1543 |date=July 16, 2011 }} ''The Atlantic Times,'' A monthly newspaper from Germany. November 2008. Accessed March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Bermuda Triangle provides about 1,600 jobs. The development of the area has privatized once-public space and turned it into beer gardens, which, although not without controversy, has been accepted by the general population.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Bermuda Triangle property rates have risen so much in recent years, that longtime retailers are increasingly forced out. The vacant spaces are then taken over by the restaurant and catering sector. Triangle prices for food and beverages are often above the local average, sometimes comparing with expensive cities like [[Düsseldorf]], [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]]. 

The heart of the Bermuda Triangle is the square around the now removed Engelbert Fountain, named after Count [[Engelbert III of the Mark]]. There is a procession each year, named the ''Maiabendfest'' (May Evening Festival). The fountain was removed in spring 2009. 

Among the major events are: 
* the multi-day "Bochum Total," the biggest music festival in Europe
* "Stühle raus ", the annual symbolic opening of the open air season.
* the ''Maiabendfest'' (May Evening Fest), a local festival steeped in tradition and legend, featuring a long procession.

The Bermuda Triangle is a cultural focal point of Bochum and a popular meeting place for people from throughout the Ruhr region. In addition to these events, it is near the [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]], a nightclub, several cinemas and the construction site of a new concert hall for the [[Bochum Symphony Orchestra]] to be erected nearby.&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;

== History ==
With a multitude of diverse catering outlets, [[:de:Logos Gruppe|Logos Gruppe]] counts among the main developers of the Bermuda3Eck since the 1980s. In the mid 90s they covered almost the whole market in the Bermuda3Eck with a broad spectrum of diverse catering concepts.
Logos Gruppe were initiators of ISG Bermuda3Eck e.V., one of the first [[Business improvement district|Business Improvement Districts]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with Logos [[Chief_Executive_Officer|CEO]] Hans-Joachim Hauschulz a member of its [[supervisory board]].

'''Billy''' is a [[puppet]] that has appeared in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]]. It was used by [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]] to communicate with his test subjects by delivering recorded messages, often appearing on a television screen or occasionally in person to describe the details of the traps and the means by which the test subjects could survive.

In the film series, before becoming the Jigsaw Killer, Kramer was believed to have created Billy to be given as a toy to his unborn child. However, Jill, his wife, is shown to miscarry after being hit in the stomach by a swinging hospital door due to Cecil ramming it open without looking. Kramer's unresolved anger was likely a primary motive for creating the puppet as a vehicle for his instructions trap victims. The traps he created can be seen as a manifestation of his anger with people who he feels don't appreciate having their life when his unborn baby was killed before having a life of its own.

Although it has never actually been identified in the films, "Billy" is the name by which it is referred to by writers, directors, and members of the cast and crew on documentaries and interviews. The name was given to it by its real-life creator [[James Wan]], who is the director and co-writer of ''Saw''. Some claim that the name is spelled "Billie", though Wan himself spells it "Billy".&lt;ref name=SawUncut&gt;Saw: Uncut special features&lt;/ref&gt;

The endurance and popularity of the ''Saw'' franchise has resulted in the production of Billy merchandise, as well as references in other media. Billy has become a type of [[mascot]] for the ''Saw'' series.

==Characteristics==
Billy appears to be a male [[ventriloquism#Ventriloquist's dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], as its jaw is movable to give the suggestion that it is talking; however, it is not used in the same manner, as the entire doll is frequently seen moving on its own. Its face is white, with a protruding brow and cheeks that have red spirals painted on them. His red lips form a grin. His eyes are black with red irises, and his head is topped with black, messy hair.

Billy is always depicted wearing a black [[tuxedo]], with a white shirt and gloves, red bow tie, and red handkerchief in the breast pocket. He also has red [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] for shoes. In the short film, he is seen wearing a green [[bowler hat]]. He is often riding an old-fashioned red [[tricycle]]. The only sound originating directly from him is a generic electronic cackle much like one would find in a [[Halloween]]-type toy.

==Construction==
According to Wan, the construction of the original puppet's face for ''[[Saw (2003 film)|Saw]]'' involved [[clay]], [[papier-mâché]], and black [[Table tennis|ping pong]] balls with the irises painted in for the eyes. Paper towel rolls were used internally.&lt;ref name=Saw1DVD&gt;Saw DVD special features&lt;/ref&gt; To make him move, the puppeteers pulled him along on a fishing line.

For ''[[Saw II]]'', Billy was redesigned with mechanical features that could be manipulated by a remote control, including his unhinged jaw and his eyes.&lt;ref name="GreggJoBlopt2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=24 August 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK?url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|archivedate=24 August 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Saw III]]'', the prop crew was given the original puppet, but found it unfit for work, as time had damaged it. Instead, they recreated Billy, using waterjet-cut foam for his body instead of fiberglass, equipped with plates to hold the puppet together and magnets to attach him to his tricycle. The back of his head was removable, to make it easier to slide animatronic pieces in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]|people=Jason Ehl (props builder)|date=2007 |time=0:32–1:41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Saw IV]]'', the prop crew again made the body of waterjet-cut foam, held together by metal rods. They used strong magnets to make a flat rear for the puppet, so it could be easily positioned on any metal surface. The resin-filled ping-pong ball eyes were moved with a remote control, as was the mouth.

==Appearances in films==

===''Saw''===
{{Main|Saw (2004 film)}}
In the first ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' movie, Billy is seen on a television set by [[Amanda Young]], telling her about the reverse bear trap that was hooked into her [[jaw]]s, and explaining that the key to remove it is in the stomach of her "dead cellmate" (who is actually a heavily sedated man) lying in the room. After she disembowels the man and frees herself, Billy comes into the room on his tricycle to congratulate her.

Later, [[List of Saw characters#Adam Faulkner|Adam]] remembers seeing the puppet in his apartment when the lights went out. As he was searching through the [[Darkroom|dark rooms]] using his camera flash, the puppet's eerie laugh rang through the apartment, and Adam hit it with a [[Baseball bat|bat]] until it stopped.

When Detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]] uncover Jigsaw's latest hideout, they snoop around the area and pull the blankets off several covered items, one of which proves to be Billy.

===''Saw II''===
{{Main|Saw II}}
In ''[[Saw II]]'', Billy is seen on the screen at the beginning of the film, giving [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael]] hints about the death mask he is wearing. It plays out similarly to Amanda's test, except Michael dies.

Later, when the detectives discover Jigsaw's new hideout, several officers walk up a caged [[Stairs|staircase]] and are greeted by Billy, who wheels into sight at the top of the stairs on his tricycle and laughs. The cage then becomes electrified after one officer steps on a rigged stair that breaks his legs.{{Clear}}

===''Saw III''===
{{Main|Saw III}}
In ''[[Saw III]]'', Jigsaw is seen constructing Billy in a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] for the purpose of Amanda's game, painting the puppet's face. Later, Billy appears on videotape to inform both [[List of Saw characters#Troy|Troy]] and [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Kerry]] of their respective traps. The puppet is also seen in the background of a flashback that features Jigsaw and Amanda discussing her loyalty.

He is also used to remind [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]] of his dead son at one point, by being laid down next to his [[tricycle]] in the same position Jeff's son was in when he was killed. The puppet gives a mocking laugh until Jeff beats it into silence.

After Jeff cuts Jigsaw's throat, a reflection of Billy can be seen on Jigsaw's heart rate monitor for a split second.
{{Clear}}

===''Saw IV''===
{{Main|Saw IV}}
Billy is first seen in ''[[Saw IV]]'' when [[List of Saw characters#Rigg|Rigg]] awakes after being attacked in his apartment and rendered [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Rigg opens his bathroom door, pulling a trigger-wire from a TV set. Billy appears on the screen to explain Rigg's game. Upon leaving the room, Rigg is greeted by another message concerning his first test, referring to [[List of Saw characters#Brenda|a woman]] Jigsaw deemed to be a criminal that had been placed in a machine that would scalp her.

Agents [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] and [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] later find Billy in a room in a school, sitting on a chair surrounded by [[candle]]s. From a microcassette recorder hung around the puppet's neck, Perez learns that her partner will soon take the life of an innocent man (who is later revealed to be [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]]), and that her next move is critical. Billy's eyes begin turning to Perez while a low voice on the tape murmurs, "Open the door." Perez leans in to hear this last, at which point Billy's face explodes, blowing [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] into her face and neck. Perez collapses into Strahm's arms as Billy begins to laugh.

There is also a flashback of Jigsaw giving a less menacing, early version of Billy to [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] as a gift for their unborn son Gideon. An interview with [[Tobin Bell]] revealed that this was the beginning of a storyline concerning the origins of Billy, as well as his tricycle, to be explored in future ''Saw'' films.&lt;ref name=SawVBilly&gt;{{cite web |author=Topel, Fred|title=Tobin Bell Previews Saw V Surprises |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw_4/news/1686930/tobin_bell_previews_saw_v_surprises |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher= |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saw V''===
{{Main|Saw V}}
Billy appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[Saw V]]'', to tell [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]] the rules of his game, which is later revealed to have been set up by [[Mark Hoffman]] to frame Jigsaw and kill Seth. It is unknown how Hoffman created the tape for this game. According to a list of potential Jigsaw victims, Seth was the third person tested after Cecil and Mark. In those tests, Jigsaw didn't use a puppet.

Billy is also seen at the beginning of all of the team's traps.

The early version of Billy from a ''Saw IV'' flashback is seen in the background of a flashback explaining the connection between Jigsaw and Hoffman.

===''Saw VI''===
{{Main|Saw VI}}
In ''[[Saw VI]]'', Billy appears on tape in the opening trap, which pits [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]] and [[List of Saw characters#Eddie|Eddie]] against each other. He also addresses [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] during two of his four tests (Jigsaw himself addresses William via video in his first test). He appears "in person" in William's second test by way of hanging from a noose, and on video in the fourth. ''Saw VI'' marks the first time Billy was purposefully shown in person to deliver test information to victims. Snippets of the Seth Baxter tape which Billy is featured in are also played.

===''Saw 3D''===
{{Main|Saw 3D}}
Billy appears in ''[[Saw 3D]]''. He gives [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Brad and Ryan]] instructions to their trap in person, does the same for Bobby Dagen's second test, and appears on tape for the others. When Hoffman goes to his hideout after he escapes the Reverse Beartrap, multiple Billy heads can be seen. His final appearance is in Hoffman's secret hideout at the end of the film; Hoffman blows it up, destroying Billy in the explosion. Billy's voice is changed, as if Jigsaw is using a voice changer, implying that it was Hoffman who recorded the tapes.

===''Jigsaw'' ===
{{Main|Jigsaw (2017 film)|}}
Billy returns for the eighth Saw film titled "Jigsaw". He was first shown in the official trailer on his iconic tricycle. He is shown this time with illuminated eyes and shoes. In the film, he only appears twice. He appears once on his tricycle with a letter around his neck with the word "Confess" written on it. The second time is on tape with his eyes lit up for the grain silo trap.

== Non-canon film appearances ==

===''Saw 0.5''===
{{Main|Saw (2003 film)}}
In the Original Saw short film, Billy is seen on a television set by David, telling him about the reverse bear trap that was hooked into his [[jaw]]s, and explaining that the key to remove it is in the stomach of his "dead cellmate" (who is actually a heavily sedated man) lying in the room. After he disembowels the man and frees himself, Billy comes into the room on his tricycle to congratulate him.

===''Dead Silence''===
{{Main|Dead Silence}}
In the 2007 film ''[[Dead Silence]]'', one of the puppets, who appears on the film's poster and wears the same outfit as Jigsaw's puppet, is named Billy.

===''Death Sentence''===
{{Main|Death Sentence (2007 film)}}
A [[graffiti]]-style painting of Billy's face can be seen on a wall in James Wan's film [[Death Sentence (2007 film)|''Death Sentence'']].

===''Insidious''===
{{Main|Insidious (film)}}
In the 2011 film ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' there is a scene in which Josh (the father) is working late in the classroom and Billy is drawn in chalk on the blackboard behind his head. Underneath the drawing the number eight is shown, hinting at Jigsaw.

===''Scary Movie 4''===
{{Main|Scary Movie 4}}
Billy the Puppet makes a cameo appearance as the parody antagonist.

===''Upgrade''===
{{Main|Upgrade (film)}}
A [[graffiti]]-style painting of Billy's face can be seen on a wall in [[Leigh Whannell]]'s film [[Upgrade (film)|''Upgrade'']].

==Other media==
{{See also|List of Saw media|l1=Saw in other media}}

===Comic===
Billy can be seen in the corners of two panels near the beginning of ''[[List of Saw media#Saw: Rebirth|Saw: Rebirth]]'', foreshadowing John's eventual transformation into Jigsaw. The comic also appears to mark Billy as one of John's creations at the toy factory where he worked, but this backstory was negated in ''Saw IV''.

===Video games===
Billy, voiced by Tobin Bell, appears throughout [[Saw (video game)|''Saw: The Video Game'']] delivering hints and objectives to the player. He also featured prominently in marketing for the game. In the Freedom ending, Billy's reflection is seen on a T.V. when [[David Tapp|Tapp]] commits suicide.

He returns in ''[[Saw II: Flesh &amp; Blood]]'', the sequel to the first game, also voiced by Tobin Bell. Billy repeats his role as in the first game, giving hints and clues to the player. The player can also collect small Billy dolls throughout the game, which require solving more complicated puzzles to obtain them; they are off of the main path, so the player does not have to get them. ''Flesh &amp; Blood'' is also the only time in the ''Saw'' franchise that he is actually called "Billy."

Dead By Daylight: Chapter VII the SAW chapter.
Billy is in the video game 'Dead by Daylight' as a NPC as part of the SAW chapter DLC.
He appears when the player chooses 'the Pig' a licenced character from Saw. He is also seen in the map 'The Game, gideon's meatplant,'

===Amusement park appearances===
'''Saw [[Saw – The Ride|–]] The Ride'''
{{Main|Saw – The Ride}}
Billy appears on numerous screens throughout the queue line of [[Saw – The Ride]] at [[Thorpe Park]], England telling riders that they are not worthy of the life they have been given,  implicating the ride to be one of Jigsaw's traps. He also appears on his tricycle at the start of the ride itself, riders on the second dispatched car (two cars are dispatched one after the other), the vehicle will stop while Billy gives a speech, informing you that there is no escape, and proclaiming, "Here's what happens when you lose", before allowing the train to pass – this regulates the distance between cars. He can also be seen before the car travels up the lift hill, appearing on a screen and saying "GAME OVER", and at the end of the ride, where his head can be seen on a shelf covered with body parts.

'''Saw - The Maze'''

The Saw Alive maze, also in Thorpe Park, allows parkgoers to be photographed with Billy.

'''Saw: Game Over'''

In the U.S., Billy appears several times in the maze Saw: Game Over at [[Halloween Horror Nights|Orlando Horror Nights]] at Universal Studios Florida.

'''[[Brunei]]''', as ''Brunei Darussalam'', first participated at the '''[[Olympic Games]]''' in 1988, with a single official but no athletes. The nation returned and sent athletes to compete in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in 1996, 2000 and 2004. On each occasion, it was represented by a single athlete.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/summer-olympics/2012/9939-qatar-set-to-bow-to-ioc-pressure-and-send-women-to-london-2012 "Qatar decision to send female athletes to London 2012 increases pressure on Saudi Arabia"], Inside the Games, July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei has never participated in the [[Winter Olympic Games]], and has never won an Olympic medal.

In the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], Brunei originally planned to participate, but was expelled on the day of the opening ceremony after failing to register any athletes with the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamusa.org/News/2008/August/08/Brunei-expelled-from-Olympics-opening-ceremony Brunei expelled from Olympics opening ceremony.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010 Brunei was, along with [[Saudi Arabia at the Olympics|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar at the Olympics|Qatar]], one of only three countries to never have sent a female athlete to the [[Olympic Games]], despite only having a total of four Olympians beforehand. The [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2010 announced it would "press" these countries to allow and facilitate women's participation, and shortly thereafter the [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] announced that it "hoped to send up to four female athletes in [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics|shooting]] and [[Fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|fencing]]" to the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Games]] in London.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/inside-lines-protests-at-2012-if-saudis-say-no-girls-allowed-2017852.html "Inside Lines: Protests at 2012 if Saudis say 'no girls allowed'"], ''[[The Independent]]'', July 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|inaugural Youth Olympics in 2010]], for which mixed teams were a requirement, Brunei's three-person delegation did include two girls (Amanda Jia Xin Liew in swimming and [[Maziah Mahusin]] in hurdling).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jo2012.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/03/14/saoudiennes-qataries-et-bruneiennes-enfin-aux-jo/ "Saoudiennes, Qataries et Bruneiennes enfin aux JO ?"], ''Le Monde'', 14 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Brunei informed the IOC that it intended for [[Maziah Mahusin]] to compete at the London Games. Although Mahusin was unlikely to meet the qualifying standards for the Games, she would be able to compete thanks to the Olympics' principle of universality, which states that "[[National Olympic Committee|NOCs]] have the possibility of entering unqualified athletes in athletics and swimming should they not have athletes qualified in these sports".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/saudi-arabia-may-include-women-on-its-olympic-team/?ref=olympics "Brunei to Send Its First Female Athlete to the Olympics"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 21 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/2012OG/3.Tripartite_Commission_Invitations.pdf "Games of the XXX Olympiad, London 2012 Tripartite Commission: Invitation Places: Information Paper for NOCs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817092305/http://www.ittf.com/World_Events/2012OG/3.Tripartite_Commission_Invitations.pdf |date=2012-08-17 }}, International Olympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Olympic Committee]] for Brunei was created in 1984 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">There have been two '''[[Channel 4]] Banned seasons'''. The first aired in April 1991 over three weeks and saw the broadcast of a number of films and documentaries which had previously been banned from British television or cinema. The second was in 2004/2005 and consisted of a series of documentaries concerning the history of explicit and controversial material on British television.

==1991 Banned season==

''Banned'' was a series of programmes shown over a three-week period in April 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/learning/microsites/W/wtc4/history/c4timeline.jsp|title= Channel 4 timeline|publisher= Channel 4|accessdate= 30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the season was conceived as a statement about the censorship of broadcasting at the time. The season included network television showings of ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]'' (which was edited to remove some of the violent gang rape scene and the subsequent graphic suicide of the victim), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (which was preceded by a warning that viewers may find the film's treatment of religious themes upsetting), the controversial documentary feature ''[[The Animals Film]]'' and [[Derek Jarman]]'s ''[[Sebastiane]]'' and ''[[Jubilee (1977 film)|Jubilee]]''. There was also a second broadcast of the controversial 1988 [[Thames Television]] documentary ''[[Death on the Rock]]'' which investigated [[Operation Flavius|the shooting]] of three members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] by the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] in [[Gibraltar]]. The season proved to be controversial and Channel 4 was investigated by the [[Obscene Publications Squad]] and referred to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/c4/1991.htm |title=Channel 4 At 25: 1991 compiled by Steve Williams, Ian Jones and Jack Kibble-White |accessdate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918234351/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/c4/1991.htm |archivedate=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cinema of Thailand''' dates back to the [[History of film|early days of filmmaking]], when [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]]'s 1897 visit to [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] was recorded by François-Henri Lavancy-Clarke. The film was then brought to [[Bangkok]], where it was exhibited. This sparked more interest in film by the  [[Thai Royal Family]] and local businessmen, who brought in filmmaking equipment and started to exhibit foreign films. By the 1920s, a local film industry was started and in the 1930s, the [[Thailand|Thai]] film industry had its first "golden age", with a number of studios producing films.

The years after the [[Second World War]] saw a resurgence of the industry, which used [[16 mm film]] to produce hundreds of films, many of them hard-driving action films. Competition from [[Hollywood]] brought the Thai industry to a low point in the 1980s and 1990s, but by the end of the 1990s, Thailand had its "new wave", with such directors as [[Nonzee Nimibutr]], [[Pen-Ek Ratanaruang]] and [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], as well as action hero [[Tony Jaa]], being celebrated at film festivals around the world.

== History ==

===The first Thai films===
[[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] had a film exhibition that toured in [[Southeast Asia]] in 1894, and on 9 June 1897, "the wonderful Parisian cinematograph" was screened in [[Bangkok]], and is the first known film screening in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Anchalee Chaiworaporn, [http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=34 The Birth of Film Screening in Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101020000/http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=34 |date=2007-11-01 }}, Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the film of the visit to Europe by King [[Chulalongkorn]] was brought back to Thailand, along with camera equipment acquired by the king's brother, Prince Thongthaem Sambassatra. ({{lang-th|พระองค์เจ้าทองแถมถวัลยวงศ์ กรมหลวงสรรพสาตรศุภกิจ}}) The prince, considered "the father of Thai cinema", made many films and his work was shown commercially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=56 Prince Sanbassart (Prince Thongthamthawanwong) - The Father of Thai Filmmaking.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101020028/http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=56 |date=2007-11-01 }}, Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese businessmen opened the first permanent cinema, the Japanese Cinematograph, in 1905. Japanese films were so popular that ''nang yipun'' became the generic term for all moving pictures. European and American films were called ''nang [[farang]]'' (after the [[nang drama]] ([[shadow puppet]] plays) that were a Thai traditional art).&lt;ref&gt;{{Th icon}} [http://www.rimpingfunds.com/writing/ThaiMovie/movie.htm History of Thai film (ประวัติภาพยนตร์ไทย)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142624/http://www.rimpingfunds.com/writing/ThaiMovie/movie.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} ,Rimping foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Under another member of the royal family, [[Purachatra Jayakara|Prince Kamphangphet]], the Topical Film Service of the [[State Railway of Thailand]] was set up. The service produced many promotional documentaries for the railroad and other government agencies and became an important training ground for many filmmakers.&lt;ref name="SEAPAVV"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edmondson |first=Ray |title=East of the Sun, West of Moon: A Region in Memory |work=Introductory essay for the “Memory of the World” film series, as published in the catalogue of the Giornate del Cinema Muto, Sacile, Italy |publisher=South East Asia Pacific Audio Visual Archive |date=September 2003 |url=http://www.archival.com.au/pdfsr/East%20of%20the%20sun,%20west%20of%20the%20moon.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829024551/http://archival.com.au/pdfsr/East%20of%20the%20sun%2C%20west%20of%20the%20moon.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-29 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the early works produced was
''Sam Poi Luang: Great Celebration in the North'' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]]: สามปอยหลวง), a docudrama that became a hit when it was released in 1940.&lt;ref name="rise of"&gt;{{Th icon}} [http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=9 The rise of Thai cinemas (ความรุ่งโรจน์ ของอุตสาหกรรมภาพยนตร์ยุคบุคเบิก)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092920/http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=9 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the first Thai films was ''Nang Sao Suwan'', or ''[[Miss Suwanna of Siam]]'', a [[Hollywood]] co-production with the Topical Film Service that was directed and scripted by [[Henry MacRae]]. It premiered on 22 June 1923, in Bangkok at the Phathanakorn Cinematograph. Unfortunately, ''Miss Suwanna'' has been lost over the years, with only a few still photos from it remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Kong Rithdee, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060628100841/http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=79 Historical inspiration] Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The first all-Thai feature was ''Chok Sorng Chan'' (''Double Luck''), produced by the Wasuwat brothers' Bangkok Film Company in 1927 and directed by [[Manit Wasuwat]] ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]]: มานิต วสุวัต). That same year, a film company, Tai Phapphayon Thai Company, produced ''Mai Khit Loei'' (''Unexpected'').&lt;ref name="rise of"/&gt;

Seventeen films were made between 1927 and 1932, but only fragments have survived, such as a one-minute car chase from ''Chok Song Chan''&lt;ref&gt;The one-minute fragment was exhibited in 2006 in Paris during the "Tout a Fait Thai 2006: The Thai Culture Festival in France" (Rithdee, Kong. October 13, 2006. [http://www.bangkokpost.com/131006_Realtime/13Oct2006_real002.php "Screen test"], ''Bangkok Post'', Real Time, Page R1.&lt;/ref&gt; or a two- to three-minute boxing match from ''Khrai Di Khrai Dai'' (''None But the Brave'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Th icon}} [http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=43 Manit Wasuwat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031191952/http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=43 |date=2007-10-31 }} ,Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood would also make movies in Siam during this time, including the [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Chang (film)|Chang]]'', by [[Merian C. Cooper]] and [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]], about a poor farmer struggling to carve out a living in the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Anderson, [http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/classic/chang.shtml Chang (1927)]&lt;/ref&gt; In making the film, they were assisted by Prince [[Yugala Dighambara]], grandfather of modern-day filmmaker Prince [[Chatrichalerm Yukol]].

Robert Kerr, who served as assistant director to Henry MacRae on ''Miss Suwanna'' returned to Siam in 1928 to direct his own film, ''The White Rose''. It was shown in Bangkok in September 1928.

===The Golden Age===
By 1928, the first "[[talkies]]" were being imported, providing some heavy competition for the [[Silent films|silent]] Thai films. In the tradition of the [[benshi]] in Japan, local cinemas had entertaining narrators to introduce the films as well as traditional Thai orchestras that were often as big an audience pleaser as the films themselves, and but within two or three years, silent movies had given way to the talkies.

The first Thai sound film was ''Long Thang'' (''Gone Astray''), produced by the Wasuwat brothers, and premiered on 1 April 1932. Considered an ideological film in the period of political reform, the film proved a big success and led to the building of the Sri Krung Talkie Film Company in [[Bang Kapi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Th icon}} [http://www.thainationalfilm.com/thai/24000/241film_his_part4.html History of Thai films part 4] ,Thainationalfilm.com&lt;/ref&gt; It produced three to four films a year.

In 1933, Sri Krung made the first colour Thai film, ''Grandpa Som's Treasure'' (''Pu Som Fao Sap'').

This period up until 1942 is regarded by scholars as the "Golden Age" for Thai film.

Among the hit films of this period was the 1938 [[musical film|musical]], ''Klua Mia'' (''Wife-phobia'') by the Srikrung studio. It was shot on [[35 mm film|35-mm]] colour stock. The stars were Chamras Suwakhon and Manee Sumonnat, the first Thai actors to be recognized as movie stars by having their names painted on their chairs while filming at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Natee, Kritya (translator) and Himes, Robert (editor). January 1, 2004. [http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=55 "Manee Sumonnaj (The Shining Star)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001017/http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=55 |date=2007-09-27 }}, Thai Film Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Second World War]] loomed, and the country being led by a [[dictatorship]] under Field Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] film companies were pressed into service to make [[propaganda]] films to whip up [[nationalism]].

Opposition politics found their way into film, too, with statesman [[Pridi Phanomyong]] producing ''[[King of the White Elephant]]'', in 1940. With all the dialogue in [[English language|English]], Pridi hoped to send a message to the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking. The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked.

===Film dubbing===
The advent of sound raised another problem for cinemas in Thailand: the language of the talkies. Soon a [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] method developed in which a dubber would provide a simultaneous translation of the dialogue by speaking [[Thai language|Thai]] into a microphone at the back of the theater. The first Thai dubber was Sin Sibunruang, or "Tit Khiaw", who had worked for Siam Film Company and was the editor of the company's film magazine. Tit Khiaw and other talented dubbers became stars in their own right. They would perform all the roles in the films, both male and female, as well as such sound effects as animal noises, cars and gunfire.

Also, there were film companies that could not afford to make sound films, and would make films with the intention that they would be dubbed at screenings by live performers reading from a script. These dubbed films proved as popular as the talkies, especially if the dubber was well known.

Due to the extensive use of [[16 mm]] film in the 1970s, the technique has lasted up until recent years, especially for [[outdoor cinema|outdoor screenings]] of films at temple fairs in rural areas. Examples of a dubber at work can be seen in contemporary Thai films, ''[[Monrak Transistor]]'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]) and ''[[Bangkok Loco]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]).

===Post-war years: The 16-mm era===
After the end of the Second World War, filmmaking got under way again in Thailand using surplus [[16 mm]] black-and-white stock from wartime [[newsreel]] production.

At least two Thai films were produced in 1946. One was an [[action film]], ''Chai Chatree'' (''Brave Men''), directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker Chalerm Sawetanant. The screenplay was by writer Malai Chupinij, who would go on to script other films of the era, including ''Chao Fah Din Salai'' (''Till Death Do Us Part''). The other film noted by the National Film Archive for 1946 was an adaptation of a [[Thai folklore|Thai folktale]], ''Chon Kawao'' (''The Village of Chon Kawao'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/030806_Outlook/03Aug2006_out003.php "Good old days: Thai cinema has a long history"], ''Bangkok Post'' retrieved August 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war boom in filmmaking really took off, however, with the use of 16-mm colour-reversal film, which was easy to obtain and make films with. The vividly coloured films were popular with audiences as well, prompting dozens of new filmmakers to enter the business.&lt;ref name="16-mm era"&gt;{{Th icon}}[http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=10 Thai films in 16-mm era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091744/http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail.asp?id=10 |date=2007-09-29 }} ,Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] of films during the pre-war years, some of these films used dubbers to provide dialogue and sound effects as the film was running, further adding to the entertainment value of the movies. From 1947 until 1972, 16&amp;nbsp;mm was the industry standard for Thai film production.&lt;ref name="16-mm era"/&gt;

The first hit of the era was 1949's ''Suparb Burut Sua Thai'' (''Thai Gentlemen Fighters''), which outgrossed [[Hollywood]] films at the local box office. That success prompted more enthusiasm for filmmaking, giving rise to the second "golden age" of Thai cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Th icon}}[http://www.thainationalfilm.com/thai/24000/241film_his_part10.html History of Thai films part 10] ,Thainationalfilm.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move toward 35 mm===
At the height of the 16-mm era, cinematographer and director [[Rattana Pestonji]] sought to use [[35 mm]] film and generally improve the artistic quality of Thai films. Most of his films are regarded today as masterpieces, including ''[[Santi-Veena (1954 film)|Santi-Weena]]'', which was the first Thai film to be entered into international competition, at the 1954 [[Asia Pacific Film Festival]] in [[Tokyo]], and 1961's ''[[Black Silk]]'', the first Thai film in competition at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

Though Rattana made relatively few films, he worked tirelessly to promote the industry, and died in 1970 as he was to make a speech to government officials about setting up a national film agency.

===The 1970s and '80s===
Thailand saw an explosion of locally produced films during the 1970s after the Thai government imposed a heavy tax on imported films in 1977, which led to a boycott of Thailand by Hollywood studios. To pick up the slack, 150 Thai films were made in 1978 alone. Many of these films were low-grade action films and were derided by critics and scholars as "nam nao" or "stinking water".

But socially conscious films were being made as well, especially by Prince [[Chatrichalerm Yukol]], a US-educated filmmaker and member of the [[Thai Royal Family]], whose own family had been involved with filmmaking since the industry started in Thailand. Among Chatrichalerm's films during the 1970s was ''Khao Chue Karn'' (''Dr. Karn''), which addressed corruption in the Thai [[civil service]] and was nearly banned by the military-dominated regime of [[Thanom Kittikachorn]]. Chatrichalerm also made ''Hotel Angel'' (''Thep Thida Rong Raem''), about a young woman trapped into a life of [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution]]. He made dozens of films along these socially conscious lines through the 1990s, working up to his lavish historical epic, ''[[The Legend of Suriyothai]]'' in [[2001 in film|2001]].

Another filmmaker active during this time was [[Vichit Kounavudhi]], who made his share of action films as well as more socially conscious works like ''First Wife'', about the custom of men taking "second wives" or "mia noi" – a [[euphemism]] for [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Vichit also made ''Her Name is Boonrawd'' (1985), about [[prostitution]] around an [[American military]] [[U-Tapao International Airport|airbase]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Vichit's best known works are two semi-documentary films, ''Mountain People'' (''Khon Phukao''), an adventure tale about a young [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill-tribe]] couple, and ''Look Isan'' (''Son of the Northeast''), about a family of subsistence farmers in 1930s [[Isan]].

Also in 1985, director [[Euthana Mukdasanit]] made ''[[Pee Seua lae Dawkmai]]'' (''[[Butterfly and Flowers]]''), highlighting hardships along the [[Southern Thailand]] border. Not only did the film help expose urban Thais to regional poverty, the film broke new ground in its portrayal of a [[Buddhist]]-[[Muslim]] relationship. It won the Best Film award at the [[Hawaii International Film Festival]].

===The Thai New Wave===
By 1981, Hollywood studios were once again sending films to Thailand. Also, [[television]] (see also [[Media in Thailand]]) was a growing part of Thai culture. This was a low period for the Thai film industry, and by the mid-1990s, studio output was averaging about 10 films per year.&lt;ref name="sustainable"&gt;Robert Williamson, [http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=69 Thai cinema: sustainable development or imminent decline?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110448/http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=69 |date=2007-09-29 }} ,Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997, three directors of [[television commercials]] – [[Nonzee Nimibutr]], [[Pen-Ek Ratanaruang]] and [[Wisit Sasanatieng]] – were thinking that films needed to be more artistic to attract investors and audiences.

The first breakthrough was in 1997, with Nonzee's crime drama, ''[[Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters]]'' (''2499 Antapan Krong Muang''), which earned a record box office take of more than 75 million baht. Also in 1997, Pen-Ek's crime comedy, ''[[Fun Bar Karaoke]]'', was selected to play at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] – the first time in twenty years that Thai cinema had had any kind of an international presence.&lt;ref name="sustainable"/&gt;

Nonzee's next film, the ghost story ''[[Nang Nak]]'', was an even bigger success, earning 149.6 million [[baht]] – the highest-grossing film at the time.

Wisit, who wrote screenplays for ''Dang Bireley's'' and ''Nang Nak'', broke out with ''[[Tears of the Black Tiger]]'', a super-stylised [[western (genre)|western]] homage to the Thai action films of the 1960s and '70s. It was the first film to be included on the programme at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

There were also the [[The Pang Brothers|Pang Brothers]] from [[Hong Kong]], who came to Thailand to make stylish movies, starting with ''[[Bangkok Dangerous (1999 film)|Bangkok Dangerous]]'' and the nod to [[J-Horror]], ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]''.

===Thai independent film===
With the [[Thai New Wave|New Wave]] directors achieving commercial and artistic success, a new crop of filmmakers has grown up outside the traditional and often restrictive Thai studio system to create experimental short films and features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= No retreat, no surrender|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/08/entertainment/ca-hsu8|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of this indie movement is [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], whose [[2002 in film|2002]] feature ''[[Blissfully Yours]]'' won the [[Un Certain Regard Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Featuring a risqué sex scene involving a [[Bamar|Burmese]] man and a [[Thai people|Thai]] woman in the jungle, the movie received only limited screenings in Thailand and a Thai-released [[DVD]] of the film was censored. Apichatpong's next film, ''[[Tropical Malady]]'', featuring a gay romance between an army soldier and a country guy, was a jury-prize winner at Cannes. It, too, only received limited screenings in Thailand.

Other indie directors include [[Aditya Assarat]] (''Wonderful Town''), [[Anocha Suwichakornpong]] (''Mundane History''), [[Pimpaka Towira]] (''[[One Night Husband]]''), [[Thunska Pansittivorakul]] (''Voodoo Girls''), [[Sivaroj Kongsakul]] (''Eternity''), [[Wichanon Somumjarn]] (''In April the Following Year, There Was a Fire'') and [[Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit]] (''36'').

==Censorship==
{{Main|Censorship in Thailand}}
{{See also|Motion picture ratings system#Thailand|l1=Motion picture ratings system in Thailand}}
All films, [[VCD]]s and DVDs are placed under scrutiny of a censorship board. Until 2009, films were regulated by the Film Act of 1930.

The first board of [[Censorship|censor]]s included both men and women and was drawn from the ranks of aristocracy, the civil service and the police. Each film passed by the censors had to include a stamp on each reel, and each item of printed advertising had to contain the stamp, too. The National Police was responsible for screening films and videos until September 2005, when the government's Ministry of Culture took over the function. Every VCD and DVD sold for home viewing must bear a stamp that it has passed the Censorship Board.

On some VCDs and DVDs produced in Thailand, the censors sometimes take a hard line against depictions of [[nudity]], [[sex]], [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], the presence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[guns]] being pointed at people, images that are forbidden on broadcast television. In other instances, violent acts might pass through uncut, but sex and nudity will be edited out.

Before the [[Digital data|digital]] age, scissors and [[petroleum jelly]] were the tools of the trade for censors. Today the offending images are blurred out electronically. The effect of [[pixelization]] is so pervasive that the practice has been satirised in films, including [[2004 in film|2004]]'s action comedy, ''[[Jaew]]'' or ''[[M.A.I.D.]]'', as well as the [[zombie]] comedy, ''[[SARS Wars]]''.

Imported DVDs are generally not altered by the Thai authorities, though the Ministry of Culture's watchdogs do ban items, or at least strongly encourage retailers to not carry them. From the time the Ministry of Culture took over the censorship board until March 2006, about 40 VCD or DVD titles were banned, though a list of the banned items was not made available.&lt;ref&gt;Wattanasukchai, Sirinya (January 6, 2006) [http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000001710 "Not in my house"], ''ThaiDay''. Retrieved March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the independent film, ''[[Syndromes and a Century]]'' was to undergo cuts before public release in Thailand. The censors objected to depictions of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk playing guitar, a physician kissing his girlfriend, some doctors drinking whisky in a hospital conference room and some monks playing with a remote-control flying saucer. Director [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]] would not make the cuts and withdrew his film from release in Thailand. It had previously screened in other countries uncut.&lt;ref&gt;Rithdee, Kong.

After the controversy over ''Syndromes and a Century'', the Free Thai Cinema Movement started to gain momentum in late April 2007. A petition signed by artists and scholars was submitted to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly]], which was considering a new [[Motion picture rating system#Thailand|motion picture ratings system]]. The proposed system, passed by the [[Council for National Security|military]]-appointed [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly]] proved controversial as well, as it would not imposes ratings structure but also keeps censorship in place.&lt;ref&gt;Rithdee, Kong. December 20, 2007. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117978081.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 Thailand passes controversial film act], ''Variety (magazine)''; retrieved 2007-12-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930 Film Act was replaced in 2009 by a film-ratings system. The ratings system has six classifications – G for general audiences, P for "promote" as educational, 13+, 15+ and 18+ suggested viewing ages and the restricted 20- rating, which requires ID checks at the cinemas. A hidden seventh tier of the system is an outright ban by the Film and Video sub-committee.&lt;ref&gt;Jaichalard, Pakamard.

==Genres==
===Action===
Action films are a predominant genre of Thai film. During the 1960s and '70s, when [[Mitr Chaibancha]] and [[Sombat Metanee]] were the leading action heroes, hundreds of hard-hitting, explosive features were made.

In recent years, the [[martial arts films]] starring [[Tony Jaa]], ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'' and ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong]]'', have put Thai action films on the international map. ''[[Kerd ma lui]]'' (''Born to Fight'') is in the same vein, and gives more exposure to action choreographer [[Panna Rittikrai]], who toiled for decades making low-budget, [[direct-to-video]] action films featuring dangerous stunt choreography.

The culture of Thailand's B-movie stuntmen is further examined in the 2005 documentary, ''[[Crying Tigers]]'', by [[Santi Taepanich]].

Action comedies have also proven to be popular, including 2001's ''[[Killer Tattoo]]'' by [[Yuthlert Sippapak]], who cast well-known Thai comedians, including [[Petchtai Wongkamlao]] and [[Suthep Po-ngam]], in roles as bumbling hitmen.

===Animation===
{{Main|Thai animation}}
Thai animation got underway after the [[Second World War]], when artist [[Sanae Klaikluen]] was asked by the Thai government to make a short [[animated cartoon]] that instructed Thai citizens to wear hats and farmers to wear boots.

Sanae in turn influenced [[Payut Ngaokrachang]], who made a 1955 short about a traffic cop called ''Haed Mahasajan''. Payut went on to make Thailand's first and only cel-animated feature film, ''[[The Adventure of Sudsakorn]]'', in 1979.

Because of the labour-intensive work involved with animation, it was cheaper for studios to make live-action films, so animation was eschewed. But in recent years, Thailand's technology community has sought to make the country a hub for [[computer animation]], with many animated television shows, commercials and video games being created in Thailand.

In 2006, Thailand's first computer-animated feature film was released, ''[[Khan Khluay]]'', about [[Naresuan|King Naresuan the Great]]'s war elephant. It is directed by [[Kompin Kemgunerd]], on such [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] features as ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' and [[Blue Sky Studios]]' ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]''. Although the work is being done on computers, Kompin has faced many of the same difficulties in funding and human resources that Payut faced.

===Comedies===
No matter what the genre of Thai film, most films &amp;ndash; be they action, horror or romantic dramas &amp;ndash; have some element of comedy.

One of the classic comedies from the 1960s is called ''[[Ngern Ngern Ngern]]'' (''Money, Money, Money''). It starred [[Mitr Chaibancha]] and [[Petchara Chaowarat]] in a story about the nephew of an unscrupulous moneylender who takes sides with a group of debtors against his uncle. The remake of the film was done in the 1980s.

In 2005, the comedy ''[[Luang phii theng]]'' (''The Holy Man'') starring comedian [[Pongsak Pongsuwan]] as a street hood who poses as a [[Buddhist]] monk, was one of the top films at the domestic box office.

===Crime===
Most of the films by [[Pen-Ek Ratanaruang]] have been [[crime film]]s, from his debut feature 1997's ''[[Fun Bar Karaoke]]'' to 2006's ''[[Invisible Waves]]''.

A true-crime film, 2003's ''[[Macabre Case of Prom Pirom]]'' (''Keunbab prompiram'') by veteran director [[Manop Udomdej]], about a 1977 murder-rape of a young woman in a rural village was controversial because the village where the case took place did not want the incident revisited. The film played at many overseas festivals, including the [[New York Asian Film Festival]].

Another true-crime case about a cannibalistic serial killer in 1946 [[Bangkok]] was depicted in the 2004 film ''[[Zee-Oui]]''.

===Gay films===
[[Kathoey]] ([[transsexual]]/[[transvestite]]) or gays are often featured as [[comic relief]] or [[villain]]s in mainstream Thai films, but there have been a number of films that make gays and kathoey the main characters. Transvestites and gays are also known as "tdoot", originated from the title of the 1982 American film ''[[Tootsie]]''.
One of the first was [[Youngyooth Thongkonthun]]'s ''[[The Iron Ladies (film)|Iron Ladies]]'', or ''Satree lek'', based on a true story about a transsexual/transvestite [[gay]] men's volleyball team that won a national championship in 1996. It was a huge hit on the international festival circuit. The 2000 comedy spawned a sequel in 2003, ''[[The Iron Ladies 2 (film)|The Iron Ladies 2]]'' ''(Satree lek 2)''.
More loosely based on a true incident was the 2002 film ''[[Saving Private Tootsie]]'', which tells the story of a group of gay and kathoey entertainers who are lost in rebel-held jungle territory after their plane crashes. A squad from the Thai army, led by a gruff, homophobic sergeant played by veteran actor [[Sorapong Chatree]], goes to the rescue.
And the life of [[transgender]] [[Muay Thai]] champion [[Parinya Kiatbusaba]] (or Nong Tum) is related in 2003's ''[[Beautiful Boxer]]'', directed by [[Ekachai Uekorngtham]]. Unlike ''The Iron Ladies'', ''Beautiful Boxer'' was less comedic in tone.
The 2003 film ''[[Tropical Malady]]'', directed by [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], depicts a romance between a Thai army soldier and a local small-town boy. The narrative of the film then abruptly shifts in the middle to relate a [[Folklore|folk tale]] about a tiger [[shaman]], with the soldier alone in the jungle, haunted by the tiger-shaman's spirit. The film won a jury prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].
Apichatpong also co-directed the low-budget digital movie, ''[[The Adventure of Iron Pussy]]'', with artist [[Michael Shaowanasai]], who portrays a transvestite secret agent. A musical, the movie also was an homage and a parody of the Thai films of the 1960s and '70s, with Shaowansai basing his character on the actress [[Petchara Chaowarat]].
In 2005, Thai film ''[[Rainbow Boys (film)|Rainbow Boys]]'', depicting a contemporary gay relationship, produced by [[Vitaya Saeng-aroon]], saw a limited-release screening. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama ''Club M2'', set in a gay sauna.&lt;ref name = "Real"&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/11/03/lifestyle/lifestyle_30054727.php The real pride in being gay], ''The Nation (Thailand)''; retrieved 2007-11-17&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2006 there was ''[[The Last Song (2006 film)|The Last Song]]'', a remake of a 1985 Thai film about a transsexual cabaret dancer and her struggle to find acceptance and true love.
''[[Me ... Myself]]'' ({{lang-th|ขอให้รักจงเจริญ}} or ''Kaw hai rak jong jaroen'') is a 2007 Thai romantic drama film written and directed by actor-singer Pongpat Wachirabunjong. In the film, [[Ananda Everingham]] stars as a male dancer in a transvestite cabaret who must re-find himself after being struck by a car and suffering from [[amnesia]].
Another 2007 film, ''[[Bangkok Love Story]]'', directed by [[Poj Arnon]], was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites and transsexuals.
Gay Thai independent film producer similarly praised the film, saying director [[Poj Arnon]] was "brave enough to shake society up".

In 2011, Thanwarin Sukhaphisit's [[Insects in the Backyard]], a movie depicting the struggles of a family in which a transgender teenage son and daughter's lives are tormented by a lack of communication and an inability to communicate with their biological father to the point that they end up selling their bodies looking, very much in vain, for a way out of their own lives, became the first film to receive the Haw Heep rating, which banned the distribution and showing of the film. There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order.

In 2012, Thanwarin's [[It Gets Better]] is marketed to a more mainstream audience, and was admitted by the film committee. The film portrays the story of a young boy whose father forces him to become a monk after he catches him wearing his mother's clothes and dancing around effeminately in his room. At first the boy resists, but is then captivated by the beauty of the monk who comes out of the temple, and so immediately changes his mind. The story runs alongside two other narratives, one of a man returned to Thailand to sell his father's business and the other of a woman whose purpose seems unclear throughout the story until the very end. We find out that the monk is the woman, who has come back to see her father but is killed by a thief before she can make amends with him. It turns out the bar/dance club was hers and her death is the reason for her son's return to Thailand; his father's identity was kept from him his whole life, but after he learns everything from his biological father's office, he goes to see his grandfather and the story ends. 

===Historical epics===
Another staple of the Thai film industry, among the biggest was 2003's ''[[The Legend of Suriyothai]]'' by [[Chatrichalerm Yukol]], who had done research for many years to write the screenplay. With a huge budget, support from the royal family and the cooperation across the nation's film industry, this film is considered a true "national film".&lt;ref&gt;Chalida Uabumrungjit, [http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=35 Coming of Age of New Thai Cinema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101020006/http://thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=35 |date=2007-11-01 }} Thai film foundation&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up epic is 2007's ''[[King Naresuan (film)|King Naresuan]]'', about 16th century ruler [[Naresuan|King Naresuan the Great]], which topped the budget for ''Suriyothai'', and was shown in two parts.

Other epics include ''[[Bang Rajan (film)|Bang Rajan]]'' by [[Thanit Jitnukul]], who has made several other historical battle epics, including ''[[Sema: Warrior of Ayutthaya]]'' and ''[[Kun Pan: Legend of the Warlord]]''.

More recent history is depicted in ''[[The Overture]]'', covering the life of a palace musician from the late 19th century to the 1940s, and ''[[The Tin Mine]]'', set at a mine in southern Thailand in the 1950s.

===Horror===
Many of the Thai early horror movies such as 1958 ''Mae Nak Phra Khanong'' and  1973 movie ''[[Krasue Sao]]'' (Ghosts of Guts Eater), {{lang-th|กระสือสาว}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://diedangerdiediekill.blogspot.com/2011/06/ghost-of-guts-eater-thailand-1973.html Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; featured [[Mae Nak]] and [[Krasue]], ancient village [[ghost]]s of Thai folklore that became very popular.
[[Nonzee Nimibutr]]'s ''[[Nang Nak]]'' in 1999 was a ghost story based on the same folkloric theme that had been depicted dozens of times throughout the history of Thai cinema and television. But it gave rise to a new crop of Thai horror and suspense films, including the [[The Pang Brothers|Pang Brothers]]' ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'', Nonzee's pan-Asian compilation ''[[Three (2002 film)|Three]]'', ''[[Bangkok Haunted]]'', directed by [[Pisuth Praesaeng-Iam]] and [[Oxide Pang]] and the 2004 box-office smash ''[[Shutter (2004 film)|Shutter]]'' by [[Banjong Pisonthanakun]] and [[Parkpoom Wongpoom]].

In 2013, [[Pee Mak|Pee Mak Phra Khanong]] - another spin-off from ''Mae Nak'' folklore - became an instant hit throughout Southeast Asia, earning more than ฿ 1 Billion. ''Pee Mak'' is currently the highest grossing Thai film in the history of Thai cinema.  

Examples of slasher movies include ''[[Art of the Devil]]'' and a 2005 sequel ([[Long khong]]), as well as ''Scared'' and ''Narok'' (''Hell''), also in 2005.

The horror genre also has spawned a number of genre-blending horror comedies, most notably the films of [[Yuthlert Sippapak]], ''[[Buppah Rahtree]]'' (featured at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]) and a sequel, and ''[[Krasue Valentine]]''. There has even been a [[zombie]] movie, 2004's ''[[SARS Wars]]''.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Monrak.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Monrak Transistor'' is a bittersweet story of a young man's two loves - a local girl in his rural village and singing luk thung.]] --&gt;

===Musicals===
The biggest hit musical was 1970's ''[[Monrak luk thung]]'' (''Magical Love in the Countryside''), starring [[Mitr Chaibancha]] and [[Petchara Chaowarat]]. It was hugely popular, playing in cinemas for six months.

As a result, a whole genre of [[luk thung]] musicals, rhapsodizing Thailand's rural life in [[Isan]] was created. Another example was [[Dokdin Kanyamarn]]'s 1971 musical comedy, ''[[Ai Tui]]'' (''Mr. Tui''), which starred [[Sombat Metanee]] and Petchara.

In 2001 there were two movies that celebrated luk thung, the singing-contest comedy ''[[Monpleng Luk Thung FM]]'' (''[[Hoedown Showdown]]'') and [[Pen-Ek Ratanaruang]]'s, ''[[Monrak Transistor]]'', which paid tribute to the music of [[Suraphol Sombatcharoen]]. And in 2005, comedian-actor-director [[Petchtai Wongkamlao]] wrote, directed and starred in ''[[Yam Yasothon]]'', a colourful homage to the 1970s musicals. It was one of top films at the Thai box office.

===Romance===
Weepy, sentimental romance stories are audience favorites. Historically, [[Cherd Songsri]]'s 1970s film ''[[Plae Chow]]'' (''The Old Scar'') is a classic tale of star-crossed lovers, and was one of the first Thai films to be a success internationally.

During the 1980s, ''Baan Sai Thong'' based on the novel ''Kor Surangkanang'' was a popular hit.&lt;ref name = "Pins"&gt;[http://www.rebound88.net/02/may/25.html#story2 "Thai govt pins border hopes on soaps"], The Nation (retrieved January 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples include ''[[The Letter (2004 film)|The Letter]]'', in which tissues were actually handed out at the cinemas.

Childhood romance was a hit with 2003's ''[[Fan Chan]]'', which was made by six directors. One of the six, [[Komgrit Treewimol]], went on to make the college-age romance, ''[[Dear Dakanda]]'', a hit in 2005, but took three years to completely write, cast, film, and tweak.

===Teen===
As a genre, teen films arose in the 1970s, with director [[Piak Poster]]'s ''[[Wai Ounlawon]]'', about a young man whose courtship of a teenaged girl puts him at odds with the girl's irascible father. That young couple, portrayed by the original actors, were revisited 30 years later as embattled parents in the 2005 sequel, ''[[Wai Ounlawon 4]]'' (''[[Oops ... There's Dad]]'').

Music was an important component of the teen films, with a musical interlude featured prominently in the film and a soundtrack album that would be a popular hit. This was the case with both ''[[Wai Ounlawon]]'' and its recent sequel.

Another noteworthy film of this genre is ''[[Fake (film)|Fake]]'', which was the debut film by [[Thanakorn Pongsuwan]]. The film's modern, visual style offers a sharp-focus snapshot of the city of Bangkok and a plausible account of the mating game in its current forms.

===Short films===
{{Main|List of Thai short films}}
In the burgeoning independent film movement, many [[short film]]s are being produced and featured in festivals. ''Graceland'', a film by [[Anocha Suwichakornpong]], about an [[Elvis impersonator]], was featured in the [[Cinéfondation]] competition at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was the first Thai short film selected at Cannes. Short-film festivals in Thailand include the [[Thai Short Film and Video Festival]] by the Thai Film Foundation and the [[Fat Film Festival]] by Fat Radio. Thai short-film programs are also put together for the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]]. for the past two years CNXWOOD Studios has co-sponsor a Film Festival, in the northern city of Chiang Mai in conjunction with Creative Kingdom Animation Studios Film.

[[Pen-ek Ratanaruang]]'s ''Twelve Twenty'' (30 min) was made as part of the [[Jeonju International Film Festival#Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers|Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers]] project for the 2006 [[Jeonju International Film Festival]]. The film stars [[Ananda Everingham]], has an appearance by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by [[Christopher Doyle]]. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters of a man and a woman on a long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side without talking.

In 2007, [[Digital Forum]] by Thai Film Foundation, Festival for a digital long-film

==Festivals and awards==

===Film festivals===
{{See also|List of film festivals in Asia#Thailand|l1=List of film festivals in Thailand}}
The [[Thai Short Film and Video Festival]] was first held in 1997. The [[Bangkok Film Festival]] was started in 1998, and was eventually supplanted by the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]], which started in 2002 and is organized by the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]]. The [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]], sponsored by the [[Nation Multimedia Group]], began in 2003, and it is held annually in October.

In 2007, [[Digital Forum]] was begun in Bangkok as an outgrowth of the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, to showcase feature-length independent digital-video productions. Also in 2007, the inaugural [[Phuket Film Festival]] was held. In 2008, the annual [[Phangan Film Festival]] (PFF) was established on [[Koh Phangan]], with a focus on spiritual and environmental indie films from around the world. In 2009, PFF's sister event, the annual [[Samui Film Festival]] (SFF) took place for the first time on [[Koh Samui]].

===Film awards===
The first film awards in Thailand were the "Golden Doll" awards given by ''Tukata Tong'' magazine. The awards were first given in 1957. The statuette at first was a [[Thai dance|Thai classical dancer]] and later it was modelled after Phra Suratsawadi, the Thai-[[Hinduism|Hindu]] god of art. King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] handed out the awards in 1965 and '66. The ''Tukata Tong'' awards were discontinued after eight years due to organizational problems, but were revived in 1974 by the Association of Entertainment News Journalists of Thailand.

The [[Thailand National Film Association Awards]] are organised by the [[National Federation of Motion Pictures and Contents Associations]]. The name of the award is the Subhanahongsa Award.

There is also the [[Bangkok Critics Assembly]], which gives awards chosen by a panel of around 20 members, the [[Starpics Awards]], given by ''Starpics'' magazine and the Kom Chad Luek Awards, given by ''[[Kom Chad Luek]]'' newspaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">'''Danspace Project''' was founded in 1974 to provide a performance venue for [[contemporary dance]].  Its performances are held in [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery|St. Mark's Church]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] area of the [[Manhattan]] borough of [[New York City]].

==History==
"Danspace[Project] has played a significant role in the arts ecology of New York and the entire dance world."
[[Michael M. Kaiser]], President of the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]

Danspace has presented a number of artists at early stages of their careers including [[Douglas Dunn (choreographer)|Douglas Dunn]], [[Bill T. Jones]], [[John Kelly (performance artist)|John Kelly]], and [[David Rousseve]].  Danspace also serves established artists such as [[Seàn Curran]], [[Yve Laris Cohen]], [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]], [[Iréne Hultman]], [[Bebe Miller]], Emily Coates (dancer and choreographer) and [[Meredith Monk]] who return to Danspace for its supportive environment, often to show work-in-progress or work specifically developed for the space.

==Programs==

Danspace Project fully presents twenty-five to thirty weeks of contemporary dance (including local, national, and international artists) each season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15076">A '''dialect coach''' is an acting [[coaching|coach]] who helps an actor design the voice and speech of a character in the context of an on-camera (film, television or commercial), stage (theatre, musical theatre, opera, etc.), radio or animation [[voiceover]] production. The dialect coach often does original research on dialects and speech patterns, prepares training materials, provides instruction and works on lines with the actor. A dialect coach will give the actor feedback focusing on issues of credibility, consistency, and clarity. A dialect coach may also be employed to help comedians hone impressions of celebrities, to train non-actor public speakers in vocal character and delivery, or to help singers improve in diction and attain a balance between tone and articulation, especially when singing in a second language.

==Terminology==

The term ''dialect coach'' persists as the primary designation for an accent or language coach in the US and Canadian entertainment businesses. However, other designations may also be used. Some dialect coaches will refer to themselves as ''dialogue coaches'' (or, occasionally, by the historical designation, ''dialogue directors''), especially when working on a second language or when offering acting coaching on straight dialogue in the performer's own language or dialect.

In the [[opera]] world, coaches who help opera singers with articulation of lyrics (often in an unfamiliar language, such as Russian, German or Czech) are called ''diction coaches.'' In the United Kingdom, dialect coaches are generally called ''accent coaches'' and are not [[acting coach]]es.

The term ''[[vocal coach|voice coach]]'' is applied to those who work with breathing, voice and text in the theatre in the UK, though this usage is not common in the US film and television businesses where the term "voice coach" would generally be understood to refer to a singing coach (a.k.a., a ''[[vocal coach]]'').

Likewise, on US stage productions the term ''voice coach'' is also avoided to prevent confusion with either a vocal (singing) coach or someone who coaches actors in techniques for inducing a state of heightened relaxation prior to a rehearsal or performance, and who may offer guidance on breath support or vocal practices intended to promote effective placement of resonances in the upper body, the actor's availability of expression and appropriate projection.&lt;ref name="Fitzmaurice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linklater" /&gt;

==Activities==
In some cases, voice warm-up coaching integrates full-body work in [[yoga]], movement or balance. Many actors believe that such warm-ups and exercises reduce the likelihood of vocal damage, most especially during expression of high intensity emotion outdoors or in a large performing venue in the absence of electronic amplification (e.g., microphones and a PA system).&lt;ref name="claims" /&gt; A dialect coach may also be engaged to coach voice issues in this latter sense in conjunction with theatrical dialect coaching. Not every dialect coach has the training and knowledge to also do vocal coaching in a singing sense.

==Hiring and management==

===On-camera productions===
On a film or television production, dialect coaches are typically hired by the [[line producer]] during pre-production to begin preparing cast far in advance of the first day of [[principal photography]]. If engaged during principal photography, it is the [[unit production manager]], [[production manager]], [[production supervisor]], [[production coordinator]] or, in some cases, [[executive producer]] who is likely to interview prospective coaches in behalf of the production. If engaged only during post-production, the coach may even be hired directly by the post producer. In advance of being hired, coaches may be interviewed by the [[showrunner]] or a staff writer in the case of episodic television or by the [[film director]] in the case of a feature film. Dialect coaches may work with any members of the cast, but are brought in especially often to work with celebrity actors who have been cast in roles which require accents other than their own or even the performance of dialogue in languages unknown to the actors. Therefore, frequently, the actors themselves will ask Production to hire a particular coach. 

However the coach comes to be hired, the creatives will often consult with the dialect coach early in the process in order to acquaint the dialect coach with the overall creative vision and to start the actor as early as possible to allow time for the character's voice to become fully integrated by the actor prior to the actor's first shoot day. Once hired, the coach will typically prepare actors over a number of sessions either remotely, on set, at the Production Office or in the actor's own home. Coaches who work in serialized television are expected to be especially flexible as there may be no opportunity for a meeting between the episode director and coach, as shooting scripts may not be finalized until very close to the day of the shoot and as last-minute casting decisions and limitations on actor-availability may make it difficult to schedule advance coaching.

During production, the [[key second assistant director]] typically schedules coaching sessions. Many creatives will ask that the coach be present at read-throughs or story conferences, at production meetings (if serving as key coach) and during at least some first-team rehearsals. While a shot is set-up, the coach will be kept in close proximity to the actors to be coached. Often, the coach will be assigned a dressing room, or, on location, a room in the honeywagon, double-banger or triple-banger near the actors' trailers. On set, the dialect coach will be issued a wireless headset and given a chair (exclusive, if on set regularly) in video village in order to facilitate access to the director and to the script supervisor who may be asked by the coach to relay notes on pronunciation and clarity, particularly if the dialogue is in dialect or language unfamiliar to the post-production team. An on-set coach may also work with an actor between takes if needed, especially on last minute changes to the script. Later, the coach may be brought back for dubbing or to pick up new lines during the post-production process, sometimes via a feed from a remote studio when the actors are no-longer available in person.&lt;ref name="Blaise" /&gt;

===Stage productions===
On a stage production, dialect coaches are typically brought in by a director or artistic director with contractual terms negotiated by a producer or general manager. Coaches work closely with the production stage manager who coordinates meetings with the director and coaching sessions for the cast collectively or individually. The coach will often also be present to give notes to the actors at some rehearsals, partial runs and full runs. Coaching typically takes place throughout the rehearsal process, but especially before the actors begin memorizing their lines and again after the show is loaded into the performance space. Understudies may be coached alongside the principal performers or after the show goes into previews. Coaching may continue in a limited way during a run.

==Status and compensation==
In the film and television businesses, dialect coaches are very well paid. Coaches are customarily given on-screen credits for their work on films and for substantial contributions to serialized television. The wording of the credit may vary with the specific requirements of the production. On some shows, dialect coaches may be asked to contribute intellectual property to the production in the form of, for instance, dialogue polishing in English or other languages. They may serve as technical consultants in the areas of culture and written language. They often guide, or engage with, the cast's process of creating a character and consult on the overall vocal design for the production. Consequently, the deal memos for coaches may include compensation terms that are not typical for crew positions, leading to the adage that dialect coaches are neither [[above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] nor [[below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]], but on-the-line.

In the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK and the US, dialect coaches remain among a very small minority of production staff who are not unionized; their deals may differ in substance from production to production in these jurisdictions. In Australia and New Zealand, dialect coaches who are employed on a film or theatre set are covered under the [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]]. On English-language Canadian film and television productions, dialect coaches are unionized under the [[Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists]]. Coaches are not unionized under the [[Union des artistes]] for French-language productions in Canada.

In the theater, coaches who help actors hone dialects or character voices typically seek compensation on a par with designers and may be credited as dialect coaches, dialect designers or voice and speech directors. Dialect coaches are not unionized for live performances in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK or the US. 

There is no membership branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] that incorporates dialect coaching, nor is there a peer group of the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] that accords active membership status to coaches.

==Cost-cutting for low-budget productions==
Due to budget constraints, producers of student films and stage plays, showcase theater and slimly financed independent films and web series may avoid hiring a dialect coach, and instead substitute the services of a low-paid or volunteer native speaker model in hopes that the actors will be able to learn mimetically, retain the accent and act in it without expert guidance or monitoring. In some such cases, cast members may themselves pay a coach, sometimes in consultation with the director, though employing crew is not normally regarded as a cast member’s responsibility. In other cases, actors may attempt to self-study the dialect using commercially available training materials or web-based voice archives&lt;ref name="IDEA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VADA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCVoices" /&gt; which host native-speaker recordings of oral histories or interviews or other scripted speech.&lt;ref name="SAA" /&gt; The majority of such archives also provide native-speaker recordings of phonemically balanced narrative passages, especially ''Comma Gets a Cure,''&lt;ref name="Comma" /&gt; which is structured around the [[lexical sets]] of English and other phonological patterns of potential interest to the student of dialect.&lt;ref name="VSR" /&gt;

==Job prospects==
While there are many hundreds of voice and speech trainers connected with drama courses throughout the English-speaking world who may control a stock of ''stage dialects'' for general use, far fewer specialize in dialect coaching. A web search of dialect coaches with [[Internet Movie Database]] listings produces fewer than 100 living film and TV coaches worldwide, the majority showing few recent jobs, credited or uncredited. Most of these dialect coaches work on an ad hoc basis on individual productions. However, in some cases, a coach may become attached to a theatre company as a resident voice and speech director, especially if the coach has a second specialization (esp. [[Shakespeare]] or voice). As with many aspects of the entertainment business, entry into the field of dialect coaching is very competitive. Because dialect coaches are not always called for every day of a shoot, many coaches find a way to supplement income while maintaining their availability for coaching, often by acting, directing (including animation voice directing), teaching in related areas (public speaking, etc.) or taking on private students, especially for auditions.&lt;ref name="Kopf" /&gt; Outside of the entertainment businesses based in English-speaking countries, dialect coaching is less common, and opportunities rarer.

==Professional societies==
Dialect coaches, especially those who teach in theater education programs, may become active in such professional societies as the Australian Voice Association, the British Voice Association, the International Centre for Voice and the Voice and Speech Trainers Association.

'''''Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death''''' is a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' special made for the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Red Nose Day]] charity [[telethon]] in the United Kingdom, and was originally broadcast in four parts on [[BBC One]] on 12 March 1999 under the title '''''Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Pixley |title=DWM Archive Extra: The Curse of Fatal Death |url= |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=328 |page=25 |location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=Panini Publishing Ltd. |date=2 April 2003 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later home video releases are formatted as two parts and drop the "and" in the title. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.

It has a special status amongst ''Doctor Who''-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;Issues #278 and #328&lt;/ref&gt; – an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only [[parody|parodic]] story to be covered by "DWM Archives", a section of ''DWM'' normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website,&lt;ref name=CRW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305025453/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/08/10/13656.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who - News - Comic Relief Who|author=|date=5 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned [[live-action]] ''Doctor Who'' production between [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|the ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] in 1996 and [[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|"Rose"]] in 2005.

Finally, it serves as a production bridge – if not a narrative bridge – between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between "old" and "new" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised ''Doctor Who'' script by [[Steven Moffat]], the first post-production work of [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between [[Verity Lambert]] and [[Susie Liggat]], and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, [[Roy Skelton]]. Executive Producer [[Richard Curtis]] would later write the 2010 episode "[[Vincent and the Doctor]]". [[Richard E. Grant]], who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor would later appear on the actual show, as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the [[Great Intelligence]], after performing the voice of another version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.

==Plot==
The story begins with [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] gloating over his latest scheme to destroy his nemesis. However, instead of only spying on [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] and his companion [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Emma|Emma]], he is actually in communication with them, so they hear his plans. The Doctor invites his old foe to meet him at a castle on the planet Tersurus. The planet is in ruins, and was the home of a now-extinct race of supremely-enlightened beings shunned by all because they used [[flatulence]] as their means of communication. They all died when they discovered fire.

The Master appears, gloating that he travelled a century back in time, and persuaded the architect of the castle to put in a secret death trap. The Doctor had anticipated this and travelled further back, persuading the same architect to sabotage the trap. The Master had also anticipated this, and arranged for an additional trap – with identical results because the Doctor had likewise anticipated his move. The Doctor informs the Master, having calculated that he "has saved every planet in the known universe a minimum of 27 times", and having grown tired of battles with aliens and "the endless gravel [[quarry|quarries]]", that he is retiring, having found a Companion – Emma – with whom he has fallen in love. The Master springs yet another trap; a trap door under the Doctor's feet leading to the vast [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] of Tersurus, which he intends to suggest to the [[architect]] after going back in time again and buying him an expensive dinner. However, the Doctor had already bought the architect that dinner, so when the Master pulls the lever the trap door opens beneath him instead.

Seconds later, as the Doctor and Emma start to leave, the Master bursts in. Having taken him 312 years to crawl out, he emerges as an old man covered in sewage. Using his TARDIS to return to the present, he has brought allies – the [[Dalek]]s (who, lacking noses, are the only race that will have anything to do with him). Additionally, he has been enhanced by superior Dalek technology, a Dalek Suction Cup Hand. To the Master's dismay he can not answer when Emma asks him what the suction cup is for. The Master throws himself at the Doctor but falls into the sewers again, and immediately bursts in again, another 312 years older. The Daleks give chase to the Doctor, knocking the Master once more into the sewers. Having spent a total of 936 years in the sewers, he returns using a [[zimmer frame]] (walker) and is easily outpaced by the slow moving Daleks.

Emma and the Doctor are captured when they run into a room full of Daleks. Rather than being exterminated immediately, they are tied to chairs aboard the Dalek ship. The Master claims he has been enhanced again with Dalek technology – rejuvenating him and adding "Dalek bumps" to his chest. The Doctor insults the Master, comparing the "bumps" to breasts. In return for his enhancements, the Master agreed to give the Daleks the Zektronic energy beam – a weapon that would "allow the Daleks to conquer the universe in a matter of minutes".

When the Doctor tells the Daleks they will have to share the universe "with the beard and the bosoms over there", they inform the Doctor that they plan to exterminate the Master after he has assisted them. The Doctor uses the Tersuran language (farting) to warn his fellow [[Time Lord]]. The Master helps the Doctor and Emma escape, but not before the Doctor is fatally injured by the Daleks. He tells Emma (in Tersuran, which the Master translates) that he loves her, then dies. The Doctor regenerates into a handsome and sexually eager new Doctor (Richard E. Grant). Forced to fix the Dalek weapon, he is also electrocuted and becomes a shy, middle-aged and overweight Doctor ([[Jim Broadbent]]). Another accident results in a handsome, smooth-mannered Doctor ([[Hugh Grant]]), but this Doctor is also accidentally killed while fixing the weapon. Due to Zektronic energy beam's ability to disable the regenerative process, the Doctor permanently dies. The Master vows to live a life of heroism in honour of his fallen foe's memory, as do the Daleks.

Seemingly through the will of the universe itself, the Doctor does regenerate yet again, only this time as a woman ([[Joanna Lumley]]). Emma is deeply disappointed, pointing out that "You're just not the man I fell in love with." The Master, however, is quite smitten with this new Doctor, who notices the sonic screwdriver has "''three'' settings!" The story ends with them walking off together.

==Continuity==
This story is connected to a number of others by virtue of its narrative and its production elements. Many of the story's actors also have other connections to the programme, although most of these connections take the form of various actors ''almost'' getting a role in the main production.

===Narrative===
* The planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#T|Tersurus]] was first mentioned in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'', where a severely deteriorated Master, at the end of his last regeneration, was found. The spin-off novel ''[[Legacy of the Daleks]]'' by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] relates the events leading up to the Master's arrival there.

===Production===
* The title sequence is the same as used during most of the Tom Baker era of ''Doctor Who'', albeit edited to remove Tom Baker's face.
* The opening image of the TARDIS flying through space as the Master watches was taken from the beginning of the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|''Doctor Who'' TV movie]].
* [[Steven Moffat]], best known at the time for the children's drama series ''[[Press Gang]]'' (which starred Julia Sawalha), was well known as a fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and included many small continuity references in his script. He subsequently wrote several episodes for the series proper since its revival in 2005, starting with the two-part serial "[[The Empty Child]]"/"[[The Doctor Dances]]", and was the programme's head writer and executive producer between 2010 and 2017.
* The title ''Curse of Fatal Death'' is a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] (it being impossible to have a death that is not fatal), which parodies the sometimes melodramatic and tautological titles of the original series (an example being the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'').
* This is the lone example of a BBC-only production prior to 2005 in which the TARDIS interior appears to be lit when viewed from the exterior. This continues a tradition begun in the 1996 television movie, and is common practice in the 2005 series. The visual effect was first seen in the film ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]''.
* The exterior [[TARDIS]] prop was the same Mark II fibreglass version used in the 1980s and in the 30th-anniversary story ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''; ''Curse'' was the last time the prop would be used.
* Other specially made episodes of ''Doctor Who'' include ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' (1993), the officially untitled [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|2005 special mini-episode]], and ''[[Time Crash]]'' (2007)—all produced for [[Children in Need]]—, [[Space and Time (Doctor Who)|"Space" and "Time"]], a two-part mini-story produced for Comic Relief in 2011 and "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" (2013). "Time Crash" and "Space / Time" were written by Moffat.

====Music====
The production was deliberately based on the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s era and a conscious effort was made to use cues taken directly from episodes of that era. However, the practical unavailability of these soundtracks forced the show's musical director, [[Mark Ayres]], to use material mostly from the [[Fifth Doctor]]'s era. Except for the reuse of the theme music, the majority of musical cues come from episodes between ''[[Meglos]]'' and ''[[The Caves of Androzani]]'', with a brief excerpt also taken from the [[Third Doctor]] serial ''[[The Sea Devils]]'' as well as an excerpt from the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''[[The Greatest Show in the Galaxy]]'' (written by Ayres himself). The music during the episode's final scene, for example, is the same as that which played at the conclusion of the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s regeneration into the [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] in ''[[Logopolis]]''. After each regeneration portrayed in the episode, music from ''[[Meglos]]'' is employed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Mark_Ayres/COFD.htm Mark Ayres essay about the musical cues heard in ''The Curse of Fatal Death''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017004233/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Mark_Ayres/COFD.htm |date=17 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actors===
* [[Richard E. Grant]] was later cast as the Doctor in the animated 40th-anniversary adventure ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]'' in 2003, though his [[Shalka Doctor|status was relegated to unofficial]] following the announcement of a new series in September 2003. He later played the villainous [[Great Intelligence]] (in its Walter Simeon persona) in 2012 "[[The Snowmen]]", and 2013's "[[The Bells of Saint John]]" and "[[The Name of the Doctor]]".
* [[Jim Broadbent]] had previously played the Doctor in a sketch on ''[[Victoria Wood]]'', mocking the series' perceived sexism, cheapness, and use of [[technobabble]].
* [[Roy Skelton]] had voiced Daleks since 1967.
* [[Julia Sawalha]] was being considered for the role of a [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Raine Creevey|new companion]], a "[[cat burglar]]" who would have been introduced in the twenty-seventh season. Building on this, a "what if" article in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #255 featured her in this role along with a hypothetical Eighth Doctor, played by [[Richard Griffiths]], who was at one time considered for the role of the Fifth Doctor.&lt;ref name="griffiths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/faces/richard_griffiths.shtml|title = BBC – Drama Faces – Richard Griffiths|accessdate=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hugh Grant]] was offered the role of the Doctor again ahead of [[Christopher Eccleston]], and later said publicly that he regretted dismissing it without much thought when he saw how good the series was – and that he was hoping to play a villain in the ongoing programme instead.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a43067/hugh-grant-to-appear-in-doctor-who.html|title = Hugh Grant to appear in 'Doctor Who'?|accessdate=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Joanna Lumley]] is the first woman to play an incarnation of the Doctor. The second was [[Arabella Weir]] in the ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] episode ''[[Exile (audio drama)|Exile]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck 2013"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Matthew Wace|last1=Peck|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/355731|title=Op-Ed: Is the new Doctor Who a woman?|work=Digital Journal|publisher=digitaljournal.com|date=August 3, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2017, [[Jodie Whittaker]] was revealed as the official [[Thirteenth Doctor]], becoming the first woman to be cast in the role of the Doctor within the canon of the series.&lt;ref name="ThirteenthDoctorCasting"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/07/16/doctor-jodie-whittaker-replace-peter-capaldi-time-lord-regeneration/ |title=Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker is to replace Peter Capaldi in the Time Lord regeneration game |work=The Telegraph |date=16 July 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast and releases==
* When originally broadcast, the title of the story was ''Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death''. The four episodes were later re-edited into a two-part story that was released to home video a few months following broadcast, with the proceeds again donated to Comic Relief. The opening credits were remade to include Rowan Atkinson's face. In the VHS release, the title was simply reduced to ''The Curse of Fatal Death''.
* The serial was rebroadcast twice on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]] during their 40th anniversary marathon in 2003. Used as a five-minute "pause" between fan-chosen episodes of the classic era, it returned to its original title and four-episode format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2003/11/20/8107.shtml|title=BBC Gold schedule for 22 and 23 November 2003|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Curse of Fatal Death'' has been released digitally via iTunes (UK store only)&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?i=307275549&amp;id=306716716&amp;s=143444 iTunes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104002425/http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?i=307275549&amp;id=306716716&amp;s=143444 |date=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available on both the [[Comic Relief|Red Nose Day]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do-wDPoC6GM|title=Rowan Atkinson is Doctor Who - Comic Relief|first=|last=Comic Relief|date=16 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor Who]] channels on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp_Fw5oDMao|title=The Curse of Fatal Death - Comic Relief Special - Doctor Who - BBC|first=|last=Doctor Who|date=24 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There have not been any plans to bring ''Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death'' out on DVD, however BBC Worldwide have said when all the classic series DVDs have been released it may be.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Potential sequel==
A week after the special aired, ''Doctor Who'' writer [[Lawrence Miles]] contacted [[BBC Books]] editor [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]] with an idea for a novel sequel focusing on Joanna Lumley's Thirteenth Doctor; Cole had already received a different Thirteenth Doctor pitch from [[David A. McIntee]] that weekend. Titled ''The War'', Miles's novel would have taken place during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)#Eighth Doctor Adventures|time war]] alluded to in Miles's ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels. Miles planned to take advantage of the BBC's catalogue of characters, mostly those from 1970s and 1980s sitcoms: with the war causing alternative timelines to overlap, the Doctor would have found herself in a concentration camp on Earth along with strays from other realities, such as [[Norman Stanley Fletcher]] from ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]''. In a pastiche of war story clichés, the heroes would have been betrayed by "[[Mrs. Slocombe]]'s pussy", a running joke in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' which would have been revealed as a conceptual entity working for the Enemy, the Time Lords' unseen opponents. At the story's climax, the Doctor and [[Captain Mainwaring]] from ''[[Dad's Army]]'' would have led a suicidal "[[Charge of the Light Brigade|Light Brigade]]"-style assault on the Enemy's base. Cole never replied, which Miles has attributed to Cole mistaking the submission for a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menace.ndo.co.uk/loz/inter/INTER00.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030204002644/http://www.menace.ndo.co.uk/loz/inter/INTER00.TXT|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 February 2003|title=The Potential Last Ever Doctor Who Interview with Lawrence Miles|publisher=Menace.ndo.co.uk|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flash drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|theatrical play]] that does not exceed ten [[minute]]s in duration, hence the name. Groups of four to six flash drama plays are popular with [[school]], [[university]] and community drama companies since they offer a wide variety of [[Role (performing arts)|roles]] and situations in a single performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-flash-drama.htm|title=What Is a Flash Drama? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no set rules for flash plays but the typical play has certain characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://risenwise.com/category/miscellaneous/what-is-a-flash-drama.php|title=What is a Flash Drama?|website=risenwise.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

==History==
{{details|History of Indian Football}}
&lt;!--This is just a short summary of Football in India. Please refrain from adding specific details here--&gt;
The origin of football in India can be traced back to mid-nineteenth century when the game was introduced by British soldiers. Initially, games were played between army teams. However, clubs were soon set up around the country. [[Calcutta Cricket and Football Club|Calcutta FC]] was the first club to be established in 1872, though reports suggest that they were initially a rugby club and switched their attentions to football as late as 1894. Other early clubs include Dalhousie Club, Traders Club and Naval Volunteers Club.&lt;ref name="TheSportsCampus.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportscampus.com/200805197/introduction-to-football/history-indian-football |title=History of Football in India |publisher=TheSportsCampus.com |date=2008-05-19 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other football clubs like Sovabazar, [[Mohun Bagan Athletic Club|Mohun Bagan]] and [[Techno Aryan F.C.|Aryan Club]] were established in [[Calcutta]] around the 1890s. Calcutta, then capital of British India, soon became the hub of Indian football. Tournaments like Gladstone Cup, Trades Cup and Cooch Behar Cup was also started around this time. The Durand Cup and IFA Shield were both started in late nineteenth century.

The first Indian team to achieve success was Sovabazar Club, which won the Trades Cup in 1892. [[Mohun Bagan Athletic Club]] was set up in what is now West Bengal in 1889. The club became famous in 1911 when it became the first Indian team to lift the [[IFA Shield]], a tournament previously won only by British teams based in India. It defeated the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] 2–1 in the final of the tournament in a victory that is still regarded by many as the greatest win by an Indian team before Independence.

The [[Indian Football Association]] (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, but did not have a single Indian on its board until the 1930s. The [[All India Football Federation]], which runs the game in India, was formed in 1937, but took more than a decade to get affiliated with FIFA. India also insisted on playing barefoot when other nations were putting their boots on and the game was changing fast.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2010/06/why_is_india_a_football_laggard.html |title=Soutik Biswas's India: Why is India not at the World Cup? |publisher=BBC |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India qualified by default for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] as a result of the withdrawal of all of their scheduled opponents. But lack of foreign exchange, the prospects of a long sea journey and an insistence on playing barefoot meant that the team never made it to Brazil.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://in.yfittopostblog.com/2010/06/14/barefoot-in-bengal-and-other-stories/ |title=Fit to Post: Yahoo!

The myth that Indians refused to play because they were not allowed to play barefoot is not entirely true, according to the then Indian captain [[Shailen Manna]], it was just a story to cover up the disastrous decision of the AIFF. The team has never since come close to qualifying for the World Cup.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisi (2007), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=7/overview.html |title=1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil&amp;nbsp;– Overview|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arunava Chaudhuri |url=http://www.indianfootball.de/data/worldcupq.html |title=The Indian National Team's World Cup qualifying |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320195543/http://www.indianfootball.de/data/worldcupq.html |archivedate=March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India even picked up the gold in football in the first [[Asian Games]] in 1951, beating a "booted" Iran by a solitary goal. In 1956, after having put on its boots, India reached the semi-final in [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne Olympics]] football, the first Asian country to do so. It stood fourth in the tournament. In 1962, India again picked up the football gold in the Asian Games.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; 1951–1962 is usually considered as "golden phase" of Indian football. The National team won numerous titles in this era under the coaching of [[Syed Abdul Rahim]]. Other than success in Asian Games football, India also won Merdeka Cup and Quadrangular Tournament while [[East Bengal F.C.|East Bengal]] garnered rave reviews after its tour of Romania. Rahim's death in the early 1960s pegged Indian football back after a successful period. The foremer FIFA president Mr. Sepp Blatter believes India is 'the sleeping giant of World Football'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/best-football-stadiums-in-india-002837.html|last=|first=|date=|work=nativeplanet.com|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India never qualified for the Olympics after 1960.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; India did qualify for its first Asian Cup in 1964 but failed to capture the title. India's last important performance in an international tournament was in 1970 Asian Games, when it won the bronze medal by defeating Japan 1–0. In the mid-70s, Indian youth team jointly won the Youth Asian Cup with Iran. 24 September 1977, was a golden day for Indian Club football, when Mohun Bagan managed to hold on for a memorable 2–2 draw at the legendary Eden Gardens stadium in Calcutta, against a Pele led New York Cosmos. Mohun Bagan would have gone on and won the tie, had it not been for a controversial penalty awarded to the visitors that ensured the spoils were shared. The next day, the Ananda Bazar Patrika described Goutam Sarkar as "India's very own Beckenbaur". Indian football would however go through a barren phase in 70s, 80s and 90s, gradually losing its foothold as a top Asian team.

In August 2007, the Indian national team won the [[Nehru Cup International Football Tournament|Nehru Cup]] for the first time in its history beating [[Syria national football team|Syria]] 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-29226020070829 | title = India upstage Syria 1–0 to lift Nehru Cup | work=Reuters | date=2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August the following year, India defeated [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]] 4–1 to lift the [[AFC Challenge Cup]] and in turn qualified for the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] in Qatar. In August 2009, India again won the Nehru Cup beating Syria in penalty (6–5).

In January 2011 India played in the [[2011 Asian Cup]] which was the first time India has played in the [[Asian Cup]] for 24 years. India were knocked out in the group stage which contained [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], and [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]].

Ever since the [[2011 Asian Cup]] the [[All India Football Federation]] has been working very hard on Indian Football. For instance they allowed former coach [[Bob Houghton]] coach the Indian side in the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]] qualifiers. After going first in there [[AFC Challenge Cup]] group [[Bob Houghton]] was sacked and replaced by [[Wim Koevermans]]. Meanwhile, the [[India national under-23 football team]] won the first round of the [[2012 Olympics]] qualifiers against Myanmar but were knocked out by Qatar. India played their next official matches against [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers which India lost on aggregate 5–2.

In 2014, India hosted the first-ever [[Unity World Cup]] in [[Goa]], [[Hyderabad]] and [[Bangalore]].

India has participated for the first time in [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]] as hosts in the [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup|2017 edition]] of the tournament. This was the first time ever  that a team representing India participated in the finals of a FIFA-organised world tournament. India was placed in Group A along With, U.S.A, Ghana and Columbia. On 6 October 2017, India played their First Ever match in FIFA-U17 World Cup history in front of 47000 people against U.S.A.But unfortunately, India lost the match by 3–0. India played their Second match against Colombia. In 82nd minute Jeakson Singh Thounaojam became the First Indian Goal Scorer in any FIFA Tournament. For the third match of group stage, India faced Ghana where they went down to lose 4–0, finishing bottom of the group A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Official Emblem launched for FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017|url=https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/news/y=2016/m=9/news=official-emblem-launched-for-fifa-u-17-world-cup-india-2017-2837035.html|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in 2018, Indian football has reached another level, by defeating [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina U20]] 2–1 in 2018 Cotif Cup and [[Iraq national under-17 football team|Iraq U16]] the defending champions of [[AFC U-16 Championship]] by 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goal.com/en-in/news/argentina-iraq-slayed-in-an-incredible-day-for-india/jecl56sbmsie105cozmp6zi97&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the [[Asian Football Confederation]]. Since 1948, the AIFF has been affiliated with [[FIFA]], the international governing body for world football. In 1954, AIFF became one of the founder members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

At the peak of its success during the 1950s and 60s, the team was automatically advanced to play in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] (all the other Asian teams withdrew), but ultimately they did not go to the tournament in Brazil due to the cost of travel,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; lack of practice time, team selection issues, the issue of the AIFF valuing Olympics over the World Cup, and, unusually, their instance on playing barefoot when FIFA required all players to wear football boots.&lt;ref name="in.yfittopostblog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.yfittopostblog.com/2010/06/14/barefoot-in-bengal-and-other-stories/ |title=Barefoot in Bengal and Other Stories |publisher=In.yfittopostblog.com |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614204013/http://in.yfittopostblog.com/2010/06/14/barefoot-in-bengal-and-other-stories/ |archivedate=2010-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They won gold medals at two Asian Games, and held the record for the best performance by an Asian football team at the Olympics.

==League system==

===Indian Super League===
{{main|Indian Super League}}
The Indian Super League, a tournament just recently recognized by [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] or [[FIFA]], was founded in 2013 in an effort to make football a top sport in India and to make Indian football a major player worldwide.&lt;ref name=Founded&gt;{{cite web|title=RELIANCE, IMG WORLDWIDE AND STAR INDIA, LAUNCH `INDIAN SUPER LEAGUE' FOR FOOTBALL|url=http://img.com/news/news/2013/october/reliance,-img-worldwide-and-star-india,-launch-%60in.aspx|website=IMG|accessdate=21 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008194259/http://img.com/news/news/2013/october/reliance%2C-img-worldwide-and-star-india%2C-launch-%60in.aspx|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league operates along the lines of the [[Twenty20]] cricket [[Indian Premier League]], and [[Major League Soccer]] of the United States.&lt;ref name=MLSstyle&gt;{{cite web|last=Bali|first=Rahul|title=IMG-Reliance keen to start an eight team franchisee competition, I-League likely to follow the MLS|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/136/india/2012/07/19/3250992/img-reliance-keen-to-start-an-eight-team-franchisee|work=Goal.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the vast majority of football leagues around the world, the ISL does not use the promotion and relegation system. Instead, it uses an American style franchise system in which ten teams were specifically created to participate in the league.  Each team in the ISL is composed of players from I league or state league, apart from the foreigners who may or may not be a part of the I league. Recently it was recognised as the second national league in India, which means ISL champions from 2017–2018 leagues will be eligible for an AFC Cup qualifying slot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valcke: ISL is second official league in India|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/isl-gets-official-recognition-from-afc-becomes-second-national-football-league-3755201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-League===
{{main|I-League}}
[[National Football League (India)|National Football League]], established in 1996 by governing body [[All India Football Federation]] (AIFF) was the first "semi-professional" football league in India. 
The League was renamed and restructured and the I-League was founded in 2006 after India's former top league the National Football League disbanded in a successful effort aimed at increasing the game in India. Links with clubs that were not in the I-League were maintained, and each season the bottom two clubs are relegated from the I-League and replaced by two from the [[I-League 2nd Division]]. The I-League is contested between 14 clubs each season. The [[Kolkata Derby]] in the I League (and other tournaments) played between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal is one of the most fierce rivalries of the world (featured in FIFA website) and one of the oldest derbies in the world (90 years). An average 80, 000 to 100, 000 supporters throng the stadium in this special fixture.

===I-League 2nd Division===
{{main|I-League 2nd Division}}
The I-League 2nd Division ranks second in the hierarchy of Indian football since the disbanding of India's top league in 2005. The I-League 2nd Division has 21 member clubs evenly divided among three divisions. Promotion and relegation of clubs still takes place between the I-league and the I-League 2nd Division.

===Youth leagues===
Right now the official youth leagues in India are [[I-League U18]], U15 Youth league and U13 Youth league. I league U18 started as U19 tournament in 2011. [[2017-18 I-League U18|2017–18 season]] U18 champions are [[Shillong Lajong]]. [[All India Football Federation|AIFF]] started U16 Youth League in 2015 (later renamed U15 Youth league) in the wake of [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]  (hosted by India).

There is no promotion/relegation between the state leagues and the [[I-League 2nd Division]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but there could be promotion/relegation between leagues within the state. For example, the Calcutta Football League has five divisions with promotion/relegation but the winner of the [[Calcutta Football League]] will not get promoted to the [[I-League 2nd Division]].

==Women's football==
{{main| Women's football in India}}

Women's football has not had the relative head start over the rest of the world that the men's game has had, and also has not had the chance to spread through the country like its male counterpart. The game was administered by the Women's Football Federation of India (WFFI) from 1975 until the early 1990s when they were absorbed into the AIFF. However, there are complaints that women's football is treated as a poor relation to the men's game leading to (unfulfilled) plans to de-merge the WFFI.&lt;ref name="indien-netzwerk1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Autor |url=http://www.indien-netzwerk.de/navigation/frauen/artikel/achaudhuri-womenfootball.htm |title=Gender and sport in India: aspects of women's football by Arunava Chaudhuri (english) |publisher=Indien-netzwerk.de |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030829121209/http://www.indien-netzwerk.de/navigation/frauen/artikel/achaudhuri-womenfootball.htm |archivedate=2003-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's game, like the men's game, also has its early pioneers in the state of West Bengal. The large Kolkata teams, [[Kingfisher East Bengal F.C.|East Bengal]] and [[Mohun Bagan A.C.|Mohun Bagan]], started women's club sides in the 2000–01 season, and they participate with other teams in the [[Calcutta Women's Football League]]. However, it has been seen recently that players from [[Odisha]] and [[Manipur]] have made advances in the game. Players from these two states make up a large part of the [[India women's national football team]].

The women's national competition is played on a state vs. state basis in the [[India women's football championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://aiffonline.com/women-comp/index.asp |title=The Official Website Of All India Football Federation |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204233655/http://aiffonline.com/women-comp/index.asp |archivedate=February 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also similar national championships for junior teams like the ''Junior Girls National Championship'' (for under 19s) and the ''Under-17 Girls National Championship''.

Some female players have become internationally recognised. Among them are Chitra Gangadharan who was selected to play for the All Asian Star team. Jaanki Kotecha was selected as captain to the All Asian Star Team in 2008–2009, where she led her team to victory. In February 2000, Sujata Kar and Alpana Sil became the first Indian footballers to sign a contract outside India. They signed with the German team [[TSV Crailsheim]], but had to return after a month due to problems with the clearance of their international transfer.

Until 1983, women's football took part in international tournaments like the [[AFC Women's Asian Cup]]. For example, the team won silver in 1980 at Calicut. In later years it had become poor in status just like its male counterpart. During the [[2003 AFC Women's Championship]], the Indian team were embarrassed by a 12–0 defeat to [[China women's national football team|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2628/stories/20030712005400600.htm |title=Sound planning needed |publisher=Sportstaronnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor support of the national team by the AIFF became evident, when the team's trip to Germany was only made possible by [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non Resident Indians]] in the country, and by the support of the [[German Football Association]]. Furthermore, championships are held in remote locations, and national media coverage is said to be restricted to state and local newspapers.&lt;ref name="indien-netzwerk1"/&gt;

The women's game reached a new low in June 2009 when FIFA delisted the side from its world rankings for being out of action for more than 18 months. This comes at a time when the game was gaining in popularity amongst the younger generation as evident by the local leagues conducted around the country. The recently concluded Mumbai Women's Football League 2009–10 organised by the MDFA (Mumbai District Football Association) was a major success and featured many talented players who had played for the national team. Furthermore, the popularity of the event gave hope that the women's game could rise in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballmumbai.com/index_women.html |title=Women's Home |publisher=Football Mumbai |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Women's League===
On 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF started plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football league would kick off in October 2016  with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/Womens-football-league-from-October/articleshow/51922352.cms |title=Women's football league from October – Times of India |website=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2016-04-21 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over two months later, on 5 July 2016, the AIFF organized a workshop to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC) attended the workshop. It was announced that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be determined through a pre-qualification round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/AIFF-conducts-workshop-for-National-Womens-League/articleshow/53062408.cms |title=AIFF conducts workshop for National Women's League – Times of India |website=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2016-07-05 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October, the AIFF announced that the preliminary rounds for the Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams are split into two groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-aiff.com/news-center-details.htm?id=7522 |title=Welcome to All India Football Federation |website=The-aiff.com |date=2016-10-14 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadiums in India==
There are many football stadiums in India, however only a few of them stadiums are currently of world standards. These are namely the largest stadium in India, the [[Salt Lake Stadium]] in [[Kolkata]] with a seating capacity of 85,000 , [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] in [[New Delhi]] with a capacity of over 60,000 and the [[Ambedkar Stadium]] with a capacity of 20,000 (but is known to have had crowds of 35,000 in the [[2009 Nehru Cup]]). [[Barabati Stadium]] in [[Cuttack]], with seating capacity of over 45,000 and [[Kalinga Stadium]] in [[Bhubaneswar]], with seating capacity approximately 55,000 are two major arenas for football events in [[Odisha]]. In Sikkim, the [[Paljor Stadium]] in [[Gangtok]] which seats over 25,000 is famous as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world as it is situated in the backdrop of Himalayas. In [[Shillong]] the main stadium is the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Shillong|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] with a capacity of 25,000 standing. Both the Paljor and the JLN in Shillong have been renovated and now have artificial playing surfaces. Some other stadiums important stadiums are the [[Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex]] in [[Pune]], the [[Barasat Stadium]] in [[Barasat]], the [[Fatorda]] in [[Goa]], the [[Kaloor International Stadium]] in [[Kochi]], [[Municipal Corporation Stadium, Kozhikode|Municipal Corporation Stadium]] in [[Kozhikode]], the [[Nehru Stadium, Guwahati|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] in [[Guwahati]]. Apart from the above-mentioned stadiums, there are hundreds of more stadiums in the country. However, with India likely to host the [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] there is definitely going to be massive renovation of said stadiums around the country.
The following tournaments are affiliated by [[All India Football Federation]].

'''Homelessness''' is the circumstance when people are without a permanent [[dwelling]], such as a [[house]] or [[apartment]]. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate [[housing]] due to a lack of, or a steady income.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [http://www.hud.gov/homeless/definition.cfm "Federal Definition of Homeless"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904165337/http://www.hud.gov/homeless/definition.cfm |date=4 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal definition of ''homeless'' varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.homeless.org.au/glossary.htm |title = Glossary defining homelessness |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''homeless'' may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a [[homeless shelter]], a [[domestic violence shelter]], long-term residence in a [[motel]], a [[vehicle]], [[squatting]], [[cardboard box]]es, a [[tent city]], [[tarpaulin]]s, [[shanty town]] structures made of discarded building materials or other ''ad hoc'' housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home is not just a physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom charity Crisis&lt;/ref&gt; United States government homeless enumeration studies&lt;ref&gt;Bogard, Cynthia J., [http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/1/105.abstract "Advocacy and Enumeration: Counting Homeless People in a Suburban Community"], ''American Behavioral Scientist'' September 2001 vol. 45 no. 1 105–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabbard, W.

In 2005, an estimated 100 million (1 in 65 at the time) people worldwide were homeless and as many as 1 billion people live as squatters, refugees or in temporary shelter, all lacking adequate housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.share-international.org/archives/homelessness/hl-mlaroof.htm |title = A roof is not enough – a look at  homelessness worldwide, by Monte Leach, Share International Archives|website=Share-international.org|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.homelessworldcup.org/homelessness-statistics/ |title = Global Homelessness Statistics – Homeless World Cup|website=Homelessworldcup.org|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/12/homelessness_around_the_world.html Homelessness around the world]".

Most countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people. These services often provide food, shelter (beds) and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often with the help of volunteers) or by government departments or agencies. These programs may be supported by the government, charities, churches and individual donors. Many cities also have [[street newspapers]], which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people. While some homeless have jobs, some must seek other methods to make a living. [[Begging]] or [[Aggressive panhandling|panhandling]] is one option, but is [[Begging#Legal restrictions|becoming increasingly illegal]] in many cities. People who are homeless may have additional conditions, such as physical or mental health issues or substance addiction; these issues make resolving homelessness a challenging policy issue.

Homeless people, and homeless organizations, are sometimes accused or convicted of fraudulent behaviour. Criminals are also known to exploit homeless people, ranging from [[identity theft]] to tax and welfare scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/kinahan-gang-taking-advantage-homeless-11569806|title=Kinahan gang taking advantage of homeless crisis as part of latest fraud scheme|publisher=Dublin Live|author=Claire Scott|date=5 July 2016|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article148814304.html|title=Georgia man gets 10 months for perpetrating ‘Operation Homeless’ fraud in Boise|newspaper=Idaho Statesman|author=Kristin Rodine|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294984602|title=Fighting fraudsters who target homeless in scams|author=Kevin Wendolowski |journal=Fraud Magazine|year=2014|issue=September–October|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents often lead to negative connotations on the homeless as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/homeless-organization-called-fraud/?_r=0|title=Homeless Organization Is Called a Fraud|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Nicholas Confessore|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/is-begging-just-a-scam-or-a-lifeline-for-those-most-in-need-a7371516.html|title=Is Begging Just A Scam, Or A Lifeline For Those Most In Need?|newspaper=The Independent|author=David Barnett|date=31 October 2016|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and classification ==
=== United Nations definition ===
In 2004, the [[United Nations]] sector of Economic and Social Affairs defined a homeless household as those households without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters due to a lack of or a steady income. They carry their few possessions with them, sleeping in the streets, in doorways or on piers, or in another space, on a more or less random basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/techreport/hhChar.pdf "United Nations Demographic Yearbook review: National reporting of household characteristics, living arrangements and homeless households : Implications for international recommendations"], United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, Demographic and Social Statistics Branch, 14 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] Conference of European Statisticians (CES), held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], the Group of Experts on Population and Housing Censuses defined homelessness as:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb20/Attachments/2009MPHASIS_ECE_Homeless-GUID25ae612721cc4c2c87b536892e1ed1e1.pdf "Enumeration of Homeless People"], United Nations Economic and Social Council, 18 August 2009; Economic Commission for Europe Conference of European Statisticians, Group of Experts on Population and Housing Censuses, Twelfth Meeting, Geneva, 28–30 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In its Recommendations for the Censuses of Population and Housing, the CES identifies homeless people under two broad groups:&lt;br /&gt; (a) Primary homelessness (or rooflessness). This category includes persons living in the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters;&lt;br /&gt; (b) Secondary homelessness. This category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations (including dwellings, shelters, and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters). This category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting 'no usual address' on their census form.&lt;br /&gt; The CES acknowledges that the above approach does not provide a full definition of the 'homeless'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted 10 December 1948 by the UN General Assembly, contains this text regarding housing and quality of living:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a25 |title = Article 25 |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== European typology ===
Homelessness is perceived and addressed differently according to country. ''The European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion'' (ETHOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.feantsa.org/en/toolkit/2005/04/01/ethos-typology-on-homelessness-and-housing-exclusion |title = ETHOS Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |access-date = 11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed as a means of improving understanding and measurement of homelessness in Europe, and to provide a common "language" for transnational exchanges on homelessness. The ETHOS approach confirms that homelessness is a process (rather than a static phenomenon) that affects many vulnerable households at different points in their lives.

The typology was launched in 2005 and is used for different purposes: as a framework for debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Amore |first = Kate, Michael Baker and [[Philippa Howden-Chapman]] |title = The ETHOS Definition and Classification of Homelessness: An Analysis |url = http://eohw.horus.be/files/freshstart/European%20Journal%20of%20Homelessness/Volume%20Five/Volume%205.2/article-1.pdf |work = The European Journal of Homelessness, Volume 5.2, December 2011 |publisher = FEANTSA |accessdate = 31 July 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120131161013/http://eohw.horus.be/files/freshstart/European%20Journal%20of%20Homelessness/Volume%20Five/Volume%205.2/article-1.pdf |archive-date = 31 January 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for data collection purposes, for policy purposes, monitoring purposes, and in the media. This typology is an open exercise which makes abstraction of existing legal definitions in the EU member states. It exists in 25 language versions, the translations being provided mainly by volunteer translators.

=== Other terms ===
The terms ''unsheltered'' and ''unhoused'' refer to that segment of a homeless community who do not have ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep; the latter term is defined by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) as describing persons occupying "place not designed for ... sleeping accommodation for human beings".  Such persons frequently prefer the term ''houseless'' to the term ''homeless''. Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term ''unsheltered homeless''. The common colloquial term ''[[street people]]'' does not fully encompass all unsheltered people, in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments. Many shun such locales, because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up. Some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings ("[[squatting]]"), or inhabit mountainous areas or, more often, lowland meadows, creek banks and beaches.&lt;ref&gt;"Inside Straight Edge". Writer: David Shadrack Smith. Directors: Jim Gaffey and David Shadrack Smith. Inside. National Geographic Society. 9 April 2008. Retrieved on 28 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide short-term emergency shelter during particularly cold spells, often in churches or other institutional properties. These are referred to as [[warming centers]], and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Svitek |first = Patrick |title = Evanston homeless find warm shelters |publisher = ''Daily Northwestern'' |url = http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/city/evanston-homeless-find-warm-shelters-1.2458986 |access-date = 14 February 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110323124913/http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/city/evanston-homeless-find-warm-shelters-1.2458986 |archive-date = 23 March 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HUD requires jurisdictions which participate in [[Continuum of Care]] grant programs to count their homeless every two years. These counts have led to a variety of creative measures to avoid undercounting. Thus teams of counters, often numbering in the hundreds in logistically complex volunteer efforts, seek out the unsheltered in various nooks and crannies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.breakingground.org/ |title = Breaking Ground: Building and Restoring Lives |publisher = Breaking Ground, LLC }}
&lt;br /&gt;Renamed from "Common Ground" (previous ref): {{cite web |title = Common Ground is now Breaking Ground |url = http://www.breakingground.org/news-and-events/common-ground-is-now-breaking-ground/#.WSUHGoWV5nE |accessdate = 24 May 2017 |date = 23 October 2015 |quote = We are pleased to share with you that as of October 23, 2015, Common Ground has changed its name to Breaking Ground. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These counts include people sleeping in official shelters and people sleeping in parks, alleys and other outdoor locations.

A portion of the homeless population are generally in transit, but there is no generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Sinti]] and other ethnic descent have rejected the term ''[[gypsy]]'', which they view as a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]], [[tramp]] or [[drifter (person)|drifter]]. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, e.g. ''[[hobo]]''. The pejorative term ''bum'' is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a [[work ethic]]. The term ''transient'' is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.

Following the [[Peasants' Revolt]], English [[constable]]s were authorised under 1383 [[English Poor Laws]] statute to collar [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] and force them to show support; if they could not, the penalty was [[gaol]].&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book |title = Controlling Misbehavior in England,1370–1600 |author = Marjorie Keniston McIntosh |year = 1998 |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-521-89404-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vagabonds could be sentenced to the [[stocks]] for three days and nights; in 1530, [[flagellation|whipping]] was added. The presumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed [[beggar]]s.&lt;ref name="McIntosh" /&gt; In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years servitude and branding with a "V" as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second. Large numbers of vagabonds were among the [[convicts]] transported to the American colonies in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyamericancrime.com/www.earlyamericancrime.com/convict-transportation/convict-voyages/overview-2 Convict Voyages (1): Overview], by Anthony Vaver, Early American Crime, 6 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century in England, the state first tried to give housing to [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] instead of punishing them, by introducing [[bridewell]]s to take vagrants and train them for a profession. In the 17th and 18th centuries, these were replaced by [[workhouse]]s but these were intended to discourage too much reliance on state help.

The growing movement toward social concern sparked the development of rescue missions, such as the U.S. first rescue mission, the New York City Rescue Mission, founded in 1872 by Jerry and Maria McAuley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nycrescue.org/ |title = New York City Rescue Mission website |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycrescue.org/413019.ihtml History of the New York Rescue Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107144623/http://www.nycrescue.org/413019.ihtml |date=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In smaller towns, there were [[hobo]]s, who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations. Especially following the [[American Civil War]], a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as "hobohemia" all over the United States. This phenomenon re-surged in the 1930s during and after the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Depastino, Todd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6RFcUQKNm08C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America"], Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-226-14378-3}}.

=== Modern ===
[[File:YongeStreetMission.jpg|thumb|Food line at the Yonge Street Mission, 381 [[Yonge Street]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in the 1930s]]
''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'' (1903) discussed homelessness, and raised public awareness, which caused some changes in building codes and some social conditions. In England, dormitory housing called "spikes" was provided by local boroughs. By the 1930s in England, there were 30,000 people living in these facilities. In 1933, [[George Orwell]] wrote about poverty in London and Paris, in his book ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''. In general, in most countries, many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor, transients, and afflicted, such as a "[[skid row]]". In New York City, for example, there was an area known as "the [[Bowery]]", traditionally, where [[alcoholics]] were to be found sleeping on the streets, bottle in hand.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and homelessness. There were two million homeless people migrating across the United States.&lt;ref name=Depression&gt;[http://amhist.ist.unomaha.edu/lessons/Ruben%20Cano_Why%20did%20the%20Great%20Depression%20happen%3F_lesson_template_mps.doc Overproduction of Goods, Unequal Distribution of Wealth, High Unemployment, and Massive Poverty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205005617/http://amhist.ist.unomaha.edu/lessons/Ruben%20Cano_Why%20did%20the%20Great%20Depression%20happen?_lesson_template_mps.doc |date=5 February 2009 }}, From: President's Economic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Many lived in shantytowns they called "[[Hoovervilles]]". In the 1960s, the nature and growing problem of homelessness changed in England as public concern grew. The number of people living "rough" in the streets had increased dramatically. However, beginning with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration's Rough Sleeper Initiative, the number of people sleeping rough in London fell dramatically. This initiative was supported further by the incoming Labour administration from 2009 onwards with the publication of the 'Coming in from the Cold' strategy published by the Rough Sleepers Unit, which proposed and delivered a massive increase in the number of hostel bed spaces in the capital and an increase in funding for street outreach teams, who work with rough sleepers to enable them to access services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsp-02007.pdf Wilson, Wendy. Rough Sleepers, Standard Note SN/SP/2007, House of Commons Library], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109020831/http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsp-02007.pdf |date=9 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern homelessness started as a result of economic stresses in society and reductions in the availability of affordable housing such as [[Single Room Occupancy|single room occupancies]] (SROs) for poorer people.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In the United States, in the 1970s, the [[deinstitutionalisation]] of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor that seeded the homeless population, especially in large cities like New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Scherl DJ, Macht LB |title = Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |journal = Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume = 30 |issue = 9 |pages = 599–604 |date = September 1979 |pmid = 223959 |url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=223959 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120106115504/http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=223959 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2012-01-06 |doi = 10.1176/ps.30.9.599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is vigorously disputed by clinical psychologist Seth Farber who points out that "the emptying of the state mental hospitals took place almost entirely in the 1960s and 1970s," a decade or more before the steep rise in homelessness which began in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Farber, "Homelessness, Madness, the Power Elites and Final Battles of the East Village," in Clayton Patterson, ed., ''Resistance: A Radical Social and Political History of the Lower East Side'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that Ronald Reagan's signing (as governor of California in 1967) of the [[Lanterman–Petris–Short Act]] greatly exacerbated homelessness among the mentally ill. This law lowered the standards for involuntary commitment in civil courtrooms and was followed by significant de-funding of 1700 hospitals caring for mental patients {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [unclear why ''lowering'' standards would cause less committals].

The [[Community Mental Health Act]] of 1963 was a predisposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Rochefort DA |title = Origins of the "Third psychiatric revolution": the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 |journal = J Health Polit Policy Law |volume = 9 |issue = 1 |pages = 1–30 |year = 1984 |pmid = 6736594 |url = http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6736594 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120709153258/http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6736594 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 9 July 2012 |doi = 10.1215/03616878-9-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into SROs and supposed to be sent to community mental health centers for treatment and follow-up, but it never quite worked out properly. The community mental health centers mostly did not materialize, and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Feldman S |title = Out of the hospital, onto the streets: the overselling of benevolence |jstor = 3561609 |journal = Hastings Cent Rep |volume = 13 |issue = 3 |pages = 5–7 |date = June 1983 |pmid = 6885404 |doi = 10.2307/3561609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Borus JF |title = Sounding Board.

Also, as real estate prices and neighborhood pressure increased to move these people out of their areas, the SROs diminished in number, putting most of their residents in the streets. Other populations were mixed in later, such as people losing their homes for economic reasons, those with addictions, the elderly, and others. Trends in homelessness are closely tied to neighborhood conditions, according to a report by the [[Edna McConnell Clark Foundation]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''Families on the move: Breaking the cycle of homelessness.'', Notkin, S., Rosenthal, B., &amp; Hopper, K., New York: [[Edna McConnell Clark Foundation]] Ken Burnett, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, research showed that children and families were the largest growing segment of the homeless population in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.facsnet.org/edu/progs/family_03-26-02.php3 |title = FACS, "Homeless Children, Poverty, Faith and Community: Understanding and Reporting the Local Story", March 26, 2002 Akron, Ohio. |publisher =  |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072235/http://www.facsnet.org/edu/progs/family_03-26-02.php3 |archivedate = 28 September 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Homeless Youth |year = 2005 |work = National Coalition for the Homeless |url = http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/youth.pdf }} {{small|(164&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has presented new challenges, especially in services, to agencies. Some trends involving the plight of homeless people have provoked some thought, reflection and debate. One such phenomenon is paid physical advertising, colloquially known as "[[sandwich board]] men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-05-08/syndication/|title=Schreiber Cindy, "Sandwich men bring in the bread and butter", Columbia (University) News Service, May 8, 2002|website=Jrn.columbia.edu|accessdate=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626191323/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-05-08/syndication/|archive-date=26 June 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/06/17/offbeat.pizza.ap/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417080224/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/06/17/offbeat.pizza.ap/ |archivedate=17 April 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the side-effect of unpaid free advertising of companies and organizations on shirts, clothing, and bags, to be worn by homeless and poor people, given out and donated by companies to homeless shelters and charitable organizations for otherwise altruistic purposes. These trends are reminiscent of the "sandwich board signs" carried by poor people in the time of [[Charles Dickens]] in the Victorian 19th century in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.victorianlondon.org/advertising/sandwichmen.htm |title = Victorian London site, "Sandwich Men" |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later during the [[Great Depression]] in the United States in the 1930s.

In the US, the [[federal government of the United States|government]] asked many major cities to come up with a ten-year plan to end homelessness. One of the results of this was a "[[Housing first]]" solution; rather than to have a homeless person remain in an emergency homeless shelter it was thought to be better to quickly get the person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home. But there are many complications of this kind of program which must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term.&lt;ref name="HF1"&gt;Abel, David, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/24/for_the_homeless_keys_to_a_home/ "For the homeless, keys to a home: Large-scale effort to keep many off street faces hurdles"], Boston Globe, 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HF2"&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/305/index.html "Home at Last?&amp;nbsp;– A radical new approach to helping the homeless"], ''[[NOW on PBS|NOW]]'' TV program, 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some formerly homeless people, who were finally able to obtain housing and other assets which helped to return to a normal lifestyle, have donated money and volunteer services to the organizations that provided aid to them during their homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Solutions at Work, [http://www.solutionsatwork.org/InTheNews/Hatton.html "Formerly Homeless Boston Man Donates Significant Portion of Social Security Retro-Check to the Organizations and People Who Gave Him a 'Hand Up'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517112054/http://www.solutionsatwork.org/InTheNews/Hatton.html |date=17 May 2008 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some social service entities that help homeless people now employ formerly homeless individuals to assist in the care process.

Homelessness has migrated toward rural and suburban areas. The number of homeless people has not changed dramatically but the number of homeless families has increased according to a report of HUD.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Koch. "Homelessness in Suburbs Increases". ''USA Today'', 9 July 2009: 3a&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress appropriated $25 million in the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act|McKinney-Vento]] Homeless Assistance Grants for 2008 to show the effectiveness of Rapid Re-housing programs in reducing family homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Alliance to End Homelessness]], [http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/article/detail/2032 "Rapid Re-Housing"], 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/ "Homeless Assistance Programs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110091553/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/ |date=10 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance to End Homelessness, [http://www.endhomelessness.org/section/policy/legislature/federalbudget "HUD and McKinney-Vento Appropriations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028220901/http://www.endhomelessness.org/section/policy/legislature/federalbudget |date=28 October 2009 }}, FY 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, President Obama signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], part of which addressed homelessness prevention, allocating $1.5 billion for a Homeless Prevention Fund. The Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) program's name was changed to Emergency Solution Grant (ESG) program, and funds were re-allocated to assist with homeless prevention and rapid re-housing for families and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into Public Law (Public Law 111-22 or "PL 111-22"), reauthorizing [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]'s Homeless Assistance programs. It was part of the [[Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009]]. The HEARTH act allowed for the prevention of homelessness, [[Rapid Re-Housing|rapid re-housing]], consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's signing, HUD was to make regulations implementing this new McKinney program.&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance to End Homelessness, [http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/general/detail/2098 "Summary of HEARTH Act"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217224733/http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/general/detail/2098 |date=17 February 2010 }}, 8 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlchp.org/content/pubs/HEARTH_Act_Overview_for_Web1.pdf "The HEARTH Act&amp;nbsp;– An Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008230454/http://www.nlchp.org/content/pubs/HEARTH_Act_Overview_for_Web1.pdf |date=8 October 2010 }}, National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HEARTH Act also codified in law the Continuum of Care planning process, long a part of HUD's application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs. This final rule integrated the regulation of the definition of ''homeless'' and the corresponding record-keeping requirements, for the Shelter Plus Care program and the Supportive Housing Program. This final rule also established the regulation for the definition ''developmental disability'' and the definition and record-keeping requirements for ''homeless individual with a disability'' for the Shelter Plus Care program and the Supportive Housing Program.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register/Vol.76, No 233 Monday, 5 December 2011, Rules and Regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, some homeless advocacy organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless, reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions on eligible activities.&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless, [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/2009Policy/HMV.pdf "NCH Public Policy Recommendations: HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization"], Washington, D.C., 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.cohhio.org/resources/factsheets/Chicagofactsheet.html Homelessness: The Causes and Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618135024/http://www.cohhio.org/resources/factsheets/Chicagofactsheet.html |date=18 June 2006 }}. Retrieved 10 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, cf. [https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/mpi/mpi_newsrelease.htm "News Release: Personal Income for Metropolitan Areas, 2006"], [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Paul Koegel of [[RAND]] Corporation, a seminal researcher in first-generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Koegel1" /&gt;

=== Challenges ===
{{Main|Discrimination against the homeless}}
The basic problem of homelessness is the need for personal shelter, warmth, and safety. Other difficulties include:

* Hygiene and sanitary facilities
* Hostility from the public and laws against urban vagrancy
* Cleaning and drying of clothes
* Obtaining, preparing and storing food
* Keeping contact with friends, family and government service providers without a permanent location or mailing address
* Medical problems, including issues caused by an individual's homeless state (e.g., [[hypothermia]] or [[frostbite]] from sleeping outside in cold weather), or issues which are exacerbated by homelessness due to lack of access to treatment (e.g., [[mental health]] and the individual not having a place to store prescription drugs for conditions such as [[schizophrenia]])
* Personal security, quiet, and privacy, especially for sleeping, bathing, and other hygiene activities
* Safekeeping of bedding, clothing, and possessions, which may have to be carried at all times

Homeless people face many problems beyond the lack of a safe and suitable home. They are often faced with reduced access to private and public services and vital necessities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Randall Amster|Amster, Randall]] |url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/lost-in-space-the-criminalization-globalization-and-urban-ecology-of-homelessness/oclc/221150739 |title = Lost in Space: The Criminalization, Globalization, and Urban Ecology of Homelessness |publisher = LFB Scholarly |location = New York |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-59332-297-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* General rejection or [[discrimination against the homeless|discrimination]] from other people
* Increased risk of suffering violence and abuse
* Limited access to education
* Loss of usual relationships with the mainstream
* Not being seen as suitable for employment
* Reduced access to banking services
* Reduced access to communications technology
* Reduced access to healthcare and dental services
* Targeting by municipalities to exclude from public space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Roark |first = Marc |date = 28 February 2014 |title = Homelessness at the Cathedral |ssrn = 2402925 |publisher = Working Paper Series }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty forming trust in relation to services, systems and other people; exasperating pre-existing difficulty accessing aid and escaping homelessness, particularly present in the Chronically Homeless&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pendleton|first=Lloyd|title=The Housing First approach to homelessness|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/lloyd_pendleton_the_housing_first_approach_to_homelessness|language=en|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter, as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by [[WFXT|FOX 25 TV]] in [[Boston]] wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudet, Mike, [http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 "FOX Undercover: Employees implicated in thefts from local homeless"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303140612/http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 |date=3 March 2011 }}, FOX 25 TV, Boston, Tuesday, 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Stephen, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/02/23/shelter_kitchen_theft_prevalent_report_says/ "Shelter kitchen theft prevalent, report says"], ''The Boston Globe'', 23 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The homeless are often obliged to adopt various strategies of self-presentation in order to maintain a sense of dignity, which constrains their interaction with passers-by and leads to suspicion and stigmatization by the mainstream public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Dromi |first = Shai M. |title = Penny for Your Thoughts: Beggars and the Exercise of Morality in Daily Life |journal = Sociological Forum |date = 1 December 2012 |volume = 27 |issue = 4 |pages = 847–871 |doi = 10.1111/j.1573-7861.2012.01359.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homelessness is also a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e. "deprejudice"). When someone is prejudiced against people who are homeless and then becomes homeless themselves, their anti-homelessness prejudice turns inward, causing depression. "Mental disorders, physical disability, homelessness, and having a sexually transmitted infection are all stigmatized statuses someone can gain despite having negative stereotypes about those groups." &lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Cox |first1 = William T. L. |last2 = Abramson |first2 = Lyn Y. |last3 = Devine |first3 = Patricia G. |last4 = Hollon |first4 = Steven D. |year = 2012 |title = Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal = [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume = 7 |issue = 5 |pages = 427–449 |doi = 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate =  |pmid = 26168502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties can compound exponentially. For example, a homeless man in [[New Jersey]] found that he could not get food from some volunteer organizations if he did not have a legally-recognized address; after being mugged, he lost valuable identification documents and contact information so he could not contact his daughter; since his hips and knee had been broken because of the attack, it was harder for him after recovering in the hospital to walk to those places which did offer free food; in numerous instances, problems seemed to exacerbate other problems in a downward cycle.&lt;ref name="twsTAPinto1"&gt;Thomas W. Sulcer, 10 September 2015, Westfield TAPinto, [https://www.tapinto.net/towns/sparta/categories/other-nj-news/articles/westfield-mom-rallies-community-to-turn-homeless-9 Westfield Mom Rallies Community to Turn Homeless Man’s Life Around in a Month], Retrieved 11 September 2015, "..During one attack, all of his contact information was taken from him ... lost the phone number and address of his daughter... as well as important identifying documents....."&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that in the city of [[Hong Kong]] over half of the homeless population in the city (56%) suffered from some degree of mental illness. Only 13% of the 56% were receiving treatment for their condition leaving a huge portion of homeless untreated for their mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Yim L and others, '[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140940 Prevalence Of Mental Illness Among Homeless People In Hong Kong]' (2015) 10 PLOS ONE&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Victimization by violent crimes ====
The homeless are often the victims of violent crime. A 2007 study found that the rate of violent crimes against the homeless in the United States is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewan, Todd, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-08-homelessattacks_N.htm "Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring"], [[Associated Press]], 8 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Coalition for the Homeless]], [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/hatecrimes/ Hate, "Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness, 2008"], August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 2013 there were 109 reported attacks on homeless people, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year, according to the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]]. Eighteen of those attacked died as a result. In July 2014 three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to death two homeless men with bricks and a metal pole in [[Albuquerque]].&lt;ref name="HomelessKilled"&gt;{{cite news |title = Police arrest three teenagers for hammering homeless to death |url = http://www.albuquerquenews.net/index.php/sid/224021037/scat/2fc3b2cae8166470/ht/Police-arrest-three-teenagers-for-hammering-homeless-to-death |accessdate = 23 July 2014 |publisher = ''Albuquerque News.Net'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18-year-old was subsequently found guilty of second-degree murder and other felony charges and sentenced to 67 years in prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://krqe.com/2016/02/05/man-convicted-of-fatally-beating-transients-faces-sentencing/ |title = Judge gives Alex Rios maximum sentence for homeless men killing |date = 25 February 2016 |publisher = KRQE News 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 16-year old was sentenced to 26 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://krqe.com/2016/10/04/teen-charged-with-killing-homeless-men-to-appear-in-court/ |title = Teen charged with killing homeless men sentenced |date = 4 October 2016 |publisher = KRQE News 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of women veterans found that homelessness is associated with domestic violence, both directly as the result of leaving an abusive partner, and indirectly due to trauma, mental health conditions, and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Dichter ME, Wagner C, Borrero S, Broyles L, Montgomery AE. Intimate partner violence, unhealthy alcohol use, and housing instability among women veterans in the Veterans Health Administration. Psychological Services. 2017; 14(2): 246-249. doi: 10.1037/ser0000132&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rent control ====
[[Rent regulation|Rent-controlled]] apartments contribute to shelter and street populations (around .04%). Apartments that are rent-controlled encourage people to not move out or to pass apartments along between families; this leads to higher rents for new renters, and reduces availability and affordability. About 10% of housing in the [[United States]] is under price control laws. Most of the laws were enacted to deal with the high inflation rates experienced during the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Assessing the Effect of Rent Control on Homelessness |last = Grimes |first = Paul |date = January 1997 |doi = 10.1006/juec.1996.1085 |volume = 41 |journal = Journal of Urban Economics |pages = 23–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws can motivate apartment owners to convert their property to a more profitable enterprise, thereby reducing the amount of housing available to potential tenants. A black market can also develop, with tenants leasing rent-controlled premises at prices above the legal maximum. This can price out lower income individuals and families.

==== Stigma attached to the term ====
Prior to 1983, the term 'homeless' implied that economic conditions caused homelessness. However, after 1983, conditions such as [[alcoholism]] and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] also became associated with the term in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = There's No Place Like Home: The Discursive Creation of Homelessness |journal = Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies |last = Pascale |first = Celine-Marie |date = 1 May 2005 |doi = 10.1177/1532708605274558 |volume = 5 |issue = 2 |pages = 250–268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims were often backed up with testimony made by high-ranking officials. For example, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated that "one problem that we’ve had, even in the best of times, is the people who are sleeping on the grates, those who are homeless by choice.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Homelessness in America |journal = American Journal of Public Health |last = Rosenheck |first = Robert |date = December 1994 |doi = 10.2105/ajph.84.12.1885 |volume = 84 |issue = 12 |pages = 1885–1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim made homelessness into a personal choice and a state of mind, and unhinged it from the neoliberal reforms sweeping through the economic system. In the broader sense, it made homelessness something that would exist even under the best economic conditions, and therefore independent of economic policies and economic conditions.

==== Consequences of stigma ====
Due to the stigma attached to the term, consequences have arisen. Fear is a major consequence. Many people fear the homeless due to the stigma surrounding the homeless community. Surveys have revealed that before spending time with the homeless, most people fear them, but after spending time with the homeless, that fear is lessened or is no longer there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X09000106 | doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.01.009| title=Humanizing the homeless: Does contact erode stereotypes?| journal=Social Science Research| volume=38| issue=3| pages=521–534| year=2009| last1=Knecht| first1=Tom| last2=Martinez| first2=Lisa M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another effect of this stereotype is isolation. Homeless people often experience isolation. This gives the homeless community no say in how things are. No one really listens to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 27752103|title = Citizens' Publications That Empower: Social Change for the Homeless|journal = Development in Practice|volume = 19|issue = 4/5|pages = 654–664|last1 = Magallanes-Blanco|first1 = Claudia|last2 = Pérez-Bermúdez|first2 = Juan Antonio|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance and resources ==
Most countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people. Provisions of food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations, often with the help of volunteers, or by government departments. Assistance programs may be supported by government, charities, churches and individual donors. In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was, with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that [[transaction cost]]s were perhaps too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoeni |first=Robert F. |last2=Koegel |first2=Paul |year=1998 |title=Economic Resources of the Homeless: Evidence from Los Angeles |journal=[[Contemporary Economic Policy]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=295–308 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.1998.tb00520.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] have a special [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.va.gov/homeless/page.cfm?pg=53 The Department of Housing and Urban Development and VA's Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614223126/http://www.va.gov/homeless/page.cfm?pg=53 |date=14 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The HUD-VASH program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tsai |first = Jack |author2 = Rosenheck, Robert A. |title = Homeless veterans in supported housing: Exploring the impact of criminal history |journal = Psychological Services |volume = 10 |issue = 4 |pages = 452–8 |pmid = 24079354 |doi = 10.1037/a0032775 |date = November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-governmental organizations also house and/or redirect homeless veterans to care facilities. Social Security Income/Social Security Disability Income, Access, Outreach, Recovery Program (SOAR) is a national project funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It is designed to increase access to SSI/SSDI for eligible adults who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and have a mental illness and/or a co-occurring substance use disorder. Using a three-pronged approach of Strategic Planning, Training, and Technical Assistance (TA), the SOAR TA Center coordinates this effort at the state and community level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.prainc.com/soar/ |title = SOAR – SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access and Recovery for people who are homeless |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social supports ===
{{See also|Wall of kindness}}
While some homeless people are known to have a community with one another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://usm.maine.edu/swo/faculty/david-wagner.html Wagner, David] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011035440/http://www.usm.maine.edu/swo/faculty/david-wagner.html |date=11 October 2008 }}.

Such social supports may occur through a formal process, such as under the auspices of a [[non-governmental organization]], religious organization, or [[homeless ministry]], or may be done on an individual basis. In Los Angeles, a collaboration between the Ostrow School of Dentistry of the University of Southern California and the Union Rescue Mission shelter offer homeless people in the Skid Row area free dental services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url = https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/comprehensive-shelter-based-clinic-enhances-access-oral-health-services-homeless-los |title = Comprehensive, Shelter-Based Clinic Enhances Access to Oral Health Services for Homeless in Los Angeles |date = 27 March 2013 |accessdate = 10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Income sources ===
Many non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries]] "provide skill development and work opportunities to people with barriers to employment", though most of these organizations are not primarily geared toward homeless individuals.  Many cities also have [[street newspapers]] or magazines: publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people or others in need by street sale. While some homeless have paying jobs, some must seek other methods to make money. [[Begging]] or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. Despite the stereotype, not all homeless people panhandle, and not all panhandlers are homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/spare-change "Spare Change?"], ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Adam, [http://sparechangenews.net/news/panhandling-beacon-hill-lowdown-reported-crackdown "Panhandling on Beacon Hill: The Lowdown on a Reported Crackdown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724080656/http://sparechangenews.net/news/panhandling-beacon-hill-lowdown-reported-crackdown |date=24 July 2011 }}, ''Spare Change News'', Boston, 4 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is [[busking]]: performing tricks, playing music, drawing on the sidewalk, or offering some other form of entertainment in exchange for donations. In cities where [[plasmapheresis]] (blood donation) centers still exist, homeless people may generate income through visits to these centers.

Homeless people can also provide [[waste management]] services to earn money. Some homeless people find returnable bottles and cans and bring them to recycling centres to earn money. For example, they can sort out organic trash from other trash, and/or separate out trash made of the same material (for example, different types of plastics, and different types of metal). Especially in Brazil, many people are [[Waste picker#In post-industrial countries|already engaged in such activities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://globalrec.org/2012/06/20/resistencia-a-higienizacao-dos-centros-urbanosresisting-the-hygienization-of-urban-centers/ |title = Many waste pickers reported as homeless |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 |date = 2012-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rather than sorting waste at landfills, ... they can also collect [[litter]] found on/beside the road to earn an income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.govyou.co.uk/rewarding-homeless-for-collection-litter/ |title = Homeless people collecting litter |work = Gov You |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless people have been known to commit crimes just to be sent to [[County jail|jail]] or [[prison]] for food and shelter.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Invented in 2005, in Seattle, [[Bumvertising]], an informal system of hiring homeless people to advertise, has provided food, money, and bottles of water to sign-holding homeless in the Northwest. Homeless advocates have accused its founder, Ben Rogovy, and the process, of [[Exploitation of labor|exploiting]] the poor and take particular offense to the use of the word "bum" which is generally considered [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=1028240&amp;page=1 |title = Web Entrepreneur Banks on 'Bum-vertising' |date = 6 January 2006 |publisher = ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Claudia, [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/240452_bumvertising13.html ''"Bumvertising" stirs debate : Idea by young entrepreneur draws worldwide attention&amp;nbsp;– both positive and negative''], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', Tuesday, 13 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' carried a story on so-called cyberbegging, or [[Internet begging]], which was reported to be a new trend worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, David, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/26/homeless_ex_cook_lets_his_fingers_do_the_panhandling_online/ "Panhandlers move from street to Internet: Online sites offer a fertile venue for some in need"], Boston Globe, 26 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
The [[United States Department of Labor]] has sought to address one of the main causes of homelessness, a lack of meaningful and sustainable employment, through targeted training programs and increased access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people develop [[self-sustainability|sustainable lifestyles]].&lt;ref name="Department of Labor" /&gt; This has included the development of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]], which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homeless individuals to resources at the state level.&lt;ref name="U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness"&gt;{{cite web |title = United States Interagency Council on Homelessness |url = http://usich.gov/ |accessdate = 25 February 2014 |year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the [[Workforce Investment Act]] (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.&lt;ref name="Department of Labor"&gt;{{cite web |title = United States Interagency Council on Homelessness |url = http://usich.gov/member_agency/department_of_laboi |accessdate = 25 February 2014 |year = 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140319060023/http://usich.gov/member_agency/department_of_laboi |archive-date = 19 March 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Department of Labor, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) offers a variety of programs targeted at ending homelessness among veterans.&lt;ref name="Department of Labor" /&gt; The Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP) is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Department of Labor" /&gt; The VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program, as well as services that are unique to female Veterans.&lt;ref name="Department of Labor" /&gt; Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the [[Workforce Investment Act]], [[One-Stop Career Centers]], and a Community [[Voice Mail]] system that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources.&lt;ref name="Find It!"&gt;{{cite web |title = United States Department of Labor |url = http://www.dol.gov/dol/audience/aud-homeless.htm |work = Find It!

==== Street newspapers ====
{{Main|street newspaper}}
Street newspapers are a tool for allowing homeless individuals to work. In New York City in 1989, a street newspaper was created called ''[[Street News]]'' which put some homeless to work assisting with writing, producing, and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Dana, "Read all about it: street papers flourish across the US", The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 17 November 2003. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.htm csmonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Street News was written ''[[pro bono]]'' by a combination of homeless, celebrities, and established writers. In 1991, in England, a street newspaper following the New York model was established, called ''[[The Big Issue]]'' which is published weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bigissue.com/ |title = ''The Big Issue'' |work = Big Issue |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its circulation has grown to 300,000.

Chicago has ''[[StreetWise]]'' which has the second largest circulation of its kind in the United States, 30,000. Boston has a ''[[Spare Change News]]'' newspaper, founded in 1992 by a small group of homeless people in Boston, built on the same model as the others: homeless helping themselves. [[San Francisco]] has the twice-monthly ''[[Street Sheet]]'' newspaper, founded in 1989, with a distribution of 32,000 per month. In central and southern Florida, [[The Homeless Voice]] works to spread awareness of homelessness and provide aid to victims through its street paper. The publication is the oldest continuously published street newspaper, operates advertising-free, contains poverty-related news stories, artwork, and poetry, and is provided to street vendors free of charge.

Seattle has ''[[Real Change]]'', a $1 newsletter that aims to directly benefit homeless people and also report on economic issues in the area. Portland, Oregon, has ''[[Street Roots]]'' with articles and poetry by homeless writers, sold on the street for a dollar. ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'' in Washington, D.C., has gained popularity and helped many make the move out of homelessness. Students in Baltimore, Maryland, have opened a satellite office for that paper as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.streetsense.org/ |title = ''Street Sense'' website |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Challenger'' Street Newspaper is written and run by people experiencing homelessness and their allies in Austin, Texas – one of the most economically segregated cities in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.challengernewspaper.org |title = The Challenger Street Newspaper – Ending Homelessness – Austin TX |website = www.challengernewspaper.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sacramento, California, has ''Homeward Street Journal'', published bimonthly with a circulation of about 11,000 per issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://homeward.wikispaces.com/ |title = ''Homeward'' |publisher = |accessdate = 28 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fox40.com/2015/06/17/homeward-street-journal-serves-sacramentos-homeless/ |title = ''Homeward Street Journal'' Serves Sacramento's Homeless |publisher = |accessdate = 28 September 2017 |date = 2015-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housing ===
==== Community organization housing initiative ====
Many housing initiatives involve homeless people in the process of building and maintaining [[affordable housing|affordable shared housing]]. This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, located in downtown San Diego, CA. This community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative builds community [[empowerment]] by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair the homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and home maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement in all parts of the decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Living Solutions"&gt;{{cite web |last = Hall |first = Corey |title = Living Solutions |url = http://www.livingsolutionsandservices.org/?gclid=CMK68tCw3rwCFcY-MgodkHEADw |accessdate = 22 February 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140319055911/http://www.livingsolutionsandservices.org/?gclid=CMK68tCw3rwCFcY-MgodkHEADw |archive-date = 19 March 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Housing Initiative.jpg|thumb|Photo of housing initiative for the homeless]]

==== Organizing in homeless shelters ====
Homeless shelters can become grounds for community organization and the recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this type of initiative. The representative presents and forwards problems, raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of the shelters. Examples of possible problems are ways to deal with drug and alcohol use by certain shelter users, and resolution of interpersonal conflicts. SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sandudvalg.dk/side/english |title = English|website=HSandudvalg.dk|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level. To open further dialogue, SAND organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from the shelters, homeless representatives, and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at the shelters.&lt;ref name="Organizing the Homeless" /&gt;

=== Political action: voting ===
Voting for elected officials is important for the homeless population to have a voice in the democratic process.&lt;ref name="Organizing the Homeless" /&gt; Equal access to the right to vote is a crucial part of maintaining a [[democracy]]. Voting enables homeless people to play a part in deciding the direction of their communities on local, regional and national issues that are important and relevant to their lives. Unfortunately, in some jurisdictions it may be hard for homeless people to vote if they do not have identification, a fixed address, or a place to receive mail. With each election, low income and homeless individuals vote at a lower rate than those with higher incomes, despite the fact that many policy decisions directly impact people who are economically disadvantaged. Currently, issues such as raising the [[minimum wage]] and funding certain [[social welfare]] and housing programs are being debated in the U.S. Congress and in communities around the country. In order for the government to represent the people, citizens must vote — especially those who are economically disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=NCH&gt;{{cite web |title = You Don't Need a Home to Vote |url = http://nationalhomeless.org/campaigns/voting/ |publisher = National Coalition for the Homeless |accessdate = 22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A model of how to overcome obstacles and encourage greater voter participation among low-income and homeless citizens was provided by the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] and other national advocacy and grassroots social movement groups. These groups collaborated to create a manual that promotes voting access for low income and homeless persons, to ensure that those who are economically disadvantaged maintain an active role in shaping their futures. The manual is designed to cultivate ideas to help overcome the many obstacles that prevent people experiencing homelessness from becoming registered, active voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhomeless.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Manual_2012.pdf|format=PDF|title=Voting Rights: Registration Manual : You Don't Need a Home to Vote|date=August 2012|website=Nationalhomeless.org|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working together with homeless persons, low-income individuals, and advocates around the country, grassroots social movement organizations can help ensure their voices heard on Election Day.

=== Legislation and legal pro bono efforts ===
In 1979 a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class-action suit, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's constitutional "right to shelter". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.

By the mid-1980s, there was a dramatic increase in family homelessness. Tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished and runaway children, teenagers, and young adults, which created a new substratum of the homeless population ([[street children]] or street youth).&lt;ref&gt;Tull, Tanya, [http://wiki.nlchp.org/download/attachments/7438857/TANYA+TULL+TESTIMONY-Maxine+Waters+Hearing.doc?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1239895515000 "Beyond Shelter: Testimony of Tanya Tull, President/CEO Before the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunities House Committee on Financial Services March 28, 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124538/http://wiki.nlchp.org/download/attachments/7438857/TANYA+TULL+TESTIMONY-Maxine+Waters+Hearing.doc?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1239895515000 |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nunez, Ralph, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/798021 "Family Homelessness in New York City: A Case Study"], ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 116, No. 3 (Autumn, 2001), pp. 367–379, The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Steven, [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1883966,00.html "Report Says 1 in 50 U.S. Kids Is Homeless"], ''Time'' magazine, Tuesday, 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1980s, in the United States, some federal legislation was introduced on homelessness as a result of the work of Congressman [[Stewart McKinney (politician)|Stewart B. McKinney]]. In 1987, the [[McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] was enacted.

{{See|List of homelessness organizations}}
There are many community organizations and social movements around the world which are taking action to reduce homelessness. They have sought to counteract the causes and reduce the consequences by starting initiatives that help homeless people transition to self-sufficiency. Social movements and initiatives tend to follow a [[grassroots]], community-based model of organization – generally characterized by a loose, informal and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on radical protest politics. By contrast, an [[interest group]] aims to influence government policies by relying on more of a formal organization structure.&lt;ref name="Organizing the Homeless"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Anker |first = J. |title = Organizing homeless people: Exploring the emergence of a user organization in Denmark |journal = Critical Social Policy |date = 1 February 2008 |volume = 28 |issue = 1 |pages = 27–50 |doi = 10.1177/0261018307085506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups share a common element: they are both made up of and run by a mix of allies of the homeless population and former or current members of the homeless population. Both grassroots groups and interest groups aim to break stereotyped images of the homeless as being weak and hapless, or defiant criminals and drug addicts, and to ensure that the voice of homeless people and their representatives is clearly heard by policymakers.

=== Urban homeless shelters ===
[[Homeless shelters]] are most often night shelters, where people leave in the morning to do whatever they can manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelter open up again for sleeping. An example of a homeless shelter is Pine Street Inn in Boston's South End neighborhood. There are some daytime shelters where people might go instead of being stranded on the street, and to receive meals, counseling, avail themselves of resources, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is [[Saint Francis House (Boston)|Saint Francis House]] in [[Boston]], founded in the early 1980s, which is open to the homeless all year long during daytime hours and was originally based on the [[settlement movement|settlement house]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, Thomas, Jr., [http://tomkeane.com/archives/2003/tom07042003.htm "Greiff's activism isn't just a good act"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424045012/http://tomkeane.com/archives/2003/tom07042003.htm |date=24 April 2008 }}, Friday, 4 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Many homeless people keep all their possessions with them because they have no access to storage. There have been "bag" people, shopping cart people, and soda can collectors (known as [[binner]]s or dumpster divers) who sort through garbage to find items to sell, trade, or eat. Such people have typically carried all their possessions with them all the time. If they had no access to or ability to get to a shelter and possible bathing, or access to toilets and laundry facilities, their hygiene was lacking. This has created social tensions in public places.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

These conditions have created an upsurge in [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]], [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019922.htm "Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Among Homeless Persons : Recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis"], 17 April 1992 / 41(RR-5);001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slutkin G. Management of tuberculosis in urban homeless indigents. Public Health Rep 1986;101(5):481–485. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAdam J, Brickner PW, Glicksman R, Edwards D, Fallon B, Yanowitch P. Tuberculosis in the SRO/homeless population. In: Brickner PW, Scharer LK, Conanan B, Elvy A, Savarese M, eds. Health care of homeless people. New York: Springer, 1985:155–175. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Kip Tiernan founded [[Rosie's Place]] in Boston, the first drop-in and emergency shelter for women in the United States, in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country.

=== Refuges and alternative accommodation ===
There are various places where a homeless person might seek refuge:
* '''24-hour [[Internet cafes]]''' are now used by over 5,000 Japanese "[[Net cafe refugees]]". An estimated 75% of Japan's 3,200 all-night internet cafes cater to regular overnight guests, who in some cases have become their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tokyo dreaming |author = Justin McCurry |publisher = The Guardian |date = 28 September 2007 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2178925,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''24-hour [[McDonald's]] restaurants''' are used by "[[McRefugee]]s" in Japan, China and Hong Kong. There are about 250 McRefugees in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/1900562/lives-others-where-hong-kongs-wealth-abandons |title = The lives of others: where Hong Kong’s wealth abandons those without shelter |last = Lam |first = Evangeline |date = 13 January 2016 |work = South China Morning Post |access-date = 15 April 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Derelict structures''': abandoned or condemned buildings
* '''Friends or family''': temporary sleeping arrangements in dwellings of friends or family members ("couch surfing"). Couch surfers may be harder to recognize than street homeless people&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Susan, [http://www.insidetoronto.com/News/York/article/11919  "Homeless advocates urge council to remember 'couch surfers'"], ''Inside Toronto'', Canada, 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Homeless shelter]]s''': including emergency cold-weather shelters opened by [[Church body|churches]] or community agencies, which may consist of cots in a heated warehouse, or temporary [[Christmas Shelters]]. More elaborate homeless shelters such as Pinellas Hope in Florida provide residents with a recreation tent, a dining tent, laundry facilities, outdoor tents, casitas, and shuttle services that help inhabitants get to their jobs each day.&lt;ref name="radioproject.org" /&gt;
* '''Inexpensive [[boarding house]]s''': have also been called [[flophouse]]s. They offer cheap, low-quality temporary lodging.
* '''Inexpensive [[motels]]''' offer cheap, low-quality temporary lodging. However, some who can afford housing live in a motel by choice.

* '''Public places''': [[Park]]s, [[bus]] or [[train station]]s, [[public libraries]], [[airport]]s, [[public transportation]] vehicles (by continual riding where unlimited passes are available), hospital lobbies or waiting areas, [[college]] campuses, and 24-hour businesses such as [[café|coffee shops]]. Many public places use security guards or police to prevent people from loitering or sleeping at these locations for a variety of reasons, including image, safety, and comfort of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kleinig, John |title = Policing the Homeless: an ethical dilemma |journal = Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless |volume = 2 |issue = 4 |date = October 1993 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g761175417103502/?p=52eafdf57fcd4aabbe1b8b7b29b2191a&amp;pi=2 |doi = 10.1007/BF01065524 |pages = 289–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Brandt, David E. |title = Social Distress and the police |journal = Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless |volume = 2 |issue = 4 |date = October 1993 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u286666x7836g6g5/?p=195e7127e77745759c2fad73f0693c2b&amp;pi=3 |doi = 10.1007/BF01065525 |pages = 305–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Residential [[hotel]]s''', where a bed as opposed to an entire room can be rented cheaply in a dorm-like environment.
* '''[[Shantytown]]s''': ad hoc dwelling sites of improvised shelters and [[shack]]s, usually near [[rail yard]]s, [[interstates]] and high transportation veins. Some shantytowns have interstitial tenting areas, but the predominant feature consists of hard structures. Each pad or site tends to accumulate roofing, sheathing, plywood, and nailed two by fours.
* '''[[Squatting]]''' in an unoccupied structure where a homeless person may live without payment and without the owner's knowledge or permission.
* '''[[Tent city|Tent cities]]''': ad hoc campsites of tents and improvised shelters consisting of tarpaulins and blankets, often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as [[rail yard]]s, [[highways]] and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate tent cities, such as [[Dignity Village]], are hybrids of tent cities and shantytowns. Tent cities frequently consist only of tents and fabric improvised structures, with no semi-permanent structures at all.
*'''Tiny Houses and Micro-shelters:''' small, inexpensive homes known as “[[Tiny house movement|tiny houses]]” or “[[Micro shelters|micro-shelters]]” have been increasingly used as alternative housing for the homeless in certain cities. On the high end, these dwellings can include utilities and furnishings (tiny houses); on the lower end they can be simply a covered structure large enough to accommodate a sleeping area (micro-shelters). Some of the micro-shelters popping up in cities around the world include wheels for easy transport and can be relocated by manually pushing; tiny houses usually require towing by a vehicle. Several cities have designated areas where tiny houses and micro-shelters can be located. Nonprofit organizations and sole individuals construct and donate these structures for the homeless.
*'''Outdoors''': on the ground or in a [[sleeping bag]], [[tent]], or improvised shelter, such as a large [[cardboard box]], under a bridge, in an urban doorway, in a park or a vacant lot.
* '''Underground tunnels''' such as abandoned subway, maintenance, or train tunnels are popular among the long-term or permanent homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Margaret, "The Tunnel: The Underground Homeless of New York City (Architecture of Despair)", Yale University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-300-06559-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toth, Jennifer, "The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City", Chicago Review Press, 1 October 1995. {{ISBN|1-55652-190-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vehicles''': cars or trucks used as temporary or sometimes long-term living quarters, for example by those recently evicted from a home. Some people live in [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs), [[school bus]]es, [[van]]s, [[sport utility vehicle]]s, covered [[pick-up truck]]s, [[station wagon]]s, [[sedan (car)|sedans]], or [[hatchback]]s. The [[Vehicle dweller|vehicular homeless]], according to homeless advocates and researchers, comprise the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population.&lt;ref name="Vehicular Homeless"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last = Brenoff |first = Ann |title = 7 Myths About Homeless People Debunked |journal = Huffington Post |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/03/7-things-homeless-people-not-true_n_5206475.html |accessdate = 4 May 2014 |date = 2014-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities have safe parking programs in which lawful sites are permitted at churches or in other out-of-the-way locations. For example, because it is illegal to park on the street in Santa Barbara, the New Beginnings Counseling Center worked with the city to make designated parking lots available to the homeless.&lt;ref name="radioproject.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.radioproject.org/2009/02/how-we-survive-the-deepening-homeless-crisis/ |title = How We Survive: The Deepening Homeless Crisis |work = Making Contact Radio: Media that helps build movements |accessdate = 17 September 2014 |date = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of such refuges are called in some places, like New York City, "[[Mole People]]". Natural caves beneath urban centers allow for places where people can congregate. Leaking water pipes, electric wires, and steam pipes allow for some of the essentials of living.

=== Other housing options ===
'''Transitional housing'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Transitional housing]] provides temporary housing for the certain segments of the homeless population, including the working homeless, and is meant to transition residents into permanent, affordable housing. This is usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services. The transitional time can be relatively short, for example, one or two years, and in that time the person must file for and obtain permanent housing along with gainful employment or income, even if Social Security or assistance. Sometimes transitional housing programs charge a room and board fee, maybe 30% of an individual's income, which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent residence. In the U.S., federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Martha R.,
[http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411369_transitional_housing.pdf "Characteristics of Transitional Housing for Homeless Families Final Report"], Urban Institute, Washington, DC, 7 September 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dordick, Gwendolyn A., [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7110354uw2164n7/ "Recovering from Homelessness: Determining the 'Quality of Sobriety' in a Transitional Housing Program"], ''Journal Qualitative Sociology'', Volume 25, Number 1 / March 2002, Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/graduate "The Graduate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724080935/http://sparechangenews.net/news/graduate |date=24 July 2011 }}, ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, 11 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supportive housing'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Supportive housing]] is a combination of housing and services intended as a cost-effective way to help people live more stable, productive lives. Supportive housing works well for those who face the most complex challenges — individuals and families confronted with homelessness who also have very low incomes and/or serious, persistent issues such as substance abuse, addictions, [[alcoholism]], [[mental illness]], [[HIV/AIDS]], or other serious challenges.

'''Pedestrian villages'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2007, urban designer and social theorist [[Michael E. Arth]] proposed a controversial national solution for homelessness involving the building of nearly car-free "Pedestrian Villages" in place of what he terms "the current band-aid approach to the problem."&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth, "A National Solution to Homelessness That Begins Here", Orlando Sentinel, 20 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype, Tiger Bay Village, was proposed for near [[Daytona Beach]], FL. He claimed this would be superior for treating the psychological and psychiatric needs of both temporarily and permanently homeless adults, and would cost less. It would provide a lower cost alternative to jail, and provide a half-way station for those getting out of prison. Work opportunities, including construction and maintenance of the villages, as well as the creation of workforce agencies would help make the villages financially and socially viable.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Leonard, "Daytona may give vagrants their own resort." Telegraph.co.uk,  24 January 2007 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/23/wdaytona23.xml/ link to article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etan Horowitz, "Developer defends homeless-village concept", ''Orlando Sentinel'', 27 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebbecca Mahoney, "Homeless village or leper colony?" Orlando Sentinel, 20 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Government initiatives'''&lt;br /&gt;
In South Australia, the state government of Premier Mike Rann (2002-2011) committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness. Advised by Social Inclusion Commissioner [[David Cappo]] and the founder of New York's [[Common Ground (New York City)|Common Ground]] program, [[Rosanne Haggerty]], the Rann government established Common Ground Adelaide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.commongroundadelaide.org.au |title = Common Ground |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, building high-quality inner city apartments (combined with intensive support) for "rough sleeping" homeless people. The government also funded the Street to Home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people admitted to the emergency departments of Adelaide's major public hospitals. Rather than being released back into homelessness, patients identified as rough sleepers were found accommodation backed by professional support. Common Ground and Street to Home now operate across Australia in other States.

==== Savings from housing homeless in the US ====
In 2013, a Central Florida Commission on Homelessness study indicated that the region spends $31,000 a year per homeless person to cover "salaries of law enforcement officers to arrest and transport homeless individuals — largely for nonviolent offenses such as trespassing, public intoxication or sleeping in parks — as well as the cost of jail stays, emergency room visits and hospitalization for medical and psychiatric issues. This did not include "money spent by nonprofit agencies to feed, clothe and sometimes shelter these individuals". In contrast, the report estimated the cost of permanent supportive housing at "$10,051 per person per year" and concluded that "[h]ousing even half of the region's chronically homeless population would save taxpayers $149 million over the next decade — even allowing for 10 percent to end up back on the streets again." This particular study followed 107 long-term-homeless residents living in Orange, Osceola or Seminole Counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-05-21/news/os-cost-of-homelessness-orlando-20140521_1_homeless-individuals-central-florida-commission-tulsa |title = Cost of homelessness in Central Florida? $31K per person |date = 21 May 2014 |newspaper = [[The Orlando Sentinel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar studies showing large financial savings in Charlotte and Southeastern Colorado from focusing on simply housing the homeless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/05/27/3441772/florida-homeless-financial-study/ |title = Leaving Homeless Person On The Streets: $31,065.

Yet at the same time, they have reduced access to public medical services or clinics,&lt;ref name="HCAH"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/health.html |title = Health Care and Homelessness |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because they often lack identification or registration for public healthcare services. There are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders because clinical appointments may not be kept, their continuing whereabouts are unknown, their medicines may not be taken as prescribed, medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate, and other reasons. Because [[Homelessness and mental health|many homeless people have mental illnesses]], this has presented a crisis in care.&lt;ref name="SEGAL1980" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McQuistion, Hunter L.; Finnerty, Molly; Hirschowitz, Jack; Susser, Ezra S., "Challenges for Psychiatry in Serving Homeless People With Psychiatric Disorders", ''Psychiatric Services'' 54:669–676, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Jean-Marc; Boyer, Laurent; Belzeaux, Raoul; Baumstarck-Barrau, Karine; Samuelian, Jean-Claude, "Mental Disorders Among Homeless People Admitted to a French Psychiatric Emergency Service", ''Psychiatric Services'' 61:264–271, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless people may find it difficult to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a [[Photo identification|photo ID]], homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including healthcare. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]].&lt;ref&gt;National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, [http://www.nlchp.org/view_report.cfm?id=128 "Photo Identification Barriers Faced by Homeless Persons"].&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the U.S., free-care clinics for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but often attract more demand than they can meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Moore |first1 = Grace Elizabeth |title = No Angels Here: The Closing of the Pine Street Inn Nurses Clinic, 1972–2003 |url = http://www.hds.harvard.edu/cswr/resources/print/rhb/body/08.moore.pdf |website = Center for the Study of World Religions, Harvard Divinity School |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525202843/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/cswr/resources/print/rhb/body/08.moore.pdf |archivedate = 25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions affecting homeless people are somewhat specialized and have opened a new area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including [[scabies]], are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold in the winter and have little access to bathing facilities.

There are many organizations providing free care to homeless people in countries which do not offer free state-run medical treatment, but the services are in great demand given the limited number of medical practitioners. For example, it might take months to get a minimal dental appointment in a free-care clinic. Communicable diseases are of great concern, especially [[tuberculosis]], which spreads more easily in crowded homeless shelters in high-density urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Collet Marc, [[Georges Menahem|Menahem, Georges]], Picard, Hervé,  [http://www.irdes.fr/EspaceAnglais/Publications/IrdesPublications/QES113.pdf "Why patients attending free health centres seek care: Precalog Survey 1999–2000"], Health Economics Letter, Issues in health economics, IRDES (Institute for Research and Information in Health Economics), Paris, France. n° 113- October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There has been ongoing concern and studies about the health and wellness of the older homeless population, typically ages 50 to 64,  and older, as to whether they are significantly more sickly than their younger counterparts and if they are under-served.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Dennis P.; George, Christine; Walker, Christopher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEvI1Swbx_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover "Falling through the cracks: health care needs of the older homeless population and their implications"], in Kronenfeld, Jennie Jacobs, ''Care for Major Health Problems and Population Health Concerns: Impacts on Patients, Providers and Policy'', Research in the Sociology of Health Care series, 2008, v.26, pp.187–204, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Cohen Carl I |year = 1999 |title = Aging and Homelessness |url = http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/1/5.abstract |journal = The Gerontologist |volume = 39 |issue = 1 |pages = 5–15 |doi = 10.1093/geront/39.1.5 |pmid = 10028766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study led by Dr. Rebecca{{nbsp}}T. Brown in Boston, conducted by the Institute for Aging Research (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School), [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program found the elderly homeless population had "higher rates of geriatric syndromes, including functional decline, falls, frailty and depression than seniors in the general population and that many of these conditions may be easily treated if detected". The report was published in the Journal of Geriatric Internal Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110913152936.htm |title = Boston's Elderly Homeless Sicker Than Others, Research Finds |work = ScienceDaily |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are government avenues which provide resources for the development of healthcare for the homeless.

These organizations help meet the large need which exists for expanding healthcare for the homeless.

The 2010 passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] could provide new healthcare options for the homeless in the United States, particularly through the optional expansion of Medicaid. A 2013 Yale study indicated that a substantial proportion of the chronically homeless population in America would be able to obtain Medicaid coverage if states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tsai |first = Jack |author2 = Rosenheck, Robert A. |author3 = Culhane, Dennis |author4 = Artiga, Samantha |title = Medicaid expansion: Chronically homeless adults will need targeted enrollment and access to a broad range of services |journal = Health Affairs |volume = 32 |issue = 9 |pages = 1552–1559 |pmid = 24019359 |doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0228 |date = September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on life expectancy ===
In 1999, Dr. Susan Barrow of the Columbia University Center for Homelessness Prevention Studies reported in a study that the "age-adjusted death rates of homeless men and women were four times those of the general U.S. population and two to three times those of the general population of New York City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Barrow SM, Herman DB, Córdova P, Struening EL |title = Mortality among homeless shelter residents in New York City |journal = Am J Public Health |volume = 89 |issue = 4 |pages = 529–534 |date = April 1999 |pmid = 10191796 |pmc = 1508869 |url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10191796 |doi = 10.2105/AJPH.89.4.529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report commissioned by homeless charity [[Crisis (charity)|Crisis]] in 2011 found that on average, homeless people in the UK have a life expectancy of 47 years, 30 years younger than the rest of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16272120 |title = Homeless people die 30 years younger, study suggests |journal = BBC News |accessdate = 17 September 2014 |date = 2011-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics for developed countries ===
In 2005, an estimated 100 million people worldwide were homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Capdevila, Gustavo, [http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 "Human Rights:  More Than 100 Million Homeless Worldwide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422025345/http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 |date=22 April 2009 }}, IPS, [[Geneva]].&lt;/ref&gt; The following statistics indicate the approximate average number of homeless people at any one time.  Each country has a different approach to counting homeless people, and estimates of homelessness made by different organizations vary wildly, so comparisons should be made with caution.

This number had increased from January 2009's 643,067. The unsheltered count increased by 2.8 percent while the sheltered count remained the same. Also, HUD reported the number of chronically homeless people (persons with severe disabilities and long homeless histories) decreased one percent between 2009 and 2010, from 110,917 to 109,812. Since 2007 this number had decreased by 11 percent. This was mostly due to the expansion of permanent supportive housing programs.

:The change in numbers has occurred due to the prevalence of homelessness in local communities rather than other changes. According to HUD's July 2010 Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, more than 1.59 million people spent at least one night in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during the 2010 reporting period, a 2.2 percent increase from 2009. Most users of homeless shelters used only an emergency shelter, while 17 percent used only transitional housing, and less than 5 percent used both during the reporting period. Since 2007, the annual number of those using homeless shelters in cities has decreased from 1.22 million to 1.02 million, a 17 percent decrease. The number of persons using homeless shelters in suburban and rural areas increased 57 percent, from 367,000 to 576,000.&lt;ref name="2010HUDReport"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-121 |title = HUD 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140913220449/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fpress%2Fpress_releases_media_advisories%2F2011%2FHUDNo.11-121 |archive-date = 13 September 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the federal government's HUD agency has required federally-funded organizations to use a computer tracking system for homeless people and their statistics, called HMIS (Homeless Management Information System).&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Nan, [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/132/WNV.html "Tracking the Homeless: An Overview of HMIS"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913082605/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/132/WNV.html |date=13 September 2007 }}, ShelterForce Magazine, Issue #132, November/December 2003, National Housing Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/hmis/ |title = HUD information on HMIS |website = Hud.gov |accessdate = 7 December 2017 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925222934/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/hmis/ |archivedate = 25 September 2006 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Libby, [https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2005/meta-crs-7973.tkl "The Home Management Information System"], Congressional Research Service, CRS Report RS22328, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some opposition to this kind of tracking by privacy advocacy groups, such as [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|EPIC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epic.org/privacy/poverty/ |title = EPIC page on HMIS privacy |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developing and undeveloped countries ===
The number of homeless people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Zarocostas, John, [http://washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/10/20050410-105739-5991r/ "Homelessness increasing all over the world"], [[The Washington Times]], 11 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capdevila, Gustavo, [http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 "Human Rights: More Than 100 Million Homeless Worldwide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422025345/http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 |date=22 April 2009 }}, IPS (Inter Press Service), 30 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[developing country|developing countries]] such as [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], homelessness is rampant, with millions of children living and working on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;The Urban Poverty Group, [http://www.homeless-international.org/doc_docs/UPGCommissionforAfricaSubmission(FINAL)__Dec0425958.pdf "Urban Poverty Group submission to the Commission for Africa"], [[Homeless International]], December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-HABITAT]], [http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=3008&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 "The Challenge of Slums&amp;nbsp;– UN-HABITAT's new Global Report on Human Settlements"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221182227/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=3008&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |date=21 December 2008 }}, 10 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Homelessness has become a problem in the countries of China, [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]] despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes.&lt;ref&gt;YXC Project, [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]]/[[UNESCO]], [http://www.youthxchange.net/main/b236_homeless-i.asp "Homeless: Developing Countries"]. "Homelessness has also become a problem in the cities of China, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes and to rising income inequality between social classes."&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining the true number of homeless people worldwide varies between 100 million and 1 billion people based on the exact definition used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Tipple |first1 = Graham |last2 = Speak |first2 = Suzanne |year = 2005 |title = Definitions of Homelessness in Developing Countries |url =  |journal = Habitat International |volume = 29 |issue = 2 |pages = 337–52 |doi = 10.1016/j.habitatint.2003.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced persons (ITDs)  can also be considered homeless in that they too experience "marginalization, minority status, socio-economic disadvantage, poor physical health, collapse of social supports, psychological distress, and difficulty adapting to host cultures" like the domestic homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Kassam, A., &amp; Nanji, A. (2006). [http://www.interventionjournal.com/sites/default/files/kassam.pdf Mental health of Afghan refugees in Pakistan: A qualitative rapid reconnaissance field study]. Intervention, 4, 58–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past twenty years, scholars like Tipple and Speak have begun to refer to homelessness as the "antithesis or absence of home" rather than rooflessness or the "lack of physical shelter." This complication in the homelessness debate further delineates the idea that home actually consists of an adequate shelter, an experienced and dynamic place that serves as a "base" for nurturing human relationships and the "free development of individuals" and their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Springer |first1 = Sabine |year = 2000 |title = Homelessness: A Proposal for a Global Definition and Classification |url =  |journal = Habitat International |volume = 24 |issue = 4 |pages = 475–84 |doi = 10.1016/s0197-3975(00)00010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the home is perceived to be an extension of one's self and identity. In contrast, the homeless experience, according to Moore, constitutes more as a "lack of belonging" and a loss of identity that leads to individuals or communities feeling "out of place" once they can no longer call a place of their own home &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Moore |first1 = Jeanne |year = 2007 |title = Polarity or Integration? Towards a Fuller Understanding of Home and Homelessness |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228456398 |journal = Journal of Architectural and Planning Research |volume = 24 |issue = 2 |pages = 143–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new perspective on homelessness sheds light on the plight of refugees, a population of stateless people who are not normally included in the mainstream definition of homelessness. It has also created problems for researchers because the nature of "counting" homeless people across the globe relies heavily on who is considered a homeless person. Homeless individuals, and by extension refugees, can be seen as lacking lack the "crucible of our modern society" and lacking a way of actively belonging to and engaging with their respective communities or cultures &lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Peter. A Nation of Home Owners. London: Unwin Hyman, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As Casavant demonstrates, a spectrum of definitions for homelessness, called the "continuum of homelessness," should refer to refugees as homeless individuals because they not only lose their home, but they are also afflicted with a myriad of problems that parallel those affecting the domestic homeless, such as "[a lack of] stable, safe and healthy housing, an extremely low income, adverse discrimination in access to services, with problems of mental health, alcohol, and drug abuse or social disorganization" &lt;ref&gt;Casavant, Lyne. "Definition of Homelessness." Definition of Homelessness (PRB99-1E). Parliamentary Research Branch, Jan. 1999. Web. 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees, like the domestic homeless, lose their source of identity and way of connecting with their culture for an indefinite period of time.

Thus, the current definition of homelessness unfortunately allows people to simplistically assume that homeless people, including refugees, are merely "without a place to live" when that is not the case. As numerous studies show, forced migration and displacement brings with it another host of problems including socioeconomic instability, "increased stress, isolation, and new responsibilities" in a completely new environment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Meghan |first1 = Morris D. |last2 = Popper |first2 = Steve T. |last3 = Rodwell |first3 = Timothy C. |last4 = Brodine |first4 = Stephanie K. |last5 = Brouwer |first5 = Kimberly C. |year = 2009 |title = Healthcare Barriers of Refugees Post-resettlement |journal = Journal of Community Health |volume = 34 |issue = 6 |pages = 529–38 |pmid = 19705264 |doi=10.1007/s10900-009-9175-3 |pmc=2778771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor urban housing conditions are a global problem, but conditions are worst in developing countries. Habitat says that today 600 million people live in life- and health-threatening homes in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For example, more than three in four young people had insufficient means of shelter and sanitation in some African countries like [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;(2010) [https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/WYR2010Final%20online%20version.pdf "The world youth report; youth and climate change"], New York: United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; "The threat of mass homelessness is greatest in those regions because that is where population is growing fastest.

In Australia the [[Supported Accommodation Assistance Program]] (SAAP) is a joint Commonwealth and state government program  which provides funding for more than 1,200 organisations which are aimed to assist homeless people or those in danger of becoming homeless, as well as women and children escaping [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10191|title=Demand for SAAP assistance by homeless people 2003–04 (AIHW)|website=Aihw.gov.au|accessdate=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426064046/http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10191|archive-date=26 April 2010|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide accommodation such as refuges, shelters, and half-way houses, and offer a range of supported services. The Commonwealth has assigned over $800 million between 2000 and 2005 for the continuation of SAAP. The current program, governed by the Supported Assistance Act 1994, specifies that "the overall aim of SAAP is to provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. This legislation has been established to help the homeless people of the nation and help rebuild the lives of those in need. The cooperation of the states also helps enhance the meaning of the legislation and demonstrates their desire to improve the nation as best they can." In 2011, the Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) program replaced the SAAP program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/supported-accommodation-assistance-program/ |title = Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) (AIHW) |website = Aihw.gov.au |access-date = 13 September 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919081717/http://www.aihw.gov.au/supported-accommodation-assistance-program/ |archive-date = 19 September 2016 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the number of [[homeless]] people grew in the 1980s, as welfare cuts increased.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Hearing op. cit., May 1984, p. 32 IUD Office for Policy Development and Research, A Report to the Secretary on the Homeless and Emergency Shelters, 1 May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Housing first|Housing First]] is an initiative to help homeless people reintegrate into society, and out of homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's [[Interagency Council on Homelessness]]. It asks cities to come up with a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, then there would be no need for emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Florence; Sayfan, Hadar,  [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/06/24/first_things_first/ "First things first: 'Housing first,' a radical new approach to ending chronic homelessness, is gaining ground in Boston"], ''Boston Globe'', Sunday, 24 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roncarati, Jill, [http://www.bhchp.org/documents/JillsoundingboardJAAP0608.pdf "Homeless, housed, and homeless again"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230083813/http://www.bhchp.org/documents/JillsoundingboardJAAP0608.pdf |date=30 December 2008 }}, Journal of the American Academy of Physician's Assistants, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami, Florida's [[Community Housing Partnership|Community Partnership for Homeless]] launched a national outreach program in 2008 to help other communities throughout the United States address homelessness. Since its inception in 1993, CPH has served nearly 76,000 residents with a successful outplacement rate of nearly 62 percent in Miami-Dade County, Florida.  The number of homeless people in the county has declined by 83 percent. The national program shares CPH's model of Homeless Assistance Centers, job training programs, on-site childcare, housing assistance and more. The organization also provides background on its unique funding structure and partnerships within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cphi.org |title = Community Partnership for Homeless |work = Chapman Partnership |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Homelessness has increased rapidly in the past decade. Domestic violence, substance abuse, losing jobs, unaffordable rent and issues with family are significant contributing factors.
[[File:Street Sleeper 8 by DS.JPG|thumb|A homeless man sleeping in the [[Bowery]] neighborhood]]

In the Bowery, homelessness used to be common, but has declined since the 1970s. The area began revitalization in the 1990s and now is an upscale Manhattan neighborhood.

Carrfour Supportive Housing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.carrfour.org |title = Carrfour Supportive Housing |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit organization established in 1993 by the Homeless Committee of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce – develops, operates and manages innovative housing communities for individuals and families in need through a unique approach combining affordable housing with comprehensive, on-site supportive services. As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly homeless men, women and children since its founding. 

In [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 2007, a non-profit organization named [[Back on My Feet (non-profit organization)|Back on My Feet]] was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a [[running]] club for homeless men and women in the area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and [[sobriety]]. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. Back on My Feet counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Seward |first = Zack |title = Making a run for it: How Philly's Back on My Feet went national |url = http://www.bomfbeta.org/sites/default/files/WHYY_8_10_12.pdf |work = NewsWorks |publisher = WHYY |accessdate = 11 March 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521170007/http://www.bomfbeta.org/sites/default/files/WHYY_8_10_12.pdf |archive-date = 21 May 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bomfmiss&gt;{{cite web |title = Mission &amp; Process |url = http://www.backonmyfeet.org/mission-process |work = backonmyfeet.org |publisher = Back on My Feet |accessdate = 11 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in September 2007, an outreach to homeless people was established in the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]], after some arrests and shootings, and in anticipation of the cold winter ahead. This outreach targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on the Boston Common, and tries to get them into housing, trying to skip the step of an emergency shelter. Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally mandated. Boston's Mayor, [[Thomas Menino]], was quoted as saying "The solution to homelessness is permanent housing". Still, this is a very controversial strategy, especially if the people are not able to sustain a house with a proper community, health, substance counseling, and mental health supportive programs.&lt;ref&gt;St. Martin, Greg, [http://www.metrobostonnews.com/us/article/2007/09/17/02/2107-72/index.xml "Seeking help for homeless on Common: Program hopes to offer housing"], ''Boston Metro'' newspaper, Monday, 17 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, as part of the city's ''Leading the Way'' initiative, Mayor [[Thomas Menino|Thomas M. Menino]] of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day Center which is the first city-operated day center for chronically homeless persons. It is a multi-service center, providing shelter, counseling, healthcare, housing assistance, and other support services. It is a {{convert|3400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility located in the Woods Mullen Shelter. It is also meant to reduce the strain on the city's hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying health problems before they escalate into emergencies. It was funded by $3 million in grants from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.massmed.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2 |title = Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation website |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA).&lt;ref&gt;Mayor's Office, City of Boston, [http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=4390 "Mayor Menino Dedicates New Day Center for the Homeless"], Press Release, 14 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enhanced data collection and evaluation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Homeless enumeration counts are mandated by HUD for all jurisdictions participating in HUD Continuum of Care grant programs. These occur as frequently as every two years. More recently, organizations such as Common Ground have compiled [[Vulnerability Index]]es which prioritize homeless persons. The factors include the existence of late stage terminal disease, HIV-AIDS, kidney or liver disease, frequent hospitalizations and frequent emergency room visits. The data which is compiled which exceeds the BUD mandate is retained and held confidential by Common Ground. Advocates of the system claim high rates of success in placing the most vulnerable persons, but skeptics remain concerned with confidentiality and security issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Since the late 1990s, housing policy has been a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved matter]], and state support for the homeless, together with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called '''Streetlink''', was established in 2012 to help members of the public obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, with the support of the Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetlink.org.uk/|title=StreetLink|website=www.streetlink.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).

The annual number of homeless households in England peaked in 2003–04 at 135,420 before falling to a low of 40,020 in 2009–10. In 2014–15, there were 54,430 homeless households, which was 60 per cent below the 2003–04 peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/463017/201506_Statutory_Homelessness.pdf |title = Statutory Homelessness: April to June Quarter 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|The UK]] has more than 80,000 children in temporary accommodation, a number which increases every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = More than 80,000 children homeless for Christmas |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24798498 |accessdate = 22 July 2015 |agency = BBC UK |date = 4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 80,000 children facing homelessness this Christmas |url = http://england.shelter.org.uk/news/november_2013/80,000_children_facing_homelessness_this_christmas |website = Shelter England |accessdate = 22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 the official figures for [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20071001220358/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/hspolicybrief20 "Homelessness Statistics September 2007 and Rough Sleeping – 10 Years on from the Target"] September 2007 Department for Communities and Local Government: London&lt;/ref&gt; were that an average of 498 people slept rough each night, with 248 of those in [[London]].

In [[Sweden]], [[municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] are required to provide a home to any citizen who does not have one. However, landlords and lessors have the right to select guests among applicants. Owners, including municipalities themselves, avoid homeless people, unemployed people or people with a bad [[credit score]]. People who cannot pay their rent will be evicted, including families with small children. In 2009, 618 children were evicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/farre-barn-vraktes-i-fjol-1.1027099 |title = Färre barn vräktes i fjol|website=Dn.se|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities with a lack of housing, the only options for homeless are usually shelters; usually privately owned, often of bad quality, for which municipalities pay.

In 2007 the centre-right [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|government of Matti Vanhanen]] began a special program of ''four wise men'' modeled after a US-originated [[Housing First]] policy to eliminate homelessness in Finland by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.fi/download.asp?contentid=22654&amp;lan=en|title=Finnish government's programme to reduce long-term homelessness 2008–2011|website=Ara.fi|accessdate=7 December 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=17791&amp;lan=en|title=Reducing homelessness|website=Ymparisto.fi|accessdate=7 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204155041/http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=17791&amp;lan=en|archivedate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia and the USSR ===
{{Main|Homelessness in Russia }}
After the abolition of [[serfdom in Russia]] in 1861, major cities experienced a large influx of former peasants who sought jobs as industrial workers in rapidly developing Russian industry. These people often lived in harsh conditions, sometimes renting a room shared between several families. There also was a large number of shelterless homeless. Immediately after the [[October Revolution]] a special program of "compression" ("уплотнение") was enabled: people who had no shelter were settled in flats of those who had large (4, 5 or 6 room) flats with only one room left to previous owners. The flat was declared state property. This led to a large number of [[Kommunalka|shared flats]]  where several families lived simultaneously. Nevertheless, the problem of complete homelessness was mostly solved as anybody could apply for a room or a place in dormitory (the number of shared flats steadily decreased after large-scale residential building program was implemented starting in the 1960s).

By 1922 there were at least [[Orphans in the Soviet Union|7 million homeless children in Russia]] as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_/ai_n8801575 |title = And Now My Soul Is Hardened: Abandoned Children in Soviet Russia, 1918–1930 |publisher =  |accessdate = 17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of a large number of orphanages. By the 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a [[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]&amp;nbsp;– a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called "order") to register in another place. If someone wanted to move to another city or expand their living area, he had to find a partner who wanted to mutually exchange the flats. The right for shelter was secured in the Soviet constitution. Not having permanent residency was legally considered a crime.

After the breakup of the USSR, the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. In 1991 articles 198 and 209 of Russian criminal code which instituted a criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished. In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://kulac.narod.ru/statya/bomz.html |title = Бездомность вчера, сегодня... Завтра?|website=Kulac.narod.ru|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.

Nevertheless, the state is still obliged to give permanent shelter for free to anybody who needs better living conditions or has no permanent registration, because the right to shelter is still included in the constitution. Several projects of special cheap 'social' flats for those who failed to repay mortgages were proposed to facilitate mortgage market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/H/Hoejdestrand_T_01.htm |title = Höjdestrand, Tova: The Soviet-Russian production of homelessness: propiska, housing, privatisation|website=Anthrobase.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puerto Rico ===
According to the most recent count by the [[Puerto Rico]] Department of Family, in January 2017 there were 3,501 homeless persons in the country. The study shows that 26.2% of this population live in the capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Other municipalities percentage of this population was Ponce with 6.3%, Arecibo with 6%, Caguas with 5.3%, and Mayagüez with 4.7%. Results from the study determined that 76% of the homeless population were men and 24% were women and that both men and women populations, were on average age, 40 years old.

Data provided by the Department of Community Social Development of San Juan, indicates that in 1988 the number of homeless in the municipality was of 368, while in 2017 there are about 877 persons without a home. While the average age for the overall homeless population is 40 years old for both women and men, in San Juan the [[median]] is 48 years for men and 43 years for women. Other data obtained showed that more than 50% have university level education. Also it revealed that 35% of men and 25% of women have relapsed more than four times after unsuccessful attempts to reinsert themselves socially. Reasons given to wander are varied with the most common causes being drug abuse (30.6%), family problems (22.4%), financial or economic problems (15.0%), and others such as unemployment, mental health problems, domestic violence, evictions, or lack of support when released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Figueroa-Rosa |first=Bárbara |url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/puerto-rico/nota/estrenanunidadmovilparapersonassintechoensanjuan-1296527/|title=Estrenan unidad móvil para personas sin techo en San Juan|work=PrimeraHora |language=Spanish |date=8 August 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homeless snowman (3147026895).jpg|thumb|right|A street bench in Kitsilano, British Columbia, Canada with a snowman depicting a homeless person]]
Homelessness in popular culture is depicted in various works. The issue is frequently described as an invisible problem, despite its prevalence. Writers and other artists play a role in bringing the issue to public attention. Homelessness is the central theme of many works; in other works homelessness is secondary, added to create interesting characters or contribute authenticity to the setting (e.g., for a story set in the impoverished  inner city). Some stories and films depict homeless people in a stereotypical or pejorative manner (e.g., the exploitation film ''[[Hobo With a Shotgun]]'', which depicts homeless people fighting).

=== Films ===
* ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'', 1936 film, shows negative effects of [[vagrancy laws]].
* ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'', 1966, shows the effects of homelessness on parenthood.
* ''[[God Bless the Child (film)|God Bless the Child]]'', 1988, is a made-for-TV movie about a single mother ([[Mare Winningham]]) living on the streets of [[New York City]] with her young daughter.

== Public awareness ==
Advocates for the homeless have developed various events, commemorations, and projects to raise awareness of the issue of homelessness. In 1987, the United Nations established an [[International Year of Shelter for the Homeless]]. In England, advocates founded an annual event named [[Homelessness Action Week]].In Australia, NGOs have founded two main annual events: [[Homeless Persons' Week]], and [[Youth Homelessness Matters Day]]. Some advocates have taken to social media to raise awareness with projects such as [[I Have A Name]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9867">The '''International Plastic Modellers' Society''' (often shortened to '''IPMS''') is an international organisation of [[hobby]]ists interested in building [[plastic model]] kits. The Society is made up of national branches, and within these, local clubs who usually represent a town, city or locality. The first branch was established in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1963.

Local clubs organise regular meetings, typically once a month for members to meet up, show off their latest models, discuss the hobby and work on ongoing projects. Many also organise their own annual shows and invite fellow clubs to display alongside traders, and together, these shows make up a busy calendar of events throughout each year. The UK has the most developed club network, with organisations covering virtually the whole country. Elsewhere, local clubs can often function as national branches simultaneously, such as IPMS [[Argentina]] who also represent the [[Mar del Plata]] region of the country.

At a higher level, national branches will also organise their own shows. These are typically termed 'Nationals'. The largest of these is IPMS UK's Scale ModelWorld, held at [[Telford]] in November each year and features not just local British club displays, but also contributions from overseas branches and clubs, such is its scale.

In addition to the branch and club structure, Special Interest Groups (SIG) exist which focus on a specific area or type of model building, for instance a particular aircraft such as the [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], a time period like the [[Cold War]], a manufacturer such as [[Airfix]] or a genre like [[science fiction]] and fantasy. SIGs often transcend club and branch boundaries, being made up of modellers from around the world sharing a common interest. As a result, most SIGs do not meet up on a regular basis like clubs, but instead communicate more frequently online.

'''Kratzen''' is a "fun", Austrian [[card game]] for three to six players that is played for small stakes using a 33-card, [[William Tell pack]].

== Cards ==
Kratzen uses a [[William Tell pack]] ([[German-suited pack|German-suited]]) from which all the Sixes have been removed apart from the {{Bell}}6 or ''[[Weli]]'', which has a special role as the permanent, 2nd highest [[trump (card games)|trump]]. The suits are: [[Acorns (card suit)|Acorns]] (''Eichel''), [[Leaves (card suit)|Leaves]] (''Laub''), [[Hearts (card suit)|Hearts]] (''Herz'') and [[Bells (card suit)|Bells]] (''Schellen'').&lt;ref name=kartenspiele&gt;[http://www.kartenspiele.net/spiele/kratzen.htm ''Kratzen''] at www.kartenspiele.net. Retrieved 27 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking of the cards is: [[Sow (playing card)|Sow]] (also erroneously called the Ace, actually a [[Deuce (playing card)|Deuce]]) (''Sau'') &gt; [[King (playing card)|King]] (''König'') &gt; [[Ober (playing card)|Ober]] &gt; [[Unter (playing card)|Unter]] &gt; Ten &gt; Nine &gt; Eight &gt; Seven. In the trump suit, the ''Weli'' is just below the Trump Sow.&lt;ref name=kartenspiele/&gt;

== Playing ==
The following rules are taken from kartenspiele.net,&lt;ref name=kartenspiele/&gt; the source recommended by Geiser.&lt;ref name=Geiser&gt;[http://www.talon.cc/Hefte/Talon13-p029.pdf Geiser, Remigius (2004). "100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg"], in ''Talon'', Issue 13, p. 37 &amp; 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is in two phases. In the first phase, players may not drop out and they contribute an ante or antes to the pot. In the second phase, the aim is to win the contents of the pot, but players may drop out for an individual hand if they think they are unlikely to take the minimum number of tricks.

=== First phase – ''Muss'' ===
The first deal is a so-called ''Muss'' i.e. everyone has to participate; there is no option to 'drop out'. Each player pays an ante into the pot; the dealer pays double. The dealer [[shuffles]] and offer the pack to rearhand to [[cut (cards)|cut]]. Rearhand cuts and shows the bottom card of the top packet. If it is the ''Weli'', a Sow or a Seven, the cutter looks at the bottom card of the lower packet. Play now proceeds as follows, depending on the cards revealed:

* No Sow, Weli or Seven. Dealer deals as normal (see below).
* Seven. Dealer passes cards to rearhand (on his right). This is a ''Hupf'' i.e. 'hop'. Rearhand  pays an ante into the pot and reshuffles as the new dealer.
* Single Sow. Hop to left. Forehand pays an ante and reshuffles as the new dealer.
* Two Sows. Dealer passes cards via forehand to middlehand (i.e. two places to his left). This is  a ''Sprung'' i.e. 'jump'. Both forehand and middlehand pay an ante and middlehand reshuffles as the new dealer.
* Sow and Seven. The cards are passed, first in one direction, then the other. Forehand and middlehand pay an ante. The role of dealer does not change and the dealer proceeds as normal.
* Weli. Dealer deals as normal. Everyone pays an ante.

The above process is repeated each time until a normal card is cut. The dealer then deals a packet of 2 cards, in clockwise order, to each player. The next card is flipped. If it is the ''Weli'', another one is turned. Then another packet of 2 cards is dealt to each player. The upcard determines the [[trump suit]] and belongs to the dealer. So the dealer will have at least one, and possibly two, extra cards.

The dealer now becomes the striker (''Schläger''), effectively the soloist, and must take at least 2 tricks. He discards one or two cards to reduce his hand to four and leads to the first trick. The others have to take at least one trick. 

Suit must be followed (''[[Farbzwang]]''), trumps played if that is not possible (''[[Trumpfzwang]]'') and players must head the trick if they are able (''[[Stichzwang]]''). The winner of a trick leads to the next.

After 4 tricks have been played, the score is reckoned. If the Striker has not won a minimum of 2 tricks, he pays a penalty of double the pot contents. If a defender has not won at least 1 trick, he pays a penalty equivalent to the pot.

=== Second phase - normal game ===
The role of dealer now rotates to the left and the new dealer pays an ante to the pot, shuffles and offers the cards to rearhand to cut. The aforementioned rules for determining the eventual dealer apply and the cards are then dealt. This time the dealer chooses one of the following four contracts: 

* '''Schlagen'''. The dealer chooses to be the striker and has to win at least 2 tricks.
* '''Oder'''. The dealer changes the trump suit by turning cards from the stock until one is of a different suit from the initial trump card. This new card determines the trump suit.
* '''Weiter-Oder'''. Only the top card of the talon is turned. Its suit becomes the trump suit and the dealer is the striker.
* '''Weiter'''. The dealer passes the right to choose a contract to forehand (the player to his right).

If other players wish to bid, they must outbid any previously announced contracts. The contracts rank in the above order.

Players then decide whether to "play" (''mitgehen'') or "drop out" (''Spiel verzichten''). In a variant of the rules, a player has the right to announce his decision last; the first one to claim this right has it.

Next, the participating players may exchange any number of hand cards for cards in the talon. The first 3 may be exchanged without revealing them. The fourth and fifth cards to be exchanged must be faced up and, for each trump, the player is dealt another card. if the Trump Ace is dealt face up, the player is given 5 extra cards, face down. They can they rearrange their hand and discard excess cards to bring their hand down to four again. 

A special feature is the Seven Muss (''Siebenermuss''). If the trump suit has been determined by a Seven, the deal becomes a ''Muss'' and is played as in the first phase. Each player only needs one trick to win, regardless of whether they were the striker or not. 

With the exception of the Seven Muss, the game continues as follows. The striker must win at least two tricks, the other active players at least one. For each trick won, players earn 1/4 of the pot. The indivisible remainder can either remain in the pot or be assigned to the striker If any player fails to achieve his target, he pays an amount equivalent to that already in the pot, or double if he is the striker. If no player has to pay a penalty, the pot is either empty again or contains an indivisible remainder. Then the next round is another ''Muss''. Otherwise another normal game is played.

{{nihongo|'''''Leo the Lion'''''|新ジャングル大帝 進めレオ!|Shin Janguru Taitei: Susume Reo!|New Jungle Emperor: Move Ahead Leo!}} is a sequel to the Japanese [[anime]] series ''Jungle Emperor'', or ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''. [[Osamu Tezuka]] had always wanted his story of Kimba to follow Kimba's entire life, and the ''Jungle Emperor''/''Kimba'' series was such a hit in Japan that Dr. Tezuka produced a sequel, without his American partners, in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035548/http://www.kimbawlion.com/history.htm History of Kimba the White Lion]  Archived from [http://www.kimbawlion.com/history.htm the original] on 2012-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Making the series without a co-producer gave him complete creative control. For example, Dr. Tezuka changed the conclusion of his original manga story (represented in the last two episodes of this series) to a happy ending.&lt;ref name="epguide"/&gt;
 	
''Leo the Lion'' does not follow immediately from the end of the ''Kimba'' series. Instead, the story begins a couple of years following the end of the previous series. To English-speaking audiences, the behavior of the title character is inexplicably out of line with what was established in the first series. At the end of the first series, in the original Japanese script, Kimba promises to keep his animals separate from humans. It is this promise that drives the seemingly hermit-like Leo in this series.
	
As the series unfolds, the focus shifts from the title character to one of his cubs, the male named Rune. This series as a whole is about Rune's growth, from a whining weakling to a confident leader.

This Japanese series was dubbed into English by a company based in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] in the [[United States]] known as SONIC-Sound International Corporation, and run by Enzo Caputo.  ''Leo the Lion'' (so named because Leo was the Japanese name for the Kimba character) aired on [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] Cable Network in [[1984 in American television|1984]], The theme song for the English dub was written by Mark Boccaccio and Susan Brunet.

Stuart Chapin, who dubbed many of the voices into English, "colloquialized" all 26 scripts.  After Chapin and Caputo clashed about basic matters (Chapin wanted the series to reference Kimba, a show Caputo never heard of; Chapin also wanted the Thompson gazelle to be called "Tommy" but Caputo stuck with "Tumy" because that was how the Japanese spelled it), Chapin ignored most of the plots and made up the scripts as he pleased, matching the dialog to lip movements.  Thus, an elephant quotes a poem by [[Emily Dickinson]] and a gadget-heavy spy episode becomes a vehicle for "Sterling Bond", James' hapless brother.  In later scripts, puns abounded.  In the last script, Chapin had Leo/Kimba (voiced by Caputo himself) explain the Kimba name mix-up.

== Characters ==
{{See also|Osamu Tezuka's Star System}}
While there is some speculation that Leo's cub Rune is Leo himself, Leo is actually grown up to a fully adult lion with white fur. Unlike the previous series, the producers of the English-dubbed version of this series used the original Japanese names for nearly all the characters:

*Leo
*Lea
*LoLo
*Coco
*Mandy
*Rune and Rukio
*Squawk
*Tommy
*Rick The Lycon
*Grandpa Leopard
*Mr. Hunter
*Rhino
*Agura the Terrible One

*The Saber-Toothed Tiger
*Triceratops Herd
*Huge The Gorilla
*Zamba the Blue Lion
*The Ceratosaurus
*The Mahamba
*Raffe
*Dr. Sugi
*Christopher Sugi

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">A '''loosely associated statement''' is a type of [[simple non-inferential passage]] wherein statements about a general subject are juxtaposed but make no inferential claim.&lt;ref name="Conciselogic"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=17 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[rhetorical device]], loosely associated statements may be intended by the speaker to infer a claim or conclusion, but because they lack a coherent logical structure any such interpretation is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as loosely associated statements prove nothing and attempt no obvious conclusion.&lt;ref name="Logicofarguments"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.julianhermida.com/algoma/law1studyarguments.htm | title=The logic of arguments | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely associated statements can be said to serve no obvious purpose, such as illustration or explanation.&lt;ref name="NONargument"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/polen/LC9_Help/1/12loosely.htm | title=NONargument - Loosely associated statements | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included statements can be premises, conclusions or both, and both true or false, but missing from the passage is a claim that any one statement supports another.

In ''A concise introduction to logic'', Hurley demonstrates the concept with a quote by [[Lao-Tzu]]:

{{quote |Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind. |Lao-Tzu}}

While each clause in the quote may seem related to the others, each provides no reason to believe another.

"'''Man Down'''" is a song by Barbadian singer, [[Rihanna]] from her fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). Singer [[Shontelle]] and production duo [[Rock City (duo)|Rock City]] wrote the song with its main producer, Sham. They wrote it during a writing camp, in Los Angeles of March 2010, held by Rihanna's record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then-untitled album. Rock City were inspired by [[Bob Marley]]'s 1973 song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective. "Man Down" is a [[reggae]] song which incorporates elements of [[ragga]] and [[electronic music]]. Lyrically, Rihanna is a [[fugitive]] after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets. Several critics singled out "Man Down" as ''Loud''{{'}}s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.

[[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] released "Man Down" on May 3, 2011, as the fifth single from the album. In the United States, the single reached number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. It has been certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song topped the chart in France for five consecutive weeks and reached the top three in Belgium and the Netherlands. [[Anthony Mandler]] directed its music video, in which Rihanna's character shoots a man after he [[rape]]s her. The video was criticized by the [[Parents Television Council]], Industry Ears and Mothers Against Violence, who faulted Rihanna for suggesting that murder is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims. However, actress [[Gabrielle Union]], a rape victim, praised the video for being relatable. "Man Down" was on the [[set list]] for three of Rihanna's tours&amp;nbsp;– the [[Loud Tour]] (2011), the [[Diamonds World Tour]] (2013) and the [[Anti World Tour]] (2016).

==Background==
In March 2010, record label [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] held a writing camp in Los Angeles for songwriters and producers to compose material for possible inclusion on [[Rihanna]]'s then-untitled fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]''.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ketchum III|first=William|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.18167/title.sak-pase-reveals-queens-influence-on-watch-the-throne-tracks-rihannas-man-down-controversy|title=Sak Pase Reveals Queen's Influence On 'Watch The Throne' Tracks, Rihanna's 'Man Down' Controversy|work=[[HipHopDX]]|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chace|first=Zoe|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/07/05/137530847/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-hit-song|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Hit Song?|work=[[NPR]]|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Def Jam rented out nearly every recording studio in Los Angeles in order to create as many songs as possible.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt; Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo [[Rock City (musical duo)|Rock City]] (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during the sessions, and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; Daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music, and where producers have music but no lyrics.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt;

[[Shama Joseph]], professionally known as Sham, was hired as one of the producers to work on crafting songs at the camp.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt; Sham's manager had arranged his attendance at the camp through an acquaintance who was an employee of the record label. Sham explained that he found a flight to Los Angeles and began working on music as soon as he arrived, stating that he had "nothing to lose and everything to gain".&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt; He was inspired by a vision of Rihanna performing songs at a concert that were Caribbean themed.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt; Sham felt that Rihanna had not explored Caribbean-themed music since her debut album, ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt;

==Production and recording==
[[File:Bob-Marley.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Bob Marley onstage with a guitar|[[Rock City (production duo)|Rock City]] wanted to recreate [[Bob Marley]]'s ''(pictured)'' 1973 song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" from a female perspective.]]
According to Daniels, Rock City knew Sham but they had not heard the West Indian/Caribbean-themed music that he had composed during the camp. Sham played the music to them, to which the brothers responded "Let's give Rihanna a one-drop! Like, a response to 'I shot the sheriff'!"&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; Together, Sham and Rock City wrote the lyrics to "Man Down" in twelve minutes.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; In an [[MTV News]] interview, Rock City said they intended to write a song that would embody [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" (1973) from a female perspective and to "tap [Rihanna's] island origins in a way that sounded authentic".&lt;ref name="RockCity MTV Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1665450/rihanna-man-down-bob-marley/|title=Rihanna’s ‘Man Down’ Is Her Answer To Bob Marley Classic|work=[[MTV News]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NME Rock City Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/rihanna/57210|title=Rihanna's 'Man Down' is 'answer to Bob Marley's 'I Shot The Sheriff'|work=[[NME]]|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Shontelle]] said that Rihanna called her during the [[Last Girl on Earth]] tour and asked her to be involved with the song. She confirmed that Rihanna was present when she was writing her part in the recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nissim|first=Maya|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a307989/shontelle-glad-leona-turned-down-song.html#~pbmOEp7iJO3v6e|title=Shontelle 'glad Leona turned down song'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shonetelle explains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/11/08/new-music-rihanna-california-king-bed-man-down/|title=New Music: Rihanna - 'California King Bed' and 'Man Down'|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shontelle elucidated that following one of Rihanna's concerts, the singer exited the stage and immediately returned to the tour bus to work in the studio.&lt;ref name="Shonetelle explains"/&gt; Daniels said that once the writing camp had concluded, Rihanna listened to all of the songs which had been composed for her and chose her favorites.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; In September 2010, several months after Sham attended the writing camp, Rihanna called him and said that she wanted to record "Man Down" for inclusion on ''Loud''.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt;

Rihanna later described the sentiment she wanted to express as "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: "I'm super inspired by reggae music [and it] has been a part of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that."&lt;ref name="Rihanna MTV Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1652415/rihanna-says-louds-man-down-is-gangsta/|title=Rihanna Says Loud‘s ‘Man Down’ Is ‘Gangsta’|work=MTV News|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at [[The Village (studio)|The Village]] in Los Angeles. [[Kuk Harrell]] produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at [[Westlake Recording Studios]], also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Manny Marroquin]] at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.&lt;ref name="LoudNotes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]|date=November 12, 2010|others=[[Rihanna]]|page=5|type=Inlay cover|work=''[[Def Jam Recordings]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels estimated the total cost of the writing camp to be approximately $200,000, averaging $18,000 for each of the eleven songs which were included on ''Loud''; the camp consisted of forty writers and producers.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; Daniels confirmed that Rock City received $15,000 and Sham $20,000 for their part in the production of "Man Down". He said that "to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive — even before you take into account the fee for the songwriters".&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; A cost of $53,000 for "Man Down" was already incurred prior to Rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; Although [[Makeba Riddick]] did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her as an example of how the process works and how much she would charge. It is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He estimated the final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering "Man Down" to be $78,000.&lt;ref name="NRP"/&gt; When combined with the marketing and promotional costs, the total expense was $1,078,000.&lt;ref name="Million Cost"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=Neil|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11619043/How-many-songwriters-does-it-take-to-change-a-chorus.html|title=How many songwriters does it take to change a chorus?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I think it was very hypocritical for some of the parents against violence in media, those same parents have probably allowed their kids to watch all types of movies and programs that have depictions, or things that insinuate violence. So for them to be mad about, number one, an issue that actually exists?&amp;nbsp;... A woman feeling like she wants to shoot somebody who’s still alive because of something that they took from her, that’s real and that’s honest. So the emotion is a very true emotion&amp;nbsp;... and they relive it on a daily basis. I think it was crazy and blown out of proportion&amp;nbsp;.... But people benefit from controversy, and those same people who probably were trying to bring awareness, now they have a voice and now they’re 'specialists,' and they can speak for a group of people all of a sudden.&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt;}}

==Release and reception==
On March 1, 2011, Rihanna asked fans to help her choose the next single from ''Loud'' using [[Twitter]], saying that she would film a music video in the forthcoming weeks. After an influx of suggestions, the singer said she had narrowed the options down to four songs: "Man Down", "[[California King Bed]]", "[[Cheers (Drink to That)]]" and "[[Fading (song)|Fading]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a306542/rihanna-asks-fans-to-choose-next-single.html#~pbmn2Q37ApCRz8|title=Rihanna asks fans to choose next single|work=Digital Spy|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, she confirmed that "California King Bed" had been selected as the next international single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/sitecomponent/a28814/singles-release-diary.html |title=Singles Release Diary |work=Digital Spy |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRMEHEvD?url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/sitecomponent/a28814/singles-release-diary.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Copsey|first=Robert|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a308595/rihanna-announces-next-single.html|title=Rihanna announces next single|work=Digital Spy|date=March 12, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Man Down" was sent to [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] and [[Urban contemporary|urban]] radio stations in the United States on May 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a316646/rihanna-switches-new-single-release-dates.html#~piCFqiRLBH15S6|title=Rihanna switches new single release dates?|work=Digital Spy|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPorUcGl?url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases |url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases |title=Impacting Songs – Urban Radio |work=All Access Music Group |archivedate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhythmic"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yFf2i1Mx?url=http://www.allaccess.com/top40-rhythmic/future-releases |url=http://www.allaccess.com/top40-rhythmic/future-releases |title=Impacting Songs – Rhythmic Radio |work=All Access Music Group |archivedate=April 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the May 13 release of "California King Bed", making "Man Down" and "California King Bed" the fifth and sixth singles from ''Loud''.&lt;ref name="CKB Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/dk/album/california-king-bed/id437261352?i=437261353&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2|title=California King Bed – Single Denmark iTunes|work=iTunes Store (DK)|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released in France and Switzerland on July 11&lt;ref name="FRANCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.7digital.com/artist/rihanna/release/man-down-1/?h=01&amp;src=live-search|title=Man Down (Explicit) – Rihanna|work=[[7digital]]|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SWISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de-ch.7digital.com/artist/rihanna/release/man-down-1/?h=01&amp;src=live-search|title=Man Down (Explicit) – Rihanna|work=7digital|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015|language=Swiss German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Netherlands on July 15.&lt;ref name="NETHERLANDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nl.7digital.com/artist/rihanna/release/man-down-1/?h=01&amp;src=live-search|title=Man Down (Explicit) – Rihanna|work=7digital|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitty Empire called the track "excellent", and praised it for being an original composition which is reminiscent of a "righteous old reggae murder ballad".&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' writer Ryan Burleson said that "Man Down" and another album track called "[[Fading (song)|Fading]]" both "stand on their own sonically", and that the former is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to her Caribbean heritage with its dancehall melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burleson|first=Ryan|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/11/album-review-rihanna-loud/|title=Rihanna – Loud|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the track as "breezy", Bradley Stern thought that no other song on ''Loud'' embodied Rihanna's personality more so than on "Man Down".&lt;ref name="MuuMuse"/&gt; Cinquemani chose "Man Down" as the best song on ''Loud'', calling Rihanna's vocal agility "surprising" and noting that the "fully-fledged reggae" song is co-written by a fellow Barbadian-born singer, Shontelle.&lt;ref name="Cinquemani"/&gt;

In her review of ''Loud'', Emily Mackay of ''[[NME]]'' called its experimentation more "organic" than that on Rihanna's previous album ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009), citing "Man Down{{"'}}s theme of "doomed youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackay|first=Emily|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/11718|title=Review: ''Loud''|work=[[NME]]|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Nima Baniamer of [[Contactmusic.com]] pointed out that "Man Down", which she described as "a dark track" that is "haunting" yet "delightfully intriguing", was reminiscent of the material on ''Rated R''.&lt;ref name="Contactmusic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baniamer|first=Nima|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/rihanna/music/rihanna-loud|title=Rihanna - Loud Album Review|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]|date=December 2, 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their review of Rihanna's top 20 songs, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' ranked "Man Down" as their tenth best track, writing that it is Rihanna at "her badass best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Nick|last2=Manning|first2=James|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/best-rihanna-songs|title=The 20 best Rihanna songs|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' staff compiled a list of their top 26 Rihanna songs, and ranked "Man Down" in thirteenth place; Claire Lobenfeld thought that it was the singers most "cinematic" song of her career, and that she elevated the theme of "accidental manslaughter" from "downtrodden" to "adorable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2014/02/best-rihanna-songs/man-down|title=The 26 Best Rihanna Songs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==

===Background and synopsis===

[[Anthony Mandler]] directed the music video for "Man Down" in April 2011 on a beach in [[Portland Parish]], on the northeastern [[Jamaica]]n coast.&lt;ref name="Video location"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/05/30/rihanna-sends-strong-message-in-man-down-video/|title=Rihanna sends strong message in 'Man Down' video|work=Rap-Up|date=May 30, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandler 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1663924/rihanna-man-down-music-video/|title=Rihanna Director Talks Upcoming 'Man Down' Video|work=MTV News|date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rihanna told ''[[Rap-Up]]'' that the video has a "strong underlying message [for] girls like me!"&lt;ref name="Video location"/&gt; On May 1, 2011, three [[camera phone]] [[Teaser campaign|teaser]] photos, of Rihanna on a beach in a white [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] dress and riding a bicycle in Portland Parish, were released.&lt;ref name="Teaser photos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/05/01/rihanna-shoots-man-down-video-in-jamaica/|title=Rihanna Shoots 'Man Down' Video in Jamaica|work=Rap-Up|date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video premiered on [[Black Entertainment Television (BET)|BET]]'s ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' on May 31, 2011.&lt;ref name="Video location"/&gt; In an interview for [[MTV News]], Mandler said that "Man Down" required "a strong narrative and visual" and that fans could expect something "dramatic and shocking and intense and emotions and uplifting and enlightening".&lt;ref name="Mandler 1"/&gt;

The video opens as the protagonist (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a flashback to the previous day, when she rides her bike, meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied [[sexual assault]], and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a dresser drawer.&lt;ref name="Man Down Video Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinh|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1664864/rihanna-man-down-video/|title=Rihanna Pulls The Trigger In 'Man Down' Video|work=MTV News|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis and reception===
Janell Hobson analysed the imagery presented in the video for "Man Down" in her book ''Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender'', which "challenges postmodernist dismissals of identity politics and the delusional belief that the Millennial era reflects a 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' world."&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobson |first=Janell |date=October 18, 2012 |title=Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMpKLdkpnp8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22rihanna%22+%22man+down%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBGoVChMI3ZeHy-yFyAIVSpWUCh0sBw6w#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rihanna%22%20%22man%20down%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|page=82 |isbn=1438444001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Body-Evidence-Mediating-Globalizing-Gender/dp/1438444001|title=Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender Paperback – 18 Oct 2012|work=''[[Amazon.com]]''|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter titled "Disclosures: Black Women's Resistance to Sexual Violence", Hobson explores how black women have "found the courage" to speak out about sexual violence, protest against it and not remain a silent victim.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; She recalled Rihanna's interview for ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' with [[Diane Sawyer]], which aired on November 6, 2009.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Having remained silent about her altercation with Brown on the evening of the Grammy Party in February that year, whereby Brown assaulted her, Rihanna decided to speak about it for the first time.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; The author noted how Sawyer decided to approach the interview by presenting the couples relationship and assault case as an "anomaly" and accused Rihanna of "projecting a 'fake' imagery of strong black woman", rather than presenting her another domestic violence victim not only in the United States, but in the world.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; "I ''am'' strong," Rihanna responded.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Hobson wrote that from then on, the singer decided to project an image of "hardcore masculinity and dominatrix-type femininity in her music trajectory".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

Subsequently, several of Rihanna's songs and music videos have courted controversy for their violent themes, which Hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers "battered face" on the evening of the assault by [[TMZ]] which circulated the internet without the permission of Rihanna.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Hobson writes: "Because of this, Rihanna has had to wrest back control of the 'victim' image foisted on her, and she in turn has challenged us rhetorically and visually to question and examine the power, danger, and violences that shape our relationships."&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; She continued to highlight the music videos for "[[Russian Roulette (Rihanna song)|Russian Roulette]]", "[[Hard (Rihanna song)|Hard]]", "[[We Found Love]]", "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" with [[Eminem]] which documents domestic violence, and "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]", which contains references to [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] and is, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics, as examples.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; At one point in the video for "S&amp;M", Rihanna is literally tied up as a victim.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

However, Hobson noted that Rihanna "rejects  the victim stance" in the video for "Man Down", and elucidated that she played the role of a rape survivor who shot her attacker.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; She attributed the location of shooting the video in Jamaica as significant, due to how the image of a gun proliferated during 1990s Jamaican [[dance hall]]'s to "express female rage".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; The prologue depicts Rihanna as a "dark-hooded" ''[[femme fatale]]'' whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and provokes the spectator to sympathize with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club, which Hobson suggests is "somehow deserving of rape".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; She continued to explain that Rihanna is inviting the audience to consider what justice means by "pointing both a literal and lyrical gun at the issue".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Hobson concluded that Rihanna is protecting her vulnerability and countering the image of the abused black woman who is looked at unsympathetically in society.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

Beck Bain of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] described the video as "visually stunning",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bain|first=becky|url=http://www.idolator.com/5883402/rihanna-shoots-to-kill-in-her-man-down-video|title=Rihanna Shoots To Kill In Her 'Man Down' Video|work=''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]''|date=May 31, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer Lee Ann labelled it as "shocking".&lt;ref name="Mothers Against Violence"/&gt; Co-writer of "Man Down" Theron Thomas felt that the video was very theatrical and that Rihanna played her role "perfectly".&lt;ref name="NME Rock City Interview"/&gt; He continued to say that had the video been a lyric-by-lyric representation, the narrative would have been more "graphic".&lt;ref name="NME Rock City Interview"/&gt;

===Controversy===
[[File:GabrielleUnionFeb09 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Actress [[Gabrielle Union]] ''(pictured)'', a rape victim, said that she could relate to the music video's storyline.|alt=A woman with her head tiled up slightly, smiling.]]
The [[Parents Television Council]] (PTC) criticized Rihanna for her portrayal of "cold, calculated execution of murder" in the music video, and argued that murdering a rapist as socially-acceptable justice is impermissible. The group disagreed with Rihanna's rationale for the storyline: that the video has "a very strong underlying message [for] girls" like Rihanna.&lt;ref name="Rap Up PTC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/06/01/rihanna-draws-fire-from-parents-advocacy-group-for-man-down-video/#more-86812|title=Rihanna's 'Man Down' Video Draws Fire from Parents Advocacy Group|work=Rap-Up|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the PTC and Industry Ears, if Chris Brown murdered a woman in a video that premiered on BET "the world would stop" and Rihanna should not have been allowed to release her clip.&lt;ref name="Mothers Against Violence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rap Up PTC"/&gt; The week before the council's statement about the video it had objected to Rihanna and [[Britney Spears]]' performance of the "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" remix at the [[2011 Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], having called it a "profanity-laced, S&amp;M sex show on prime-time broadcast television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a321473/rihanna-britney-spears-sm-sex-show-slammed.html#~pergfBqC1E1koz|title=Rihanna, Britney Spears 'S&amp;M' 'sex show' slammed|work=Digital Spy|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the PTC's statement, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of [[AlterNet]] wrote that the group seemed to employ a [[double standard]]; it had not condemned [[Kanye West]]'s music video for "[[Monster (Kanye West song)#Music video|Monster]]", in which dead women hang from ceilings and West holds a severed head. Shepard added that Eminem and Rihanna's video for "Love the Way You Lie" had not been criticized, despite the fact that she felt that it "glorified and romanticized" [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd|first=Julianne Escobedo|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/151326/watchdogs,_outraged_over_rihanna%27s_new_video,_give_kanye%27s_misogyny_a_pass/?page=entire|title=Watchdogs, Outraged Over Rihanna's New Video, Give Kanye's Misogyny a Pass|work=[[AlterNet]]|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mothers Against Violence spokesperson criticised Rihanna for failing to present a solution, rather than encouraging the vulnerable youth, for which rape is a reality for many people.&lt;ref name="Mothers Against Violence"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ann|url=http://metro.co.uk/2011/06/02/rihannas-man-down-video-should-be-banned-say-us-pressure-groups-36442/|title=Rihanna’s Man Down video should be banned, say US pressure groups|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Anthony Mandler addressed the controversy in an interview for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', saying that the visual evoked the reaction he intended and that it highlighted an issue still taboo in modern society.&lt;ref name="Mandler Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kits|first=Boris|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rihannas-man-down-music-video-195736|title=Rihanna's 'Man Down' Music Video Director Defends Controversial Violence (Exclusive)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled growing up in an era in which artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] released controversial music videos, and noted that contemporary videos no longer tackle taboo subjects as frequently.&lt;ref name="Mandler Hollywood Reporter"/&gt;

Rihanna responded to the PTC's criticism on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that "touchy subject matters" should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape.&lt;ref name="DS Video 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Report Explain"/&gt; The singer continued to state that "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us{{' "}} and that singers "have the freedom to create art".&lt;ref name="DS Video 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a322851/rihanna-man-down-murder-video-is-the-real-world.html|title=Rihanna: 'Man Down murder video is the real world' – Music News |work=Digital Spy|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for ''BET'', Rihanna further explain why rape was used as the vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. And we decided to home in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario."&lt;ref name="Hollywood Report Explain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rihanna-explains-controversial-man-down-194425|title=Rihanna Explains Controversial 'Man Down' Video on BET's '106 &amp; Park' (Video)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Report Explain"/&gt;

Actress and women's-health advocate [[Gabrielle Union]], a rape victim, voiced support for the video on Twitter. Union called it "brave" and, although she did not agree with the [[eye for an eye]] sentiment, she could relate to the situation. Union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation, and that they all have an idea of how justice should be served. She admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist, but missed, and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better. She continued to say that while it is "understandable" to desire to kill a rapist, unless it is in [[self-defense]] then it is not advisable.&lt;ref name="Shepard"/&gt;

==Live performances and covers==
Rihanna has included "Man Down" on the set lists of several concerts and tours, including the 2011 [[Loud Tour]],&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite video | people=|year=2012|title=Loud Tour Live at the O2| medium=DVD, Blu-ray Disc|work=''SRP, [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio 1's Big Weekend#2012|BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend]] on May 24, 2012&lt;ref name="Hackney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e9wmxj/acts/adjc6q#p00wgd44|title=Rihanna – Set list|work=BBC|date=June 24, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2013 [[Diamonds World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_22974451/setlist-rihanna-san-jose|title=Setlist: Rihanna in San Jose|work=[[Mercury News]]|last=Harrington|first=Jim|date=April 6, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Loud Tour, Rihanna performed the song on "a levitating, rotating platform, a conveyer belt and graffiti-laden car shell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/07/rihanna-is-loud-sexy-and-larger-than-life|title=Rihanna is loud, sexy and larger than life|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kitty Empire described "Man Down" as "terrific", the critic felt let down by the "baffling lack of creativity" from Rihanna's production team for the stage set up during Rihanna's performance. She wrote that she did not understand why a truck [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] was in the middle of the stage.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; Maza praised the tracks placement on the set-list. "Man Down" was performed as the fourth song on the Loud Tour, following its opener "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]", "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]" and "[[Shut Up and Drive (Rihanna song)|Shut Up and Drive]]". Maza noted that the tempo of "Man Down" should have "slowed down the momentum she'd accumulated until then but that was instead an ideal marriage of production and performance." Instead, the red lights on the stage played up the "ominous" tone of the song as it gradually increased its tempo to the point whereby the end of the song was on the verge of sounding like an [[incantation]].&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maza|first=Erik|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/midnight_sun/blog/2011/06/rihanna_review_june_four.html|title=Rihanna at 1st Mariner Arena, first stop of Loud Tour|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Diamonds World Tour, Rihanna performed "Man Down" in a Caribbean-theme section of the show, which also included "[[You da One]]", "[[No Love Allowed]]", "[[What's My Name?

&lt;!--NOTNEWS and this is not a weblog as this article clearly seems to demonstrate a "list of" tidbits and TRIVIA--&gt;
[[File:Работа журналистов на авиабазе «Хмеймим» в Сирии (10).jpg|300px|thumb|Journalists interviewing Russian General Igor Konashenkov ([[:ru:Конашенков, Игорь Евгеньевич|ru:И́горь Конаше́нков]]) at [[Bassel Al-Assad International Airport]] during the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]]]]

Since the start of the [[Syrian Civil War]], all sides have used [[social media]] to try to discredit their opponents by using negative terms such as 'Syrian regime', 'armed gangs/terrorists', 'Syrian government/US State Department propaganda', 'biased', 'US/Western/foreign involvement'.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} According to the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], given the complexity of the Syrian conflict, media bias in reporting remains a key challenge, plaguing the collection of useful data and misinforming researchers and policymakers regarding the actual events taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198712596/sipri-9780198712596-chapter-2-div1-2.xml# |title=I.

==Internet activists==

===Social media===
As in the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, the Internet played a major role in the organization and coverage of the protests/armed-uprising. As of 2011 the largest Facebook page in support of the Syrian uprising was '''"The Syrian Revolution 2011"''', which claimed more than 383,000 followers. The page, co-founded by [[Fida al-Sayed]], reports on news related to the uprising and provides general guidelines for protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook Page|id=Syrian Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 the largest Facebook page in support of the Syrian President Bashar-al-Assad has more than 2,958,595 followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/almayadeen.tv |title=قناة الميادين - Al Mayadeen Tv - Facebook |work=Facebook |accessdate=28 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713073027/https://www.facebook.com/almayadeen.tv |archivedate=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Bana Alabed]], a 2016 Twitter account of unclear provenance about a child purportedly tweeting in English from Aleppo as the city was being destroyed.&lt;ref name=nyt-20161207&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/aleppo-twitter-girl-syria.html |title=Girl Posting to Twitter From Aleppo Gains Sympathy, but Doubts Follow |author1=Rick Gladstone |author2=Megan Specia |author3=Sydney Ember |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 December 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobiles===
Since international news media was banned in Syria, the main source of second-hand information/dis-information was private videos usually taken by shaky mobile phone cameras and uploaded to YouTube. Such videos were difficult to verify independently, and several TV stations showed older footage from Iraq and Lebanon, which was claimed to have been filmed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3218415.htm |title=Media Watch: Beware the 'trusted' source|date=16 May 2011|work=ABC |location=Australia|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avisen.dk/gigantisk-dr-bommert-uden-konsekvenser_146651.aspx |title=Gigantisk DR-bommert uden konsekvenser – |work=Avisen.dk |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter accounts have also been used to spread news and opinions about the conflict, using pictures from mobile phones. For example, pro Assad [[Rana Harbi]] from [[Lebanon]]&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/RanaHarbi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most popular persons{{cn|date=October 2018}} using tweets to inform about the conflict development (using pictures from mobile phones). 

==Visual media==
 
Between January 2012 and September 2013, over a million videos documenting the war have been uploaded, and they have received hundreds of millions of views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria's War Viewed Almost in Real Time|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324492604579083112566791956|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' states that the "unprecedented confluence of two technologies—cellphone cams and social media—has produced, via the instant upload, a new phenomenon: the YouTube war." ''The New York Times'' states that online videos have "allowed a widening war to be documented like no other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watching Syria's War|url=http://projects.nytimes.com/watching-syrias-war|accessdate=29 September 2013|newspaper=NYT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent videos include the rebel commander [[Abu Sakkar]] cutting organs from the dead body of a Syrian soldier and putting one of them in his mouth, "as if he is taking a bite out of it". He called rebels to follow his example and terrorize the [[Alawite]] sect, which mostly backs Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/13/syria-brigade-fighting-homs-implicated-atrocities |title=Syria: Brigade Fighting in Homs Implicated in Atrocities|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22519770|title=Outrage at Syrian rebel shown 'eating soldier's heart'|publisher=BBC|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda==
Syria is ranked the third most repressive country in the world in terms of press freedom by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/reports/2012/05/10-most-censored-countries.php |title=10 Most Censored Countries |work=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=2 May 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 4th most repressive by [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012,1043.html |title=Press Freedom Index 2011-2012 |work=Reporters Without Borders |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230901/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012%2C1043.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been rumoured that [[Syrian Arab News Agency]] (SANA) television interviews sometimes use government supporters 'disguised as locals' who stand near sites of destruction and claim that they were caused by rebel fighters.&lt;ref name="Propaganda"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chulov|first=Martin|title=Syrian regime TV reporter defects|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/syrian-regime-tv-reporter-defects|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebanese newspaper ''[[As-Safir]]'' cited outtakes of interviews showing that the channel's staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of oppression by Syria's government. It refers to leaked internal e-mails suggest that [[Al Jazeera]] has become subordinated to the Qatari emir's assertive foreign policy, which supports Syria's rebels and advocates military intervention in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/al-jazeera-gets-rap-as-qatar-mouthpiece.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Al-Jazeera Gets Rap as Qatar Mouthpiece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Al Jazeera correspondents [[Ali Hashim]] and two others resigned from their jobs because of objections over the reporting on the conflict. They reported that Al Jazeera paid $50,000 for smuggling phones and satellite communication tools to Syria's rebels. Hashim concluded, "The channel was taking a certain stance. It was meddling with each and every detail of reports on the Syrian revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rt.com/news/al-jazeera-rebels-phones-lebanon-281/ |title=Ex-employee: Al Jazeera provided Syrian rebels with satphones — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|RT is not RS|date=October 2018}}

[[Ahmad Ibrahim (journalist)|Ahmad Ibrahim]], who is in charge of the Al Jazeera's coverage on Syria, is the brother of a leading member of the opposition [[Syrian National Council]].{{fact|date=October 2018}} Al Jazeera reportedly put pressure on its journalists to use the term "martyr" for slain Syrian rebels, but not pro-government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/4525/ |title=Syria's Electronic Warriors Hit Al Jazeera |publisher=Al Akhbar English |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, a former News Editor at Al Jazeera, who was from Syria, and had been at Al Jazeera for "nearly a decade" was fired without cause given, but in an interview stated their belief that it was linked to his/her resistance of ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. The former Editor stated that the Muslim Brotherhood was "controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera" with both organizations biasing news coverage in favour of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government of Assad by force and warning the then-editor "the majority [in Syria] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [taking power] is within our grasp" so  "thank your god if you get a pardon when we become the government." The source named the names of several other former employees who resigned in protest, including director of the Berlin bureau [[Aktham Sleiman]], a Syrian, "who was, at the beginning, with the [Syrian] opposition" but resisted what the interviewee terms the "lies and despicable [political and ethnic] sectarianism" and concluded that "Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying" about Syria and in favour of armed overthrow and of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_65277.shtml An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel] at AxisOfLogin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmyboxoffice.com/news/interview-with-a-former-journalist-in-the-qatari-al-jazeera.html An exclusive interview with a news editor of Al-Jazeera Channel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914144606/http://www.filmyboxoffice.com/news/interview-with-a-former-journalist-in-the-qatari-al-jazeera.html |date=14 September 2013 }} at FilmBoxOffice&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|a blog and a dead link|date=October 2018}}

Propaganda has been used by the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict.&lt;ref name="Propaganda"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/09/world/meast/syria-propagandist-defects/ |title=Defecting Syrian propagandist says his job was 'to fabricate' | date=9 October 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2012|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syrian Arab News Agency]] (SANA), the official government news agency, often refers to the FSA and ISIS as "armed gangs" or "terrorists" - while other media sources maintain that only part of the opposition are 'extremists'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/07/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=State TV reports 6 dead in Damascus 'terrorist' blast |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Assad has characterized the opposition as armed terrorist groups with Islamist ''"[[takfiri]]"'' extremist motives, portraying himself as the last guarantee for a secular government form.&lt;ref name=127dead&gt;{{cite news |title=Opposition: 127 dead as Syrian forces target civilians |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-07/middleeast/world_meast_syria-unrest_1_homs-and-hama-syrian-observatory-network-of-opposition-activists |publisher=CNN |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221022240/http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/07/world/meast/syria-unrest/index.html |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Syrian public school instructors teach students that the conflict is a foreign conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHE6PyiMXgQ| title=Damascus School Struggles to Carry On | date=1 October 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2012|publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (Syria)|Syrian foreign ministry]] called the U.S. government's statements in 2012, concerning the danger of the Syrian government using chemical weapons against civilians a myth they invented to launch a campaign against Syria and "a joke",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Oct-01/189775-syria-accuses-us-of-chemical-weapons-propaganda.ashx#axzz2GlZHI25C Syria accuses U.S. of chemical weapons propaganda]. ''The Daily Star'' (Lebanon), 1 October 2012. Retrieved 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; thus accusing the U.S. of propaganda on that subject; which accusation and denial of above-mentioned danger, 'are in turn of course again examples of propaganda'.

In 2016, it was revealed through [[emails of Hillary Clinton]] that [[Google]] and Al-Jazeera planned to encourage defections from the Syrian government, through various internet tools that disseminate information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3503000/Hillary-Clinton-s-emails-reveal-Google-wanted-overthrow-Assad-map-tool.html Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|DM is not RS|date=October 2018}}

===Hoaxes===
Both sides have been distributing on social media videos and photos of violence, while falsely claiming that the atrocities had been committed by the opposition: later it turned out to be footage from conflicts in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Military &amp; Defense Contributors |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disturbing-fake-videos-are-making-the-rounds-in-syria-2012-11 |title=Disturbing Fake Videos Are Making The Rounds in Syria |publisher=Business Insider |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/syria/121109/fake-syria-videos-images|title=The most disturbing fake videos making the rounds in Syria|author=Tracey Shelton|work=GlobalPost|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attacks on journalists ==
{{See also|List of journalists killed during the Syrian Civil War}}
It has been maintained that, by October 2012, 'more than hundred professional or citizen journalists' had reportedly died in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], 13 journalists were killed in work-related incidents during the first eighteen months of the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Journalists Killed in Syria since 1992 |url= http://www.cpj.org/killed/mideast/syria/ |publisher= Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=19 July 2012}} [[Nota bene|N.B.]] According to the organisation, no journalists were killed in Syria between 1992 and the start of the uprising.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, [[Reporters Without Borders]] said a total of 33 journalists were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Thirty-Three Professional and Citizen Journalists Killed since March 2011 |url= http://en.rsf.org/syrie-thirty-three-professional-and-07-07-2012,42982.html |publisher= Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[Marie Colvin]] who was killed by an explosion during the battle of Homs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Wardrop |first= Murray |date= 22 February 2012 |title= Syria: ''Sunday Times'' journalist Marie Colvin 'killed in Homs' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9097762/Syria-Sunday-Times-journalist-Marie-Colvin-killed-in-Homs.html |publisher= telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least one, French journalist [[Gilles Jacquier]], was killed by rebel mortar fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Malbrunot |first= Georges |date= 17 July 2012 |title= Jacquier: l'enquête française pointe les rebelles syriens |trans-title= Jacquier: French investigation points to Syrian rebels |url= http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2012/07/17/01003-20120717ARTFIG00525-jacquier-l-enquete-francaise-pointe-les-rebelles-syriens.php|language=French|publisher= [[Le Figaro|LeFigaro.fr]] |accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for those hand-picked by the government, journalists have been banned from reporting in Syria. Those who have entered the country regardless have been targeted. Within a month of the protests taking off, at least seven local and international journalists were detained, and at least one of them was beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/04/15/syria-rampant-torture-protesters |title= Syria: Rampant Torture of Protesters |publisher= HRW |date= 16 April 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Citizen journalist' Mohammed Hairiri was arrested in April 2012, tortured in prison, and sentenced to death in May 2012 for giving an interview for Al Jazeera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/syria-citizen-journalist-sentenced-to-18-05-2012,42641.html |title=Citizen journalist sentenced to death for Al-Jazeera interview - Reporters Without Borders |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian Salameh Kaileh was tortured and detained in deplorable conditions before being deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/syria-deported-palestinian-journalist-speaks-out-about-torture-custody-2012-05-17 |title= Syria: Deported Palestinian journalist speaks out about torture in custody |publisher= Amnesty International |date= 17 May 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NBC News team kidnapping ===
{{main|NBC News team kidnapping in Syria}}

On 13 December 2012, [[NBC News]] reporter [[Richard Engel]] and his five crew members, Aziz Akyavaş, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar, were abducted in Syria. Having escaped after five days in captivity, Engel said he believed that a [[Shabiha]] group loyal to [[Bashar al-Assad|al-Assad]] was behind the abduction, and that the crew was freed by the [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] group five days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=[[Brian Stelter]] |author2=Sebnem Arsu |title=Richard Engel of NBC Is Freed in Syria |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/business/media/richard-engel-of-nbc-is-released-in-syria.html |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engel's account was however challenged from early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jamie Dettmer |title=Richard Engel's Kidnapping: A Behind the Scenes Look |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/22/richard-engel-s-kidnapping-a-behind-the-scenes-look.html |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, NBC had to revise the kidnapping account, following further investigations by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which suggested that the NBC team "was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the [[Free Syrian Army]]," rather than by a loyalist [[Shia]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Ravi Somaiya |author2=[[C.

[[Image:MilkyWay behind Tree 2.jpg|thumb]]

There are many myths and legends about the origin of the [[Milky Way]], the crowd of stars that makes a distinctive bright streak across the night sky.

==Mythology among cultures==

===Armenian===
Ancient [[Armenian mythology]] called the Milky Way the "Straw Thief's Way". According to legend, the god [[Vahagn]] stole some straw from the [[Assyria]]n king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Khoisan===
The [[Khoisan people]] of the [[Kalahari]] desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="starryskies"&gt;{{cite web

===Cherokee===
A [[Cherokee mythology|Cherokee folktale]] tells of a dog who stole some [[cornmeal]] and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (''Gili Ulisvsdanvyi'') "The Way the Dog Ran Away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Eastern Asia===
[[File:Guo Xu album dated 1503 (11).jpg|thumb|The creation of the River of Heaven (Milky Way) across the sky, associated with the myth of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]'']]
Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the "Silvery River" of Heaven ({{zh|c=銀河}}, {{lang-ko|eunha}} and {{lang-ja|ginga}}). In one story, the stars [[Altair]] and [[Vega]] were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of [[magpie]]s and [[crow]]s formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as [[Qi Xi]], the ''Seventh Night'' ({{zh|七夕|qī xī}}, {{lang-ko|[[chilseok]]}} and {{lang-ja|tanabata}}).

===Egyptian===
In [[Egyptian mythology]], the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was [[:wikt:deify|deified]] as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]] (later on [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretized]] with the sky goddess [[Hathor]]).

===Finno-Ugric===
Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called "The Pathway of the Birds" ({{lang-fi|Linnunrata}}, {{lang-et|Linnutee}}). The Finns observed that the migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed ''[[Finnish mythology#The origins and the structure of the world|Lintukoto]]'' (bird home) resided.

In [[Estonian mythology|Estonian folklore]] it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases [[birds of prey]] away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the [[Polaris|Pole Star]] for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty.  They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward.  The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finnishmyth.org/FINNISHMYTH.ORG/Comparative_Mythology.html|title=Comparative Mythology|website=www.finnishmyth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Mesopotamian===
In the [[Babylonia]]n epic poem ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water [[dragon]]ess [[Tiamat]], set in the sky by [[Marduk]], the Babylonian [[national god]], after slaying her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=William P.|title=The Seven Pillars of Creation: The Bible, Science, and the Ecology of Wonder|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-973079-7|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zce500t8puUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Tiamat+Milky+Way&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMxOnqjeXYAhUNylMKHRT0AZcQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Tiamat%20Milky%20Way&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacBeath|first1=Alastair|title=Tiamat's Brood: An Investigation Into the Dragons of Ancient Mesopotamia|date=1999|publisher=Dragon's Head|isbn=9780952438755|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uobfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tiamat+Milky+Way&amp;dq=Tiamat+Milky+Way&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGoZr-juXYAhVS61MKHdPDDl8Q6AEIMzAC|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was once thought to have been based on an older [[Sumer]]ian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by [[Enlil]] of [[Nippur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=E.

===Greek and Roman===
The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας ''Galaxias'') is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, ''gala''). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by [[Heracles]] when he was a baby.&lt;ref name="starryskies"/&gt; His father, [[Zeus]], was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman [[Alcmene]]. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife [[Hera]]'s milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was [[breastfeed]]ing an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way.

Another version of the myth is that [[Heracles]] (Roman [[Hercules]]) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, [[Amphitryon]] and [[Alcmene]]. [[Heracles]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Alcmene]], was naturally favored by his father, who sent [[Athena]], Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. [[Athena]], not being so motherly, decided to take him to [[Hera]] to suckle. [[Hera]] agreed to suckle [[Heracles]] As [[Heracles]] drinks the milk, he bites down, and [[Hera]] pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way. 

A story told by the Roman [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] in the ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess [[Ops]] (Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]), or Opis, the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] (Greek [[Cronus]]). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Pantheon]] and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek [[Zeus]]): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Hindu===
In the [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] collection of stories called [[Bhagavata Purana]], all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called ''śiśumãra cakra'', the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the [[abdomen]] of the dolphin and is called ''Akasaganga'' which means "The [[Ganges River]] of the Sky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to Hindu mythology, [[Vishnu]] lies meditating on [[Shesha]] with his consort [[Lakshmi]], in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk).

===Irish===
[[File:Toormore Altar Wedge Tomb and Milkyway.jpg|thumb|[[Altar Wedge Tomb]] (c. 2500–2000 BC), Ireland, under the Milky Way.]]
In [[Irish mythology]], the main name of the Milky Way was ''Bealach na Bó Finne'' — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred [[River Boyne]], which is described as "the Great Silver Yoke" and the "White Marrow of [[Fedlimid mac Daill|Fedlimid]]," names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (''Mór-Chuing Argait'', ''Smir Find Fedlimthi'').&lt;ref&gt;http://theses.univ-lyon2.fr/documents/getpart.php?id=lyon2.2009.beck_n&amp;part=159207&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names include:

*''Earball na Lárach Báine'' — the White Mare's Tail. The [[Láir Bhán]] (white mare) is believed to a relic of a sovereignty goddess, and processions featuring a white [[hobby horse]] formerly took place in [[County Kerry]] around [[Samhain]] (Hallowe'en).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bestow-you-forskolin.com/forskolin_int/?a=389910&amp;netaff=103573&amp;click_id=06_26972001_7c94d945-6287-4c36-8b2e-36a889a0c758&amp;subid1=319573&amp;netid=2&amp;ver=new&amp;geo=intl|title=Forskolin Slim|website=bestow-you-forskolin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered, the king [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] exhumed the bodies and buried them separately, but a tree grew from each grave and the branches entwined. Again he had them dug up and buried on opposite sides of a lake; but then the great cluster of stars appeared across the sky, connecting the two graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=706&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian===
In [[Hungary|Hungarian]] mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of [[Attila the Hun]] and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the [[Székelys]] (ethnic Hungarians living in [[Transylvania]]) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called "The Road of the Warriors" (lit. "Road of Armies") {{lang-hu|Hadak Útja}}. The stars are sparks from their horseshoes.

===Māori===
To the [[Māori people|Māori]] the Milky Way is the [[waka (canoe)]] of [[Tama-rereti]]. The front and back of the canoe are [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and [[Scorpius]], while the [[Southern Cross]] and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the [[Taniwha]] would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, [[Rangi and Papa|Ranginui]], was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australian Aboriginal===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
The Kaurna Aboriginal People of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the skyworld. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ''yura''; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means "monster water." Moreover, Aboriginal Groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon. Further south the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie.

In addition, the Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the skyworld. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.

Despite this however, these critics would also mention the "instantly engaging" nature of the podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/arts/missing-richard-simmons-podcast.html/|title= ‘Missing Richard Simmons,’ the Morally Suspect Podcast|accessdate=December 11, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; with

'''Neil Burgess''' (1846, [[Boston, Massachusetts]] – 1910) was an American [[Vaudeville|Vaudevillian]] comedian who specialized in female impersonation of elderly "widders".

==Biography==
He started his unusual career at age 19 when called on to fill in for an ailing actress in ''The Quiet Family'' in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

Burgess debuted in New York as a solo artist in 1872 under produce [[Tony Pastor]], when he was billed as an "Ethiopian Comedian".&lt;ref name=Bordman221&gt;Bordman, Gerald and Thomas S. Hischak. ''The Oxford Companion to American Theatre''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004: 221. {{ISBN|0-19-516986-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first role as a female impersonator came in 1877 in ''The Coming Woman'' for the Theatre Comique of [[Edward Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart]].&lt;ref name=Bordman221/&gt; He was soon recognized as one of the leading female impersonators, successively playing women's parts in vaudeville. By the 1880s, he took several such roles in ''The Widow and the Elder'', ''Betsey Bobbet: A Drama'' (later renamed ''Vim''), and the ''County Fair''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Linda A. ''Gender Play in Mark Twain: Cross-Dressing and Transgression''. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2007: 5&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest success was ''Widow Bedott'' in 1879. He also produced and starred as Auntie Abigail Prue in Charles Barnard's play ''The County Fair'' in 1889. George C. Odell later reflected on these roles: "I still see him as Widow Bedott in the kitchen, making pies, straightening out the affairs of the neighborhood and personifying, in spite of his sex, the attribuates of a managing woman. He was not the least bit effeminate, not at all like the usual female impersonator of minstrelsy or of variety, and yet he was Widow Bedott to the life, and with little suggestion of burlesque."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Linda A. ''Gender Play in Mark Twain: Cross-Dressing and Transgression''. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2007: 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess was also interested in inventions tied to the stage and backed a turntable device that allowed horses to run at full speed on stage, and another device that simulated the sound of a large crowd.

'''Oldies''' is a [[radio format]] that concentrates on [[rock and roll]] and [[popular music|pop]] music from the latter half of the 20th century, specifically from around the mid-1950s to the 1970s or 1980s.

In the 1980s and 1990s, "oldies" meant the 15 years from the birth of [[rock and roll]] to the beginning of the [[singer-songwriter]] era of the early 1970s, or about 1955 to 1972, although this varied and some stations chose 1950–1969.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
After 2000, 1970s music was increasingly included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/10/31/oldies.radio.ap/index.html |accessdate=October 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201135222/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/10/31/oldies.radio.ap/index.html |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 1980s music is beginning to also be called "oldies", though the term "classic hits" is used to distinguish the "new" oldies (the [[Generation X]] oldies) from the "old" oldies (the [[Baby Boomer]] oldies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/02/19/entertainment/e113127S14.DTL&amp;type=entertainment] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Oldies tunes are typically from [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]] genres. [[country music|Country]], [[jazz]], [[classical music]], and other formats are generally not considered oldies music, although some of those genres have their own oldies format (for instance, [[classic country]]), and a number of songs "crossed over" from country to Top 40. Occasionally the term is used to describe the rare station that includes 1940s music as well, although music from before 1955 (coinciding with the "birth of rock'n'roll") is typically the domain of the [[adult standards]] format. However, the term constitutes ambiguity for people who like old [[dancing music]].

This format is sometimes called '''Golden Oldies''' (after another album series of the same name, which was sold through bulk TV commercials), though this term usually refers to music exclusively from the 1950s and 1960s. Oldies radio typically features artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Animals]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]], and [[Sam Cooke]]; as well as such musical movements and genres as early [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[doo-wop]], [[soul music]], [[Motown]], [[British Invasion]], early [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], [[teen idol]] singers, [[teenage tragedy song]]s, and [[bubblegum pop]]. One notable omission from most oldies playlists is the music of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] of the early 1960s.

Most traditional oldies stations limit their on-air playlists to no more than 300 songs, based on the programming strategy that average listeners and passive listeners will stay tuned provided they are familiar with the hits being played. A drawback to this concept is the constant heavy rotation and repetition of the station's program library, as well as rejection of the format by active listeners. This can be avoided either through the use of a broader playlist or by rotating different songs from the oldies era into and out of the playlist every few weeks. The oldies format has an inherent advantage over current-music formats in that it can draw popular songs from a broad period of over a decade and is not bound to devote the majority of its [[spin (radio)|spins]] to a single top 40 playlist as current stations are.

Oldies has some overlap with the [[classic rock]] format, which concentrates on the rock music of the late-1960s and 1970s and sometimes plays newer material made in the same style as the older songs. Traditionally, classic rock focuses on the heavier rock music of the era while oldies focuses on the lighter pop music.

==History==

===1970s===
Oldies stations as they are known today did not come into existence until the early 1970s. In the 1970s, [[KOOL-FM]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] became one of the first radio stations to play oldies music, at that time focusing on the 1950s and early 1960s. KOOL is still playing oldies today.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the 1960s, very few [[Top 40]] Radio stations played anything older than a few years old. In the late 1960s, a few FM stations adopted Top 40 formats that leaned towards adults who did not want to hear the same 30 songs over and over again but also did not want to hear easy listening music featured on [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] radio stations. They mixed in oldies with their current product and played new music only several times per hour. These radio stations were often referred to as "Golden" or "Solid Gold" stations. Some AM radio stations also began to employ this format. There were also syndicated music format packages such as [[Drake-Chenault]]'s "Solid Gold" format, frequently used on FM stations that needed separate programming from their AM sisters due to the new FCC rules on simulcasting, that functioned as a hybrid of oldies and the adult-oriented softer rock hits of the day. The popularity of the movie ''[[American Graffiti]]'' is often credited with helping to spur the 1950s nostalgia movement of the early 1970s, and it was out of this 1950s nostalgia movement that some of these stations, such as [[WRDT|WHND]]/[[WCSX|WHNE]] "Honey Radio" in Detroit, [[WCBS-FM]] in New York, [[WQSR]] [[Baltimore]], and [[WBZ-FM|WROR]] in Boston, sprang up and were classified as Oldies stations and not Adult Top 40 stations. These stations, however, did play current product sparingly (one or two per hour) throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s; WCBS-FM, for example, played current hits under the moniker "Future Gold" as late as the late 1980s, and [[WLNG]] on nearby [[Long Island]] featured a roughly 50/50 mix of current hits and oldies from the early 1960s until about 1999. [[WHKW#WGAR (AM)|WGAR]] in Cleveland and [[KRLA 1110]] in Los Angeles were other examples of Top 40 stations with heavy oldies orientations; KRLA was in fact promoted in the 1970s as the "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]-to-[[Elton John|Elton]]" station.

Most of these "Solid Gold" stations began to either evolve into other formats or abruptly drop the format altogether from the late 1970s to early 1980s.   Most AM solid Gold stations simply flipped to other formats. Some FM stations evolved into [[Adult Contemporary]] stations such as WROR Boston, WFYR Chicago, for example. Other FM stations simply moved into other formats like Rock, Top 40, Urban, or Country. In the early 1980s many Adult Contemporary stations began mixing in more oldies into regular rotation. Many of these stations had oldies shows on Saturday nights.

===1980s and 1990s===

Gradually, beginning in 1982, both AM and FM stations began flipping to a full-time oldies format playing "All Oldies All The Time". These stations played strictly music from 1955 to 1973 focusing on the 1964 to 1969 era. By the mid to late 1980s stations like [[WDRC-FM]] Hartford, [[WODS]] Boston, [[WOGL]] Philadelphia, [[KLUV]] Dallas, 970AM [[WWSW]] [[Pittsburgh]], [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]] [[Chicago]], 1050AM [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] [[Toronto]], and many others had sprung up. Some had as few as 300 songs while stations like WODS and WOGL had as many as 1,500 songs in regular rotation. By 1989, most large and medium markets had at least one Oldies station. By 1990, most were on FM.

This period also saw the rise of syndicated radio shows specifically aimed at an oldies format. They included "Soundtrack Of the 60s" with [[Murray the K]], "[[Dick Clark's Rock, Roll &amp; Remember]]", "Live From the 60s with the [[Don Steele|Real Don Steele]]", "Cruisin America With [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Brucie]]", and "American Gold with [[Dick Bartley]]". Most of these shows were three hours in length and featured much of the same music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that was in rotation at affiliate stations.  All but a few of these shows had ended their run by the mid-1990s, though Bartley's show remains on air (now focusing on the 1970s and 1980s) while Clark's and Steele's can still be heard in reruns.

From 1986 to 1990 several solid gold stations evolved into full-time oldies stations by eliminating current and recent product, gradually eliminating 1980s songs, and even limited 1970s songs severely. KRTH and WQSR both did this in the late 1980s into the early 1990s. WCBS-FM however continued playing current product in regular rotation until 1988. After that, they continued playing it once an hour between 11 p.m. and 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. until 2001. WCBS-FM also played several 1990s songs per shift during these overnight hours. They also continued to play between one 1980s song every couple hours to as many as two per hour day and night. WCBS-FM also played from three to five songs per hour from the 1970s. They indeed played more 1970s music than any other notable oldies station. At the same time, WCBS-FM featured slightly more pre 1964 songs than the average station playing as many as five of those per hour.

Oldies stations continued to be late 1960s based throughout the 1990s. WCBS-FM was an exception. Most AM oldies stations also disappeared by the early 1990s except in markets where there was no FM oldies outlet. The format fared well with no end in sight.

===Decline of oldies formats===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}In 2000, oldies stations began to notice their demographics were getting older and harder to sell. Still, at that time few stations dumped the format altogether. A few (such as Orlando's [[WOCL]]) went for a flavor-of-the-month format called "Jammin' Oldies". But most continued to hang onto the format initially.

Since 2000, stations have begun to limit selections from the 1950s and early 1960s. At the same time these stations began playing songs from as late as 1979 and even a few 1980s songs. WCBS-FM New York slightly cut back on the pre-1964 oldies and slightly increased the 1970s and 1980s songs early in 2001. They also eliminated the overnight currents and recurrents at the same time along with some specialty shows.

In 2002, many oldies stations began dropping pre-1964 music from their playlists, since the earlier music tended to appeal to an older demographic that advertisers found undesirable—hence, the addition of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. WCBS-FM canceled their "Doo Wop Shop" program and began playing only one pre-1964 oldie per hour; by 2003, there were fewer than 50 songs from the 1950s and early 1960s in the regular rotation. Many other oldies stations eliminated their early rock-era catalog altogether, and rare exceptions included mainstay songs such as "[[Louie Louie]]" by [[The Kingsmen]] and "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" by [[Ben E. King]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

From 2003 to 2006, many FM oldies stations—including KRTH, WOGL and KLUV—evolved into [[classic hits]],  classic rock, or gold-based [[adult contemporary]] formats (e.g. [[WHTT-FM|WHTT]] in Buffalo, New York). Others simply dumped the format altogether.

The changes in selection have created some confusion over the definition of "oldies", while many stations have adjusted their logos to accommodate their new formats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Stations that continue to use the term "oldies" in their on-air positioning generally do not play music made after 1979 (with some exceptions) and still may play one pre-1964 oldie an hour. Still, that is not always true. But most stations that do play post-1975 music have generally dropped the word "oldies" from their positioners, using identifiers such as "Super Hits", "Classic Top 40" or "The Greatest Hits of All Time" (a la [[WRIT-FM|WRIT]] in Milwaukee, [[KLUV]] in Dallas/Fort Worth, [[WRBQ-FM]] (Q-105) in Tampa) or "Classic Gold" (a la the former format of [[CFCO]] in Chatham, Ontario, which has since switched to [[country music]], or the now-defunct "[[Classic Gold Digital Network|Classic Gold]]" oldies-radio network in the [[United Kingdom]]). Many such as [[WODS]], [[KLDE]], and [[WWBB]] said "Greatest Hits of the 60s and 70s". [[WSRZ-FM]] in Sarasota, Florida dropped their "Oldies 108" advertising [[nomenclature]] in favor of "Your Home Town Station" while expanding their playlist up to 1980. They still have their "Cruise In" segment for late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rocking50s.net|title=Rocking50s|publisher=Rocking50s.net|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 1960s music. [[KQQL]] in Minneapolis – St. Paul and [[WLDE]] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, are two other examples of oldies stations which have relegated early and mid-1960s music to weekend specialty shows.

In 2003, [[Clear Channel]]'s [[WSAI]] launched the first "Real Oldies" branded station. It was created by Programmer Dan Allen and featured mostly the songs from the beginning of rock through the [[Summer of Love]], 1967. It was a recreation of the WSAI that dominated Cincinnati ratings in the 1960s and early 1970s and returned original WSAI DJs to the air, such as Dusty Rhodes, Jack Stahl, Ted McAllister and Casey Piotrowski. Unlike the 300 songs normally played, the Real Oldies format featured a very wide playlist and spawned clones all around the country. Soon, other radio stations such as [[WWKB]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[WYTS|WCOL]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and [[WRLL (defunct)|WRLL]] in Chicago adopted the "Real Oldies" moniker. Most of these "Real Oldies" stations were on the AM dial and featured legendary personalities from the 1960s–1970s golden Top 40 era (for example, [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] legend [[Larry Lujack]] was part of the WRLL air staff). The "real oldies" format mostly faded in popularity from 2004 to 2006 as less expensive formats, including satellite-fed [[progressive talk radio]], became more attractive to station operators who began reducing their investments into AM radio stations. A handful of stations remain. Clear Channel has maintained the Real Oldies format on Iheartradio.com with Dan Allen programming and hosting along with two other WSAI personalities, Bobby Leach and Marty Thompson. It is also available on AM and FMHD2 stations in [[Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]].

Veteran [[New York, NY|New York]] radio programmer [[Scott Shannon]] developed a format known as the "[[True Oldies Channel]]," distributed via satellite by [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]], which features some of the music featured on "Real Oldies" stations as well as hits of the 1960s and very early 1970s, but generally nothing after 1975. The most high-profile "True Oldies Channel" affiliate is probably WLS-FM in Chicago, which adopted the "True Oldies" approach in the wake of WJMK's change to [[Jack FM]]. However, WLS-FM has slowly been adding more local personalities (including veteran radio personalities [[Greg Brown (disc jockey)|Greg Brown]] and [[Dick Biondi]]), and now only airs 'True Oldies' from 10am-3pm weekdays, overnights, and weekends. [[WIFO-FM]] Jesup, Georgia airs the True Oldies Channel during weekends as a contrast to its normal weekday country programming, and it is well received. True Oldies has also evolved to include more 1970s music and less pre-1964 product, and at times plays 1980s material, despite initial promises to the contrary.

Many stations have since dropped the oldies format because of low ad revenue despite high ratings. On June 3, 2005, New York's WCBS-FM, an oldies-based station for over three decades, abruptly switched to the Jack FM format, resulting in a tremendous outcry from oldies fans in the [[Big Apple]] and a huge decline in revenue followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/beastie-boys/news/are-oldies-the-new-jack-on-nyc-radio--45019874|title=Are oldies the new Jack on NYC radio?|agency=Associated Press|publisher=New.music.yahoo.com|date=2007-07-07|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]] in Chicago (WCBS-FM's sister station) switched to Jack FM on the same day. Some{{Who|date=April 2015}} point to the demise of WCBS-FM and WJMK as a sign that the oldies format is in danger, for many of the same reasons that the [[adult standards]] and [[smooth jazz]] formats are disappearing. However, WJMK had been struggling for many years, and was in much worse shape than most other major-market oldies stations. In addition, unlike New York City (with the possible exception of [[WMTR (AM)]] in nearby New Jersey), the Chicago market has not technically been without an oldies station since, due to the existence of the aforementioned WRLL and now WLS-FM.

Yet another reason for the discontinuance of oldies stations in recent years is the attraction of a more lucrative format as an attempt to lure younger listeners. In 2001, [[Baltimore]]'s [[WQSR]] (105.7 FM) and [[WJZ-FM|WXYV]] (102.7 FM) swapped frequencies, with WXYV being flipped from CHR/Top-40 to hip hop at the same time, and WQSR retaining its oldies format. These two stations have since changed formats again, with 105.7 going to talk and eventually to sports radio, and 102.7 being a Jack FM station. In 2004, [[WHQC|WWMG]] ("Magic 96.1") in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], switched to a Rhythmic CHR format and was renamed "96.1 The Beat". A new oldies station, nicknamed "Oldies 106.1" and carrying the [[WOLS]] callsign, was created to serve the Charlotte area, but has since been flipped to Spanish-language programming.

The oldies format returned to WCBS-FM on July 12, 2007 in an updated form featuring music from 1964 to 1989 (and without the word "Oldies", but rather "Greatest Hits" in the on-air positioning), with songs such as "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]" by [[Cyndi Lauper]], "[[Gloria (Umberto Tozzi song)|Gloria]]" by [[Laura Branigan]], and "[[We Built This City]]" by [[Starship (band)|Starship]] in rotation (though the original WCBS-FM played current hits mixed in with its oldies as late as the late 1980s and the three songs mentioned here during most of their years). Also included on the returning format were a selected number of classic oldies from the pre-1964 period.  The resurrected WCBS-FM has been well received.  Still, WCBS-FM is positioned as "Classic Hits" rather than oldies. Since 2017, the station has focused on hits of the 1970s to the 1990s, having gradually decreased the number of 1960s songs on its playlist while increasing the number of 1980s and 1990s hits it plays.

After spending almost six years as Jack FM, WJMK reverted to its oldies format in an updated form on March 14, 2011. Much like New York sister WCBS-FM, the updated playlist was broader in time range, featuring music from the early 1960s to the late 1980s. In addition, the format is positioned on-air as "The Greatest Hits of the 60s, 70s and 80s" rather than "Oldies". WJMK's reversion to the previous classic hits format it dropped in 2005 resulted in a significant increase in ratings from its previous "Jack FM" format, whose ratings began to struggle after [[WSHE-FM|WILV]] (now WSHE-FM) debuted a 1980s-shifted adult hits format.

By the mid-2010s, as the phrase "classic hits"  came to entail a format centered around late 1970s ([[disco]]-era) and 1980s pop, dance and rock format, the phrase "oldies" had come to entail a 1960s to mid-1970s format that centered mostly on [[soft rock]] and [[easy listening]], examples including [[WRME-LP]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-me-tv-fm-chicago-radio-20180427-story.html|title=MeTV FM goes from low-power TV station to top-10 Chicago radio station|first=Robert|last=Channick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other oldies radio stations==
The oldies format remains one of the most popular formats on radio in markets where it is still active. Some of the most successful major-market oldies stations today really lean towards the Classic Hits format and include [[KRTH]] "K-Earth 101" in Los Angeles, [[XHPRS-FM]] "105.7 the Walrus" in Tijuana-San Diego, [[KOLA]] 99.9 in Riverside-San Bernardino,, 98.1 [[WOGL]] in Philadelphia, [[WMJI]] "Majic 105.7" in Cleveland, and [[KLUV]] in Dallas. [[WLS-FM]] in Chicago, however is similar to the way oldies stations sounded several years back. They still play one or two pre-1964 songs an hour during the day and as many as 4 an hour at night.  However, to illustrate the continued decline in the format, San Francisco's [[KMVQ-FM|KFRC]] moved toward Classic Hits in 2005 and dropped this format entirely in 2006 in favor of the [[Rhythmic AC]] "[[MOViN]]" format which left most of Northern California without an oldies station until the debut of [[KMJE (FM)|KCCL]] (K-Hits 92.1) in Sacramento in January 2007. (However, KFRC had already evolved its format and positioning to classic hits at the time it changed to "Movin".) But KFRC was not gone for long. On May 17, 2007 with [[Free FM]] [[hot talk]] format failing on 106.9 KIFR [[CBS]] relaunched KFRC with a rock leaning classic hits format on 106.9.  But KFRC was not back for long either.  On October 27, 2008, 106.9 KFRC FM became an all news 740 KCBS AM simulcast.  KFRC now only airs on 106.9 FM HD-2 and online at KFRC.com.  But KFRC came back again.  On January 1, 2009, KFRC returned on the radio at 1550 AM, as true oldies.

[[KZQZ]], which airs in St. Louis, Missouri and began playing oldies in March 2008, has held onto the traditional oldies format, playing a wide variety of top 40 Billboard hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s.

Non-commercial [[WXRB]], 95.1 FM in Dudley, Massachusetts (one of the very first non-commercial all-oldies stations in North America) began playing Golden Oldies on March 6, 2005 at 1:00 PM, focusing on the years 1954 through 1979.

On August 27, 2009, Grand Rapids, Michigan station [[WGVU (AM)|WGVU]] became the first [[public radio]] station to feature an all-oldies format. The format has since been imitated by other public radio stations; for example, [[WCNY-FM]] in Syracuse, New York has begun broadcasting a personality-based oldies format on its [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]].

[[Jones Radio Networks]], [[Waitt Radio Networks]] and [[Transtar Radio Networks]] also offered 24-hour satellite-distributed oldies formats; since those companies have integrated into the [[Dial Global]] corporation, the networks have merged into one, [[Kool Gold]]. [[Satellite Music Network]] offered "Oldies Radio;" Oldies Radio survived until its acquisition by [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC]] but has since rebranded as [[Classic Hits (Cumulus radio network)|Classic Hits Radio]] under current owner [[Cumulus Media Networks]], focusing on music primarily from the 1970s and 1980s, with some limited 1960s music.

ABC also offered [[The True Oldies Channel]], a 24-hour oldies network programmed and [[voice-tracking|voice tracked]] at all hours by [[Scott Shannon]], at the time morning show host at ABC's [[WPLJ]]. The True Oldies Channel was conceived on the concept of avoiding the drift into 1970s and 1980s music that the oldies format was undergoing in the first years of the 21st century. Eventually, by the end of the network's terrestrial run in 2014, it had taken a hybrid approach, with both 1960s and 1970s music being featured at the core of the network, with some limited 1980s music included.

In North America, [[satellite radio]] broadcasters [[XM Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Radio|Sirius]] launched in 2001 and 2002, respectively, with more than a dozen oldies radio channels, with XM offering separate stations for each decade from the 1940s to the 1990s, and Sirius doing the same for the 1950s through the 1980s. These companies also offered specific genre channels for [[disco]] and [[dance music|dance]] hits, [[garage rock]], classic rock, classic country, and vintage R&amp;B and [[Soul music|soul]] hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xmradio.com/onxm/full-channel-listing.xmc|title=XM Channel Lineup|publisher=Xmradio.com|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/CachedPage&amp;c=ChannelLineup&amp;cid=1139320914821|title=Sirius Satellite Radio Channel Guide|publisher=Sirius.com|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pay radio channels boasted thousands of songs in their libraries, ensuring far less repetition than traditional broadcast stations. (In November 2008, following a [[Sirius XM Radio|merger]] of Sirius and XM, the two services shifted to a unified group of "decades" channels, with the playlists for most cut back to reflect a more conventional style of oldies programming.) [[Music Choice]] similarly offers an interruption-free oldies station (which covers the 1950s and 1960s, primarily from the rock and roll era) as well as decades channels for the 1970s through the 1990s. A number of [[Internet radio]] stations also carry the format.

==Classic hits format==
{{Main|Classic hits}}
A variation on the oldies theme is classic hits, which provides most of the playlist of oldies with some classic rock with an addition of contemporaneous R&amp;B and pop hits as well, striking a balance between the mostly 1970s-focused classic rock genre and the more broad-based oldies format. The evolution of oldies into classic hits is an example of [[channel drift]].

'''''OsWALD''''', also known as '''''OsWALD Of The Ice Floes''''',&lt;ref&gt;http://hol.abime.net/2326&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1988 Danish computer game for [[Amiga]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The game was designed by [[Ivan Sølvason]] for use as a game controlled over a [[push-button telephone]], for [[TV 2 (Denmark)|Danish TV2]]'s Friday night prime time program [[Eleva2ren]]. The game sold well in Denmark due to the exposure in Eleva2ren.&lt;ref name="slides"&gt;http://datamuseum.dk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/OsWALD-og-Hugo-pr%C3%A6sentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sølvason later designed ''[[Hugo (franchise)|Hugo the TV Troll]]'', also for Eleva2ren and using the same push-button telephone concept. Hugo the TV Troll went on to be an international success.

==Super OsWALD==
A new version of the game named '''''Super OsWALD''''', featuring two-player mode, was created for Eleva2ren in 1989.&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;

"'''Pagan Poetry'''" is a song recorded by Icelandic singer [[Björk]] for her fourth album, ''[[Vespertine]]''. It was released as the second single from the album on 5 November 2001, by [[One Little Indian Records]].

The single peaked at number 38 in the UK and number 15 in Canada.

== Writing and recording ==

It was written and produced by Björk with additional production by [[Marius de Vries]] and mixed by [[Mark Stent|Mark "Spike" Stent]]. The music box adaptation, featured in the song, was done by Jack Perron and the full version was later featured as a B-side song on the "[[Cocoon (Björk song)|Cocoon]]" single.

==Critical reception==
Heather Phares of [[AllMusic]] said of "Pagan Poetry" that it "shares a spacious serenity with the album's quietest moments" and included this song as a track pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vespertine-mw0000586936 |title=Vespertine – Björk |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=24 January 2018 |last=Phares |first=Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "In 'Pagan Poetry', she deploys the implied heaven of Zeena Parkins harp and a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/vespertine-20010820 |title=Vespertine |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=20 August 2001|accessdate=24 January 2018 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' said "'Pagan Poetry' sounds like the prelude to a particularly exotic sexual interlude".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=866|title=Bjork - Vespertine|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|accessdate=24 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024140049/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=866|archivedate=24 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul Campbell from ''7'' magazine called the track "terrifying" and an album standout.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040216073704/http://unit.bjork.com/specials/magz/pics/7mag/7-review.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, on the Spanish edition of ''Rolling Stone'', "Pagan Poetry" was ranked number 38 by Spanish music professionals and experts on a list of the best songs of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Las 100 mejores canciones del siglo XXI|date=March 2006|journal=[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone España]]|issue=77|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' placed the song at number 227 on its list of "The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/?page=2|title=The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s: 500-201|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Pagan Poetry" was directed by [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]], who had previously photographed the cover image for her third studio album ''[[Homogenic]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unit.bjork.com/specials/gh/SUB-07/index.htm|title=Pagan Poetry|accessdate=25 January 2018|publisher=Bjork.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629004356/http://unit.bjork.com/specials/gh/SUB-07/index.htm|archivedate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video is described as being about "a woman preparing herself for marriage and for her lover". It features highly blurry and stylized images of explicit sex from Björk's personal footage, including [[fellatio]] and [[ejaculation]], and images of large needles sewing pearls to skin.&lt;ref name="slant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/top-10-bjork-music-videos|title=Top 10 Björk Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|date=5 July 2013|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the video features Björk in a dress designed by [[Alexander McQueen]], which covers only the lower portion of her body. The upper portion of the dress consists of pearls piercing her skin, which is shown throughout the first half.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unit.bjork.com/specials/gh/SUB-07/making/|title=The Light of Love: The Making of the Pagan Poetry Video|last=Alien|first=Rock|date=2002|publisher=bjork.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509084401/http://unit.bjork.com/specials/gh/SUB-07/making/|archivedate=9 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video ends with a shot of a [[Corset piercing]].

The video had three stages of shooting: a video shoot of piercings, a private video shoot handled by Björk, and a film shoot of Björk. The piercings video and film shoot were done in a day in June 2001 in Knight's studio in London. The sole light source was diffused sunlight shining through the ceiling windows of the second floor daylight studio. This studio gave a "northlight" look and had a rawness to it that matched the subject matter, photography director Simon Chaudoir said.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt;

Five young women who were into subculture and piercings were cast for the video. Knight directed Chaudoir to shoot the piercings by placing the Sony Mini DV camera on the women's bodies—mostly chests, arms, and shoulders—and getting as physically near as he could while maintaining a close, macro focus on a wide-angle lens. A nurse and piercing unit were on hand, but no thimble, so the bleeding most often came from cast girls' thumbs as they pushed the needles in. "It was one of the most difficult things I've ever filmed because I felt I was on the verge of throwing up. I liked to actually only watch it by the video monitor rather than with my eyes as it were because it was just too much", Chaudoir said.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt; Björk also pierced her own ear at the shoot, but all other piercings were the cast girls'. Knight gave Björk  a Sony Mini DV camera and asked her to shoot her own private scenes.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt;

}}
Tired of music videos which featured the singer looking to the camera and lip-synching throughout, Chaudoir suggested having Björk lip-synch and look into the camera only for some of the last lines. He also suggested using a track so they could move closer to her as she sings these lines or move closer before she sings them—"so it's like a reveal of her", he said.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt; There was no script, so some improvisation made it to the final cut.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt; Since blue-screening and [[Computer-generated_imagery|CGI]] work were not involved, Chaudoir did not use diffusion or consulted with post-production, and he arrived with only a few assistants—a gaffer, loader, grip, focus puller, and some electricians. "Basically what I was asked to do and what I thought I'd be able to do is more or less there. It would have benefited from being simplified down to a much more bold and direct visualization of what she was trying to do. I think we were too subtle in that", Knight said.&lt;ref name="making" /&gt;

The video was banned by [[MTV]] in the United States, but was eventually shown in unedited form on [[MTV2]] in a presentation of the "20 Most Controversial Music Videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diffuser.fm/bjork-cocoon-banned-music-videos/|title=Bjork, ‘Cocoon’ – Banned Music Videos|last1=Robinson|first1=Joe|date=5 July 2013|website=[[Diffuser.fm]]|publisher=Townsquare Media|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video was placed sixth on the "20 Of The Most Controversial Music Videos Ever" list by ''NME'', which described it as "scarier than her dead swan dress or when she punched that photographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Lisa|url=http://www.nme.com/list/20-of-the-most-controversial-music-videos-ever/373505#fECiYIozjt2ZqDMi.99|title=Top 10 Björk Music Videos|date=20 March 2015|work=NME|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included on the list by ''Rolling Stone'', "The 15 Most NSFW Music Videos of All Time",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-15-most-nsfw-music-videos-of-all-time-20110713/bjoerk-pagan-poetry-2-aa-436943|title=The 15 Most NSFW Music Videos of All Time|date=13 July 2011|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered by ''Slant'' the sixth best music video by Björk.&lt;ref name="slant" /&gt; The dress was shown in [[Björk (exhibition)|Björk's MoMA retrospective]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-a-tour-of-the-bjrk-exhibition-at-moma-20150-008-photo.html|title=Scandalous dress|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold as part of Kerry Taylor Auctions "Passion for Fashion" sale in London, in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/kerrytaylor/catalogue-id-kerry-10002/lot-8da7650c-b61d-4434-b936-a60f00edb12f|title=Björk's Alexander McQueen pearl beaded 'bridal' gown, made for the Pagan Poetry' video, 2001|accessdate=25 January 2018|publisher=The Saleroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peek-A-Boo Poker''''' ({{zh|t=撲克精靈|p=Pūkè Jīnglíng|l=Poker Wizard}}), is a [[video game]] made by the company Idea-Tek and distributed by [[Hacker International]]/[[Panesian]] in 1991 as one of their three [[pornographic]] video games for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], the other two being ''[[Magic Bubble]]'' and ''[[Hot Slots]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve L. Kent, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7KfAAAAMAAJ ''The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon and Beyond: The Story Behind the Craze That Touched Our Lives and Changed the World''], Prima, 2001, pp. 399, {{ISBN|0-7615-3643-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7615-3643-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="htb"/&gt;

==Summary==
One of only a few adult video games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the distribution was limited as major national chains would not carry the items for sale.&lt;ref name="htb"&gt;Nick Shoveen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYpksq148R4C ''How To Be  Porn Producer''], Magic Lamp Press, 2007, pp.146-8,  {{ISBN|1-882629-99-X}}, 9781882629992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Brathwaite, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xc8TAQAAIAAJ ''Sex in Video Games''], Charles River Media, 2007, pp.40, {{ISBN|1-58450-459-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58450-459-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay consists of a simple [[strip poker]] simulator in which the player can see a different reward screen, consisting of an erotic image of a woman, for every $1000 they collect in winnings, to a maximum of $5000.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Carter, "Battle against risque video games wages on after 20 years", University news wire, August 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses standard [[five-card draw]] [[poker]] rules.  There are three computer controlled players: Full House Francine, Double Dealing Debby, and Pok-er Penny.

'''''Perestroika''''' (also known as '''''Toppler''''') is a [[Russian language|Russian]] video game released in 1989 by a small software developer called Locis (Nikita Skripkin, Aleksander Okrug and Dmitry Chikin, currently - Nikita online&lt;ref name="Nikita_online"&gt;[http://www.nikitaonline.ru Nikita Online], Nikita Online Company website&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1990, and named after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policy of [[Perestroika]]. Its splash screen shows Gorbachev and the [[Kremlin]], the seat of Soviet government. The splash screen includes imagery suggestive of crumbling masonry, perhaps symbolizing the deterioration of public infrastructure in the twilight years of the Soviet Union.

The game consists of controlling a small frog-like creature which jumps from one [[Nymphaeaceae|lily pad]] to another, trying to collect dots in four colours symbolizing grocery goods, currency transactions, progressive taxes and adventures and to reach a certain pad in the right-top corner of the screen. The lilies, symbolizing the ever-changing laws and acts in the USSR, constantly shrink and disappear only to appear in other places. Higher levels also feature one or more evil creatures called "[[bureaucrat]]s" which follow the frog and try to eat it. The frog dies if the lily pad on which it is standing disappears, if the player moves it to a place where there is no lily pad, or if it is caught by a bureaucrat.

Perestroika runs under [[DOS]], and it was written in [[Borland C++]] using the [[Borland Graphics Interface]] and has a resolution of 640×350.

Nikita Online &lt;ref name="Nikita_online"/&gt; released a [[Video game remake|remake]] of this game for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]—Toppler for Windows—and chose the frog from the game as its logo.

The frog itself and the second game name (which is mentioned in the file name ''toppler.exe'') may be inspired by the [[Nebulus (video game)|Tower Toppler]] game.

== Other versions ==

The game exists also in a version for computers [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and compatible. It was programmed by a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] programmer group ''GCC'' under a Czech variant of the name '''Perestrojka'''.&lt;ref name="Perestroika_in_ZX_spectrum"&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003661&amp;loadpics=3 Perestrojka] at [[World of Spectrum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The producer was a company [[Proxima - Software]], the game was published in 1992 as a part of compilation [[Mah Jongg (compilation)|Mah Jongg]].

The game exposes the [[List of Resident Evil characters#Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella Corporation]]'s meddling throughout the ''Resident Evil'' series through narration from [[Albert Wesker]], a former Umbrella Corporation scientist, and hidden documents pertaining to the organization's secret motives and actions. The game is composed of five scenarios that recapitulate the events of ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', the [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|''Resident Evil'' remake]], and ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', as well as new material pertaining to the Umbrella Corporation's downfall.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ResidentEvilChroniclesJill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jill Valentine|Jill]] using her taser counterattack]]

''The Umbrella Chronicles'' is an on-rails shooter. Players follow a pre-set path, shooting enemies and picking up optional weapons and health items, occasionally choosing between multiple paths. Using the analog stick on the Nunchuk, players can look around in a limited manner. In some cases, the Wii Remote can be used to activate melee weapons against enemies where the camera shifts to a third-person view, or use timed button presses in certain [[cutscene]]s to evade traps and enemy attacks. Each stage is split into individual chapters and contains save checkpoints at the end of each chapter. Stars are obtained at the end of each stage, based on the player's performance, which can be used to upgrade weapons. To unlock some levels and sublevels, the player needs a certain ranking, "S" being the best. The amount of destroyed items, obtained objects, files, critical hits and clear time affects this.

Upon beating Hunk's "4th Survivor" mission, [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative mode]] will be unlocked for the single-player missions. When selecting characters, an option will appear on the screen to select co-op mode. Both players will play as the same character, but each player will have their own aiming reticule. {{clear left}}

==Plot==
''The Umbrella Chronicles'' encompasses several scenarios, which are based on various plot elements from the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. The game's first three scenarios, "Train Derailment", "The Mansion Incident", and "Raccoon's Destruction", are set within [[Raccoon City]], or its surrounding area, in 1998. The final scenario, which is based on new material, is set in Russia, taking place in 2003. The game features nine playable characters from previous ''Resident Evil'' games, including [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]], [[List of Resident Evil characters#Billy Coen|Billy Coen]], [[Chris Redfield]], [[Jill Valentine]], [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliviera|Carlos Oliviera]], [[Albert Wesker]], [[Ada Wong]], [[Richard Aiken]], and [[Hunk (Resident Evil)|Hunk]]. 

The game's first scenario, based on the events of ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', follows STARS operative Rebecca Chambers, and former Marine Billy Coen as they venture through a train that eventually takes them to a derelict training facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote= '''Resident Evil 0 Digest 1:''' Facing certain death, Rebecca was rescued by the prisoner, Billy Coen. Rebecca was still suspicious of Billy but realized that they needed to work together if they wanted to survive the nightmare. Shortly after, the train suddenly started to move. It accelerated and was rapidly approaching dangerous speeds. To prevent the imminent derailment, the pair engaged the brake. However, it was too late and the train rolled on its side. The two barely managed to escape the wreck. Nearby was Umbrella’s Management Training Facility.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once within the facility, they discover they are being stalked by [[List of Resident Evil characters#James Marcus|James Marcus]], one of the Umbrella Corporation's co-founders and former scientists, who has managed to resurrect himself with the aid of [[leech]] test-subjects.&lt;ref name="rezero"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Resident Evil 0 Digest 2:''' While monitoring Billy and Rebecca’s progress, they began to sense a presence bent on Umbrella’s destruction and decided to destroy the facility... The pair eventually met with a reanimated Marcus. He told them the startling story of how he was assassinated 10&amp;nbsp;years ago. The copied Marcus eventually transformed into Queen Leech while the timer began to run down on a bomb that was set to level the facility... }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a confrontation, Marcus mutates into a monstrosity, but is subdued by the duo. Chambers and Coen escape as the facility self-destructs.&lt;ref name="rezero"/&gt; Another sub-chapter within the scenario traces Wesker's actions, now posing as the leader of STARS' Alpha team, as he attempts to escape the training facility. This chapter also introduces Sergei Vladimir and one of his bodyguard Tyrants, codenamed "IVAN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Albert Wesker:''' It is time for me to abandon the sinking ship that is Umbrella.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Albert Wesker:''' Wesker Here, I will use the ropeway to return to the training facility, and depart from there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game then proceeds to retell the events of the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. The scenario follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, as opposed to the actual ''Resident Evil'' game, which features the two splitting up. Redfield and Valentine are forced to battle their way through a mansion full of undead residents before stumbling upon a secret Umbrella Corporation research facility in the mansion's basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Resident Evil Digest 1:''' The survivors – Chris, Jill, Barry and Wesker – resumed the search for Bravo Team, but found that most of them had already been killed by zombies.

The Tyrant pursued Jill and Chris, while in the background a self-destruction mechanism had been initialized.

I did not have time to enjoy my newfound life. I had something I needed to do. Time to grab the data and get out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next scenario visits Raccoon City during the events of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]''. Valentine returns to the game, and is paired with mercenary Carlos Oliveira, as they attempt to survive an outbreak of the T-virus.&lt;ref name="RE3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Resident Evil 3 Digest 1:''' One of the U.B.C.S. men was mercenary Carlos Oliveira.

The game's final scenario is composed of new material, which trails Redfield and Valentine as they and other armed anti-bioweapon activists investigate the Umbrella Corporation's final stronghold in Russia.&lt;ref name="darkthrone"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=November 13, 2007 |platform=[[Wii]] |quote='''Jill Valentine:''' There's no time to wait for authorization from the Russian Government.

The game was initially going to play similarly to ''Resident Evil 4''. However, in an interview with Famitsu, the game's producer Masachika Kawata revealed the reason for the drastic change in gameplay: according to him, "Wii users like easiness" and that a ''Resident Evil 4''-style game is "too complicated" for Wii users to enjoy. Masachika Kawata then elaborated that "complex operability can be an obstacle for Wii users", and that he purposefully had to "compromise to a lower difficulty level" and "reduce enthusiast-only elements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/784/784627p1.html IGN: Umbrella Chronicles Was Like RE4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314025738/http://wii.ign.com/articles/784/784627p1.html |date=March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wii version of ''The Umbrella Chronicles'' has received positive scores from critics. ''[[GamePro]]'' praised its unlockable secrets and satisfying gameplay, adding that "the only downside to ''The Umbrella Chronicles'' is that longevity will be an issue."&lt;ref name="Gamepro-Review"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tae|last=Kim|publisher=[[GamePro]]|url= http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/147348.shtml|title=Review: Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=December 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114112137/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/147348.shtml|archivedate=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameTrailers]] called it "fantastic overall" and a "superb entry in the genre," praising the game for its surprising length and unlockable content, but stated that while the graphics "look good", they were sometimes "a step behind" ''Resident Evil 4'' and added that having the game on rails actually makes it scarier, and that it's "basically a love letter" to fans of the series.&lt;ref name="Gametrailers-Review"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/27764.html | title = Resident Evil: UC review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date=November 12, 2007 | accessdate=December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] praised the game for having "amazingly cool" design but complained about the lack of representation from ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''4'' as well as the gameplay, which they felt was too slow; on the other hand, they called the presentation "pretty impressive" and stated that "there’s no denying the fun" they had with it.&lt;ref name="IGN-Review"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = IGN| url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/835/835031p3.html | title = Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Review| last=Bozon | first=Mark | date=November 13, 2007 | accessdate =December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] praised the easy controls and the look and feel of the game, but criticized the music, stating that "it undermines the atmosphere," and that the "on-rails shooter gameplay can still feel restrictive.&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Review"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/residentevilseries/review.html | title = Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Review| last=Suttner | first=Nick | date=November 13, 2007 | accessdate =November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]] called it "a surprisingly meaty experience" and "an accessible, mostly satisfying shooter" and praised the depth and strategy offered by the gameplay, but complained about difficult headshots and stated that "it never really amounts to more than its concept".&lt;ref name="1UP-Review"/&gt;

The Wii version of the game has sold over 1.4&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;CAPCOM | Press Release 2007, [http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/news/html/e080304.html Capcom's "Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles" Breaks 1 Million!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403174856/http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/news/html/e080304.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5923">'''Screen-Free Week''' (formerly '''TV Turnoff Week''' and '''Digital Detox Week''') is an annual event where children, families, schools and communities are encouraged to turn off screens and "turn on life". Instead of relying on [[television program]]ming for entertainment, participants read, daydream, explore, enjoy nature, and spend time with family and friends. Over 300 million people have taken part in the turnoff, with millions participating each year.

In 2010, [[Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood]] (CCFC) became the home of Screen-Free Week at the request of the Board of the Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness (CSTA), which ran the initiative since 1994 (first as TV-Free America).  CCFC launched a new website and developed a new Organizer's Kit, fact sheets, and other materials for Screen-Free Week 2011 and beyond.  The Screen-Free Week Organizer's Kit is available as a free download.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenfree.org|title=Screen-Free Week|website=Screen-Free Week|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1994, the week was first championed by TV-Free America, and promoted by [[Adbusters]] magazine and other organizations.  TV-Free America then became Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness.  CSTA was an organization that encouraged all people to use electronic screen media responsibly and then have more time for a healthy life and more community participation. It was a [[grassroots]] alliance of many different organizations, with participation in over 70 nations around the world. Screen Free week happens in Canada.

CCFC changed the name of TV-Turnoff to Screen-Free Week in 2010, since entertainment media (and [[advertising]]) are increasingly delivered through a variety of screens (computers, hand-held devices, etc.), and not just traditional [[television commercial]]s.  In 2008 [[Adbusters]] changed the name of '''TV Turnoff Week''' to '''Digital Detox Week''' to reflect the growing predominance of computers and other digital devices.

==Future Dates==
*2018: April 30 – May 6
*2019: April 29 – May 5

==Members and supporters==
Important members of the network include [[Adbusters]] in [[Canada]] and [[White Dot]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (named after the small white dot that would briefly appear when turning off older [[TV set]]s, especially [[black-and-white]] ones). A related organization, {{lang|es|Asesores TV La Familia Internacional}}, works in many countries with large [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking populations. In France, {{lang|fr|Casseurs de pub}} is part of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casseursdepub.org/ Casseurs de pub&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, [[Instituto Alana]] promotes the ''Semana sem telas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alana.org.br/semana-sem-telas-2013   Semana sem telas 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than seventy other organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]], the [[American Medical Association]], [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]] and the [[YMCA]], support the movement in the US. In 2004, a major partnership was created with the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Anti-TV "guerrillas" use a small device known as [[TV-B-Gone]] to remotely turn off television sets within {{convert|14|m|ft}} in an attempt to reduce "ambient TV" in public spaces.

A '''shooting range''', '''firing range''' or '''gun range''' is a specialized facility designed for [[firearm]]s qualifications, training or practice.  Shooting ranges are typically operated by military or law enforcement agencies, though the majority of ranges are privately-owned and cater to recreational shooters.{{contradict-inline|reason=It can't be majority one thing but typically another thing! Someone with actual references should pick one or the other.}}  Each facility is typically overseen by one or more supervisory personnel, called variously a ''range master'' or "Range Safety Officer" (RSO) in the US, or a ''range conducting officer'' (RCO) in the UK.  Supervisory personnel are responsible for ensuring that all [[weapon safety]] rules and relevant government regulations are followed at all times.

Shooting ranges can be indoor or outdoor, and may be restricted to certain types of type of firearm that can be used such as [[handgun]]s or [[rifle]]s, or they can specialize in certain shooting sports such as [[skeet shooting]] or [[10 m Air Pistol|10&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;Air&amp;nbsp;Pistol]]/[[10 m Air Rifle|Rifle]].  Most indoor ranges restrict the use of certain powerful calibers, rifles, or fully automatic weapons.

A '''shooting gallery''' is a recreational shooting facility with very low-powered guns, often located within [[amusement park]]s, [[amusement arcade|arcade]]s, [[carnival]]s or [[fair]]grounds that provides [[game]]s and [[entertainment]]s for the visiting crowd.

==Type==
In urban areas, most shooting ranges will be at indoor facilities.  Indoor ranges offer protection from inclement weather conditions and can be operated around the clock under controlled environmental conditions.  Outdoor shooting ranges are typically found away from populated areas because of concerns about safety, noise pollution and soil contamination.

===Indoor range===
[[File:Floor and sectional diagrams of a typical indoor firing range.jpg|alt=Floor and sectional diagrams of a typical indoor firing range showing the various elements of the range - firing lanes, bullet trap, wall baffles, control room or station, and any adjacent facilities such as offices, weapon cleaning room, or classrooms|center|thumb|600x600px|Floor and sectional diagrams of a typical indoor firing range&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]]
Indoor firing ranges are usually constructed as standalone structures, though they may be housed in larger buildings in basement or such.  The basic components of most indoor firing ranges consist of firing lines/lanes, targets and a [[bullet trap]]/"backstop".  Design considerations may vary depending on planned use but they all must address the basic requirements for operating the range safely, and that is provide ballistic protection, safety controls, proper ventilation, acoustic isolation and appropriate lighting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kardous|first=Chucri A.|last2=Murphy|first2=William J.|date=2010|title=Noise control solutions for indoor firing ranges|journal=Noise Control Engineering Journal|language=en|volume=58|issue=4|pages=345|doi=10.3397/1.3455050|issn=0736-2501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/wilbur15/gsa-indoor-firing-range-design-criteria-v2-0-jan-2011|title=GSA Guidance Document - Indoor Firing Ranges - Design and Operations Criteria|last=General Services Administration|first=|date=2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/05/f1/Range_Design_Criteria.pdf|title=Range Design Criteria|last=Department of Energy|first=Office of Health, Safety, and Security|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Structural components ====
[[File:Small firearm training at an indoor firing range.jpg|alt=Indoor firing range showing walls, ceiling baffles, and bullet trap|thumb|Indoor firing range showing walls, ceiling baffles, and bullet trap]]
Firing range walls are usually constructed of poured concrete, precast concrete, or masonry block.  The walls must be impenetrable and provide adequate ballistic protection from [[stray bullet]]s and back splatter.  Floors are constructed from dense reinforced concrete with a smooth surface finish. Floors are usually slanted slightly from uprange (shooting lanes) toward the bullet trap downrange to allow for better maintenance and cleaning.

Indoor firing range roofs are constructed from steel joists or precast concrete panels with a smooth flat surface that will redirect misfired bullets, facilitate maintenance, and prevent lead buildup.  Roof baffles are installed at a 25–30 degree angle protect ceilings, lighting fixtures, ventilation ducts, and any other unprotected element from stray bullets.  Baffles are typically constructed of armored plate steel covered with fire-rated plywood.  Deflectors are similar to baffles, but are not usually covered with plywood; they can be installed either vertically or horizontally and are used to redirect stray bullets from unprotected fixtures and elements inside the firing range such as doors, windows, and ventilation registers.  Shields are constructed of plate steel and plywood.

Control rooms or stations houses the central controls for the firing range equipment, communication, lights, and security.  The controls are operated by the range master–the designated official responsible for range operation and management. The control station must provide the range master with unobstructed line of sight of the firing lanes and all shooters. Control stations are usually constructed of concrete blocks with bulletproof observation windows.

Backstops and bullet traps are used to absorb the energy from the bullet and capture it to prevent overflight beyond the range area.  Bullet traps come in a variety of designs and are usually constructed of impenetrable metal plates.  The thickness of the plates and the materials used depend on the velocity and energy levels of the projectiles to be fired in the range.  Most modern traps consist of angled hardened steel plates that deflect the bullets into other metal plates to remove their energy.  The plates must be resistant to penetration, abrasion and metal fatigue.  The traps direct the spent bullets to a collection area in front of the trap or, for high-energy projectiles, at the back of the trap.

Many indoor firing ranges provide additional spaces such as a cleaning room for weapons, a classroom, restrooms (including shower facilities), office areas, lounge area, or storage and maintenance rooms.  Passageways are used to physically isolate the firing range from the adjoining areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Physical components ====
[[File:Shooting Room.JPG|thumb|An indoor shooting range]]
Some firing ranges are equipped with shooting booths to provide shooters with a defined firing area and to reduce potential hazard from misfires and ejected bullet cartridges from adjacent shooters.  Shooting booths are made of partitions or panels which can be acoustically treated to reduce the effect of weapons discharge on other shooters.  The booths are sometimes equipped with communication or target-operation equipment; target or booth lighting controls; shelves for holding weapons and bullets, or to prevent shooters from going downrange; and equipment for practicing shooting from behind a barrier.  The firing line, usually marked red or orange, runs along the downrange edge of the shooting booths.  Some ranges have motion detectors that can set off an alarm when a shooter passes this line during shooting. 

Target systems consist of a target, a target carrier system, and a target control system.  Targets for indoor firing ranges are usually a paper sheet or piece of corrugated cardboard with a printed target image on the sheet.  The target carrier system allows the firing range to operate more efficiently and safely by transporting the target and frame between the firing line and the target line, in both downrange and uprange directions.  The target control system allows the range master to control the operation and movement of the targets through a central control station in the control booth.  Some firing ranges provide local control modules that can be operated in the shooting booths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Operational components ====
[[File:Shooting range Glock.jpg|thumb|Indoor pistol shooting range]]
A critical component in the design and proper operation of an indoor firing ranges is the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] system.  Proper ventilation reduces shooters’ exposure to airborne lead particles and other combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gregory, Anthony M.|date=March–April 1990|title=RISKS OF LEAD POISONING IN FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS AND THEIR STUDENTS|url=http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/lead.html|deadurl=yes|journal=The Aslet Journal|volume=4|issue=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820115007/http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/lead.html|archivedate=2008-08-20|accessdate=2009-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ventilation systems consist of supply and exhaust air systems and associated ductwork.  Supply air can be provided through a perforated wall plenum or radial air diffusers mounted at ceiling height.  Airflow along the firing line should be no more than  0.38 m/s (75 feet per minute, fpm) with a minimum acceptable flow of 0.25 m/s (50 fpm).  Air is typically exhausted at or behind the bullet trap.  Some firing ranges are designed to have multiple exhaust points downrange to maintain downrange flow and desired velocities at the firing line.  The exhaust system should be designed to provide minimum duct air velocities of 12.70 – 15.24 m/s (2,500 – 3,000 fpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.acgih.org/forms/store/ProductFormPublic/industrial-ventilation-a-manual-of-recommended-practice-for-design-28th-edition|title=Industrial Ventilation Manual, 28th Edition, Table 3–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The equipment and designs for the ventilation systems are varied, most firing ranges have one supply and one exhaust fan, however, some have multiple supply or exhaust fans.  Very often, the air-flow rate required by the firing range and space constraints for the fans dictate the number and types of fans.  Most firing ranges have systems that supply 100% outside air to the firing range and exhaust all of the air to outside the building; but, some firing range ventilation systems are designed to recirculate some of the exhaust air to the supply air system to conserve energy especially in extreme climates.  The exhaust air is always filtered before being exhausted outside the building or recirculated to the supply system.

Lighting in the range consists of control booth, uprange area, shooting booth, and downrange lighting systems.  Control booth lighting is usually manually controlled and consists of general lighting and low-level lighting used during particular shooting conditions.  Lighting uprange of the booths is general ceiling-level lighting and can usually be controlled manually or from the central controls.  Lights downrange of the firing line are usually spotlights used to illuminate the targets at various distances downrange of the booths.

Safety control systems are installed to protect the shooters during range malfunction or emergency situations.  Such systems may include warning lights, alarm bells, and air-flow and filtration monitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Outdoor range===
[[File:Outdoor shooting range.jpg|alt=Outdoor firing range|thumb|Outdoor firing range]]
Outdoor shooting ranges are used for longer-distance shooting up to or exceeding {{convert|1200|yd|m}}.  Training might also specifically require exposure to the elements such as wind or rain. Outdoor competition shooting is preferred under benign weather conditions, although conditions may change, competition is only abandoned when safety becomes an issue.

Outdoor shooting ranges are designed to contain all fired shots.  This necessitates a high retaining wall behind the target line called a back-stop or stop-butt, comprising an earth mound, [[sandbag]] barrier or specially designed funnel-shaped traps to catch and prevent misaligned shots, errant projectile ricochets, or shots going beyond the bounds of the shooting range.  Most outdoor ranges restrict the maximum caliber size and/or projectile energy based on the design specification of the range.  Some target-shooting ranges have separate facilities devoted to the use of higher-powered firearms such as [[.50 caliber]].

Outdoor ranges may be partially enclosed and so have some features in common with indoor ranges, for example the [[British Armed Forces]] '''barrack range''' has a roofed firing point and normally has 360° walls.  As its name suggests, it is generally found in military bases rather than in the more remote areas common to outdoor ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/138226/JSP403_Vol2_Chap08_DLRSC.pdf|title= JSP403 - Defence Ranges Safety|website=MoD|language=en-uk|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several studies of outdoor firing ranges have shown that exposure to lead and noise can cause health problems, particularly among employees and instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ranges/|title= Indoor Firing Ranges - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-08|date= 2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outdoor ranges need less cleaning and maintenance than indoor ranges.  However, despite  the  natural ventilation of outdoor firing ranges, some outdoor ranges have ballistic baffles overhead, and concrete walls and structures on the sides that can cause the air to stagnate and lead to increase exposure to lead and noise.  

Consequently, operators of ranges might consider adding sound transmission barriers, absorptive materials, and natural vegetation to lessen noise emission.  Fans pointing downrange can provide air movement away from shooters to lessen lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2013-104/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Reducing Exposure to Lead and Noise at Outdoor Firing Ranges (2013-104)|website=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-08|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013104|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Air rifle
:Outdoor air rifle ranges can have a fixed distance such as {{convert|10|m|yd|0}} or {{convert|25|m|yd|0}} or be an area for the practice of the sport of [[field target]] shooting, where reset metal targets are placed in natural surroundings at various distances and elevations, with a pellet trap behind the target.

;Small-bore rifle
:Small-bore ([[.22 Long Rifle]] caliber) rifle ranges are typically {{convert|50|m|yd|0}} to accommodate the Olympic [[50 metre rifle prone|50 m Rifle]] event, but they can extend to {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}. These ranges are found around the world as part of various cadet shooting programs, sometimes reduced to {{convert|25|m|yd|0}}, or in American parlance "the thousand-inch range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 194 |author=Clark, Johnnie M. |title=Gunner's Glory: Untold Stories of Marine Machine Gunners|publisher= Ballantine Books|date= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often called "'''miniature rifle ranges'''", they featured as training establishments for initial military marksmanship training using lower-cost ammunition imparting less recoil or for entertainment [[carnival game]]s or, if built to a high specification, are used for zeroing-in full-bore rifles using specially designed "ladder" targets.

;Full-bore rifle
:Target shooting range for larger-caliber centerfire rifles are no shorter than {{convert|100|m|yd|0}}, except in the case of “Zero” ranges used for setting or checking the open (iron) or aperture (peep) sights of the rifle and telescopic sight “Zero”. Military ranges are typically at least {{convert|500|-|1000|m|yd|0}} to safely accommodate the range of most rifles. Public ranges can be as long as {{convert|2000|yd|m|0}} and typically accommodate hunters and sportsman participating in sports such as [[300 m Standard Rifle]], [[metallic silhouette]] or [[benchrest shooting]].

;Shotgun
:Specialist ranges cater for various [[clay pigeon shooting]] events and require special layouts and equipment.

===Firing point===
The firing point normally is at a defined point on the ground, and on a civilian range will usually be level and flat. Outdoor ranges without a covered firing point are usually grass, often on a slightly raised, flattened mound. Outdoor ranges with a covered firing point are usually concrete or tarmacadam. Outdoor military range firing points are not usually covered and may have other configurations, e.g., sloping, a gravel base or hole in the ground.

A "fixed firing point" or echelon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/NaturalResources/cultural/Pages/CampLogan.aspx |title=Camp Logan National Guard Rifle Range Historic District|website=Illinois.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; rifle range is where the targets are located at the various distances with the marksman or woman shooting from the one firing point. The most advanced rifle range of this design was constructed for the Commonwealth Games New Delhi 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blaserbuds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=2715 |title=CWG 2010 New Delhi Fullbore Shooting|website=BlasterBuds}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The firing point cover can be as simple as a tent, to a frame with only a roof (to keep off rain or sunshine) to a substantial building with appropriate apertures to shoot through.

[[File:Shooting range near Pittsburgh - inside 4.JPG|thumb|Shooting targets for woodchuck hunting]]

=== Targets ===
Civilian targets are usually made of paper or a plastic coreflute, sometimes with a canvas or hessian back on the larger long-range types. Most competitive targets are a solid black circle on a white background. The black circle may have scoring rings. Targets of other shapes may be used such as used in pistol (hand gun) target shooting. [[Tannerite (rifle targets)|Reactive targets]] allow shooters to easily identify bullet strikes. This allows shooters to improve their skills by quickly being able to compare their aiming point and where the actual bullet impacted the target.

Those who choose to use military surplus rifles in competition on firing ranges at set distances include bolt and semiautomatic actions, with targets used as per military standards, current and historic. The same applies for the matches they shoot. Other target types include a metal plate that is knocked over by the bullet such as in the air rifle sport of field target or handgun discipline of IPSC, and stationary metal plates of scaled animal outlines on which bullet strikes mark as well as those that mark the paint which is painted over again after scoring.

===Butts / backstop===

The butts / backstop is the area behind the target into which the shot impacts having passed through the target. Outdoor and sometimes indoor ranges have earth or sand butts. Indoor ranges can use angled plates with collectors, often with a rubber curtain through which the bullet passes and is then stopped by a metal plate.

Ranges without automatic target placements sometimes have concrete trenches where personnel lift and retract, mark and replace targets.

They need to be of sufficient height to capture the projectile intended for the target as well as any ricochet that may occur from the projectile striking the floor of the target range fairway. Usually the top is at least five degrees in elevation from the 100m firing line.

===Wind flags===
Outdoor shooting ranges sometimes have wind flags, positioned between the firing line (where the shooters are) and the targets. Shooters observe these flags to make an estimate of wind speed, which is then converted into lateral minute of angle point of aim corrections or, alternatively, windage holdoff corrections.

The flag method is the most common method used to estimate wind speed. A flag blowing in the wind will naturally blow away from the flagpole, with the angle of the bottom of the flag to the flagpole increasing with increasing windspeed. To estimate the wind speed in mph, the angle in degrees between the bottom of the flag to the flagpole at the mid-range position between the shooter and the target is divided by 4. For example, an angle of 60 degrees between the bottom of a flag and a flagpole would be estimated as a {{convert|15|mph|km/h|0}} windspeed.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clock method is then used to determine full value, half value, or no value corrections in minute of angle for this wind. Aligning the target at the 12 o' clock position or direction, with the 6 o' clock direction being directly behind the shooter, winds at 3 or 9 o'clock are equated to full value, winds at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 o'clock are equated to half value, and winds at 12 and 6 o'clock are equated to no value.
&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minute of angle correction (full value) is then commonly estimated as ((Range [meters] / 100) × Wind [mph]) / ''C'', where ''C'' is a constant. The constant ''C'' equals 15 for ranges from 100 to 500 meters, 14 for 600 meters, 13 for 700–800 meters, 12 for 900 meters, and 11 for 1,000 meters.
&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For full-value winds, this full windage correction is used. For half-value winds, the minute of correction in windage given by this formula is halved; for no-value winds, no minute of angle correction in windage is required.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple flags are required for two reasons. First, the wind speed closest to the midpoint of range has the greatest effect on the projectile.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the wind at one part of the range will not always be the same at another part.

Wind flags are not always actual flags, sometimes streamers are used, small triangle flags, or even pin wheels. Factors such as the range length and expected strength of the wind determine the best type of flag to use. When no flags are available, a small leaf or other small light object can be dropped from shoulder height, and the object is then pointed at by the shooter; the angle between his arm and his torso can provide an equivalent wind speed estimation as a wind flag, although it will not be at the mid-range location along the bullet's trajectory.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Sniper Training|journal= Field Manual |number= 32-10|date= 17 August 1994|pages= 3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archery ranges===

Oftentimes the same range is made available to both bow and gun shooters. However, there are many ranges that have been made available exclusively for [[Archery|archers]], and thousands of them can be found in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestrecurvebowguide.com/archery-range-finder-usa-map |title=US Archery Ranges Map|website=BestCurvebowGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular types of archery ranges include 3-D ranges, field ranges and indoor ranges.

==Common safety practices==
[[File:Shooting Range Safety.JPG|thumb|Very important, highly visible [[safety]] practices at a shooting range. ]]
While some ranges require that all firearms be unloaded and variously securely encased and/or trigger-locked prior to entering, or leaving, the range facility, irrespective of whether one holds a [[concealed carry (USA)|concealed carry]] license in jurisdictions where concealed carry is legal, many have no such regulations.
[[File:Warning sign posted indoor firing range to prevent Lead exposure.jpg|alt=Warning sign posted inside an indoor firing range to alert shooters and instructors about potential for lead posining|thumb|Warning sign posted inside an indoor firing range to alert shooters and instructors about potential for Lead poisoning]]
Whether indoors or outdoors, all shooters are typically required to wear eye protection as well as hearing protection (ear muffs or ear plugs) at all times when within the defined boundaries of the range. employees and users are exposed to lead dust from bullets or cartridge primers, which can be inhaled or can settle on skin or clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/05/18/firingrange/|title=Take Aim at Protecting Yourself: Solutions for Preventing Lead Poisoning and Hearing Loss at Indoor Firing Ranges|website=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the discharging of firearms in indoor ranges can produce noise levels of over 140&amp;nbsp;dB [[sound pressure level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-136/|title=Preventing Occupational Exposures to Lead and Noise at Indoor Firing Ranges|author=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|date=April 2009|work=Publication No. 2009-136}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, it is commonly recommended that those inside the range  "double up" ear protection by using both [[earplugs]] and over-the-head [[earmuffs]], and to protect range bystanders from sound exposure, Depending on the range, prescription eyeglasses may qualify as eye protection. Indoor ranges can be particularly unsafe, due to high lead exposures and increased noise exposures where the design or management is not of a quality conducive to best practice.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] issued an Alert,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-136/default.html |title=Preventing Occupational Exposures to Lead and Noise at Indoor Firing Ranges|website=CDC|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2009136|year=2009}} &lt;/ref&gt; that presents five case reports documenting lead and noise exposures, and examines firing range operations, exposure assessment and control methods, existing regulations, and exposure standards and guidelines. More information about reducing occupational exposures at indoor firing ranges can be found at [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ranges/ NIOSH Firing Range topic page]

In 2013, The [[National Academy of Sciences]] published a report titled [https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18249/potential-health-risks-to-dod-firing-range-personnel-from-recurrent-lead-exposure Potential Health Risks to DOD FIRING-RANGE PERSONNEL from Recurrent Lead Exposure.] The report highlighted the shortcomings of current occupational lead exposure standards and urged The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to update its guidelines and practices for protecting workers from lead exposure on firing ranges.

=== Safety areas ===
[[Safety area]]s are own places on shooting ranges where a small bay with a safe direction is set up for shooters to be able to handle unloaded firearms without the supervision of a Range Officer (RO). Safety areas are widely used in [[practical shooting|dynamic shooting sport]] disciplines &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/RulesCombined.pdf IPSC 2017 Combined Rules, Rule Section 2.4 Safety Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Precision Pistol Competition|PPC 1500]], and may for example be used to pack, unpack or [[handgun holster|holster]] a [[handgun|gun]], cleaning or repair, [[dry fire|dry firing]] and training with empty [[magazine]]s.

==Specialized classes and licenses==
These will vary from country to country, and even within a country. In some countries, no license or advanced training beyond just gun familiarization (for rental guns) and range rules familiarization is required for using a shooting range. In other countries, participants must be part of an organized club and must hold licenses for ownership of individual firearms. A common requirement is that the shooter must be of legal age (or have a guardian present) prior to shooting.

In the [[United States]], training classes for a [[concealed carry (USA)|concealed carry]] license are often available at shooting ranges.

==Other services==
Many target shooting ranges offer services to aid both novice and expert shooters.

Typically, a range will offer safety courses, concealed carry courses, and advanced training in firearms techniques, for a fee. In addition, some states in the USA require employees who use firearms on the job (e.g., [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] drivers, security guards) to have certain certifications. In most cases, a shooter may take a class and qualify for these certifications at a range.

Many ranges will let shooters rent firearms, as well. In most cases, ranges (especially indoor) rent out handguns and rifles in various calibers, however there are ranges that rent [[National Firearms Act|Class III/NFA]] firearms (full-auto weapons, [[Suppressor|suppressed]] weapons, etc.). Some ranges offering firearms rental also provide instructors at little to no cost as part of the rental fee.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; These contestants are the only ones to have never been in the bottom three couples or the bottom four dancers throughout the entire season.

===Season 1 (2008)===
{{Main|So You Think You Can Dance Australia (season 1)}}
Auditions for the first season were held during July and August 2008 in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Brisbane]], Melbourne, [[Adelaide]] and Sydney. After being selected, through either an impressive initial audition or after a choreography workshop, the top 100 finalists spent a week in Sydney for more auditions, ultimately forming a Top 20. Auditions began on 9 October 2007 in Brisbane, Queensland and ended in Sydney, New South Wales on 6 November 2007. A 600-seat arena was constructed in Sydney for the finals. Jack Chambers was announced as the winner on 26 April 2008. Chambers won [[Australian dollar|$]]200,000 prize money and the title of ''Australia's Favourite Dancer'', with [[Rhys Bobridge]], Kate Wormald, Demi Sorono finishing in second, third, and fourth places respectively.  Several finalists later performed during the [[Australian Idol 2008|2008]] ''[[Australian Idol]]'' grand final, as well as Ten's New Year's Eve broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MUR7mVJwMA A Jr. Idol Final – So You Think You Can Dance]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2 (2009)===
{{Main|So You Think You Can Dance Australia (season 2)}}
Auditions for the second season were held during September and November 2008. Dancers auditioning were requested to bring pre-approved copyright music CDs because of music licensing issues. Judges hoped that season 2 would see more industry dancers auditioning after the favourable response to the first season of the show. Repeats of the performance and results show aired a week later on [[MuchMusic]]. Talia Fowler was announced the winner on 27 April 2009. Fowler received [[Australian dollar|$]]200,000 prize money, the title of ''Australia's Favourite Dancer'' and the opportunity to perform at the finale of America's version of [[So You Think You Can Dance (Season 5)|So You Think You Can Dance]], while Ben Veitch came 4th place, then Amy Campbell came 3rd place, while lastly Charlie Bartley was named runner-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/09/auditions-so-you-think-you-can-dance-australia.html Auditions: So You Think You Can Dance Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Lythgoe]] and [[Mary Murphy (choreographer)|Mary Murphy]] made separate appearances in this season as guest judges.

===Season 3 (2010)===
{{Main|So You Think You Can Dance Australia (season 3)}}
The third season premiered on 31 January 2010. Robbie Kmetoni was announced the winner on 21 May 2010. Kmetoni received [[Australian dollar|$]]200,000 prize money and the title of ''Australia's Favourite Dancer''. Furthermore, he will have the opportunity to choose from three exclusive dance contracts (including [[Australian Dance Theatre]], [[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]] and Burn the Floor) to perform throughout Australia and overseas, While Phillipe Witana came 4th place, then Ivy Heeney came 3rd place, while lastly Robbie Kmetoni's secondary college friend Jessie Hesketh was named runner-up.

===Cancellation and Revival===
In July 2010, it was announced [[Network Ten]] would not recommission ''So You Think You Can Dance Australia'' for a 2011 season. It follows media speculation the show had been cancelled, and talks Ten had a new "[[Shiny-floor show|shiny floor]]" format to reveal. Ten advised [[FremantleMedia Australia]] that it would opt out of format, but didn't rule out a future return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/07/ten-dumps-dance-in-favour-of-glee-inspired-talent-series.html TV Tonight: TEN dumps Dance in favour of Glee-inspired talent series]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Ten was to develop a local version of British talent show [[Don't Stop Believing (TV series)|Don't Stop Believing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/07/auditions-dont-stop-believing.html TV Tonight: Auditions: Don’t Stop Believing]&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the success of [[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]. ''Don't Stop Believing'' was instead to be produced by Shine Australia, which is headed by former FremantleMedia Australia executives. Plans were halted late 2010, with the show cancelled before starting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/11/ten-cancels-dont-stop-believing.html TV Tonight: TEN cancels Don’t Stop Believing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Ten began airing ads for So You Think You Can Dance Australia implying it would be returning soon, but Ten were yet to release details on when.   In February 2012 rumors began to emerge in the Australian media press that former ''[[Australia's Next Top Model]]'' host [[Sarah Murdoch]] had been approached to take over hosting duties for a revival of the show&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2012/03/01/sarah-murdoch-to-front-so-you-think-you-can-dance-report/ Sarah Murdoch to front So You Think You Can Dance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304015920/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2012/03/01/sarah-murdoch-to-front-so-you-think-you-can-dance-report/ |date=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Natalie Bassingthwaighte has moved on to a judging position for Australia's iteration of music talent show [[The X Factor (Australia)|The X-Factor]].  The show was also rumored to be returning to its original network, Channel Ten.  These rumors ultimately proved to be inaccurate when Ten revealed that it had engaged Murdoch to host a different dance-themed show entitled ''[[Everybody Dance Now (Australian TV series)|Everybody Dance Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/ten-reveals-new-lineup-hits-back-at-critics-20120412-1wuki.html Ten reveals new line-up]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the show did return to broadcast on Network Ten, airing season 4 in the spring of 2014 after a four-year hiatus.

===Season 4 (2014)===
{{Main|So You Think You Can Dance Australia (season 4)}}
The show resumed airing on 9 February 2014 featuring a shortened format with one show broadcast a week, similar to the [[So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|U.S. seasons 9 and 10]].  The new format also eliminated the open audition process, with the season opening at the Top 100 stage, these dancers having been selected via audition tapes and processes not portrayed in any episode, a format atypical of So You Think You Can Dance shows, which generally show the contestant selection process from earlier auditions on.   The show also featured an entire change in judging cast, with [[Paula Abdul]], Aaron Cashacting, [[Jason Gilkison]], and Shannon Holtzapffel filling the seats of the panel, as well as a change in host, with [[Carrie Bickmore]] presenting.   The fourth season concluded on Thursday, 1 May with contemporary dancers Michael Dameski and Lauren Seymour taking 1st and 2nd places respectively.  To date, neither Network Ten nor the show's producers have made a statement as to whether the show will be returning for a fifth season.

==Ratings==
3 February 2008 premiere of ''So You Think You Can Dance Australia'' attracted a peak audience of 2.15 million viewers. The show was the night's top-rating program, averaging 1.83 million viewers over its timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/Dance-Up-A-Ratings-Storm-040208.html Dance Up A Ratings Storm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209115601/http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/Dance-Up-A-Ratings-Storm-040208.html |date=9 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following two audition episodes also put up respectable figures, peaking at 2.04 million and 1.94 million viewers respectively. The Sunday night Top 100 show averaged 1.6 million viewers to become the most watched program of the night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/TEN---Dance-Tops-The-Night-050208.html TEN – Dance Tops The Night] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209115608/http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/TEN---Dance-Tops-The-Night-050208.html |date=9 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/TEN---Dance-rocks-the-block-070208.html TEN – Dance rocks the block] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209115613/http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/ten/TEN---Dance-rocks-the-block-070208.html |date=9 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its debut, the weekly performance show averaged around 1.5 million viewers. The series one finale averaged 1.8 million viewers, peaking at 2.2 million viewers nationwide. Over 50 per cent of Ten's key 18–49 age demographic had tuned into the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/04/dance-ten-ratings-18m.html Dance TEN, Ratings 1.8m]&lt;/ref&gt; In season 3, ratings further slumped to a below million average, after which the show was cancelled.  Season 4's revival of the series had smaller viewership still, with most episodes pulling less than a million viewers, and several seeing viewership as low as 300,000.

==Controversy==
Jason Coleman has been questioned over his position as judge on the show, with members of the dance community accusing him of being under qualified, and using incorrect jargon on the show, calling a [[Pivot turn|pivot]] a [[Promenade (dance move)|promenade]]. Eliminated contestant Marko Panzic also accused Coleman of playing favourites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23343022-2902,00.html TV judge Jason Coleman rocks dancers]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also cite a possible conflict of interest due to Coleman's external business relationship with choreographer Kelly Aykers.

Coleman has responded to these criticisms, saying: "Mate, this is just nit-picking. With this show a pivot is the same thing as a promenade. In my world it's called a promenade, in the ballroom dancing world it's called a pivot. I'm aware of the differences but I don't have time in my minute-and-a-half speech to explain that." In response to the Aykers issue, he said: "Kelly Aykers has delivered three great routines. I would never put myself in a position where I would compliment a person's work because they are my friend. If the work deserves a compliment it will receive it, if it does not, it will not."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23342955-5001026,00.html Dance judge branded 'amateur']&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has also received criticism from the Australian dance community and mainstream media over the representation of the art of dance on the show. In one example, commentator Valerie Lawson observes that "''So You Think You Can Dance Australia'' goes further. Its very success ... is compromising dance as a performance art. The audience is led to believe that the most obvious effort, the most athletic of tricks, and the most vulgar of moves, represent dance at its best. As hips swivel, the studio audience cheers. When a guy lifts a girl with as much finesse as a forklift truck the audience roars its approval."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/opinion/australia-you-cant-dance-like-that/2008/03/02/1204402265772.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Valerie Lawson – Australia, you can't dance like that" Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

On two occasions the show has accidentally broadcast profanities during the PG-rated live show. On the first occasion, Ten issued an apology for a "indistinct and muffled" profanity uttered during the first elimination show, and promised that "efforts [have been] redoubled to prevent such an incident happening again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23241603-5006014,00.html Cursing catches Ten on the hop]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, when Sermsah Bin Saad was making his speech after being eliminated, he accidentally swore on national television, saying, "You guys are so fucking awesome!". At that time, Sermsah didn't realise that it was on live and apologised after finding out his mistake. In this case the profane word was censored during broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/03/on-high-dancer-drops-f-word.html On a high, dancer drops the F word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314072036/http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/03/on-high-dancer-drops-f-word.html |date=14 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The TV critic for the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' thought that "eespite a liberal sprinkling of cliches and a pattern of stilted patches in its dialogue" the play "maintained a high degree of tension... Two major merits distinguished it. One was the originality of its theme, and the other a consistently capable standard of acting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Angry General Produced on ABN|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 April 1964|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Johnson-Jeffries Fight''''' is a 1910 American film report on the heavyweight championship boxing fight between [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[James J. Jeffries]] in [[Reno, Nevada]].

==Film==
The footage depicts the heavyweight championship that took place in Reno, NV on July 4, 1910, when reigning champion Jack Johnson, a black American, knocked out former champion James J. Jeffries, a white American, in the fifteenth round of a very one-sided fight. The fight was already a media sensation weeks before it happened and was dubbed "The Fight of the Century". This sparked motivation to film the event as it was thought to be a guaranteed money-maker. The fight's promoter, George "Tex" Rickard, (who also refereed the bout) sold exclusive film rights. The film was recorded by nine cameramen and is two hours long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=WVFhcBcv_X8C&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=johnson-jeffries+fight+film&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cjvelClAms&amp;sig=T1F1E-Er5NvEvBnh6st7K-tw3VU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgkIDRv5zKAhUGYg8KHeCrDqUQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=johnson-jeffries%20fight%20film&amp;f=false|title=History in the Media|page=192|website=Books.google.be|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Jack London]] was also present in the crowd, reporting the event.

Since Johnson was African-American and Jeffries was white the competition took on major racial overtones. The press dubbed Jeffries "The Great White Hope." Sports writers and white America were generally astounded when Johnson beat Jeffries soundly.&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_066938.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE JOHNSON-JEFFRIES FIGHT : 100 YEARS THENCE: THE JOHNSON-JEFFRIES FIGHT AND CENSORSHIP OF BLACK SUPREMACY |author=Barak Y. Orbach |website=Law.nyu.edu |accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused race riots &lt;ref name="nyu.edu"/&gt; in many places across the USA and provided the film with more public attention in the United States than any other film to date and for the next five years, until the release of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]] (1915)''.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA502|date=502|title=Encyclopedia of Early Cinema|isbn=9780415234405|author1=Abel|first1=Richard|page=502|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, 1910, only three days after the fight various states and cities in the USA declared they would not allow the screening of the footage.&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"/&gt; The picture was banned virtually everywhere in the South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=GWgaA-ExOC4C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=johnson-jeffries+fight+film&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EDVunWVthg&amp;sig=V_qgieZOJScSrer1vsFk6trqMC4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0kpbsxJzKAhWCthoKHdkRApA4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=johnson-jeffries%20fight%20film&amp;f=false|title=Controversial Cinema|page=98|website=Books.google.be|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=gDqsCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA807&amp;lpg=PA807&amp;dq=z+1969+banned+greece&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_5GT_oPmZG&amp;sig=xwiVXkgVx_cUmrBUMTjijZlEVV4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0mtuVq5zKAhWHtQ8KHVinA70Q6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=banned&amp;f=false|title=Censorship|page=807|website=Books.google.be|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the match former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for ''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in America. He cited the "crookedness" and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have "introduced a new method of money getting and of demoralization." The controversy surrounding the film directly&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt; motivated Congress to ban distribution of all prizefight films across state lines in 1912; the ban lasted for nearly three decades. It was finally lifted in 1940.

==Legacy==
In 2005, the film of the Jeffries-Johnson "Fight of the Century" was entered into the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being worthy of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2005.html|title=National Film Registry 2005: Films Selected to the National Film Registry  (National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress)|publisher=Loc.gov|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rodiad''''' is a [[pornographic]] poem on the subject of [[flagellation]] published by [[John Camden Hotten]] in 1871, although falsely dated to 1810.  It has been ascribed, apparently falsely, to [[George Colman the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Neglected powers: essays on nineteenth and twentieth century literature | first=George Wilson | last=Knight | publisher=Routledge | year=1971 | isbn=0-7100-6681-3 | page=129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A candidate for its authorship is [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gendering the nation: studies in modern Scottish literature | first=Christopher | last=Whyte | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | year=1995 | isbn=0-7486-0619-X | page=216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Erotic heaven | first=Andrew | last=Lycett | date=12 March 2001 | journal=[[New Statesman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson10&gt;Nelson (2000) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  Henderson places it in ''[[The Library Illustrative of Social Progress]]'' published  around 1872 (falsely dated 1777)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Romanticism and the painful pleasures of modern life | volume=75 | series=Cambridge studies in Romanticism | first=Andrea K. | last=Henderson | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-521-88402-0 | page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not in the list of [[Henry Spencer Ashbee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Index Librorum Prohibitorum:  being Notes Bio- Biblio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books | place=London | publisher=privately printed | year=1877 | first=Henry Spencer | last=Ashbee | authorlink=Pisanus Fraxi | page=241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vampire Hunter D: American Wasteland''''' is a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] based on the popular [[Vampire Hunter D]] franchise, set to be published by [[Devil's Due Publishing]].

==Story==
The plot of ''American Wasteland'' was for the first time to see the titular Vampire Hunter D arrive on the shores of [[United States|America]], a land where the vampiric Nobility persists, uninterrupted by those who seek to destroy them. There, D would have embarked on a journey inland while bringing their menace to an end.

'''Willie Lumpkin''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is best known as the [[Mail carrier|mailman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] in their self-titled comic book.&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 42–48 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

===Newspaper comic strip===
[[File:Lumpkin.gif|thumb|Willie Lumpkin in the 1959-61 comic strip. Art by [[Dan DeCarlo]].]]
The character was originally created for a [[print syndication|syndicated]] daily comic strip by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Dan DeCarlo]]. Lee recalled in a 1998 interview that,
{{quote|[[Mel Lazarus]] had done a strip called ''[[Miss Peach]]'', which used not panels but one long panel instead. I liked that idea very much, so when Harold Anderson, the head of [[Publishers Syndicate]], asked me to do a strip, I came up with ''Barney's Beat'', which was about a New York City cop and all the characters on his patrol who he'd meet every day and there would be a gag. I did some samples with Dan DeCarlo, and I thought it was wonderful. Harold said it was too "big city-ish" and they're not going to care for it in the small towns because they don't have cops on a beat out there. He wanted something that would appeal to the hinterland, something bucolic. He said, "You know what I want, Stan? I want a mailman! A friendly little mailman in a small town." I don't remember if I came up with the name Lumpkin or he did, but I hated it. I think I came up with the name as a joke and he said, "Yeah, that's it! Good idea!"&lt;ref name=comicbookartist&gt;{{cite news |  title=Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas | url = http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html | work = [[Comic Book Artist]] | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1998 |accessdate= 2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Willie Lumpkin'' drew humor from the people and situations Willie would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of Glenville. The daily strip ran from December 1959 to May 6, 1961. A Sunday strip ran through May 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ger |last=Apeldoorn | publisher = The Fabuleous Fifties|title=Late Mail|url=http://allthingsger.blogspot.nl/2013/11/late-mail.html | date= November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Comics===
Lee and artist [[Jack Kirby]] then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #11 (Feb. 1963).  The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book placed in [[Nebraska]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their [[Baxter Building]] headquarters in New York City.  He half-jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the "power" to wiggle his [[ear]]s.

Lumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #18 (May 1989). In this parody of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis [[J. Jonah Jameson]] but couldn't find his address. The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding he hates Christmas.

==Fictional character biography==
In Marvel Comics, Willie Lumpkin serves as the postal worker mailman whose Manhattan route includes the joint home and office of the superhero group the [[Fantastic Four]]. On occasion he falls into the danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes. Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the [[Super-Skrull]],{{issue|date=March 2013}} or when he helped to save the team from the [[Mad Thinker]]. This incident involved Reed's trust in Lumpkin; he had hired the mailman to manipulate the machinery as part of a safety routine.&lt;ref&gt;"Fantastic Four" Vol 1. #15 (June 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Later Lumpkin is mind-controlled into accessing [[Doctor Doom]]'s time machine by a minion of [[Immortus]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}  An alien [[Skrull]] also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He also briefly dated [[Peter Parker]]'s [[Aunt May]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/49115/#263953 ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #343 (Jan. 1991)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; When May briefly appeared to have died, Lumpkin grieved and was seen to befriend a new companion named Doreen Greenwald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/18329/ ''Spider-Man Holiday Special, 1995'' (1995)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;
