The '''2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final''' was the last [[Gaelic football|football]] match of the 2010 [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], played between [[Louth GAA|Louth]] and [[Meath GAA|Meath]] on 11 July 2010 in [[Croke Park]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0707/1224274220413.html|title=GAA – weekly fixtures|date=7 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louth were appearing in their first Leinster Senior Football Championship Final in 50 years. The game is memorable for its controversial ending.

Meath won by 1–12 to 1–10, thanks to a controversial late goal by [[Joe Sheridan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Sheridan]]. The goal was deemed illegal by television replays but was declared valid by referee Martin Sludden, from [[County Tyrone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/8808677.stm|title=Referee Martin Sludden struck after Leinster decider|date=11 July 2010|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then blew the final whistle. Irate Louth fans stormed the [[Association football pitch|pitch]] and commenced a process of chasing and physically assaulting the referee, who had to be led away by a [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] escort in scenes broadcast to a live television audience. Other scenes of violence saw bottles being hurled from a stand, one striking a steward who fell to the ground. The situation led to much media debate in the week that followed, the violence was condemned by senior politicians (some of whom were in the stadium), and there were calls for the game to be replayed—though, ultimately, this did not happen.

Seán Moran of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' said the next day: "What will be most vividly remembered of the 2010 final was compressed into a minute at the very end of the match with Louth getting ready to celebrate a deserved win – first over their neighbours in 35 years – and a resilient display".&lt;ref name="Controversy abounds as Meath claim title in hectic final minutes"&gt;{{cite news|author=Moran, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0712/1224274518802.html|title=Controversy abounds as Meath claim title in hectic final minutes|date=12 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colm Keys of the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' said it was "hard to disagree" that it was "the greatest injustice for many a year in Croke Park",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keys, Colm|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/sheridans-cruel-twist-denies-louth-2254831.html|title=Sheridan's cruel twist denies Louth|date=12 July 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked: "The 320th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Boyne]] is being commemorated today, but that surely didn't throw up a talking point to match a Joe Sheridan goal that will have the counties divided by [[River Boyne|the same river]] at odds for years to come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keys, Colm|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/fitzpatrick-slams-disgraceful-decision-2254830.html|title=Fitzpatrick slams 'disgraceful decision'|date=12 July 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of rivalry==
Louth and Meath were rivals of old, both winning the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] in the 1950s; however, this was to be Louth's first appearance in the Leinster Senior Football Championship Final since a 1960 to [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]].&lt;ref name="Meath will look to win midfield battle"&gt;{{cite news|author=Moran, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0710/1224274420582.html|title=Meath will look to win midfield battle|date=10 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"/&gt; According to [[Colm O'Rourke]], "there was a time in the late 1940s and '50s when Meath and Louth were the two best teams in the province [of Leinster] and played some memorable championship games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Rourke, Colm|author-link=Colm O'Rourke|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/colm-orourke/colm-orourke-great-rivals-of-the-dim-and-distant-past-are-reunitedbut-louths-fairytale-day-wont-have-a-happy-ending-2254156.html|title=Great rivals of the dim and distant past are reunitedbut Louth's fairytale day won't have a happy ending|date=11 July 2010|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Duggan of ''The Irish Times'' reported that the two teams "fight like alley cats".&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"&gt;{{cite news|author=Duggan, Keith|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0710/1224274420598.html|title=Border dispute with wee bit of history|date=10 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had last met four years previously in a preliminary round of the Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath emerging victorious.&lt;ref name="Meath will look to win midfield battle"/&gt; Louth had last defeated Meath in 1975, also at Croke Park.&lt;ref name="Meath will look to win midfield battle"/&gt; Three matches were required to produce a winner when the two encountered each other in July 1949.&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"/&gt; Other meetings include a draw in a semi-final of the 1951 Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath narrowly winning the replay.&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"/&gt; Meath also defeated Louth in the 1952 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final.&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"/&gt; Following on from Louth's aforementioned 1975 victory, there were other Meath wins in 1998, 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref name="Border dispute with wee bit of history"/&gt;

==Route to the final==
'''Preliminary Round:''' Louth 1–11 [[Longford GAA|Longford]] 1–7; Meath 1–20 Offaly 2–7&lt;br /&gt;
'''Quarter-finals:''' Louth 1–22 [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] 1–16; Meath 2–14 [[Laois GAA|Laois]] 0–10&lt;br /&gt;
'''Semi-finals:''' Louth 1–15 [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]] 2–10; Meath 5–9 [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] 0–13

==Pre-match==

===Team selection===
On 9 July, both teams announced their teams for the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Riordan, Ian|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0709/1224274348043.html|title=Kenny resumes his position in central role|date=9 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=9 July 2010|quote=Both Meath and Louth will today release their starting line-ups for Sunday's Leinster football final in Croke Park – and while Louth are likely to be unchanged from their semi-final win over Westmeath, Meath are expected to start Nigel Crawford at midfield, the only likely switch from the team which ripped Dublin apart in their semi-final.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meath announced their team first, with captain [[Nigel Crawford]], returning after injury, replacing [[Mark Ward (Meath GAA footballer born 1985)|Mark Ward]] in midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0709/1224274378545.html|title=Crawford to start against Louth|date=9 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=9 July 2010|quote=Nigel Crawford comes into the Meath midfield for Sunday's Leinster final against Louth. Crawford, who has fully recovered from a back injury, will start alongside Brian Meade in the Meath engine room with Mark Ward making way. Louth manager Peter Fitzpatrick will announce his team later today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance===
It was anticipated beforehand that attendance would be at its lowest of the decade, estimated at 45,000 or 50,000 by Ian O'Riordan of ''The Irish Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Riordan, Ian|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0709/1224274348000.html|title=Lowest crowd in decade due for final|date=9 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48,875 people attended the game.&lt;ref name="Controversy abounds as Meath claim title in hectic final minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAME AT A GLANCE"/&gt; The issue of applying fencing around Croke Park to prevent pitch invasions had been discussed prior to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Moran, Seán|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0706/1224274102516.html|title=McKenna reiterates warning on fencing|date=6 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=6 July 2010|quote=Last Sunday, saw Kilkenny retain their provincial title against Galway without problems but a county winning a sixth successive provincial title is unlike to spark the same reaction as next weekend when Meath, for the first time in nine years, or Louth, for the first time in 50, will raise the Leinster football trophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violent scenes which followed the 2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final renewed this debate in the days afterwards,&lt;ref name="Referee admits error in awarding Meath goal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Riordan, Ian|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0713/1224274590265.html|title=GAA say fencing would be last resort|date=13 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though President Cooney later said "the last thing we want to do is put fencing up around Croke Park".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0720/cooneyc.html |title=Cooney confirms pitch presentations |date=20 July 2010 |work=[[RTÉ Sport]] |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |accessdate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722063726/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0720/cooneyc.html |archivedate=22 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0720/1224275100231.html|title=GAA plans for on-pitch presentations|date=20 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match==

===Summary===
Louth's [[JP Rooney]] and [[Shane Lennon]] both missed opportunities in the first half.&lt;ref name="Rough justice for heartbroken Louth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0711/1224274490689.html|title=Rough justice for heartbroken Louth|date=11 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louth dominated the second half, though spurned numerous opportunities to take a commanding lead over Meath.&lt;ref name="Rough justice for heartbroken Louth"/&gt; Rooney scored a goal with seven minutes of the game left.&lt;ref name="Rough justice for heartbroken Louth"/&gt; Meath converted two long-range free kicks from [[Cian Ward]], but Louth still led by one point in the final minute.&lt;ref name="Rough justice for heartbroken Louth"/&gt; Louth's [[Colm Judge]] was sent off in the 69th minute for a second bookable offence.&lt;ref name="Controversy abounds as Meath claim title in hectic final minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAME AT A GLANCE"/&gt; Then came the controversial goal by [[Joe Sheridan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Sheridan]] in the third minute of stoppage time.&lt;ref name="Controversy abounds as Meath claim title in hectic final minutes"/&gt; The ball was kicked into the square by Graham Reilly. It came out to [[Seamus Kenny (footballer)|Seamus Kenny]], who could have gone for the point, but saw a goal chance and shot.

===Joe Sheridan===
Joe Sheridan, who scored the controversial goal, described how he had done it: "It was well-worked and it was a definite goal. People are saying I threw it in, but I was heading for the line and I just dropped the ball and it was in the net. I got it and the lad just pushed me into the net. I tried to do whatever I could to hit it and the goal was given, simple as that. I was pushed in over the line so it should have been a penalty anyway. I think it was a perfect goal".&lt;ref name="Little sympathy in Meath camp"/&gt;

===Match officials===
Referee Martin Sludden later admitted he had made an error.&lt;ref name="Referee admits error in awarding Meath goal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10 Key questions after Sunday's chaotic scenes at Croker"/&gt; His referee's report acknowledged a "terrible mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0715/1224274738230.html|title=Louth move on but sense of injustice persists|date=15 July 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=15 July 2010|quote=In the light of this and the clear admission in the referee's report that he "made a terrible mistake", the referee's report therefore is questionable.

===Team managers===
Louth manager Peter Fitzpatrick said he was "absolutely devastated" on RTÉ.&lt;ref name="Meath county board asks for more time"/&gt; Appearing later on radio station [[LMFM]], he described the referee as "[[Dick Turpin]] without a mask", adding "It was pure daylight robbery. I'm very, very annoyed".&lt;ref name="Little sympathy in Meath camp"/&gt;

When questioned at a press conference about Sheridan's goal, Meath manager Eamon O'Brien said: "I can't say and I'm not commenting. I can comment, as I said to RTÉ, that loads of decisions were made during the game that didn't go our way. I can recall three or four balls that were blown for picking off the ground that I didn’t think were off the ground. Nigel Crawford was booked up here and Louth got a point off it. The game goes for 70 minutes, decisions are made and you live with it. That’s it, that’s the way I see it".&lt;ref name="Little sympathy in Meath camp"/&gt;

===Other players===
Meath's captain Nigel Crawford gave his opinion on the incident: "I'm sure most players have been involved in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, but I just don't think it's possible or I just don't think it can happen. If you start that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right at the end of a game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".&lt;ref name="Little sympathy in Meath camp"/&gt;

Louth player J. P. Rooney said: "Aaron Hoey was pleading with [Sludden] to consult with his umpires but when he went in, he told them to put up the green flag. [...] I know it's wrong, people running at the ref, but you can see why Louth people did it. He brought it on himself and I wouldn't feel sorry for him".&lt;ref name="Who said what . . ."/&gt;

On ''[[The Sunday Game]]'' TV highlights programme, [[Pat Spillane]] called both the fans and the referee "disgraceful", commenting: {{cquote|Those were disgraceful scenes at the end. Cowardly individuals attacking a referee who is doing it in a voluntary capacity. There is no place in the GAA for people like that. Scandalous scenes and a bad day for the GAA on that account. A fella doing a job made a human error. He made a mistake. We cannot condone those scenes, they are disgraceful and punishments must be handed out.

=== Crisis ===
On 9 April 2003, Al-Shaab stadium was largely damaged after it got bombed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)]]. Most of its seats were destroyed and many large holes were made inside the pitch. Until 2004, the stadium was used as an airstrip for the U.S. Air Force.&lt;ref name="Stadium didn't survive the invasion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium didn't survive the invasion|url=http://www.kademalsahir.com/vb/showthread.php?t=14355|website=KademalSahir|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefor, in April 2004, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] Chief Administrator, [[Paul Bremer]], announced that $3 million would be given to renovate Al-Shaab Stadium and to make it in a good condition for hosting different sports.&lt;ref name="Renovation 2004-2005 $3 mil - Paul Bremer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Kent|title=Iraqi athletes have Olympic dreams|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/iraqi-athletes-have-olympic-dreams-1.18451|agency=Stars and Stripes|date=5 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was officially reopened after 2003, on 12 June 2005, being ready to host some of the [[2005-06 Iraqi Premier League]] matches.&lt;ref name="Reopening Al-Shaab Stadium - 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reopening Al-Shaab Stadium|url=http://www.ankawa.com/forum/index.php?topic=850.0|website=Ankawa|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraq national football team]] couldn't play in Al-Shaab stadium from 2005 to 2009 because of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi Civil War]]. Iraq's first match in the stadium, after six years of playing the home matches in other countries, was on 13 July 2009, where Iraq met [[Palestine national football team|Palestine]] in an [[International friendly]] and won 4-0.&lt;ref name="The New York Times - vs. Palestine in 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myers|first1=Steven Lee|title=Iraqis Cheer for a Team That Again Is at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/world/middleeast/14soccer.html?_r=1&amp;|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2015, the administrative company that is responsible of renovating Al-Shaab stadium announced that on 15 August, the renovation continued after it was paused from June to August; because of the [[2014–15 Iraqi Premier League|Iraqi Premier League]].&lt;ref name="August 2015 Renovation announcing - Hamrin News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Renovation of Al-Shaab stadium starts in mid-August|url=http://hamrinnews.net/s/42632.html|agency=Hamrin News|date=August 5, 2015|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; They included replacing the sprinkling system and replacing the pitch, depending on the basis of high-quality international stadiums.&lt;ref name="August 2015 Renovation inclusions - Hamrin News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Removal of Al-Shaab stadium's pitch in mid-August|url=http://hamrinnews.net/n/42582.html|agency=Hamrin News|date=August 7, 2015|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7974">The '''Anteater Recreation Center''' ('''ARC''') is an {{convert|89000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} indoor gym facility that is part of campus recreation at the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI); the anteater is the mascot of the [[UC Irvine Anteaters|UC Irvine athletics team]] (see [[University of California, Irvine#Athletics]] for the mascot's origin and history). It is open to all UCI students, faculty and staff members, alumni, and other university affiliates, including spouses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campusrec.uci.edu/membership/index.asp UCI ARC Memberships]&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was designed by Langdon Wilson Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Giasone, [http://www.ocregister.com/articles/center-123368-students-student.html "Students to get new rec center"], ''[[Orange County Register]]'', July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/4913/article-1G1-81109701/university-california-irvine-anteater-recreation-center "University of California -- Irvine, Anteater Recreation Center. (Post-Secondary Outstanding Buildings)."] ''American School &amp; University'', November 1, 2001 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   It opened in January 2000, replacing older, cramped recreational facilities at the school's older gym, Crawford Hall.  Built at a cost of $26 million, it was funded by a student referendum approved in May 1996, when UCI students voted to pay an additional $88 per quarter to fund the center and other athletic and recreational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Gottlieb, [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/24/local/me-57046 "Academic Exercise"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul McLeod, [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/26/sports/sp-27042 "Irvine's Anteater Stadium Getting Ready for Bright New Look"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 26, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The positive reception for the new center led students at other [[University of California]] campuses (such as [[UCLA]]) to push for similar improvements in their recreational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Newman, [http://dailybruin.com/2002/07/21/students-declare-wooden-center/ "Students declare Wooden Center unfit"], ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', July 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7104">In baseball, a '''[[Captain (sports)|captain]]''' is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by [[Manager (baseball)|managers]] and [[Coach (baseball)|coaches]], such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dickson | first=Paul | title=The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary | publisher=Mariner Books | year=1999 | page=101 | isbn=0-15-600580-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=ASEP | title=Coaching Baseball: Technical and Tactical Skills | publisher=Human Kinetics | year=2005 | page=240 | isbn=0-7360-4703-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Baseball]]'s official rules only briefly mention the position of team captain.  Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment) which discusses the submission of a team's lineup to the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Official Baseball Rules | date=1949–2010 | publisher=Major League Baseball | page=32 | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Major League Baseball, only a handful of teams have designated a player as captain in recent years, and there are no current team captains. [[Jerry Remy]], who was named as captain of the [[California Angels]] in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, "there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team.  I think there are guys who lead by example.  You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Remy | first=Jerry |author2=Corey Sandler | title=Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game Within the Game | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2006 | page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not wear an [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-style "C" on their jersey. Retired first baseman [[Mike Sweeney]], former captain of the [[Kansas City Royals]] from 2003 to 2007, wore the "C" patch, as did two other recently retired captains: [[John Franco]] of the Mets, and [[Jason Varitek]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball.  For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as "coachers" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as "captain's lines." If the umpire made a decision that could "be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal", the "captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal."  The rules state that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules do not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chadwick | first=Henry | title=Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide: 1898 | publisher=American Sports Publishing Company | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIdLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;f=false  | pages=169–171, 175, 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains.  They held the title of "manager-captain."&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1902 the newspapers refer to "Captain-Manager [[John McGraw]] and [[Joe Kelley]]"; see {{cite news | title=M'Graw at Polo Grounds: Six of the New York Baseball Team Are Released | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 18, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/07/18/117979853.pdf }} and {{cite news | title=Yesterday's Baseball Games: New York and Cincinnati Teams Each Win a Game at the Polo Grounds—Brooklyn Won | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 14, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/08/14/101962901.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902 [[Jack Doyle (baseball)|Jack Doyle]] was signed as captain and first baseman of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] while non-player [[Horace Fogel]] was manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Doyle Signed by New York: Famous Baseball Player to Captain the Team and Play First Base—Pleased with the Club's Outlook | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 27, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/02/27/101939155.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the role of a captain has been significant in the histories of teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], the [[Boston Red Sox]], and the [[San Francisco Giants]], other teams, such as the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], have, as of 2016, never had a captain.

'''Carroll Field''' was owned by [[Baylor University]]; the [[Baylor Bears football]] program played games there from 1906 to 1925, and from 1930 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baylorbears.com/facilities/casey.html |title=Floyd Casey Stadium |publisher=Baylor Athletics (Baylor University) |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the construction of the Carroll Science Building in 1902, the field was located between the building and Waco Creek; the field took over as the location of football games from an unnamed field adjacent to and northwest of Old Main.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contentdm.baylor.edu/u?/07texas,2909 |title=The Baylor University Annual Published by the Senior Class of Ninety-Six at Waco, Texas |work=''The Texas Collection'' (Baylor University) |date=1996 |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Carroll made a donation for the field to be constructed, and his father and grandfather had also donated to build the Carroll Science Building and Carroll Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.baylor.edu/giving/news.php?action=story&amp;story=133449|title=Farewell to Floyd Casey|work=Giving to Baylor {{!}} Baylor University|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926 to 1929, Baylor football games were played at the [[Cotton Palace]] in Waco.

}}
A '''Closed Game''' (or '''Double Queen's Pawn Opening''') is a [[chess opening]] that begins with the moves:
:1. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4|d4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5|d5]]
The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with the [[King's Pawn Game|King Pawn openings]] where the e4 pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4 pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the [[King's Gambit]] is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the [[Queen's Gambit]] remains popular at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, [[transposition (chess)|transpositions]] between variations are more common and important in the closed games.

| White's formation in the Colle system
}}
The [[Richter-Veresov Attack]], [[Colle System]], [[Stonewall Attack]], [[Torre Attack]], [[London System]], and [[Blackmar-Diemer Gambit]] are classified as [[Queen's Pawn Game]]s because White plays d4 but not c4. The Richter-Veresov is rarely played at the top levels of chess. The Colle and Stonewall are both ''Systems'', rather than specific opening variations.
White develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend.
Both these systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn,
but are rarely used by professionals because a well prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily.
The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is an attempt by White to open lines and obtain attacking chances.
Most professionals consider it too risky for serious games, but it is popular with amateurs and in [[blitz chess]].

|Queen's Gambit after 2.c4
}}
The most important closed openings are in the [[Queen's Gambit]] family (White plays 2.c4).
The Queen's Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired.
In the [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]], Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4.
White will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack.
Black has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the [[Slav Defense|Slav]] (2...c6) and the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] (2...e6).
Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well.
Among the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit Declined are the [[Queen's Gambit Declined, Mainline Orthodox Defense|Orthodox Defense]], [[Lasker Defense]], the [[Cambridge Springs Defense]], the [[Tartakower Variation]], and the [[Tarrasch Defense|Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses]].

|Albin countergambit after 2...e5
}}
Black replies to the Queen's Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.
The [[Chigorin Defense]] (2...Nc6) is playable but rare.
The [[Symmetrical Defense]] (2...c5) is the most direct challenge to [[Queen's Gambit]] theory &amp;mdash;
Can Black equalize by simply copying White's moves?
Most opening theoreticians believe not, and consequently the Symmetrical Defense is not popular.
The [[Baltic Defense]] (2...Bf5) takes the most direct solution to solving the problem of Black's queen bishop by developing it on the second move.
Although it is not trusted by most elite players, it has not been refuted and some very strong grandmasters have played it.
The [[Albin Countergambit]] (2...e5) is generally considered too risky for top-level tournament play. Similarly, the [[Marshall Defense]] (2...Nf6) is very rarely seen in grandmaster play, as most theoreticians consider it definitely inferior for Black.

The '''Columbia Country Club''', located in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]], [[Maryland]], is the successor of the Columbia Golf Club, which was organized on September 29, 1898&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite book | last = Shapiro | first = Len | title = The Great Book of Washington DC Sports Lists | publisher = Running Press | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0786741708 | page=257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by nine men. Originally there were twenty members. The golf course, which opened in 1911, was designed by [[Herbert Barker (golfer)|Herbert Barker]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbert Barker design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Club History|url=http://www.columbiacc.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=397118&amp;ssid=319837&amp;vnf=1|website=ColumbiaCC.org|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first location of the Club was on the east side of Brightwood Avenue, afterwards known as Georgia Avenue, in the neighborhood of Schuetzen Park.  It stands as one of the oldest and most prestigious country clubs in the [[United States]].  Through its history, the club has counted among its members two Five Star Generals, [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Hap Arnold]], along with countless politicians, most notably [[Barack Obama]], journalists, CEOs and lobbyists.

==History==
The present site on Connecticut Avenue was purchased in 1909 from the Chevy Chase Land Company. The certificate of incorporation is dated August 25, 1909. The design of Frederick B. Pyle for the club house was selected from among four submitted. The golf course, completed in 1911, was designed by [[Herbert Barker (golfer)|Herbert Barker]], a noted golfer and course architect of the day.&lt;ref name="Herbert Barker design" /&gt; [[Walter Travis]] made extensive renovations to the course in 1915.&lt;ref name=Homsey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Homsey|first1=Dave|title=The Walter J. Travis Society: 5th hole at Columbia Country Club / Chevy Chase, MD|url=http://travissociety.com/who-was-travis/golf-course-architect/travis-bunkers/columbia_5th/|website=TravisSociety.com|date=21 August 2011|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no newspaper record of the event, the opening of the new Club occurred on January 6, 1911. Early Club minutes were lost. The course was one of the favorite courses of President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] was held at the Club in 1921, won by Englishman, [[Jim Barnes]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; President [[Warren Harding]] presented the Champion's Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sommers | first = Robert | title = Golf anecdotes : from the links of Scotland to Tiger Woods | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0195172655 | page =111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exception of the eighth hole, there have been changes (for the better) on all holes of the course. Several acres were added to the original {{convert|126|acre|ha}} in the 1930s.  Other improvements, such as new tee boxes and a better irrigation system, were added in the early part of 2012.

The first swimming pool (donated by Donald Woodward) opened in 1925. The Olympic-sized pool was built much later and the entire area was totally renovated in 1978. A profusion of tennis courts have existed from the beginning of the Club. Platform tennis courts were added in the 1960s. Major changes have been made on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes of the golf course, made possible by the construction of a water line through the area by the WSSC under its power of eminent domain. In addition, 2009 saw the completion of a major renovation and addition of the club house, adding an indoor swimming facility, upgraded fitness center, new bowling alley (duckpin), locker rooms, ice skating rink (winter only) and additional parking among other things. Throughout its rich history, only three head golf professionals ever worked at the club, [[Fred McLeod]], William Strasbaugh, and Robert Dolan (its current head PGA Professional).

Columbia has a history of counting some of the best amateur golfers in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan area among its membership.  Martin R. West III, a multiple club champion at Columbia, made the cut in 1973 the [[Masters Tournament]] and 1976 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]; he has competed in 19 United States Amateurs, is a former US [[Walker Cup]] team member, and has won numerous area tournaments including nine Maryland Amateurs.  The annual club championship, contested in early September, is one of the most prestigious in the DC area.  Columbia's MSGA A team has been very successful, winning the competition multiple times (most recently 2017).

[[Christine Blasey Ford]] testified to the US Senate on September 27, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/us/politics/kavanaugh-hearings-dr-ford.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage|title=Kavanaugh Testimony Updates: ‘You Have Replaced Advice and Consent With Search and Destroy’|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that she was likely at the club prior to attending the social gathering at which she was allegedly sexually assaulted by [[Judge Brett Kavanaugh]].

==The course==

The Columbia course favors shotmaking and finesse over the ability to drive the ball long distances.  The natural topography of the area means that Columbia's course is very hilly, with tight fairways and small, undulating greens that are almost universally sloped back to front.  Course superintendents generally keep the Columbia greens at a very high speed, and rarely do they roll anything less than an 11 on the [[Stimpmeter|Stimp meter]].

A common saying among members and caddies is that "there are only two flat lies at Columbia, on the tee and in your pocket".  Because of the layout, driving the ball long distances can often get a player into trouble due to deep rough, side-hill lies, pot bunkers, and the aforementioned tight fairways.  Almost every approach shot on the golf course plays significantly either uphill or downhill, including severe downhill plays on #2, #5, #12, #14, #15, and #16.  Hole #17 at Columbia is a truly unique hole, with only a 200-yard tee shot required to a short but wide section of fairway.  From there, the player must chip straight uphill only 70 yards to a green sloped from front to back.

The [[signature hole]], however, remains the par 3 16th, which, legend has it, served as [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]'s inspiration for the 12th hole at [[Augusta National Golf Club]].  From one of three tee boxes, the hole plays to a very long, narrow green with three distinct levels that is guarded completely along the front by a large pond.  Complicating matters are two pot bunkers, one in front of the green and one behind.  The hole has been consistently rated among the best in the area, and was ranked by ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine locally.

Overall, the par 70 (35-35) course measures {{convert|6900|yd}} in length, with a course rating of 72.3 and slope rating of 139.

During the early stages of its construction, Fayetteville’s Crown Coliseum was mentioned as a possible temporary home for the [[National Hockey League|NHL’s]] [[Carolina Hurricanes]], but this was blocked by minor-league hockey executive [[Bill Coffey]] who had signed an exclusive lease agreement with the arena for the [[Fayetteville Force]] of the [[Central Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|page=103|isbn=1-894974-21-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in mid January that [[TNA Wrestling]] would be taping its weekly [[TNA iMPACT!]] broadcast in the arena on February 24, 2011—which would be only the second time in its history that the show would be broadcast outside Universal Studio's iMPACT! zone in Orlando, Florida. [[WWE]] taped its annual [[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]] show at the venue on December 11, 2011.

Fayetteville native, rapper [[J.

[[File:Fellows Park - Geograph-2008825.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fellows Park in 1982]]
'''Fellows Park''' was a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Walsall]], [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Walsall F.C.]] from 1896 until 1990, when the team moved to the [[Bescot Stadium]].

Fellows Park was situated about a quarter of a mile away from the club's present ground, The Bescot Stadium, at the junction of Hilary Street and Wallows Lane.

The club moved to the ground from [[West Bromwich Road]] in 1896. Until 1930 it was named '''Hilary Street''', at which point it was renamed after H.L. Fellows, a club director. Walsall's record home attendance was at Fellows Park, when 25,453 spectators were present for the team's Second Division match against [[Newcastle United]] on 29 August 1961.&lt;ref name=FGG&gt;{{cite web

|title=Fellows Park Walsall Football Club
|work=Football Ground Guide
|access-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1988, the club was planning to build a new stadium at nearby Bescot Crescent.&lt;ref name=Twohundredpercent&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://twohundredpercent.net/those-we-have-lost-fellows-park-walsall-fc/

|publisher=Twohundredpercent 
|access-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years, construction work was underway at the new stadium site and the last league game at Fellows Park was played on 1 May 1990, when Walsall, in the process of their second successive relegation which took them into the [[Football League Fourth Division]], drew 1–1 at home to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], with [[Andy Dornan]] scoring the last league goal at the ground – his only goal in his time at Walsall.&lt;ref name=ExpressAndStar&gt;{{cite web

|access-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final game played at the ground was on 11 May 1990, when retiring defender [[Peter Hart (footballer)|Peter Hart's]] testimonial was held there with local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] providing the opposition. This game also ended in a 1–1 draw, with [[Gary Shaw]] scoring an equaliser for Walsall in the 37th minute, thus going down in history as the last player to score at the stadium, in its 94-year history.&lt;ref name=ExpressAndStar/&gt;  The new [[Bescot Stadium]] was ready for the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91 season]].&lt;ref name=ExpressAndStar2&gt;{{cite web

The '''Football Foundation''' is the [[United Kingdom]]’s largest sports charity, channelling funding from the [[Premier League]], [[The FA]] and the Government (via [[Sport England]]) into transforming the landscape of grassroots sport in England. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/rotherfield-united/111105/football-club-plans-to-grow-in-time-for-50th-year.html |title=Football club plans to grow in time for 50th year |date=2017-06-12 |publisher=[[Henley Standard]] |access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Launched in 2000, the Football Foundation awards grants to grassroots clubs and organisations to help build and refurbish new and existing community sports facilities, such as changing pavilions, natural grass pitches or all-weather playing surfaces, for schools, and local authority facilities or sports clubs.

Since 2000, the Foundation has awarded 17,000 grants worth more than £615m towards improving grassroots sport, which it has used to attract additional partnership funding of over £817m – over £1.4bn of investment into the grassroots game. The Foundation’s grassroots facilities investment has helped to develop:

- 1,006 changing facilities

- 2,921 real grass pitches

- 702 artificial grass pitches

- 101 multi-use games areas.

The Foundation also delivers large-scale sport CSR programmes, including the Mayor of London: Sport Facilities Fund, on behalf of Mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as the multi-award winning Barclays Spaces for Sports programme that has created 200 new or refurbished community sports sites across England. 

Moreover, the Foundation is the delivery partner for a number of Premier League and FA community schemes, including the Premier League Kit and Equipment scheme, and The FA’s Grow the Game and Respect schemes.

'''FoxSports.com''' is a [[sports news]] website operated by the [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] division of [[Fox Entertainment Group]]. The website primarily features streaming video content surrounding sports-related topics, including segments and features from the division's studio programming.

== History ==

In May 2004, Fox Sports entered into an agreement with [[Microsoft]] for FoxSports.com to become the official sports portal of [[MSN.com]], replacing [[ESPN.com]]; the deal included joint advertising sales and revenue sharing, and integration of FoxSports.com into MSN.com and its associated services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/game-on-for-msn-foxsports-site/|title=Game on for MSN, FoxSports site|work=CNET|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership was dissolved in 2014.&lt;ref name="aa-horowitz"/&gt;

In 2016, Fox Sports executive Jamie Horowitz took over the operations of the division's digital properties. Horowitz (who had led the [[Fox Sports 1]] cable channel's shift to opinion-based studio programming rather than general sports news coverage) began to institute new editorial practices at FoxSports.com, proposing that the website's written content be used to promote Fox Sports pundits and their television programs, including Fox Sports 1 hosts [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Skip Bayless]], rather than original reports.&lt;ref name="aa-horowitz"/&gt; During the lead-up to [[Super Bowl LI]], the website piloted an aspect of this content strategy by having articles [[ghostwriting|ghostwritten]] under the names of FS1 pundits.&lt;ref name="aa-horowitz"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/fox/jamie-horowitz-fox-sports-digital.html|title=Frustration, uncertainty, dread and layoffs: An inside look at Jamie Horowitz's takeover of Fox Sports Digital|date=2017-06-27|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2017, Fox Sports redesigned its website to focus primarily on streaming video content only, rather than written articles. At the same time, Fox Sports laid off 20 writers so these positions could be filled by video-focused roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/fox-sports-cuts-web-writing-staff-to-invest-more-in-online-video|title=Fox Sports Cuts Web Writing Staff to Invest More in Online Video|date=2017-06-26|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/fox-sports-job-cuts-writing-video-katie-nolan-20170626.html|title=Latest Fox Sports shake-up eliminates writing jobs|work=Philly.com|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video content draws largely from FS1 studio programs.&lt;ref name="aa-horowitz"/&gt; On July 3, 2017, Horowitz was fired from Fox Sports over allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="thr-horowitzfired"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamie Horowitz Fired at Fox Sports Amid Harassment Probe|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jamie-horowitz-exiting-fox-sports-1018505|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genius Sports''' is a sports data and technology company that provides data management and integrity services to major sports leagues and organizations.

The company was formed in 2016 following a merger between Betgenius, a technology and data supplier to the betting industry, and SportingPulse International, a sports data and software business, to form Genius Sports Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2016/04/19/is-major-league-baseball-ready-to-embrace-sports-betting/|title=Is Major League Baseball Ready To Embrace Sports Betting?|last=Heitner|first=Darren|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betgenius became a subsidiary of Genius Sports Group with its co-founder Mark Locke becoming the Group CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leadersinsport.com/news/leaders-40-awards-class-2017/|title=Leaders Under 40 Awards Class of 2017 Announced|website=Leaders|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sbcnews.co.uk/retail/2016/04/19/29889/|title=Genius Sports Officially Launches Following Merger|last1=Massey|first1=Luke|website=SBC News|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''KCOM Stadium''' (also known as the '''Hull City Stadium''' due to [[UEFA]] sponsorship regulations) is a multi-purpose facility in the city of [[Kingston upon Hull]], England.

==History==
[[File:KC Stadium.JPG|left|thumb|240px|The KCOM Stadium]]
The idea of a new stadium for [[Kingston upon Hull]], whose professional football club Hull City had played at [[Boothferry Park]] since 1946, was first mooted in 1997, but funds to finance such a project only became available when the [[Hull City Council|city council]] sold a portion of its holdings in [[Kingston Communications]].&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt; The council provided most of the funds, more than £42&amp;nbsp;million, with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund.&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt;

The council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project.&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt; He and his team partnered with consulting firm [[Drivers Jonas]] to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location, [[seating capacity]], and facilities offered. Stated Mr. Topliss: "We had a totally blank canvas and, working with consultants, made a thorough assessment of what was needed."&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt;

The project team considered over a dozen sites, inside and outside of the city, before settling on [[The Circle, Kingston upon Hull|The Circle]] in West Park.&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt; Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance, central government planning guidelines, existing athletic facilities, isolation from residential areas, and council ownership.&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt;

[[File:Kc under construction.jpg|thumb|right|The stadium under construction in 2002]]
The final recommendation of [[Drivers Jonas]] included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium, planned to seat from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt; Professional services firm [[Arup Group Limited|Arup Associates]] provided initial concept proposals for the stadium.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; The Miller Partnership, an architectural and interior design firm, adopted these proposals during the stadium's design.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;

In spite of obstacles during the course of the project, including [[Hull City A.F.C.]]'s receivership in 2001 (just after the granting of planning permission),&lt;ref name="hull_in_print"/&gt; the stadium complex was completed on time (in fourteen months)&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; and on budget (at approximately [[pound sterling|GB£]]44&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; The stadium opened its doors on 18 December 2002. Hull City beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.]] 1–0 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] to mark the occasion.&lt;ref name="hfh"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Stadium SKA Rostov-on-Don.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|SKA SKVO stadium]] 
'''Stadion SKA SKVO ''' (Russian: Стадион СКА-СКВО) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Rostov-na-Donu]], [[Russia]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground for [[FC SKA Rostov-on-Don]].  The stadium is currently being refurbished and holds 11,000 people; when the reconstruction is complete capacity will be 25,000.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100821063908/http://www.ska-rostov.ru/club/stadium/]  the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) has approved thatSKA SKVO is in  a list of 36 training grounds for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] .

==History==
The construction of the sports complex was started in the mid-sixties on the initiative of the Commander of the Troops of the North Caucasus Military District, Colonel-General Altunin. The composition of the district sports complex included the main sports arena with stands for 33 000 seats, a football field, athletics core, a water sports complex with three bathrooms, sports grounds.

The main sports arena and the whole SKA SKVO sports complex were put into operation in April 1971. Designer of buildings and structures SKA was the organization "Voenproekt".

Since February 2007, the stadium is under reconstruction. The East and West stands (the lower tier, VIP-box) function in full function. Today SKA SKVO stadium is ready to receive 11 000 people. After the reconstruction of the South and North stands, the capacity of the stadium will be 25,000 people.

On January 28, 2016, the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) approved a list of 36 training grounds for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] , including the "SKA" stadium in this application. In this regard, it is necessary to reconstruct the stadium to bring it in line with the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;ФИФА утвердила 36 тренировочных площадок ЧМ-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kayak-Valdes-BC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A sea kayak on [[Valdes Island]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]]]
A '''sea kayak''' or '''touring kayak''' is a [[kayak]] developed for the sport of [[Watercraft paddling|paddling]] on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean. Sea kayaks are [[seaworthy]] small boats with a covered deck and the ability to incorporate a [[spray deck]]. They trade off the maneuverability of [[whitewater]] kayaks for higher cruising speed, cargo capacity, ease of straight-line paddling, and comfort for long journeys.

Sea kayaks are used around the world for marine (sea) journeys from a few hours to many weeks, as they can accommodate one to three paddlers together with room for camping gear, food, water, and other supplies. A sea kayak usually ranges anywhere from {{convert|10|–|18|ft|m|abbr=none|sp=us}} for solo craft, and up to {{convert|26|ft|m|abbr=none|sp=us}} for tandem craft. Width may be as little as {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}}, and may be up to {{convert|36|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

==Origins==
{{main|Kayak}}
[[File:Greenland kayak seal hunter 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Inuit]] seal hunter in a kayak, armed with a harpoon.]]
Contemporary sea kayaks trace their origin to the native boats of [[Alaska]], northern [[Canada]], and Southwest [[Greenland]]. [[Eskimo]] hunters developed a fast seagoing craft to hunt [[Earless seal|seals]] and [[walrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hutchinson | first = Derek. C. | title = The Complete Book of Sea Kayaking | publisher = A&amp;C Black | year = 1994  | pages = 177–181 |  isbn = 0-7136-6675-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Aleut people|Aleut]] name for a sea [[kayak]] is ''Iqyak'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://shamankayaks.com/shaman/taks/schedule_mike_livingston.asp Traditional Arctic Kayak Symposium (TAKS) San Simeon California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and earliest models were constructed from a light wooden frame (tied together with [[sinew]] or [[baleen]]) and covered with [[sea mammal]] ([[sea lion]] or [[Pinniped|seal]]) hides. Archaeologists have found evidence indicating that kayaks are at least 4000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2521235,00.html Made in Anglesey, paddled in the Arctic: the Inuits' plastic kayak rules the waves] ''TimesOnline'' December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames (such as the [[folding kayak|Klepper]]) dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were introduced. [[rotomolding|Rotomolded]] [[plastic]] kayaks first appeared in 1984.

==Design==
[[File:Recreational kayak.jpg|thumbnail|Kayaking in a double on Lake Union in Seattle, USA]]
Modern sea kayaks come in a wide array of materials, designs, and sizes to suit a variety of intended uses. In sea kayaking, where the designs continue along primarily traditional lines, the primary distinction is between ''rigid'' kayaks and ''[[Folding kayak|folding]]'' kayaks.  Folding kayaks are in some ways more traditional boats, being similar in design to ''[[Skin-on-frame kayak|skin-on-frame]]'' kayaks used by native people.  Modern folding kayaks use [[fraxinus|ash]] and [[birch]] or contemporary materials such as [[aluminum]] for the frame, and replace the [[sealskin]] covering with synthetic waterproof fabrics.  Unlike native kayaks, folding kayaks can be easily disassembled and packed for transport.  Many folding kayaks include inflatable [[sponsons]] that improve the [[secondary stability]] of the vessel, helping to prevent capsize.  More recently, a class of inflatable folding kayaks has emerged, combining a more limited rigid frame with a tightly inflated skin to produce greater rigidity than an inflatable boat alone.

In recent years, there has been an increase in production of sit on top kayaks suitable for sea use. This has resulted in a new market for paddlers looking for the versatility of a sit on top, with seaworthy performance. Sit on top kayaks are a common choice for sea kayakers who prefer the sit on top versatility, but do not want to sacrifice performance.

Most rigid sea kayaks also derive from the external designs of native vessels, especially those from Greenland, but the strength of modern materials such as [[fiberglass]], [[rotomolding|rotomolded plastic]] and [[carbon fiber]] eliminate the need for an internal frame, though significantly increasing weight. Modern ''[[Skin-on-frame kayak|skin-on-frame]]'' sea kayaks constructed with [[nylon]] skins represent an ultralight niche within the rigid sea kayak spectrum. Some recent design innovations include:
* [[Recreational kayak|Recreational]] kayaks—shorter kayaks with wide beams and large cockpits intended for sheltered waters
* Sit-on-top kayaks—boats without an enclosed cockpit, but with the basic hull shape of a kayak.

A different class of vessel emerged in the 1960s, the [[Surf ski]], a long, narrow boat with low inherent stability that is intended for use in surf and [[following waves]].

===Size===
Most production sea kayaks are between {{convert|12|and|24|ft|m|2}} in length, the larger kayaks often built for two (or in rare cases, three) paddlers. The width ([[Beam (nautical)|beam]]) of typical kayaks varies from {{convert|18|to|32|in|mm|0}}, though specialized boats such as [[surf skis]] may be narrower. The length of a kayak affects not only its cargo capacity (for both gear and paddlers) but may also affect its "tracking" ability—the ease with which the boat travels in a straight line. While other design features also impact tracking, very long kayaks are easier to paddle straight (and harder to turn). The width of a kayak affects the cargo capacity, the maximum size of the cockpit (and thus the size of the paddler in that cockpit), and (to a degree that depends on the design of the hull) the [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|stability]].

===Material===
[[File:Plywood Sea Kayak.jpg|thumbnail|A sea kayak constructed from plywood, epoxy and fibreglass]]Most rigid production kayaks are now made out of [[fiberglass]], [[rotomolding|rotomolded polyethylene]], thermoformed plastic, blow moulded polyethylene or [[carbon]]-[[kevlar]]. More exotic materials include [[carbon fiber]] and [[foam core]]. Some kayaks are hand-built from [[plywood]] or wood strips covered with [[fiberglass]]. Skin-on-frame kayaks are built on wood or aluminum frames covered in [[canvas]], [[dacron]], or other fabrics, and may include inflatable tubes called [[sponsons]].

Marine Grade plywood available today provides a high strength to weight ratio for kayak construction.

===Bow, stern, and deck===
There are many design approaches for the bow, stern, and deck of kayaks. Some kayaks have upturned bows, which are meant to provide better performance when paddling into waves, as well as better wave-shedding ability. Other kayaks achieve this through increased [[buoyancy]] in the bow. Kayaks with unobstructed stern decks may ease certain types of [[self-rescue]]. Waterproof bulkheads in modern kayaks provide flotation in the event of capsize.

Sea kayak decks typically include one or more hatches for easy access to the interior storage space inside. Kayak decks often include attachment points for ''deck lines'' of various kinds, which are aids in self-rescue and attachment points for above-deck equipment.

Cockpits can be of several designs.  They can be large or small.  A large [[keyhole]] cockpit can give the advantages of both, and combine firm contact between paddler and boat, while offering relatively easier access.

===Equipment===
[[File:Sea Kayak Kealakekua.jpg|right|thumb|Sea kayaking is a popular way to explore [[Kealakekua Bay]], Hawaii.]]
Sea Kayaks have a wide range of hull designs, which greatly expands their range of performance.  Designs can accommodate a wide range of physical fitness, or usage.  Boats come in many lengths, whereby shorter boats are generally more maneuverable, and longer boats generally travel straighter and faster.  Width of beam can affect a boat's stability, speed, and ability to bring to an edge.  The amount of rocker (the curve from bow to stern) can greatly affect the ability of a boat to turn.

Many have steering gear or tracking aids in the form of [[rudder]]s or [[skeg]]s. In most cases rudders are attached at the stern and operated by lines (wire or synthetics such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|Spectra]]) from foot pedals in the cockpit. Rudders are typically retractable for beach landings. Skegs are typically retractable straight blades that drop from a well in the stern of the boat. Both devices assist in paddling when a strong wind or waves are coming from a direction other than directly in front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hutchinson | first = Derek.

==Paddles==
Sea-kayak [[paddle]]s, and the associated paddling styles, fall into three basic classifications:
* European {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
: two roughly spoon-shaped blades at either end of a cylindrical shaft. This paddle style was developed for fast acceleration and sudden maneuvering in [[Whitewater kayaking]], and then back-ported to sea-kayaking. Euro {{citation needed|date=October 2016}} paddles can be made of aluminum, plastic or even wood, but the best are usually formed of more expensive materials like carbon-fiber for lightness. Often the two blades are ''feathered'', or set at an angle relative to each other (both for ergonomic efficiency, and so that as one blade moves backwards through the water, the opposite blade moving forward through the air presents its edge, rather than its face). This does make it less efficient with the wind on the side or behind.

[[File:PaddleForKayakTopAndAxisView.svg|center|500px|thumb|A European{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} style kayak paddle, (a) top view, (b) axial view, ([[first angle projection]])]]
* Greenland
: Relatively narrow blades which are rounded and full near the loom and blade roots, and becoming oval near the blade tips. Some paddles feature a "shoulder", or abrupt transition between the loom and blade roots. Greenland paddle blades are usually never feathered. Short Greenland paddles (generally one arm-span in length), called storm paddles, are used with a sliding stroke, where the hands are shifted along the blades for each stroke. Storm paddles are often used as spares and in very windy locations, as there is very little outboard blade to catch the wind.
[[File:Greenland Paddle 2.JPG|center|500px|thumb|A Greenland style kayak paddle]]
* Wing
: The blade of the paddle is shaped with a profile like a wing. When used with a special stroke, the blade actually produces lift as it moves through the water, enabling the kayaker to produce more forward motion than with any other kind of paddle. The paddling technique is different from the European style paddle though the same motion is how the Greenland paddle works with its narrow blade. It is most often used in racing, but also sees some limited use in recreational paddling such as touring.

===Dimensions===
True Sea kayaks, not to be mistaken for wider, more stable recreational kayaks, come in many designs. The length of a solo sea kayak can range anywhere from {{convert|14|to|20|ft|m}} long, and tandem kayaks can range from {{convert|18|to|24|ft|m}} long. Sea kayaks can range in width from {{convert|20| to|24|in|mm}} ({{convert|57|-|76|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}{{clarify|date=January 2015}}). Wider touring kayaks of {{convert|23|to|24|in|mm}} ({{convert|66|-|76|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}{{clarify|date=January 2015}}) are better for bigger paddlers, or small/average sized paddlers looking for more initial stability and maneuverability. Narrower beams of {{convert|20|to|23|in|mm}} ({{convert|56|-|63.5|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}{{clarify|date=January 2015}}) are good for small-medium-sized paddlers who want more speed and less maneuverability. And lastly, kayak depth (or the height from the hull to the highest area of the deck) can range from {{convert|11|to|13|in|mm}} ({{convert|33|-|40|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}{{clarify|date=January 2015}}) high.

[[File:Explorer sea kayak side view.jpg|center]]

This design is typical of modern sea kayaks and has a low rear deck for easy rolling, a white water cockpit, compartments that allow the kayaker to reach into them while at sea, and a sloping rear bulkhead that enables the kayak to be emptied by lifting the bow.

==Safety==
{{original research|section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:St John Trunk Bay 5.jpg|right|thumb|Sea kayaking at [[Trunk Bay]] on [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]]]

A sea kayak's primary safety device is its paddler. Although some kayakers consider a well-practised self-righting move such as an [[Eskimo roll]] to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises in order to maintain an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.

While there are a number of techniques for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a [[capsize]] and [[Turtling (sailing)|turtling]], most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.

The use of a [[Paddle float]] self-rescue device, generally consisting of foam or in the form of an inflatable bag, and attached to the end of a paddle when needed, allows the paddle to be used as an outrigger while climbing back into the cockpit.  If an inflatable paddle float is chosen, it should be a dual-chambered model on account of the safety advantage (in the event of failure of one chamber) that is conferred by the redundancy.  The kayaker is advised to train with only one chamber inflated.  In many areas (Canada, for instance), a paddle float is a safety item required by the coast guard.  Re-entry using a paddle float is a fairly reliable rescue technique that, if well practised, allows one to paddle with confidence when one is not equipped with a flawlessly honed rolling skill.

There is a strong culture of self-sufficiency amongst sea kayakers and extensive safety equipment such as compass, towing lines, manual pumps, repair kits including wet application repair tape, flares, [[paddle leash]], spare paddles, and survival gear are routinely carried; along with supplies of food and a flask of hot beverage for non-emergency use. GPS, charts, lights, radios and cell phones, and [[radar reflector]]s are also sometimes carried.

==Forms of sea kayaking==
[[File:Kayak Sailing on the Columbia.jpg|right|thumb|Kayak Sailing on the [[Columbia River]]]]

===Kayak Sailing===
Developed by kayak enthusiasts, Kayak sails can supplement or effectively eliminate the need for paddling. Using a sail can increase offshore range and allow longer expeditions. Use of a sail for touring has established a strong following with recreational sea kayakers, expedition paddlers, and adventure racers.

[[File:Sea Kayaking Wilsons Promontory.jpg|right|thumb|Sea Kayaking at Wilsons Promontory in Victoria, Australia]]

===Expedition Trips===
Weekend trips with overnight camping are popular among recreational kayakers and many combine kayaking with wildlife watching. Modern sea kayaks are designed to carry large amounts of equipment and unsupported expeditions of two weeks or more are conducted in environments ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. Expedition kayaks are designed to handle best when loaded, so it may be necessary to ballast them on shorter trips.

===Surf Kayaking===
{{details|Surf Kayaking}}
{{details|Surf skis}}
Closely related to surf boards and requiring a mix of [[surfing]] and kayaking skills, a wide range of sea kayaks are specifically designed for the sport of wave surfing.

===Sea Fishing===
{{main|Kayak fishing}}

The sea [[kayak]] has long been a means of transportation and a means of accessing fishing grounds and kayak fishing has gained popularity due to the availability of purpose built stable designs. This technological development also solves some ergonomic problems that are associated with sitting for long hours without being able to change positions and special kayaks for fishing are accessorized for this sport, including specially-designed hatches, built-in rod holders, catch bags and equipment mounts.

Many of the techniques used in kayak fishing are the same as those used on other fishing boats. The difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. Contemporary kayaks can be equipped with fishing aids such as rod holders, electronic [[Fishfinder|fish-finders]] and live-bait containers. Kayak [[Fisherman|anglers]] target highly prized bottom feeders like [[halibut]] and [[cod]] and also [[Pelagic zone|pelagics]] like [[amberjack]]s, [[tuna]], [[sailfish]], [[wahoo]], and even [[marlin]].

==Pioneering sea kayak expeditions==
;Pre-1900
* There is controversial evidence to suggest early trans-atlantic kayak journeys from Labrador or Greenland to Scotland by Inuit paddlers. Indeed, at the end of the 17th century there were at least three separate kayaks preserved in Scotland. One kayak, with associated equipment, is preserved in Aberdeen's [[Marischal Museum]]. It was found, with dying occupant, on a nearby shore. Some suggest the occupants were escaped Inuit from European ships, Inuit storm-driven from Greenland, or from a European source. Many suggest Inuit and their kayaks to be the origin of the Celtic [[Finn-men]], or [[Selkie]], legends.&lt;ref&gt;MacRitchie, Scot, ''The Aberdeen Kayak and its Congeners'', Royal Scottish Geographical Society Magazine, Feb 12, 1912, http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_046/46_213_241.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shape''''' is a monthly [[English language]] [[Physical fitness|fitness]] [[magazine]] started by [[Weider Publications]] in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazines in Alphabetical Order|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_womens_magazines|work=Radcliffe Institute|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|work=PSA Research Center|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine ''Muscle &amp; Fitness''.  Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present ''Shape'', Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine.  Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy.  MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree{{what|date=May 2015}}, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.{{cn|date=May 2015}}  Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1988. Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief. ''Shape'' found a readership based on that formula.

Weider was purchased by [[American Media (publisher)|American Media]] in 2002. A [[Germany|German]] version of ''Shape'' is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.

On January 28, 2015, it was reported that ''Shape'' would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and ''[[Fitness (magazine)|Fitness]]'', published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.&lt;ref&gt;Tess Stynes, ''The Wall Street Journal''.

'''Varpa''' is an outdoor [[game]] that dates back to the [[Viking Age]] and survived in [[Gotland]]. It is similar to [[boules]] and horseshoes but is played with a flat and heavy object called a "varpa" instead of balls. Varpas used to be well-shaped stones, but nowadays, aluminium is more popular. A varpa can weigh between a half kilo and five kilos. The object of the game is to throw the varpa as close to a stick as possible. The stick is 15 meters away for women and 20 meters away for men. The game can be played individually or in teams.

No official nationally sponsored varpa teams exist; however, unofficial leagues are growing in popularity among youth in suburban areas of Sweden and Norway.&lt;ref name=spel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molin|first1=Maria|title=Stångaspelen för den oinvigde|trans-title=Stånga Games for the uninitiated|date=12 June 2015|url=http://www.gotland.net/se-och-gora/arkiv/stangaspelen-for-den-oinvigde/11142011|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Varpa" is an old word which simply means "to throw".

Varpa is one of the disciplines at the annual [[Stånga Games]] (''Stångaspelen'').&lt;ref name="spel" /&gt;

[[Image:Wicket-Keeping Gloves.jpg|thumb|A pair of wicket-keeping gloves. The webbing which helps the keeper to catch the ball can be seen between the thumb and index fingers.]]
A '''wicket-keeper's gloves''' or '''mitt''' are large [[leather glove]]s worn by [[cricket]] players of 
the defending team which assist players in catching and fielding balls hit by a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] or thrown by a teammate.

==Legal specifications==

[[File:Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves.jpg|thumb|right|Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves]]

Law 40.2, which deals with the specifications for wicketkeepers' gloves, states that: If,.... the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. If used, the webbing shall be:

(a) a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.

(b) such that the top edge of the webbing-

(i) does not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb.

(ii) is taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-40-the-wicket-keeper,66,AR.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] was inspired by the commercial success of ''[[Wii Fit]]'' to produce a follow-up. Miyamoto learned during ''Wii Fit Plus'' development that many ''Wii Fit'' owners had stopped playing the game, believing the primary reason to be inconvenience. A new menu interface, My Wii Fit Plus, was implemented to address this issue and make accessing activities quicker and easier. The interface was recreated and adjusted multiple times during development. In designing new minigames for ''Wii Fit Plus'', Miyamoto desired to create activities that played upon the [[Stroop effect]], requiring coordination of both the player's mind and body; minigames in which the player uses both the [[Wii Remote]] and the [[Wii Balance Board]] at the same time became a major focus.&lt;ref name="iwata asks 1.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-asks/Iwata-Asks-Wii-Fit-Plus/Interview-with-Shigeru-Miyamoto/1-Not-a-Sequel-but-an-Enhanced-Version/1-Not-a-Sequel-but-an-Enhanced-Version-209472.html |publisher=Nintendo of Europe |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |work=Iwata Asks: Wii Fit Plus |title=Not a Sequel but an Enhanced Version}}&lt;/ref&gt;
