      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8714">'''Alliance Base''' was the cover name for a secret Western [[Counterterrorist Intelligence Center]] (CTIC) that existed between 2002 and 2009&lt;ref name=sdr89&gt;{{cite news|last=Servenay|first=David|title=Terrorisme : pourquoi Alliance Base a fermé à Paris|url=http://www.rue89.com/2010/05/24/terrorisme-fermeture-dalliance-base-a-paris-152349|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[rue 89]]|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]]. The existence of CTICs were first revealed by [[Dana Priest]] in a November 17, 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article,&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111702070_pf.html Foreign Network at Front of CIA's Terror Fight], [[Dana Priest]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 17 November 2005 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while she referred to the Alliance Base in a July 2, 2005, article.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dana |last=Priest |author= |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/02/AR2005070201361_pf.html|title=Help From France Key In Covert Operations |work= |publisher=Washington Post |pages= |page= |date=July 3, 2005 |accessdate=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was chosen in reference of [[Al Qaeda]], which means "The Base" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It was headed by a French General assigned to the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (DGSE), and largely funded by the [[CIA]]'s [[Counterterrorist Center]].&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt; It hosted officers from [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] and was used for intelligence exchange and operational planning. Its existence was confirmed on 8 September 2006 by [[Christophe Chaboud]], chief of the [[UCLAT]] ("''Unité de Coordination de la Lutte contre le Terrorisme''", "Fight against Terrorism Coordination Unit"), in an interview to [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0%402-3224,36-812394%4051-812238,0.html ''La France abrite une cellule antiterroriste secrète en plein Paris''], ''[[Le Monde]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] exchange between [[intelligence agencies]] has become more and more widespread in the last decade, in particular following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], this organisation also engaged in operations.

== International cooperation between intelligence agencies ==

Its existence was first revealed by a November 17, 2005, article by [[Dana Priest]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who also broke the story concerning the existence of the CIA's "[[black site]]s".&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt; In the article, both the CIA and the French government declined to comment on Alliance Base, while all intelligence officers requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the project, in particular relating to its political and judicial dimensions. "No country wanted to be perceived as taking direction from the CIA," wrote Dana Priest, while France was the only [[European Union|European state]] willing to engage in more than simple information exchange. "To play down the U.S. role, the center's working language is French," told an anonymous source to the Washington Post investigative reporter. "The base selects its cases carefully, chooses a lead country for each operation, and that country's service runs the operation." Furthermore, this cooperation permits "German case officers to read information from their own country's law enforcement authorities", which is prohibited by [[German law]].&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

Alliance Base also takes advantage of the "harsh laws" of France concerning [[anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism]]. French magistrates are allowed to detain people suspected of "conspiracy in relation to terrorism" while gathering evidence. According to the top anti-terrorist magistrate, [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], he has in the past ordered the arrest of more than 500 suspects, some with the assistance of US authorities.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt; Dana Priest cited him as saying: "I have good connections with the CIA and [[FBI]]." Dana Priest described the working of Alliance Base, writing that "The CIA brings money from its classified and ever-growing 'foreign liaison' account &amp;mdash; it has paid to transport some of France's suspects from abroad into Paris for legal imprisonment' [thus [[rendition (law)|rendering]] them to France] &amp;mdash; and its global eavesdropping capabilities and worldwide intelligence service ties." France, on the other hand, "brings its harsh laws, surveillance of radical Muslim groups and their network in Arab states, and its intelligence links to its former colonies".&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

By reporting information to its counterparts, French intelligence agencies helped the US convict [[Ahmed Ressam]], arrested in 1999, as well as [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who lived a long time in France.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

In the days following the 9/11 attacks, President [[Jacques Chirac]] issued an edict to [[French secret services]] ordering them to share information with US counterparts "as if they were your own service," according to two officials who read it and were cited by Dana Priest. According to the ''Washington Post'' investigative reporter, the arrest of [[Christian Ganczarski]], alleged to be a senior Al Qaeda leader, was one of the 12 major operations it conducted during its first years. Since the end of 2001, France has detained about 60 suspects, some with the help of the CIA, according to a CIA veteran cited by Priest.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

[[Pierre de Bousquet de Florian]], director of the [[Directorate of Territorial Surveillance]] (DST), said "There's easy exchange of information. The cooperation between my service and the American service is candid, loyal and certainly effective." Jean-Louis Brugière, on the other hand, was quoted by Dana Priest as saying that "The relations between intelligence agencies in the United States and France has been good, even during the transatlantic dispute over Iraq, for practical reasons".&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

[[John E. McLaughlin]], former director of the [[CIA]], has claimed that the cooperation between the DGSE and the CIA "is one the best of the world".&lt;ref name=Dana/&gt;

== Christian Ganczarski and Ahmed Medhi ==

[[Christian Ganczarski]], a German convert to Islam, took an [[Air France]] flight from [[Riyadh]] on June 3, 2003, back to Germany, with a change of planes in Paris. But he was secretly followed on board by an undercover officer. In Paris' airport, a senior CIA officer was waiting for him, while French authorities separated him from his family and arrested him, on charges of association with terrorists. This operation was conceived at the Alliance Base.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

On May 20, 2003, Alliance Base learned that Ahmed Mehdi, who lived near Ganczarksi in Germany, was about to travel for a 14-day vacation to [[La Réunion]], a French island in the Indian Ocean. Although the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] thought that he was planning an attack, they had not enough evidence to arrest him. The CIA arranged someone to suggest that Mehdi stop in Paris on his way to La Réunion. The French services clandestinely helped him to have a visa, while the Germans monitored calls and contacts. On June 1, 2003, he was arrested by French authorities at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and sent to [[Fresnes Prison]]. Two days later, Ganczarksi was also there.&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;

Following interrogations of both men, investigators suspected that they had links with the [[Hamburg cell]], which plotted the September 11 attacks. Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] implicitly referred to Alliance Base on June 11, 2003, declaring to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] that "This arrest took place thanks to the perfect collaboration between the services of the great democracies."&lt;ref name="Priest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2002-2003/20030236.asp Assemblée nationale : 1ère SÉANCE DU MERCREDI 11 JUIN 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti Raggers''' is a non-political [[student group]] spread over the universities in [[Sri Lanka]]. There is no special bond or whatever to hold this group together. Only their self beliefs of doing what is correct is considered. The major view of the [[student]]s and [[lecturer]]s in the group is to prevent [[ragging]] and [[bullying]] on [[Freshmen|freshers]]. Also they act as a protective group for the freshers in the universities.

Although there is a lot of [[political pressure]] being built up on the group by certain [[Political party|political parties]] whose major aim is to gather student votes, the Anti Raggers or ''''Boggu'''' or ''''Ala'''' as they are fondly named keep on their good work throughout.  The current [[government]] of Sri Lanka is also against the Ragging system so hopefully these two parties will be able to stop this ugly feature in the [[university]] system.

University Independent Conversion Movement convenor Yukthi Ekadeera affiliated to the Sri Lankan government, accused the Inter University Students’ Federation(IUSF) ”Anthare” of being responsible for ragging (initiation) incidents and other acts of violence in Sri Lankan universities, and declared that it would go to court to demand a ban on the IUSF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankauniversity-news.com/2012/06/university-students-union-to-be-banned.html IUSF-Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
&lt;!--Note. If you intend to insert something to the effect: Arabs view this term as [[oxymoronic]], as they themselves are [[semites]] - Please read the section [[#Usage]] first.--&gt;

'''Antisemitism in the Arab world''' increased greatly in the 20th century, for several reasons: the [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|breakdown of the Ottoman Empire]] and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by [[Western world|Western]] [[imperialism]] and [[Arab Christians]];&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi propaganda]];&lt;ref name="Yadlin"&gt;Yadlin, Rifka. "Antisemitism". ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; resentment over Jewish nationalism (see [[Zionism]]); and the rise of [[Arab nationalism]].

Traditionally, [[Jews]] in the [[Muslim world]] were considered to be [[People of the Book]] and were given ''[[dhimmi]]'' status. They were afforded relative security against persecution, provided they did not contest the inferior social and legal status imposed on them.

While there were antisemitic incidents before the 20th century, antisemitism increased dramatically as a result of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of the state of Israel]] and [[Israel]]i victories during the wars of [[Suez Crisis#Invasion|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were a severe humiliation to Israel's opponents—primarily [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the mid-1970s the vast majority of Jews had [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|left Arab and Muslim countries]], moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.&lt;ref name=Shenhav&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.&lt;ref name=Shenhav/&gt;

By the 1980s, according to historian [[Bernard Lewis]], the volume of antisemitic literature published in the [[Arab world]], and the authority of its sponsors, seemed to suggest that classical antisemitism had become an essential part of Arab intellectual life, considerably more than in late 19th- and early 20th-century France and to a degree that has been compared to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256"&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''Semites and Anti-Semites'', New York/London: Norton, 1986, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[political Islam]] during the 1980s and afterwards provided a new mutation of [[Islamic antisemitism]], giving the hatred of Jews a religious component.&lt;ref name="Yadlin" /&gt;

In their 2008 report on contemporary Arab-Muslim antisemitism, the Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] dates the beginning of this phenomenon to the spread of classic European [[Christian antisemitism]] into the Arab world starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="itic"&gt;"[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf Contemporary Arab-Muslim anti-Semitism, its Significance and Implications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000104/http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf |date=February 20, 2009 }}", [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center (IICC)]], April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] published a global survey of worldwide antisemitic attitudes, reporting that in the Middle East, 74% of adults agreed with a majority of the survey's eleven antisemitic propositions, including that "Jews have too much power in international financial markets" and that "Jews are responsible for most of the world's wars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hating-the-jew-youve-never-met/|title=Hating the Jew you've never met|date=15 May 2014|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ADL Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism |url=http://global100.adl.org/|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval times==
{{See also|History of antisemitism#Middle Ages}}

Jews, along with [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], typically had the legal status of ''[[dhimmi]]'' ("protected" minority) in the [[Muslim history|lands conquered by Muslim Arabs]], generally applied to non-Muslim minorities. Jews were generally seen as a religious group (not a separate race), thus being a part of the "Arab family".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhimmis were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in [[Racial segregation|segregated]] quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmis had to pay a special poll tax (the ''[[jizya]]''), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the ''[[zakat]]'' alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmis were granted limited rights, including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R. Cohen|Cohen, Mark R.]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&amp;q|accessdate=April 10, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam were generally more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of [[list of events named massacres|massacres]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Jews in North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080927133652/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] where eventually Jews were forced to live in [[mellah|ghettos]].&lt;ref&gt;Roumani, Maurice. ''The Case of the Jews from Arab Countries: A Neglected Issue'', 1977, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html |title=The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=February 19, 1947 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At certain times in Yemen, Morocco and [[Baghdad]], Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or, ''The Dhimmi'', 1985, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views in modernity==
Some scholars hold that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it "Islamized"), Mark Cohen states.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:
{{quote|The volume of anti-Semitic books and articles published, the size and number of editions and impressions, the eminence and authority of those who write, publish and sponsor them, their place in school and college curricula, their role in the mass media, would all seem to suggest that classical anti-Semitism is an essential part of Arab intellectual life at the present time-almost as much as happened in Nazi Germany, and considerably more than in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France."&lt;ref name="Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256" /&gt;}}

===Nineteenth century===
The [[Damascus affair]] was an accusation of [[ritual murder]] and a [[blood libel against Jews]] in [[Damascus]] in 1840. On February 5, 1840, [[Franciscan]] [[Capuchin friar]] Father Thomas and his Greek servant were reported missing, never to be seen again. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] governor and the French consul [[Ratti-Menton]] believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel, as the alleged murder occurred before the Jewish [[Passover]]. An investigation was staged, and Solomon Negrin, a Jewish barber, [[Forced confession|confessed under torture]] and accused other Jews. Two other Jews died under torture, and one (Moses Abulafia) converted to [[Islam]] to escape torture. More arrests and atrocities followed, culminating in 63 Jewish children being held [[hostage]] and mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East. International outrage led to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in Egypt ordering an investigation. Negotiations in [[Alexandria]] eventually secured the unconditional release and recognition of innocence of the nine prisoners still remaining alive (out of thirteen). Later in [[Constantinople]], [[Moses Montefiore]] (leader of the British Jewish community) persuaded Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] to issue a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (edict) intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, pogroms spread through the Middle East and North Africa: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jaffa (1876), Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), and Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky.

Stearns, William Leonard Langer p. 527. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus affair]] of the late nineteenth century had consequences in the Arab world. Passionate outbursts of antisemitism in France were echoed in areas of French influence, especially [[Maronite]] [[Lebanon]]. The Muslim Arab press, however, was sympathetic to the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus, and criticized the persecution of Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-state antisemitism ====
While antisemitism has increased in the wake of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], there were [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the foundation of Israel, including [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and attacks on the Jews of [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s. In 1941, 180 Jews were murdered and 700 were injured in the anti-Jewish riots known as the [[Farhud]].&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zvi Zameret|date=October 29, 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/a-distorted-historiography-1.321731 |title=A distorted historiography |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four hundred Jews were injured in violent demonstrations in Egypt in 1945 and Jewish property was vandalized and looted. In Libya, 130 Jews were killed and 266 injured. In December 1947, 13 Jews were killed in Damascus, including 8 children, and 26 were injured. In Aleppo, rioting resulted in dozens of Jewish casualties, damage to 150 Jewish homes, and the torching of 5 schools and 10 synagogues. In Yemen, 97 Jews were murdered and 120 injured.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

==== Speculated causes ====
Antisemitism in the [[Arab world]] increased in the twentieth century, as antisemitic propaganda and [[blood libel]]s were imported from Europe and as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. British troops stationed in Palestine arrived fresh from deployment in the [[Russian civil war]], fighting alongside the [[White Movement]]. The British forces are credited with introducing the [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic hoax]] called ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' to Palestine. In March 1921, Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem, told [[Winston Churchill]] "The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands. ... It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Morris, Benny, ''Righteous Victims'', Knopf, 1999, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthias Küntzel]] has suggested that the decisive transfer of [[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy theory]] took place between 1937 and 1945 under the impact of Nazi propaganda targeted at the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Küntzel, Matthias, "National Socialism and Anti-Semitism in the Arab World", ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 17:1–2 (Spring 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuntzel, the Nazi Arabic radio service had a staff of 80 and broadcast every day in Arabic, stressing the similarities between Islam and Nazism and supported by the activities of the [[Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]] (who broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda from Berlin). The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian [[Moslem Brotherhood]], which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
Bernard Lewis also describes Nazi influence in the Arab world, including its impact on [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]] (which later dominated Syria and Iraq).&lt;blockquote&gt; After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws, Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active.... Before long political parties of the Nazi and Fascist type began to appear, complete with paramilitary youth organizations, colored shirts, strict discipline and more or less charismatic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]].

George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to the breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, George E. [http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm "The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World"], ([[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated. Over the next few decades, almost all would flee the Arab world, some willingly, and some under threat (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]]). In 1945 there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]] (which was once around 3% Jewish), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths3/MFrefugees.html Chapter 12: Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University Professor [[Ruth R. Wisse]] claims that "anti-Semitism / Zionism has been the cornerstone of pan-Arab politics since the Second World War" and that it is the "strongest actual and potential source of unity" in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Wisse, Ruth R. [https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-functions-of-anti-semitism "The Functions of Anti-Semitism."] ''National Affairs''. Fall 2017. 2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because Jews and Israel function as substitutes for Western values that challenge the hegemony of religious and political power in the Middle East. Antisemitism is also malleable enough that it can unite right-wing and left-wing groups within the Arab world.

[[Robert L. Bernstein|Robert Bernstein]], founder of [[Human Rights Watch]], says that antisemitism is "deeply ingrained and institutionalized" in "Arab nations in modern times".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-do-human-rights-groups-ignore-palestinians-war-of-words/2011/09/26/gIQAWU5y2K_story.html Why do human rights groups ignore Palestinians' war of words?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern examples===

====Israeli Arabs====
{{see also|Racism against Israeli Jews by Israeli Arabs}}
In the year 2003, Israeli-Arab [[Raed Salah]], the leader of the northern branch of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]] published the following poem in the Islamic Movement's periodical:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You Jews are criminal bombers of mosques,&lt;br&gt;
Slaughterers of pregnant women and babies.&lt;br&gt;
Robbers and germs in all times,&lt;br&gt;
The Creator sentenced you to be loser monkeys,&lt;br&gt;
Victory belongs to Muslims, from the Nile to the Euphrates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100092424/extremist-ife-sponsors-a-man-who-calls-jews-germs-and-monkeys "Extremist IFE sponsors a man who calls Jews 'germs' and 'monkeys'"]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a speech in 2007, Salah accused Jews of [[blood libel|using children's blood to bake bread]]. "We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood," he said. "Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stern |first=Yoav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/islamic-movement-head-charged-with-incitement-to-racism-violence-1.238209 |title=Islamic Movement head charged with incitement to racism, violence |newspaper=Haaretz |author= |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
{{see also|Antisemitism in Africa#Egypt|History of the Jews in Egypt}}
Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]] has denounced what he called "the myth of [[the Holocaust]]" in defending Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s [[Holocaust denial|denial]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4554986.stm "Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust"], ''[[BBC News]]'', December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egypt]]ian government-run newspaper, ''[[Al Akhbar (Egypt)|Al Akhbar]]'', on April 29, 2002, published an editorial denying [[the Holocaust]] as a fraud. The next paragraph decries the failure of the Holocaust to eliminate all of the Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the fraud of the Holocaust.... Many French studies have proven that this is no more than a fabrication, a lie, and a fraud!! That is, it is a 'scenario' the plot of which was carefully tailored, using several faked photos completely unconnected to the truth. Yes, it is a film, no more and no less. Hitler himself, whom they accuse of Nazism, is in my eyes no more than a modest 'pupil' in the world of murder and bloodshed. He is completely innocent of the charge of frying them in the hell of his false Holocaust!!

The entire matter, as many French and British scientists and researchers have proven, is nothing more than a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the German government in particular and the European countries in general. But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only you had done it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [without] their evil and sin.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article in October 2000 columnist [[Adel Hammoda]] alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper ''[[al-Ahram]]'' that Jews made [[Matza]] from the blood of (non-Jewish) children.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Ahram'' (Egypt), October 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed Salmawy, editor of ''[[Al-Ahram Hebdo]]'', "defended the use of old European myths like the [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]]" in his newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kate (August 10, 2003).

====Jordan====
{{See also|History of the Jews in Jordan}}
[[Jordan]] does not allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with personal religious items in their possession. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew denied entry that security concerns required that travelers entering the Hashemite Kingdom not do so with prayer shawls ([[Tallit]]) and phylacteries ([[Tefillin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan denies entry to Israeli with Jewish prayer items |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/jordan-denies-entry-to-israeli-with-jewish-prayer-items-1.279743 |date= July 10, 2009 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian authorities state that the policy is in order to ensure the Jewish tourists' safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israeli tourists asked to hand over Jewish paraphernalia |url=http://www.eturbonews.com/4337/israeli-tourists-asked-hand-over-jewish-paraphernalia |date= August 13, 2008|work= |publisher= eTurboNews |accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, six [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] were deported after attempting entry into Jordan in order to visit the tomb of Aaron / Sheikh Harun on [[Mount Hor]], near [[Petra]], because of an alert from the Ministry of Tourism.

====Saudi Arabia====
{{Main article|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia}}

Hostility toward Jews is common in Saudi Arabian media, religious sermons, school curriculum, and official government policy.  

Indoctrination against Jews is a part of school curriculum in Saudi Arabia.  Children are advised not to befriend Jews, are given false information about them (such as the claim that Jews worship the Devil), and are encouraged to engage in ''jihad'' against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

====Syria====
[[File:Zeibak.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Fara Zeibak, Mazal Zeibak, Eva Saad and Lulu Zeibak.]]

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] women were discovered by border police in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee Syrian to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girls' bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

In 1984 Syrian Defense Minister [[Mustafa Tlass]] published a book called ''The Matzah of Zion'', which claimed that Jews had killed Christian children in Damascus to make Matzas (see [[Damascus affair]]). His book inspired the Egyptian TV series ''[[Horseman Without a Horse]]'' (see below) and a spinoff, ''The Diaspora'', which led to [[Hezbollah]]'s al-Manar being banned in Europe for broadcasting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorisch, Avi|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdBkAAAAMAAJ|title=Beacon of Hatred: Inside Hizballahs Al-Manar Television|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy|isbn=0-944029-88-4|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tunisia====
For a personal account of the discrimination and physical attacks experienced by Jews in Tunisia see the Jewish-Arab anti-colonialist writer [[Albert Memmi]]'s account:&lt;ref&gt;Memmi, Albert.[http://www.jimena.org/faq/memmi.htm "Who is an Arab Jew?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132211/http://www.jimena.org/faq/memmi.htm |date=November 20, 2008 }}, February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At each crisis, with every incident of the slightest importance, the mob would go wild, setting fire to Jewish shops. This even happened during the Yom Kippur War. Tunisia's President, Habib Bourguiba, has in all probability never been hostile to the Jews, but there was always that notorious "delay", which meant that the police arrived on the scene only after the shops had been pillaged and burnt. Is it any wonder that the exodus to France and Israel continued and even increased?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 30, 2012, prominent Tunisian imam Sheikh Ahmad Al-Suhayli of [[Radès]], told his followers during a live broadcast on [[Hannibal TV]] that "God wants to destroy this [Tunisian] sprinkling of Jews and is sterilizing the wombs of Jewish women."&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/tunisian-imam-sued-for-call-to-sterilize-the-wombs-of-jewish-women/ Tunisian imam sued for call to 'sterilize the wombs of Jewish women' Times of Israel.

====Palestinian territories====
{{main article|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}
The [[Hamas]], an offshoot of the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]], has a foundational statement of principles, or "covenant" that claims that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists. It also claims the [[Freemason]]s and [[Rotary club]]s are Zionist fronts and refers to the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 articles 22 and 32 |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=July 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170055/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahmoud Abbas]], leader of the [[PLO]], published a Ph.D. thesis (at Moscow University) in 1982, called ''The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Brynn. [http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?], History News Network.&lt;/ref&gt;
His doctoral thesis later became a book, [[The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism]], which, following his appointment as Palestinian Prime Minister in 2003, was heavily criticized as an example of [[Holocaust denial]]. In his book, Abbas wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement, however, is to inflate this figure [of Holocaust deaths] so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism. Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions—fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Medoff, Dr. Rafael.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Lebanon====
[[Hezbollah]]'s [[Al-Manar]] TV channel has often been accused of airing antisemitic broadcasts, blaming the Jews for a Zionist [[conspiracy theories in the Arab world|conspiracy against the Arab world]], and often airing excerpts from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sciolino |first=Elaine |author2=Carole Corm |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7DE1031F93AA35751C1A9629C8B63 |title=A New French Headache: When Is Hate on TV Illegal? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/protocols/protocols_recycled.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Series on Arab Television: Satellite Network Recycles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion |publisher=Anti-Defamation League]] |date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=297065 "Urge President Chirac to Block Hezbollah's Antisemitic and Hate TV".] ''[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]''. May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes as a "fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century".

[[Al-Manar]] recently aired a drama series, called ''The Diaspora'', which is based on historical antisemitic allegations. BBC reporters who watched the series said that: &lt;blockquote&gt; Correspondents who have viewed ''The Diaspora'' note that it quotes extensively from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', a notorious 19th-century publication used by the Nazis among others to fuel race hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3581514.stm "France offers 'hate TV' reprieve"], ''BBC News Online'', August 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to "Zionist attempts to transmit [[AIDS]] to Arab countries". Al-Manar officials deny broadcasting antisemitic incitement and state that their position is anti-Israeli, not antisemitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric both against Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright antisemitic literature. The government of Lebanon has not criticized continued broadcast of antisemitic material on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136073.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Lebanon |publisher=State.gov |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to protests by the [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]] umbrella group of French Jews regarding allegations of antisemitic content, French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] called for a ban on Al-Manar broadcasting in France on December 2, 2004; just two weeks after al-Manar was authorised to continue broadcasting in Europe by France's media watchdog agency.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Sebastian (December 3, 2004) .[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4064317.stm "French seek 'anti-Semitic' TV ban"], ''[[BBC News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2004, France's highest administrative court banned Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV station on the grounds that it consistently incites racial hatred and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4093579.stm "France pulls plug on Arab network"], ''[[BBC News]] Online'', December 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yemen====
{{see also|Geography of antisemitism#Yemen}}
The 1940s and the [[Decleration of Israel|establishment of Israel]] saw rapid emigration of Jews out of Yemen, in the wake of anti-Jewish riots and massacres. By the late 1990s, only several hundred remained, mainly in a northwestern mountainous region named [[Sa'ada]] and town of [[Raida (town)|Raida]]. [[Houthi]] members put up notes on the Jews' doors, accusing them of corrupting Muslim morals. Eventually, the Houthi leaders sent threatening messages to the Jewish community: "We warn you to leave the area immediately.... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710042018/http://fighthatred.com/recent-events/national-political-hate/416-jews-flee-yemen-due-to-rising-anti-semitism Jews flee Yemen due to rising anti-Semitism, Fight Hartred]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab newspapers====
Many [[Arab]] newspapers, such as ''[[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]]'', the Palestinian Authority's official newspaper, often write that "the Jews" control all the world's governments, and that "the Jews" plan [[genocide]] on all the Arabs in the [[West Bank]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Others write less sensational stories, and state that Jews have too much of an influence in the United States government. Often the leaders of other nations are said to be controlled by Jews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Articles in many official Arab government newspapers claim that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', reflects facts, and thus points to an international Jewish conspiracy to [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|take over the world]].

{{quote|Netanyahu's Plan completely matches the foundations of the greater Zionist plan which is organized according to specific stages that were determined when ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' was composed and when Herzl along with Weizmann traveled around the world in order to determine the appropriate location for the implementation of this conspiracy, (official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah, November 30, 1997).}}

{{quote|The Jews seek to conquer the world....

====''Horseman Without a Horse''====
In 2001–2002, [[Arab Radio and Television Network|Arab Radio and Television]] produced a 30-part television miniseries entitled ''Horseman Without a Horse'', starring prominent Egyptian actor [[Mohamed Sobhi (actor)|Mohamed Sobhi]], which contains dramatizations of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. The United States and Israel criticized Egypt for airing the program, which includes racist falsehoods that have a history of being used "as a pretext for persecuting Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2386767.stm "Egypt criticised for 'anti-Semitic' film"], ''[[BBC News]] Online'', November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion polling====
In 2008 a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that negative views concerning Jews were most common in the three predominantly Arab nations polled, with 97% of Lebanese having unfavorable opinion of Jews, 95% in Egypt and 96% in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/262.pdf Unfavorable Views of Jews and Muslims on the increase in Europe] Pew Global Attitudes Research September 17, 2008, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autochthonous Croatian Party of Right''' ({{lang-hr|Autohtona-Hrvatska stranka prava}} or '''A-HSP''') is a [[far right]], [[neo-Nazi]] and [[social conservative]] political party founded in [[Koprivnica]], in 2005, after the merging of Croatian Rightists and Croatian Right Movement. The goal of the Movement is to unite all ''rightist'' parties in Croatia such as the [[Croatian Party of Rights|HSP]], the [[Croatian Party of Rights 1861|HSP 1861]], the [[Croatian Pure Party of Rights|HČSP]] and others. It was very critical of the [[Croatian Party of Rights|HSP]]'s political positions until 2009.

A-HSP is [[pro-life]] and advocates [[LGBT rights opposition|protection of marriage]] as well as motherhood, children and youth, people of special needs and the nature. It is strongly against Croatian accession to [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]] and advocates [[irredentism]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Boka Kotorska]], [[Srijem]] and [[Bačka|Bač]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrvatskipravasi.hr/index.php?id=m&amp;lnk=2 HP - HPP, Hrvatski pravaši&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party changed its name from United Supporters of the Croatian Party of Rights Movement to Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights in 2009.

In 2010 the A-HSP publicly burned a copy of the [[Serbs in Croatia|Serb minority]] publication [[Novosti (Croatia)|Novosti]], whose HQ had to be protected by the police for a week.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2013 (Croatia)|European Parliament election, 2013]] A-HSP received 2350 votes (0.32%) which was not enough to gain a seat.

In 2015, the Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojić, banned the party's rally in Zagreb's central square.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/zabranjen-javni-prosvjed-autohtone-hrvatske-stranke-prava-991944&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the party organized a march through the Croatian capital in order to show their support and declare allegiance to then-recently elected American president [[Donald Trump]]. During the march, the party's members, dressed in black uniforms, were waving flags of the German neo-Nazi [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD party]] and [[United States flag|USA flags]] while shouting the Ustasha salute "[[Za dom spremni]]". After the rally the party's leader Dražen Keleminec was arrested by the police for disturbing the public peace and quiet. The Croatian government condemned this rally on that same day for promoting [[ustasha|Ustasha ideology]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/pristase-a-hsp-a-marsirali-zagrebom-uhicen-drazen-keleminec-1152319&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the U.S. embassy in Zagreb reacted by publishing a statement in which they strongly condemned the march and rejected any attempts to connect the USA with Ustasha ideology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/americka-ambasada-ostro-osudila-mars-crnokosuljasa-u-zagrebu-ne-povezujte-sad-s-ovom-mrskom-ideologijom/5691115/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, party's leader, Dražen Keleminec was arrested near [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] for disturbing public peace and quiet and insulting police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hr.n1info.com/a296613/Vijesti/Keleminec-na-putu-u-Jasenovac-priveden-uz-upotrebu-sile.html|title=Keleminec krenuo prema Jasenovcu, policija ga privela uz upotrebu sile|work=N1 HR|access-date=2018-04-22|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Nanjing (1853)''' ({{zh|t=太平軍攻佔南京|s=太平軍攻佔南京|p=Taiping jun gongzhan Nánjīng |w=Nan-ching Pao-wei Chan}}) began after the fall of [[Wuhan]] on March{{nbsp}}8, 1853, and ended with the fall of the capital city of [[Nanking]] on March{{nbsp}}19, 1853, to Taiping troops, a few days after the [[Qing]] Government evacuated the city.&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;{{cite book|title=God's Chinese Son|first=Jonathan D.|last=Spence|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|edition=Reprint|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Taiping Rebellion By Shunshin Chin &lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Qing garrison surrendered to the Taiping, but they were nonetheless executed.

==Background==
Taiping forces captured [[Wuchang]] in January 1853, but instead of marching north and directly attacking Beijing they decided to head east and first take control of [[Nanjing]] with a force of 500,000+ men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795-1989 |first=Bruce A.|last= Elleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floating bridges initially used to in the siege of Wuchang were burned and destroyed to delay Qing advances led by [[Xiang Rong]]. Taiping forces took [[Jiujiang]] and [[Anqing]] in [[Anhui province]] virtually unopposed. 

The Taipings reached Nanjing on March 6, with a force that had grown to almost 750,000. The Taiping besieged the city for thirteen days, until . Three tunnels had been dug beneath city walls in order to plant explosives. Two of them exploded on time but the third one detonated late, killing many Taiping troops in [[friendly fire]]. On March 20, Taiping forces reached the [[Imperial City, Beijing|Imperial City]], the home of the [[Manchu Garrison]] and defended by 40,000 bannermen and Han troops. Qing forces were unable to contain a Taiping [[human wave attack]] and the Inner City fell quickly.

During the battle the Taiping forces used [[Spy|spies]] disguised as [[Buddhist monks]] who successfully entered the city. They set fires alerting the Taiping where the weak points in the city were.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8045">{{Socialism sidebar}}
'''Blanquism''' refers to a conception of revolution generally attributed to [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] (1805–1881) which holds that [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/blanquism.php "Blanquism"]. Retrieved April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Having seized power, the revolutionaries would then use the power of the state to introduce [[socialism]]. It is considered a particular sort of "putschism"—that is, the view that political revolution should take the form of a ''[[putsch]]'' or ''[[coup d'état]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyouth.com/archives/theory/glossary/b.html#Blanquism "Blanquism"]. Retrieved April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanquism is distinguished from other [[Socialism|socialist]] currents (especially [[Marxism|Marxist]] ones) in various ways: on the one hand, contrary to Marx, Blanqui did not believe in the predominant role of the working class, nor did he believe in popular movements—instead he believed that revolution should be carried out by a small group of professional, dedicated revolutionaries, who would establish a temporary dictatorship by force. This dictatorship would permit the implementation of the basis of a new order, after which power would then be handed to the people. In another respect, Blanqui was more concerned with the revolution itself rather than the future society that would result from it—if his thought was based on precise socialist principles, it rarely goes so far as to imagine a purely socialist society. For Blanquists, the overturning of the [[bourgeois]] social order and the revolution are ends sufficient in themselves, at least for their immediate purposes. 

== Central Revolutionary Committee ==
[[File:Louis Auguste Blanqui.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]]]
The [[Central Revolutionary Committee]] (CRC) was a French Blanquist [[political party]] founded in 1881 and dissolved in 1898.

The CRC was founded by [[Édouard Vaillant]] to continue the political struggle of [[Auguste Blanqui]] (1805&amp;ndash;1881). The CRC was a blanquist party: revolutionary activism, [[atheism]], [[patriotism]] and [[Jacobinism]] of the [[French Revolution]]. The CRC was weakened by a split in 1888, when numerous members ([[Henri Rochefort]]) followed [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|General Georges Boulanger]] who synthesized jacobin nationalism with [[socialism]]. Many saw Boulangism as a possible way to socialism. Following the Boulangist dissidence, Vaillant adopted a strategy of [[syndicalism]] and [[strike action]].

The CRC was further re-enforced by the affiliation of the [[Revolutionary Communist Alliance]] (ACR), formed by dissidents of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (France)|Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party]] (POSR) in 1896.

The CRC merged into the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party (France)|Socialist Revolutionary Party]] in 1898.

== Use of the term "Blanquism" ==
The term "Blanquism" has often been used polemically to accuse some revolutionaries of failing to sufficiently meld their [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] with the mass [[working class]]. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were keen to distinguish their conception of revolution from Blanquism. As Engels put it in a short fragment, ''The Program of the Blanquist Fugitives from the Paris Commune'': {{blockquote|Blanqui is essentially a political revolutionist. He is a socialist only through sentiment, through his sympathy with the sufferings of the people, but he has neither a socialist theory nor any definite practical suggestions for social remedies. In his political activity he was mainly a "man of action", believing that a small and well organized minority, who would attempt a political stroke of force at the opportune moment, could carry the mass of the people with them by a few successes at the start and thus make a victorious revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1874/06/26.htm "The Program of the Blanquist Fugitives from the Paris Commune"]. First published in ''Der Volksstaat''. June 26, 1874. [[Marxists.org]]. Retrieved April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Vladimir Lenin ===
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]]&lt;ref name="bern"/&gt; have criticised [[Vladimir Lenin]] that his conception of revolution was elitist and essentially Blanquist. For instance, as part of a longer section on Blanquism in her "Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy" (later published as "Leninism or Marxism?"), Luxemburg writes: {{blockquote|For Lenin, the difference between the Social Democracy and Blanquism is reduced to the observation that in place of a handful of conspirators we have a class-conscious proletariat. He forgets that this difference implies a complete revision of our ideas on organization and, therefore, an entirely different conception of centralism and the relations existing between the party and the struggle itself. Blanquism did not count on the [[direct action]] of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organize the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup. Indeed, to assure the success of the revolutionary conspiracy, it was considered wiser to keep the mass at some distance from the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Luxemburg, [http://www.marx.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/questions-rsd/ch01.htm "Leninism or Marxism?"]. [http://www.marx.org Marx.org]. Retrieved April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

It is worth noting that by "[[social democracy]]" Luxemburg has in mind the original use of the term derived from Marx and synonymous with "socialism". The influence of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] notwithstanding, she conceived of the social democratic party as a mass based organisation of working class struggle. However, Lenin dismissed as meaningless rhetoric the conflation of Blanquism with Bolshevism: {{blockquote|The [[bourgeoisie]] wants, by using the bogy of “Blanquism”, to belittle, discredit and slander the people’s struggle for power. The bourgeoisie stands to gain if the [[proletariat|proletarians]] and peasants fight only for concessions from the old regime. The Right Social-Democrats use the word “Blanquism” merely as a rhetorical device in their polemics. The bourgeoisie converts this word into a weapon against the proletariat: “Workers, be reasonable! Fight for the extension of the powers of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Cadet]] [[Duma]]! Pull the chestnuts out of the fire for the bourgeoisie,&lt;ref&gt;Lenin is alluding to the ''[[wikt:cat's-paw|cat's-paw]]'' allegory.&lt;/ref&gt; but don't dare to think of such madness, [[anarchism]], Blanquism, as fighting for complete power for the people!&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/may/07.htm "The Congress Summed Up"]. May 6, 1906. Marxists.org. Retrieved April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lenin himself denied any accusations of Blanquism in ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' (1917) and accused Bernstein of "opportunism".&lt;ref name="bern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch06.htm#s2|title=The State and Revolution|year=1917|author=Lenin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] thought Blanquism was corruption of revolutionism by the literati.

The '''Brazilian Congressional Bill project No. 1151''', authored by former congresswoman [[Marta Suplicy]], from the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], aims to change [[Brazil]]ian federal law in order to establish same-sex civil unions.&lt;ref name="senado.gov.br"&gt;http://www.senado.gov.br/sf/senado/unilegis/pdf/UL_TF_DL_2005_Viviane_Brito.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it aims to amend Article 1723 of the Civil Code to define a civil union as between two unmarried individuals regardless of either partner's gender.

==History==
The bill had been pending in the Chamber of Deputies since 1995 and was the theme of the 2005 [[São Paulo Gay Pride Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u109491.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; It has been debated many times,&lt;ref name="senado.gov.br" /&gt; but has never been brought to a vote. Then-President of the Chamber [[Severino Cavalcanti]] was expected to end debate and bring the bill to a vote in late 2005, but corruption charges forced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/politica/27041/severino-renuncia-e-diz-que-voltara |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721021954/http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/politica/27041/severino-renuncia-e-diz-que-voltara |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the anticipated vote, Calvalcanti strongly opposed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/edic/19990118/socied1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015141546/http://epoca.globo.com/edic/19990118/socied1.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the bill was introduced into the Senate by Suplicy, who was elected in 2011 to a seat in the Senate. On May 24, 2012, it was passed by the Senate's human rights committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-senate-committee-oks-gay-civil-unions-first-legislative-step-for-the-issue/2012/05/24/gJQAkYwinU_story.html|title = Brazil Senate committee OKs gay civil unions, first legislative step for the issue|date = May 24, 2012|publisher = Associated Press, The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will face another vote before the Senate's Committee on Constitution, Justice and Citizenship, with a subsequent vote in the Chamber of Deputies if no action is taken by the plenary of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticias/detalhes/detalhes-1/artigo/comissao-aprova-projeto-que-inclui-casamento-gay-no-codigo-civil/|title = Comissão aprova projeto que inclui casamento gay no Código Civil|date = 2012-05-24 &lt;!-- - 16:41 --&gt; |publisher = [[Agencia Brasil]], [[Jornal Correio da Bahia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's chances for a full congressional vote have been heightened since the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled in ''[[ADI 4277 and ADPF 132]]'' (May 2011) that civil unions should be allowed for same-sex couples.

A '''bureaucrat''' is a member of a [[bureaucracy]] and can compose the administration of any organization of any size, although the term usually connotes someone within an institution of [[government]]. 

The term ''bureaucrat'' derives from "[[bureaucracy]]", which in turn derives from the French "bureaucratie" first known from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bureaucrat|title=bureaucrat - definition of bureaucrat in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bureaucratic work had already been performed for many centuries. In countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], bureaucrats are known to be the officers that run the government at ministerial levels as well at district levels.

==Role in society==
Bureaucrats play various roles in modern society, by virtue of holding administrative, functional, and managerial positions in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Hegelan|first1=Abdelrahman|title=Bureaucracy and Development in Saudi Arabia|jstor=4326973|work=The Middle East Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lankov|first1=Andrei|title=The North Korean bureaucracy is here to stay|url=http://www.nknews.org/2014/10/the-north-korean-bureaucracy-is-here-to-stay/|accessdate=13 August 2015|agency=NKNews.org|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} They carryout the day-to-day implementation of enacted policies for central government agencies, such as postal services, education and healthcare administration, and various regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Are the Bureaucrats?|url=http://www.ushistory.org/gov/8c.asp|website=US History American Government|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of bureaucrats==
{{norefs|section|date=March 2018}}
Bureaucrats can be split into different categories based on the system, nationality, and time they come from.
# Classical – someone who starts at a low level of public work and does not have to express opinions of their own in their professional capacities. They follow policy guidelines and gain increasing ranks within the system. Tax collectors, government accountants, police officers, fire fighters, and military personnel are examples of classical bureaucrats.
# American bureaucrats – these are different from other types because they operate within a [[republican form of government]], and the political culture traditionally seeks to limit their power. 
# Chinese bureaucrats, also called “[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin bureaucrats]]” – Mandarins were important from 605 to 1905 CE.  The [[Zhou dynasty]] is the earliest recording of Chinese bureaucrats. There was a 9 rank system, each rank having more power than the lower rank. This type of bureaucrat went on until the [[Qing dynasty]]. After 1905 the Mandarins were replaced by modern civil servants. In 1949 the Communist Party took over China and by their theory all people were bureaucrats who worked for the government.
# European – originally referred to as “Mandarins” stemming from the Chinese word for government employee. Bureaucracy didn’t catch on in Europe very much due to the many different governments in the region, and constant change and advancement, and relative freedom of the upper class. With the translation of [[Confucian]] texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a [[meritocracy]] reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancien regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz, Bill. (1996). ''The expansion of England: race, ethnicity and cultural history''. Psychology Pres; {{ISBN|0-415-06025-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt; The implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy, followed the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 which was influenced by of the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|work=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was modeled on the imperial examinations system and  [[Scholar-official|bureaucracy]] of China based on the suggestion of Northcote–Trevelyan Report.&lt;ref name="Bodde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], China argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].&lt;ref name="Bodde"/&gt; In 1958, though, after the formation of the European Union the job of the Bureaucrat became extremely important to help organize and govern such a large and diverse community. In 1961 the term [[Eurocrat]] was coined by [[Richard Mayne (administrator)|Richard Mayne]], a journalist at the time. A Eurocrat is a bureaucrat of the European Union.
# Modern Bureaucrat - Bureaucrats gained increasingly negative reputations throughout the second half of the 20th century. As populations grow it becomes harder for bureaucratic systems to work because it often involves a lot of paperwork, which increases processing times, which eventually will be nearly impossible to manage. The digital age and the Internet has revolutionized Bureaucrats and the modern Bureaucrat has a different skill set than before. Also, the internet lowers the corruption levels of some Bureaucratic entities such as the Police Force due to social media and [[pro–am]] journalism..

==Attributes of bureaucrats==
German sociologist [[Max Weber]] defined a bureaucratic official as the following:&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite book
|author =[[Max Weber]]
|title=Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft
|pages=650–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* He is personally free and appointed to his position on the basis of conduct.
* He exercises the authority delegated to him in accordance with impersonal rules, and his loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of his official duties.
* His appointment and job placement are dependent upon his technical qualifications.
* His administrative work is a full-time occupation.
* His work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.
* He must exercise his judgment and his skills, but his duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority. Ultimately he is responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice his personal judgment if it runs counter to his official duties.
* Bureaucratic control is the use of rules, regulations, and formal authority to guide performance. It includes such things as budgets, statistical reports, and performance appraisals to regulate behavior and results.

As an academic, [[Woodrow Wilson]], later a US President, professed in his 1887 article ''The Study of Administration'':&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Woodrow Wilson]]
|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=465
|title=The Study of Administration

{{quote|But to fear the creation of a domineering, illiberal officialism as a result of the studies I am here proposing is to miss altogether the principle upon which I wish most to insist. That principle is, that administration in the United States must be at all points sensitive to public opinion. A body of thoroughly trained officials serving during good behavior we must have in any case: that is a plain business necessity. But the apprehension that such a body will be anything un-American clears away the moment it is asked. What is to constitute good behavior? For that question obviously carries its own answer on its face. Steady, hearty allegiance to the policy of the government they serve will constitute good behavior. That policy will have no taint of officialism about it. It will not be the creation of permanent officials, but of statesmen whose responsibility to public opinion will be direct and inevitable. Bureaucracy can exist only where the whole service of the state is removed from the common political life of the people, its chiefs as well as its rank and file. Its motives, its objects, its policy, its standards, must be bureaucratic. It would be difficult to point out any examples of impudent exclusiveness and arbitrariness on the part of officials doing service under a chief of department who really served the people, as all our chiefs of departments must be made to do. It would be easy, on the other hand, to adduce other instances like that of the influence of [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein]] in Prussia, where the leadership of one statesman imbued with true public spirit transformed arrogant and perfunctory bureaux into public-spirited instruments of just government.}}

The '''Cartago Agrarian Union Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Unión Agrícola Cartaginés}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Cartago Province]], [[Costa Rica]]. 

The party was founded in 1969 by Juan Guillermo Brenes Castillo. It first contested a [[Costa Rican general election, 1970|general election]] in 1970, but received only 0.5% of the vote and failed to win a seat. In [[Costa Rican general election, 1974|1974]] support for the party more than doubled, receiving 1.2% of the vote and winning its first seat.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p174 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite seeing its share of the vote drop to 1%, the party retained its seat in the [[Costa Rican general election, 1978|1978 elections]]. However a further slump to 0.8% in [[Costa Rican general election, 1982|1982]] saw the party lose its parliamentary representation. 

It regained a seat in the [[Costa Rican general election, 1986|1986 elections]], receiving 1.2% of the national vote. The seat was retained in elections in [[Costa Rican general election, 1990|1990]] and [[Costa Rican general election, 1994|1994]], but a loss of support in the [[Costa Rican general election, 1998|1998 elections]] saw its share of the vote drop to 0.5%, resulting in it losing its solitary seat. A similar result in [[Costa Rican general election, 2002|2002]] saw the party remaining seatless.

[[File:Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations, Palais des Nations in Geneva (3).jpg|thumb|A meeting of the Conference on Disarmament in the Council Chamber of the [[Palace of Nations]].]]

The '''Conference on Disarmament''' ('''CD''') is a multilateral disarmament forum established by the [[international community]] to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements based at the [[Palais des Nations]] in Geneva. The Conference meets annually in three separate sessions in Geneva. 

==History==

The Conference was first established in 1979 as the '''Committee on Disarmament''' as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community. &lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed the '''Conference on Disarmament''' in 1984.

The Conference succeeded three other disarmament-related bodies: the [[Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (1960), the [[Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (1962–68) and the [[Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (1969–78).

The Conference was created with a permanent agenda, also known as the "Decalogue," which includes the following topics: &lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nuclear weapons in all aspects
*Other weapons of mass destruction
*Conventional weapons
*Reduction of military budgets
*Reduction of armed forces
*Disarmament and development
*Disarmament and international security
*Collateral measures; confidence building measures; effective verification methods in relation to appropriate disarmament measures, acceptable to all parties
*Comprehensive programme of disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control

Additionally, all decisions of the body must be agreed upon by consensus according to the rules and procedures of the conference. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/cd/RulesofProcedure.pdf |title=Rules of Procedure of the Conference on Disarmament|publisher=Women's International League for Peace and Freedom |website=Reaching Critical Will |access-date=May 27, 2018|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the United Nations==
The Conference is formally independent from the United Nations. &lt;ref name="Critical Will"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/disarmament-fora/others/cd|title=Conference on Disarmament|publisher= Women's International League for Peace and Freedom|website= Reaching Critical Will|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while it is not formally a UN organization, it is linked to it in various ways. First and foremost, the Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] serves as the Secretary-General of the Conference. &lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/BF18ABFEFE5D344DC1256F3100311CE9?OpenDocument|title=An Introduction to the Conference |publisher=United Nations Office at Geneva|website=United Nations Office at Geneva |access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while the Conference adopts its own rules of procedure and agenda, the [[UN General Assembly|United Nations General Assembly]] can pass resolutions recommending specific topics to the Conference. Finally, the Conference submits a report of its activities to the General Assembly yearly, or more frequently, as appropriate. &lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/conference-on-disarmament/|title=Conference on Disarmament (CD) |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative|date=January 10, 2018 |website=Nuclear Threat Initiative|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work of the Conference==
Initially, the Conference and its predecessors were successful in meeting their mandate. They were instrumental in drafting numerous arms control agreements: most importantly, the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (1968), the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (1972), the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (1993) and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (1996).&lt;ref name="Goldblat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Goldblat |first1= Jozef |date= |title= The Conference on Disarmament at the Crossroads: To Revitalize or Dissolve? |url= https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/72gold.pdf|journal= The Nonproliferation Review |volume= |issue= Summer 2000|pages= 104-107|doi= |access-date= May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the work of the body was stalled for over a decade, as members were unable to agree on a work program after the passage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Difficulties included strained relations between key players, disagreement among members on the prioritization of issues, and attempts of some countries to link progress in one area to parallel progress in other areas. &lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldblat"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite report |date= September 2009|title= Report 106: Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament|url= https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=jsct/nuclearnon_proliferation/report.htm|publisher= The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia|page=163-6|access-date= May 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 2009 a breakthrough was made by the body when it established several working groups to tackle various topics under the Conference's authority. These group focused on: negotiating a treaty banning the production of [[Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty|fissile material for nuclear weapons (FMCT)]], creating practical steps to reduce nuclear weapons, prevention of an arms race in outer space (PAROS ) and addressing negative security assurances. &lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/proposed-fissile-material-cut-off-treaty/ |title=Proposed Fissile Material (Cut-off) Treaty (FMCT) |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=May 31, 2017 |website=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/proposed-prevention-arms-race-space-paros-treaty/ |title=Proposed Prevention of an Arms Race in Space (PAROS) Treaty |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=May 31, 2017 |website=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the general dysfunction of the Conference and its limited membership, negotiations for the 2017 [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] took place at the United Nations, and not at the Conference. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/ |title=Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons|publisher=United Nations |website=United Nations Office at Geneva |access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
[[Image:CDMembers.png|thumb|300px|Members countries of the Conference on Disarmament.]]

The conference is currently composed of 65 formal members, representing all areas of the world, as well as all known [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear-weapon states]]. Additionally, members are organized into a number of informal regional groups to facilitate their preparation for, and representation in the plenary meetings of the Conference. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unog.ch/__80256ee600585943.nsf/(httpPages)/2a1de6b24c2b4aa1c1257fc400455542?|title=Regional Groups |publisher=United Nations Office at Geneva|website=United Nations Office at Geneva|access-date=May 27, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Damascus Declaration''' ({{lang-ar|إعلان دمشق}}) was a statement of unity by [[Syria]]n opposition figures issued in October 2005. It criticized the [[Politics of Syria|Syrian government]] as "authoritarian, totalitarian and cliquish," and called for "peaceful, gradual," reform "founded on accord, and based on dialogue and recognition of the other."&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and shadows, the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.232-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five-page document, unveiled at an unauthorized press conference, was signed by more than 250 "major opposition figures" as well as parties "both [[secular]] and religious, Arab and [[Kurd]]ish."&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; It was considered important that the statement included the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] group of Syria, in addition to secular groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2006/05/michel-kilo-patriot.htm Syriancomment, May 15, 2006 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="nahar"&gt;[http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/0/23F322FA392A62E4C225709D00210049?OpenDocument Opposition Groups Issue 'Damascus Declaration' for a Regime Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for a "fair solution for the Kurdish issue in Syria in a way insures the equality of Kurds with all other Syrian citizens".&lt;ref name="nahar"/&gt;

Syrian journalist and activist [[Michel Kilo]] launched the declaration, after the Syrian writer and thinker [[Abdulrazak Eid]] had written its first draft. [[Riad Seif]], another democracy activist, was the first signatory. &lt;ref name="wright"/&gt;  The "five small opposition groups" signing the declaration were the Arab nationalist [[National Democratic Rally (Syria)|National Democratic Rally]], the Kurdish Democratic Alliance, the Committees of Civil Society, the Kurdish Democratic Front and the Movement of the Future.&lt;ref name="nahar"/&gt;

Twelve members of the Damascus Declaration National Council were sentenced to two and a half years in prison in October 2008.  According to a leaked March 2009 [[diplomatic cable]], Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] responded to a comment by U.S. Senator Cardin that he could give "specific examples of citizens jailed for their political views" by saying that "we are a country in process of reform.  We aren't perfect.  You are talking about 
12 people out of 20 million.  It's a process. We are moving forward, not fast, but methodically."  He said that the members had been convicted for their "contact with an individual in Lebanon who had invited the U.S. to attack Syria.  This is against our law."  In response to Senator Cardin's suggestion that Syria adhere to international standards, Asad chuckled in reply "You do not see this (international standards) anywhere in the region," comparing the situation of half a million Palestinian refugees in Syria and saying that "if he were working against his people, he would not enjoy such popularity."

An '''emerging power''' or '''rising power''' is a term used as recognition of the rising, primarily influence of a nation—or union of nations—which has steadily increased their presence in global affairs. Such a power aspires to have a [[power in international relations|more powerful position]] or role in [[international relations]], either [[regional power|regionally]] or [[great power|globally]], and possess sufficient resources and levels of development that such goals are potentially achievable. A term also used to describe such a state is "rising power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rising+powers%2Cemerging+powers&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2010&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Crising%20powers%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cemerging%20powers%3B%2Cc0|title=Google nGram: Emerging powers vs Rising powers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising powers such as China and India may also be viewed as coincidental to the perceived decline of American hegemony in world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Regilme, Salvador Santino F Jr, and James Parisot.

== Characteristics ==
There are few available conceptualizations of the term "emerging power". Therefore, there is no standard or agreed method to decide which states are emerging powers. However a fundamental characteristic of an emerging power is that it is also an [[Emerging markets|emerging economy]], being that economic development is necessary and preliminary to political and military emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers|year=1987|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|publisher=Random House|isbn=0679-720197}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that while a country may be an emerging power, it is above anything else an emerging economy with only the potential or hope of increasing their global influence. This is because of several limiting factors, largely the seven dimensions of state power; geography, population, economy, resources, military, diplomacy and national identity.&lt;ref name="Emergingpower"&gt;{{cite book|title=The European Union and Emerging Powers in the 21st Century: How Europe Can Shape a New Global Order|date=2013|first1=Thomas|last1=Renard|first2=Sven|last2=Biscop}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, only [[great power]]s or [[superpower]]s have succeeded in all seven dimensions of state power.

The [[BRICS]]&lt;ref name="BRICS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/China_Monitor_JUNE_2010.pdf |title=The Emerging Politics of the Emerging Powers: The BRICs and the Global South |work=The China Monitor |publisher=Centre For Chinese Studies |last1=Shaw |first1=Timothy M. |last2=Cornelissen |first2=Scarlett |first3=Liliana Avendãno |last3=Miranda |last4=McDonald |first4=Matthew |location=University of Stellenbosch, South Africa |date=June 2010 |issue=52 |accessdate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204011005/http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/China_Monitor_JUNE_2010.pdf |archivedate=4 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are often cited as being emerging powers, but at varying stages of development and of varying degrees of potential. For example, [[Russia]], which was once a superpower, is now re-emerging in some aspects of state power following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]]. [[China]] and [[India]] are emerging as [[potential superpowers]], while [[Brazil]] is emerging as a possible great power.

== List of emerging powers ==
The term emerging power is often used to delineate the following countries:

[[Image:No chat.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Soviet poster: ''"Be vigilant. Even walls are listening nowadays. Chat and gossip are not far from high treason. DO NOT CHAT!"'']]

The '''First Department''' ({{lang-ru|Первый отдел}}) was in charge of secrecy and political security of the workplace of every enterprise or institution of the [[Soviet Union]] that dealt with any kind of technical or scientific information ([[factory|plant]]s, [[R&amp;D]] institutions, etc.) or had printing capabilities (e.g., [[publishing house]]s).

Every branch of the Central Statistical Administration and its successor the State Statistics Committee ([[Goskomstat]]) also had a First Department to control access, distribution, and publication of official economic, population, and social statistics.  Copies of especially sensitive documents were numbered and labeled or stamped as secret or "For official use only".  In some cases, the "official use" version of documents mimicked the public use versions in format but provided much more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;A description of the operations of the First Department within statistical offices can be found in Barbara A. Anderson, Kalev Katus, and Brian D. Silver, "Developments and Prospects for Population Statistics in Countries of the Former Soviet Union," ''Population Index'' 60, No. 1 (Spring 1994): 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first departments were a part of the [[KGB]] and not subordinated to the management of the enterprise or institution. Among its functions was control of access to information considered state secret, of foreign travel, and of publications. The First Department also kept account of the usage of copying devices ([[xerography|xerographer]]s, [[printing press]]es, [[typewriter]]s, etc.) to prevent unsanctioned copying, including [[samizdat]].

The GA is the administrative head of public services in the District. As Sri Lanka has 25 districts, there are 25 governments agents at any given time. The post is one of the oldest in the civil service as it had been established by the British during the colonial era.

The term '''Greater India''' is most commonly used to encompass the historical and geographic extent of all political entities of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the regions which are culturally linked to India or received significant Indian cultural influence. These countries have to varying degrees been transformed by the acceptance and induction of cultural and institutional elements of [[India]].  Since around 500 BCE, Asia's expanding land and [[Indian Ocean trade|maritime trade]] had resulted in prolonged socio-economic and cultural stimulation and diffusion of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs into the region's cosmology, in particular in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="Hal1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth R. Hal|title=Maritime Trade and State Development in Early Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ncqGAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=funan+mountain+kings&amp;dq=funan+mountain+kings|year=1985|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0843-3|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Central Asia]], transmission of ideas were predominantly of a religious nature.&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lettre-cdf.revues.org/756  | title= History of India and Greater India |publisher= Collège de France  | date=  |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early centuries of the [[Common Era|common era]] most of the principalities of [[Southeast Asia]] had effectively absorbed defining aspects of Hindu culture, religion and administration. The notion of divine god-kingship was introduced by the concept of [[Harihara]], Sanskrit and other Indian [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] systems were declared [[official script|official]], like those of the south Indian [[Pallava dynasty]] and [[Chalukya dynasty]].&lt;ref name="academia edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2635407/As_in_Heaven_So_on_Earth_The_Politics_of_Visnu_Siva_and_Harihara_Images_in_Preangkorian_Khmer_Civilisation | title= As in Heaven, So on Earth: The Politics of Visnu Siva and Harihara Images in Preangkorian Khmer Civilisation | publisher= academia edu  |date= |accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/stark/pdfs/AP1999%20article.pdf |title=Results of the 1995–1996 Archaeological Field Investigations at Angkor Borei, Cambodia |publisher=University of Hawai'i-Manoa |date=  |accessdate=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Indianized Kingdoms, a term coined by [[George Cœdès]] in his work ''Histoire ancienne des états hindouisés d'Extrême-Orient'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The indianized states of Southeast Asia|date=1968|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=082480368X}}&lt;/ref&gt; were characterized by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Yves Manguin, "From Funan to Sriwijaya: Cultural continuities and discontinuities in the Early Historical maritime states of Southeast Asia", in ''25 tahun kerjasama Pusat Penelitian Arkeologi dan Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient,'' Jakarta, Pusat Penelitian Arkeologi / EFEO, 2002, p. 59-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north, Indian religious ideas were accepted into the cosmology of Himalayan peoples, most profoundly in Tibet and Bhutan. Buddhist monasticism extended into Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and other parts of Central Asia, and Buddhist texts and ideas were readily accepted in China and Japan in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ARTH406-Historical-Overview-of-Chinese-Buddhism-FINAL.pdf |title=Buddhism in China: A Historical Overview |publisher=The Saylor Foundation 1 |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west, Indian culture converged with [[Greater Persia]] via the [[Hindukush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp066_india_china.pdf  | title= SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS  everyone knows well the so-called "Buddhist conquest of China" or "Indianized China" |publisher= sino-platonic  | date=  |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the ''Three Indias'' was in common circulation in pre-industrial Europe. ''Greater India'' was the southern part of South Asia, ''Lesser India'' was the northern part of South Asia, and ''Middle India'' was the region near the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Phillips1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=J.

However, in some accounts of European nautical voyages, Greater India (or ''India Major'') extended from the [[Malabar Coast]] (present-day [[Kerala]]) to ''India extra Gangem''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wheatley|1982|p=13}} Quote: "Subsequently the whole area came to be identified with one of the "Three Indies," though whether ''India Major'' or ''Minor, Greater'' or ''Lesser, Superior'' or ''Inferior'', seems often to have been a personal preference of the author concerned. When Europeans began to penetrate into Southeast Asia in earnest, they continued this tradition, attaching to various of the constituent territories such labels as Further India or Hinterindien, the East Indies, the Indian Archipelago, Insulinde, and, in acknowledgment of the presence of a competing culture, Indochina."&lt;/ref&gt; (lit. "India, beyond the Ganges," but usually the [[East Indies]], i.e. present-day [[Malay Archipelago]]) and ''India Minor'', from Malabar to [[Sindh|Sind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Caverhill|1767}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Farther India'' was sometimes used to cover all of modern Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=gindia/&gt; Until the fourteenth century, India could also mean areas along the Red Sea, including Somalia, South Arabia, and Ethiopia (e.g., Diodorus of Sicily of the first century BCE says that "the Nile rises in India" and Marco Polo of the fourteenth century says that "Lesser India ... contains ... Abash [Abyssinia]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uhlig |first=Siegbert |date=2003 |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC |publisher=Isd |page=145 |isbn=978-3-447-05607-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 19th-century geography, ''Greater India'' referred to [[British India]], [[Hindustan]] (Northwestern Subcontinent) which included the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], the [[Himalaya]]s, and extended eastwards to [[Indochina]] (including Tibet and Burma), parts of Indonesia (namely, the [[Sunda Islands]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]), and the [[Philippines]]."&lt;ref name=geography19cent&gt;"Review: New Maps," (1912) ''Bulletin of the American Geographical Society'' 44(3): 235–240.&lt;/ref&gt; German atlases distinguished ''Vorder-Indien'' (Anterior India) as the South Asian peninsula and ''Hinter-Indien'' as Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=gindia/&gt;

===Geology===
''Greater India'', or ''Greater India Basin'' signifies "the [[Indian Plate]] plus a postulated northern extension", the product of the ''Indian–Asia collision''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Ali|Aitchison|2005|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its usage in geology pre-dates [[Plate tectonic]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Argand, E., 1924. La tectonique de l' Asie. Proc. 13th Int. Geol. Cong. 7 (1924), 171–372.&lt;/ref&gt; the term has seen increased usage since the 1970s.

It is unknown when and where the India–Asia (Indian and [[Eurasian Plate]]) convergence occurred, at or before 52 Million years ago.  The plates have converged up to {{convert|3600|km|mi|abbr=on}} ± {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The upper crustal shortening is documented from geological record of Asia and the Himalaya as up to approximately {{convert|2350|km|mi|abbr=on}} less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthdynamics.org/papers-ED/2012/2012-vanHinsbergen-etal-PNAS.pdf | title= The Greater India Basin hypothesis |publisher= University of Oslo  | date=  |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist movement===
Here the use of ''Greater India'' refers to a popularization by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based ''Greater India Society''.  The movement's early leaders included the historian [[R. C. Majumdar]] (1888–1980), the philologists [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] (1890–1977) and [[Prabodh Chandra Bagchi|P. C. Bagchi]] (1898–1956), and the historians Phanindranath Bose and [[Kalidas Nag]] (1891–1966).&lt;ref name="Bayley 2004 710"&gt;{{Harv|Bayley|2004|p=710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Greater India'', whether aligned or separate from the notion of ancient Hindu expansion into Southeast Asia, was linked to both [[Indian nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Keenleyside|1982|pp=213–214}} Quote: "Starting in the 1920s under the leadership of Kalidas Nag - and continuing even after independence - a number of Indian scholars wrote extensively and rapturously about the ancient Hindu cultural expansion into and colonisation of South and Southeast Asia.  They called this vast region "Greater India" – for a region which had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. Indeed, Congress leaders made occasional references to Greater India while the organisation's abiding interest in the problems of overseas Indians lent indirect support to the Indian hope of restoring the cultural and spiritual unity of South and Southeast Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Thapar|1968|pp=326–330}} Quote: "At another level, it was believed that the dynamics of many Asian cultures, particularly those of Southeast Asia, arose from Hindu culture, and the theory of Greater India derived sustenance from Pan-Hinduism. A curious pride was taken in the supposed imperialist past of India, as expressed in sentiments such as these: "The art of Java and Kambuja was no doubt derived from India and fostered by the Indian rulers of these colonies." (Majumdar, R. C. et al. (1950), ''An Advanced History of India'', London: Macmillan, p. 221)  "&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron Age trade expansion caused regional [[Geostrategy|geostrategic]] remodeling. Southeast Asia was now situated in the central area of convergence of the Indian and the East Asian maritime trade routes, the basis for economic and cultural growth. The earliest Hindu kingdoms emerged in Sumatra and Java, followed by mainland polities such as Funan and Champa. Adoption of Indian civilization elements and individual adaptation stimulated the emergence of centralized states and the development of highly organized societies. Ambitious local leaders realized the benefits of Hinduism and Indian methods of administration, culture, literature, etc. Rule in accord with universal moral principles, represented in the concept of the ''[[devaraja]]'', was more appealing than the Chinese concept of intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTEeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=Indianized+kingdoms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YwOaHr8LA&amp;sig=s3zbExmgU4vTGYBfbTY-Xa9QzME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWwPTNjYLRAhXIOJQKHQr8C84Q6AEIXDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Indianized%20kingdoms&amp;f=false | title= Societies, Networks, and Transitions, Volume I: To 1500: A Global History | publisher= Google Books |date= | accessdate=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |title=The Mon-Dvaravati Tradition of Early North-Central Thailand |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mond/hd_mond.htm|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Amitav Acharya |title=Southeast Asia: Imagining the region |url=http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Southeast%20Asia%20Imagining%20the%20Region.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from colonialism===
Indianization is different from direct colonialism in that these Indianized lands were not inhabited by organizations from the Indian subcontinent, 
with exceptions such as the [[South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I|Chola invasions]] of medieval times. Instead, Indian cultural influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points the influence was used to take over. Indianization was seen as total influence of all aspects of Southeast Asian history. Before the take over of the influence of Indian culture, Southeast Asia was seen as a place with no history. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of the cultural commencement in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giang|first1=Do Truong|title=Historiography of the "Indianization" in Ancient Southeast Asian History|url=https://campapura.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/indianization-in-southeast-asian-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Indianization===
{{Further information|Indianization of Southeast Asia}}
As conclusive evidence is missing numerous Indianization theories of [[Southeast Asia]] have emerged since the early 20th century. The central argument usually revolves around the  question, who was the main propagator exporting Indian institutional and cultural ideas to Southeast Asia.

One theory of the spread of Indianization that focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] [[Sadhaba|traders]] and their role for spreading Indian culture and language into Southeast Asia through trade. There were many trade incentives that brought Vaishya traders to Southeast Asia, the most important of which was gold. During the 4th century C.E., when the first evidence of Indian trader in Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]]. This made many Vaishya traders look to the seas to acquire new gold, of which Southeast Asia was abundant. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes.&lt;ref name=lukas/&gt;

Another theory states that Indianization spread through the warrior class of [[Kshatriya]]. This hypothesis effectively explains state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory hasn't attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.&lt;ref name=lukas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=May 21, 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585/THEORIES_OF_INDIANIZATION_Exemplified_by_Selected_Case_Studies_from_Indonesia_Insular_Southeast_Asia_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahman]] scholars. These Brahmans brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions and spread them to the elite classes of Southeast Asian polities. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmans were also experts in art and architecture, and political affairs, thus explaining the adoption of many Indian style law codes and architecture into Southeast Asian society&lt;ref name=lukas/&gt;

===Literature===
Scripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Monica L.|title="INDIANIZATION" FROM THE INDIAN POINT OF VIEW:  TRADE AND CULTURAL CONTACTS WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA  IN THE EARLY FIRST MILLENNIUM C.E.')|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient,|date=1999|volume=42.|issue=11–17|jstor=3632296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes.  Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of "God King" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=coedes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date=1967|publisher=Australian National University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as "reincarnations or descendants" of the Hindu Gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.

===Religion, authority and legitimacy===
The pre-Indic political and social systems in Southeast Asia were marked by a relative indifference towards lineage descent. Hindu God kingship enabled rulers to supersede loyalties, forge cosmopolitan polities and the worship of Shiva and Vishnu was combined with ancestor worship, so that Khmer, Javanese, and Cham rulers claimed semi-divine status as descendants of a God. Hindu traditions, especially the relationship to the sacrality of the land and social structures, are inherent in Hinduism's transnational features. The epic traditions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa further legitimized a ruler identified with a God who battled and defeated the wrong doers that threaten the ethical order of the world.&lt;ref name="oxford press"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0112.xml | title= Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Oxford Press |date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism does not have a single historical founder, a centralized imperial authority in India proper nor a bureaucratic structure, thus ensuring relative religious independence for the individual ruler. It also allows for multiple forms of divinity, centered upon the [[Trimurti]] the triad of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the deities responsible for the creation, preservation, and destruction of the universe.&lt;ref name="Ramirez-Faria2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos Ramirez-Faria|title=Concise Encyclopedia Of World History The "King of the mountain"|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gGKsS-9h4BYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=funan+mountain+kings#v=onepage&amp;q=funan%20mountain%20kings&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0775-5|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dancing Shiva 10th c.jpg|thumb|The 10th-century [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the dancing [[Shiva]] in [[Champa]], Vietnam]]
The effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleinmeyer|first1=Cindy|title=Religions of Southeast Asia|url=https://www.niu.edu/cseas/_pdf/lesson-plans/k-12/origins-religion.pdf|website=niu.edu|publisher=Northern Illinois University | accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals.

[[Champa]], [[Dvaravati]], [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Early history of Kedah|Kadaram]], [[Kalingga]], [[Kutai]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]], [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|Pan Pan]], [[History of Brunei|Po-ni]], and [[Tarumanagara]] had by the 1st to 4th centuries CE adopted Hinduism's cosmology and rituals,  the ''[[devaraja]]'' concept of kingship, and Sanskrit as official writing. Despite the fundamental cultural integration, these kingdoms were autonomous in their own right and functioned independently.&lt;ref name="Brannon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnam's Champa Kingdom Marches on|first=Vrndavan Brannon |last=Parker|work=Hinduism Today |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5491|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste system===
The caste system divides Hindus into a hierarchy of groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma).  The [[Manusmriti]], an ancient authoritative book on Hindu law, maintained that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. Once born into a group, one can not move to different levels. Lower castes are never able to climb higher within the caste system, limiting the economies progress from growing. The system divides Hindus into four categories – Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (rulers and warriors), Vaishyas (merchants and farmers), and Shudras (craftsmen and labourers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Is India's Caste System?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to Southeast Asia, beginning the Hindu and Buddhist cultures there. They introduced the caste system to the region, especially to Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. The adopted caste system was not as strict as in India, tempered to the local context.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt; There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt;

===Adaption and adoption===
It is unknown how immigration, interaction, and settlement took place, whether by key figures from India or through Southeast Asians visiting India who took elements of Indian culture back home. It is likely that Hindu and Buddhist traders, priests, and princes traveled to Southeast Asia from India in the first few centuries of the Common Era and eventually settled there. Strong impulse most certainly came from the region's ruling classes who invited Brahmans to serve at their courts as priests, astrologers and advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/The-spread-of-Hinduism-in-Southeast-Asia-and-the-Pacific | title=The spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |date= | accessdate=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Divinity and royalty were closely connected in these polities as Hindu rituals validated the powers of the monarch. Brahmans and priests from India proper played a key role in supporting ruling dynasties through exact rituals. Dynastic consolidation was the basis for more centralized kingdoms that emerged in Java, Sumatra, Cambodia, Burma, and along the central and south coasts of Vietnam from the 4th to 8th centuries.&lt;ref name="Chenla - 550-800"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/history-chenla.htm    |title= Chenla - 550-800  | publisher= Global Security  |date=   |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art, architecture, rituals, and cultural elements such as the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata had been adopted and customized increasingly with a regional character. The caste system, although adopted, was never applied universally and reduced to serve for a selected group of nobles only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hinduism-southeast-asia | title=Hinduism in Southeast Asia | publisher= Encyclopedia |date= | accessdate=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States such as [[Srivijaya]], [[Majapahit]] and the [[Khmer empire]] had territorial continuity, resilient population and surplus economies that rivaled those in India itself. [[Borobudur]] in Java and [[Angkor]] in Cambodia are, apart from their grandeur, examples of a distinctly developed regional culture, style, and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/sozant/files/working_papers/suedostasien/soa001.pdf Theories of Indianisation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224064227/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/sozant/files/working_papers/suedostasien/soa001.pdf |date=24 December 2015 }} Exemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia), by Dr. Helmut Lukas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/isa/files/working_papers/suedostasien/soa001.pdf |title=THEORIES OF INDIANIZATION Exemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia) |publisher=Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften|date=  |author=Helmut Lukas |accessdate= January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural and trading relations between the powerful [[Chola dynasty]] of [[South India]] and the Southeast Asian Hindu kingdoms led the [[Bay of Bengal]] to be called "The Chola Lake", and the Chola attacks on Srivijaya in the 10th century CE are the sole example of military attacks by Indian rulers against Southeast Asia. The [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] of [[Bengal]], which controlled the heartland of Buddhist India, maintained close economic, cultural and religious ties, particularly with Srivijaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.plala.or.jp/seareview/newpage6Sri2011Chaiya.html |title=Śrīvijaya―towards ChaiyaーThe History of Srivijaya |author=Takashi Suzuki |date=25 December 2012 |work  = |publisher= |accessdate =6 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]''': Funan was a polity that encompassed the southernmost part of the [[Indochina|Indochinese peninsula]] during the 1st to 6th centuries. The name ''Funan'' is not found in any texts of local origin from the period, and so is considered an [[exonym]] based on the accounts of two Chinese diplomats, [[Kang Tai]] and Zhu Ying who sojourned there in the mid-3rd century CE.&lt;ref name=Higham&gt;Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|9781842125847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} It is not known what name the people of Funan gave to their polity. Some scholars believe ancient Chinese scholars transcribed the word Funan from a word related to the Khmer word bnaṃ or vnaṃ (modern: phnoṃ, meaning "mountain"); while others thought that Funan may not be a transcription at all, rather it meant what it says in Chinese, meaning something like "Pacified South".

* '''[[Tarumanagara]]''' was an early Sundanese Indianized kingdom, located not far from modern Jakarta, and according to Tugu inscription ruler Purnavarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement. In his inscriptions, Purnavarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.
* '''[[Kalingga Kingdom|Kalingga]]''': Kalingga (Javanese: Karajan Kalingga) was the 6th century Indianized kingdom on the north coast of Central Java, Indonesia. It was the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in Central Java, and together with Kutai and Tarumanagara are the oldest kingdoms in Indonesian history.
* '''[[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]]''' was a classical Southeast Asian kingdom. The primary sources for much of the information on the kingdom are the New History of the Tang, and the memoirs of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing who visited in 671 CE, and states that it was "absorbed" by Srivijaya by 692 CE, but had "broken away" by the end of the eleventh century according to Chao Jukua. The exact location of the kingdom is the subject of studies among historians.
* '''[[Srivijaya]]''': From the 7th to 13th centuries Srivijaya, a maritime empire centered on the island of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers from Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa to the [[Sailendra]]s. A stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. I Ching reports that the kingdom was home to more than a thousand Buddhist scholars. A notable Buddhist scholar of local origin, [[Dharmakirti]], taught Buddhist philosophy in Srivijaya and [[Nalanda]] (in India), and was the teacher of [[Atisha]]. Most of the time, this Buddhist [[ethnic Malay|Malay]] empire enjoyed cordial relationship with China and the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Bengal]], and the 860 CE [[Nalanda inscription]] records that Maharaja [[Balaputra]] dedicated a monastery at [[Nalanda|Nalanda university]] near Pala territory. The Srivijaya kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the Javanese, Singhasari, and Majapahit empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=87|title=Thailand's World :    The Srivijaya Kingdom in Thailand|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Tambralinga]]''' was an ancient kingdom located on the Malay Peninsula that at one time came under the influence of Srivijaya. The name had been forgotten until scholars recognized Tambralinga as Nagara Sri Dharmaraja (Nakhon Si Thammarat). Early records are scarce but its duration is estimated to range from the seventh to the fourteenth century. Tambralinga first sent tribute to the emperor of the Tang dynasty in 616 CE. In Sanskrit, Tambra means "red" and linga means "symbol", typically representing the divine energy of Shiva.
* '''[[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]]''': The Medang i Bhumi Mataram Kingdom flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was first centered in central Java before moving later to east Java. This kingdom produced numbers of Hindu-Buddhist temples in Java, including [[Borobudur]] Buddhist mandala and the [[Prambanan]] [[Trimurti]] Hindu temple dedicated mainly to [[Shiva]]. The [[Sailendra]]s were the ruling family of this kingdom at an earlier stage in central Java, before being replaced by the [[Isyana Dynasty]].
* '''[[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]]''': In the 10th century, Mataram challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020–1050), the kingdom split on his death; the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java, became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries, spreading its influence to the eastern parts of Southeast Asia. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming increasingly important, as demand from European countries grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or "Spice Islands") in Indonesia, and so Kediri became a strong trading nation.
* '''[[Singhasari]]''': In the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. By the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.
* '''[[Majapahit]]''': The Majapahit empire, centered in East Java, succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire and flourished in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 15th centuries. Noted for their naval expansion, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] spanned west-east from Lamuri in [[Aceh]] to Wanin in [[West Papua (province)|Papua]]. Majapahit was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Most of [[Bali]]nese Hindu culture, traditions and civilisations were derived from Majapahit legacy. A large number of Majapahit nobles, priests, and artisans found their home in Bali after the decline of Majapahit to [[Demak Sultanate]].
* '''[[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]]''' was an ancient Hindu kingdom in the eastern Tatar Pasundan (now west Java province and Banyumasan region of central Java province), Indonesia. It was established following the collapse of the Tarumanagara kingdom around the 7th century. Traditionally the kingdom of Galuh was associated with the eastern Priangan cultural region, around the [[Citanduy]] and Cimanuk rivers, with its territory spanning from Citarum river on the west, to the Pamali (present-day Brebes river) and Serayu rivers on the east. Its capital was located in Kawali, near present-day Ciamis city.
* '''[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]''': The Kingdom of Sunda was a Hindu kingdom located in western Java from 669 CE to around 1579 CE, covering the area of present-day Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and the western part of Central Java. According to primary historical records, the Bujangga Manik manuscript, the eastern border of the Sunda Kingdom was the Pamali River (Ci Pamali, the present day Brebes River) and the Serayu River (Ci Sarayu) in Central Java.

===Issues with Indianization===
====Development in Southeast Asia====
One of the major issues with Indianization is the common debate whether or not indianization is the reason for the development in South East Asia. Many struggle to date and determine when colonization in Southeast Asia occurred because of the structures and ruins found that were similar to those in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia|date=1964|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several books and anthropologists believe that India is seen as the superior culture that influenced a lot of Southeast Asian countries. However, throughout this time that many began to debate, other anthropologists suggested that Southeast Asia had indigenous civilization and the idea of indianization was just seen as a 'national motivation. These debates continued for some time, until the Pacific War, which led to legitimately ending the debates and reviewing Southeast Asia's response to Indianzation.

====Development of caste system====
Another main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt;

===Fall of Indianization===
====Khmer Kingdom====
Beginning shortly after the 12th century, the Khmer kingdom, one of the first kingdoms that began the dissipation of Indianization started after Jayavarman VII in which expanded a substantial amount of territory, thus going into war with Champs.  Leading into the fall of the Khmer Kingdom, the Khmer political and cultural zones were taken, overthrown, and fallen as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehman|first1=Don|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of Southeast Asia's Empires|date=2015|publisher=Lulu|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Indianization change many cultural and political aspects, but it also changed the spiritual realm as well, creating a type of Northern Culture which began in the early 14th century,  prevalent for its rapid decline in the Indian kingdoms. The decline of Hinduism kingdoms and spark of Buddhist kingdoms led to the formation of orthodox Sinhalese Buddhism and is a key factor leading to the decline of Indianization. Sukhothai and Ceylon are the prominent characters who formulated the center of Buddhism and this became more popularized over Hinduism.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt;

====Rise of Islam====
Not only was the spark of Buddhism the driving force for Indianization coming to an end, but Islamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islamism coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt; Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.&lt;ref name="coedes" /&gt;

==Indian cultural sphere==
{{Further information|Indosphere}}
[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]
The use of ''Greater India'' to refer to an Indian cultural sphere was popularised by a network of Bengali scholars in the 1920s who were all members of the Calcutta-based Greater India Society.  The movement's early leaders included the historian [[R. C. Majumdar]] (1888–1980); the philologists [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] (1890–1977) and [[Prabodh Chandra Bagchi|P. C. Bagchi]] (1898–1956), and the historians [[Phanindranath Bose]] and [[Kalidas Nag]] (1891–1966).&lt;ref name="Bayley 2004 710" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ram Gopal and K. V. Paliwal, ''Hindu renaissance'', page 83, Hindu Writers Forum, 2005 Quote: "Colonial and Cultural Expansion (of Ancient India)",{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Could not find this with Google Books. Is this a book, or a scientific paper, or a chapter title?--&gt; written by R. C. Majumdar, concluded with: "We may conclude with a broad survey of the Indian colonies in the Far East.  For nearly fifteen hundred years, and down to a period when the Hindus had lost their independence in their own home, Hindu kings were ruling over Indo-China and the numerous islands of the Indian Archipelago, from Sumatra to New Guinea.  Indian religion, Indian culture, Indian laws and Indian government moulded the lives of the primitive races all over this wide region, and they imbibed a more elevated moral spirit and a higher intellectual taste through the religion, art, and literature of India.  In short, the people were lifted to a higher plane of civilisation."&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their formulations were inspired by concurrent excavations in [[Angkor]] by French archaeologists and by the writings of French [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Sylvain Lévi]].  The scholars of the society postulated a benevolent ancient Indian cultural colonisation of Southeast Asia, in stark contrast — in their view — to the Western colonialism of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bayley|2004|p=712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review by 'SKV' of ''The Hindu Colony of Cambodia'' by Phanindranath Bose [Adyar, Madras: Theosophical Publishing House 1927] in The Vedic Magazine and Gurukula Samachar 26: 1927, pp. 620–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyne Bansat-Boudon, Roland Lardinois, and Isabelle Ratié, ''Sylvain Lévi (1863-1935)'', page 196, Brepols, 2007, {{ISBN|9782503524474}} Quote: "The ancient Hindus of yore were not simply a spiritual people, always busy with mystical problems and never troubling themselves with the questions of 'this world'... India also has its Napoleons and Charlemagnes, its Bismarcks and Machiavellis. But the real charm of Indian history does not consist in these aspirants after universal power, but in its peaceful and benevolent Imperialism — a unique thing in the history of mankind. The colonisers of India did not go with sword and fire in their hands; they used... the weapons of their superior culture and religion... The Buddhist age has attracted special attention, and the French savants have taken much pains to investigate the splendid monuments of the Indian cultural empire in the Far East."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:006 Bujang Valley Candi.jpg|thumb|left|Candi Bukit Batu Pahat of [[Bujang Valley]]. A [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] kingdom ruled ancient [[Kedah]] possibly as early as 110 CE, the earliest evidence of strong Indian influence which was once prevalent among the [[Kedahan Malay]]s.]]
The term ''Greater India'' and the notion of an explicit Hindu expansion of ancient Southeast Asia have been linked to both [[Indian nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Keenleyside|1982|pp=213–214}} Quote: "Starting in the 1920s under the leadership of Kalidas Nag - and continuing even after independence - a number of Indian scholars wrote extensively and rapturously about the ancient Hindu cultural expansion into and colonisation of South and Southeast Asia.  They called this vast region "Greater India" – a dubious appellation for a region which to a limited degree, but with little permanence, had been influenced by Indian religion, art, architecture, literature and administrative customs. As a consequence of this renewed and extensive interest in Greater India, many Indians came to believe that the entire South and Southeast Asian region formed the cultural progeny of India; now that the sub-continent was reawakening, they felt, India would once again assert its non-political ascendancy over the area.... While the idea of reviving the ancient Greater India was never officially endorsed by the Indian National Congress, it enjoyed considerable popularity in nationalist Indian circles. Indeed, Congress leaders made occasional references to Greater India while the organisation's abiding interest in the problems of overseas Indians lent indirect support to the Indian hope of restoring the alleged cultural and spiritual unity of South and Southeast Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Thapar|1968|pp=326–330}} Quote: "At another level, it was believed that the dynamics of many Asian cultures, particularly those of Southeast Asia, arose from Hindu culture, and the theory of Greater India derived sustenance from Pan-Hinduism. A curious pride was taken in the supposed imperialist past of India, as expressed in sentiments such as these: "The art of Java and Kambuja was no doubt derived from India and fostered by the Indian rulers of these colonies." (Majumdar, R. C. et al. (1950), ''An Advanced History of India'', London: Macmillan, p. 221)  This form of historical interpretation, which can perhaps best be described as being inspired by Hindu nationalism, remains an influential school of thinking in present historical writings."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Indian nationalists, like [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], although receptive to "an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bayley|2004|pp=735–736}} Quote:"The Greater India visions which Calcutta thinkers derived from French and other sources are still known to educated anglophone Indians, especially but not exclusively Bengalis from the generation brought up in the traditions of post-Independence Nehruvian secular nationalism.  One key source of this knowledge is a warm tribute paid to [[Sylvain Lévi]] and his ideas of an expansive, civilising India by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, in his celebrated book, ''The Discovery of India'', which was written during one of Nehru's periods of imprisonment by the British authorities, first published in 1946, and reprinted many times since.... The ideas of both Lévi and the Greater India scholars were known to Nehru through his close intellectual links with Tagore. Thus Lévi's notion of ancient Indian voyagers leaving their invisible 'imprints' throughout east and southeast Asia was for Nehru a recapitulation of Tagore's vision of nationhood, that is an idealisation of India as a benign and uncoercive world civiliser and font of global enlightenment. This was clearly a perspective which defined the Greater India phenomenon as a process of religious and spiritual tutelage, but it was not a Hindu supremacist idea of India's mission to the lands of the trans-gangetic ''Sarvabhumi'' or ''Bharat Varsha''."&lt;/ref&gt; stayed away from explicit "Greater India" formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Narasimhaiah|1986}} Quote: "To him (Nehru), the so-called practical approach meant, in practice, shameless expediency, and so he would say, "the sooner we are not practical, the better".  He rebuked a Member of Indian Parliament who sought to revive the concept of ''Greater India'' by saying that 'the honorable Member lived in the days of Bismarck; Bismarck is dead, and his politics more dead!'  He would consistently plead for an idealistic approach and such power as the language wields is the creation of idealism—politics' arch enemy—which, however, liberates the leader of a national movement from narrow nationalism, thus igniting in the process a dead fact of history, in the sneer, "For him the Bastille has not fallen!" Though Nehru was not to the language born, his utterances show a remarkable capacity for introspection and sense of moral responsibility in commenting on political processes."&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some scholars have seen the Hindu/Buddhist acculturation in ancient Southeast Asia as "a single cultural process in which Southeast Asia was the matrix and South Asia the mediatrix."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wheatley|1982|pp=27–28}} Quote: "The tide of revisionism that is currently sweeping through Southeast Asian historiography has in effect taken us back almost to the point where we have to consider reevaluating almost every text bearing on the protohistoric period and many from later times. Although this may seem a daunting proposition, it is nonetheless supremely worth attempting, for the process by which the peoples of western Southeast Asia came to think of themselves as part of ''Bharatavarsa'' (even though they had no conception of "India" as we know it) represents one of the most impressive instances of large-scale acculturation in the history of the world. [[Sylvain Levi]] was perhaps overenthusiastic when he claimed that India produced her definitive masterpieces — he was thinking of Angkor and the Borobudur — through the efforts of foreigners or on foreign soil.  Those masterpieces were not strictly Indian achievements: rather were they the outcome of a Eutychian fusion of natures so melded together as to constitute a single cultural process in which Southeast Asia was the matrix and South Asia the mediatrix."&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of art history, especially in American writings, the term survived due to the influence of art theorist [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]. Coomaraswamy's view of pan-Indian art history was influenced by the "Calcutta cultural nationalists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Guha-Thakurta|1992|pp=159–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By some accounts Greater India consists of "lands including Burma, [[Philippines]], [[Java]], Cambodia, [[Bali]], and the former [[Champa]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] polities of present-day [[Vietnam]],"&lt;ref name="bayley2004-p713"/&gt; in which Indian and Hindu culture left an "imprint in the form of monuments, inscriptions and other traces of the historic "[[Sanskritization|Indianizing]]" process."&lt;ref name="bayley2004-p713"&gt;{{Harv|Bayley|2004|p=713}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some other accounts, many Pacific societies and "most of the Buddhist world including [[Ceylon]], Tibet, Central Asia, and even Japan were held to fall within this web of Indianizing ''culture colonies''"&lt;ref name="bayley2004-p713" /&gt;  This particular usage — implying cultural "sphere of influence" of India — was promoted by the [[Greater India Society]], formed by a group of [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Man of letters|men of letters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Handy|1930|p=364}} Quote: "An equally significant movement is one that brought about among the Indian intelligentsia of Calcutta a few years ago the formation of what is known as the "Greater India Society," whose membership is open "to all serious students of the Indian cultural expansion and to all sympathizers of such studies and activities." Though still in its infancy, this organisation has already a large membership, due perhaps as much as anything else to the enthusiasm of its Secretary and Convener, Dr. Kalidas Nag, whose scholarly affiliations with the Orientalists in the University of Paris and studies in Indochina, Insulindia and beyond, have equipped him in an unusual way for the work he has chosen, namely stimulating interest in and spreading knowledge of Greater Indian culture of the past, present and future. The Society's President is Professor [[Jadunath Sarkar]], Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University, and its Council is made up largely of professors on the faculty of the University and members of the staff of the Calcutta Museum, as well as of Indian authors and journalists. Its activities have included illustrated lecture series at the various universities throughout India by Dr. Nag, the assembling of a research library, and the publication of monographs of which four very excellent examples have already been printed: 1)''Greater India'', by Kalidas Nag, M.A., D.Litt(Paris), 2) ''India and China'', by Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, M.A., D.Litt., 3) ''Indian Culture in Java and Sumatra'', by Bijan Raj Chatterjee, D.Litt. (Punjab), Ph.D. (London), and 4) ''India and Central Asia'', by Niranjan Prasad Chakravarti, M.A., Ph.D.(Cantab.)."&lt;/ref&gt; and is not found before the 1920s. The term ''Greater India'' was used in historical writing in India into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Majumdar|1960|pp=222–223}}&lt;!--this book was written in 1960, so how can it cite examples of what occurred in the 1970s?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture spread via the trade routes that linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Siam]], the [[Malay peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]] to [[Java]], [[Philippines]], lower [[Cambodia]] and [[Champa]]. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature. Southeast Asia had developed some prosperous and very powerful colonial empires that contributed to Hindu-Buddhist artistic creations and architectural developments. Art and architectural creations that rivaled those built in India, especially in its sheer size, design and aesthetic achievements. The notable examples are Borobudur in Java and Angkor monuments in Cambodia. The Srivijaya Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence in the region.

A defining characteristic of the cultural link between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent was the adoption of ancient Indian [[Vedic period|Vedic]]/Hindu and Buddhist culture and philosophy into [[Philippines]], [[Myanmar]], [[Tibet]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Laos]] and Cambodia. Indian scripts are found in Southeast Asian islands ranging from Sumatra, Java, Bali, South Sulawesi and part of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haspelmath, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCRcARRN9nsC&amp;pg=PA569 The World Atlas of Language Structures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529081333/https://books.google.com/books?id=sCRcARRN9nsC&amp;pg=PA569 |date=29 May 2016 }}, page 569, Oxford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-925591-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] have had a large impact on South Asia and Southeast Asia. One of the most tangible evidence of dharmic Hindu traditions is the widespread use of the ''[[Añjali Mudrā]]'' gesture of greeting and respect. It is seen in the [[Culture of India|Indian]] ''[[namasté]]'' and similar gestures known throughout Southeast Asia; its cognates include the [[Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian]] ''[[sampeah]]'', the [[Indonesian culture|Indonesian]] ''[[sembah]]'', the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] ''[[Buddhist terms and concepts#G|gassho]]'' and [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] [[Thai greeting|''wai'']].

===Architecture and monuments===
* The same style of [[Hindu temple architecture]] was used in several ancient temples in South East Asia including [[Angkor Wat]], which was dedicated to Hindu god [[Vishnu]] and is shown on the [[flag of Cambodia]], also [[Prambanan]] in Central Java, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia, is dedicated to [[Trimurti]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]].
* [[Borobudur]] in Central Java, Indonesia, is the world's largest Buddhist monument. It took shape of a giant stone [[mandala]] crowned with [[stupa]]s and believed to be the combination of Indian-origin Buddhist ideas with the previous [[megalithic]] tradition of native [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[step pyramid]].

Scholars like Sheldon Pollock have used the term ''Sanskrit Cosmopolis'' to describe the region and argued for millennium-long cultural exchanges without necessarily involving migration of peoples or colonisation. Pollock's 2006 book ''The Language of the Gods in the World of Men'' makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.

Scripts in [[Sanskrit]] discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.

Sanskrit and related languages have also influenced their [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking neighbors to the north through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van Gulik|1956|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The spread of Buddhism to Tibet allowed many Sanskrit texts to survive only in Tibetan translation (in the [[Tanjur]]).  Buddhism was similarly introduced to China by [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] missionaries sent by the Indian Emperor Ashoka mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] and Classical Sanskrit texts, and many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary.

In Southeast Asia, languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] contain many [[loan word]]s from Sanskrit, as does [[Khmer language|Khmer]] to a lesser extent. For example, in Thai, [[Ravana|Rāvaṇa]], the legendary emperor of [[Sri Lanka]], is called 'Thosakanth' which is derived from his Sanskrit name 'Daśakaṇṭha' ("having ten necks").

Many Sanskrit loanwords are also found in [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] particularly the [[Old Javanese|old form]] from which nearly half the vocabulary is derived from the language.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:id: Daftar kata serapan dari bahasa Sansekerta dalam bahasa Indonesia|this page]] from the [[Indonesian Wikipedia]] for a list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zoetmulder|1982|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|traditional Malay]], [[Indonesian language|modern Indonesian]], also derive [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|much of their vocabulary]] from Sanskrit, albeit to a lesser extent, with a large proportion of words being derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Similarly, [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] have [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Sanskrit|many Sanskrit loanwords]].

A Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word ''[[Indonesian language|bhāṣā]]'', or spoken language, which is used to mean language in general, for example ''bahasa'' in Malay, Indonesian and [[Tausug language|Tausug]], ''basa'' in Javanese, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], ''phasa'' in Thai and Lao, ''bhasa'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and ''phiesa'' in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].

The utilization of [[Sanskrit]] has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. [[Sanskrit]] terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of "God King" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date=1967|publisher=Australian National University Press|page=98|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/115019/2/b11055005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of [[Vietnam]] once embraced the [[Sanskrit]] dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as "reincarnations or descendants" of the [[Hindu]] gods. However once [[Buddhism]] began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.

===Linguistic commonalities===
* In the [[Malay Archipelago]]: [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] have absorbed a large amount of [[Sanskrit]] loanwords into their respective lexicons  (see: [[List of loan words in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|Sanskrit loan words in Indonesian]]).

===Toponyms===
* [[Suvarnabhumi]] is a toponym that has been historically associated with Southeast Asia. In Sanskrit, it means "The Land of Gold". Thailand's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] is named after this toponym, signifying its intent to be a major transport hub of Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* Several of Indonesian [[toponym]]s have Indian parallel or origin, such as [[Madura]] with [[Mathura]], [[Serayu]] and [[Sarayu]] river, [[Semeru]] with [[Sumeru]] mountain, [[Kalingga]] from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga Kingdom]], and [[Yogyakarta|Ngayogyakarta]] from [[Ayodhya]].
* Siamese ancient city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] also derived from Ramayana's Ayodhya.
* Names of places could simply render their Sanskrit origin, such as [[Singapore]], from Singapura (''Singha-pura'' the "lion city"), [[Jakarta]] from ''Jaya'' and ''kreta'' ("complete victory").
* Some of the Indonesian regencies such as [[Indragiri Hulu Regency|Indragiri Hulu]] and [[Indragiri Hilir Regency|Indragiri Hilir]] derived from Indragiri River, Indragiri itself means "mountain of [[Indra]]".
* Some Thai toponyms also often have Indian parallels or Sanskrit origin, although the spellings are adapted to the Siamese tongue, such as [[Ratchaburi]] from ''Raja-puri'' ("king's city"), and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] from ''Nagara Sri Dharmaraja''.
* The tendency to use Sanskrit for modern [[neologism]] also continued to modern day. In 1962 Indonesia changed the colonial name of [[New Guinea]]n city of Hollandia to [[Jayapura]] ("glorious city"), Orange mountain range to [[Jayawijaya Mountains]].
* Malaysia named their new government seat as [[Putrajaya]] ("prince of glory") in 1999.

==Historiography of Indianization==
===Indianization of Southeast Asia===
The history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from  the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region.The prevalent interpretation caused because of the ontological differences, the fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre-colonial Asia and the conclusion from it was that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies had caused innovation to become prey to tyranny and had rendered the history of the region cyclical, immobile and non-linear.
 
The belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-01JisWpJbEC&amp;q=Indian&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=5#v=snippet&amp;q=Indian&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste systems===
Another main concern for [[Indian culture|Indianization]] was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the [[India]]n culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, [[Cambodia]]'s caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as Indianization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=Some Problems in the Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South East Asia|journal=Journal of Southeast Asia|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heemraad''', or '''hoogheemraad''' (literally a high heemraad) is a local official of a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]. The term can be pluralized to ''(hoog)heemraden'', but sometimes the word ''heemraad'' also means more than one man in the sense of a meeting of (hoog)heemraden, such as ''decisions made by the heemraad''. In this sense, the college of heemraden (''[[college van dijkgraaf en heemraden]]'', consisting of the dike-reeve (''[[dijkgraaf (official)|dijkgraaf]]'') and the (hoog)heemraden) met and acted as one body in the same way that the executive board meet at the city hall (''[[college van burgemeester en wethouders]]''). A heemraad is the equivalent of an [[alderman]] (''[[wethouder]]'') in local government, being a member of both the local legislative council, while having representational roles for his own area. The term goes back to pre-medieval days.

Literally the term means "home-advisor".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43824">The '''history of the Communist Party USA''' is deeply rooted in the [[Labor history of the United States|history of the American labor movement]] and the [[Communist Party USA]] indeed played critical roles in the earliest struggles to organize American workers into [[Labor unions in the United States|unions]] as well as the later [[Civil rights movements|civil rights]] and [[anti-war movement]]s. However, many Communists were forced to work covertly due to the high level of [[Red Scare|political repression in the United States against Communists]], whom were targeted for legal retaliation and in some areas state-supported terrorism and lynchings.

According to [[Gus Hall]], who served as the General Secretary of the party for most of the later 20th century, [[Communism|communists' scientific understanding]] of the nature of [[class struggle]] enables them to be the most effective organizers, a benefit he called the "Communist plus". When Communists were expelled from the [[AFL–CIO]] in 1948, organized labor's influence on economic and political development stagnated and later plummeted. The Communist Party greatly suffered under the ensuing period of [[McCarthyism]] in which the United States government openly carried out mass repression against Communists and simultaneously ran a nationalist propaganda campaign fueling the [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]] which would dominate [[Foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]] for the rest of the century.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States government ended its espionage and police violence against the Communist Party, but the party went through another split over differences in adapting to the post-Soviet period. The Communist Party remains active, but it never recovered the influence it had during its height in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Formation and early history (1919–1921) ==
{{see also|Communist Labor Party of America}}
[[File:Alfred Wagenknecht (1918).jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Wagenknecht]], Executive Secretary of the Communist Labor Party of America, one of the predecessors of the Communist Party]]
The first [[Socialism|socialist]] [[political party]] in the United States was the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]] (SLP), formed in 1876 and for many years a viable force in the international socialist movement. By the mid-1890s, the SLP came under the influence of [[Daniel De Leon]] and his radical views led to widespread discontent amongst the members, leading to the formation of the reformist-oriented [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) around the turn of the 20th century. A left-wing gradually emerged within the Socialist Party, much to the consternation of many party leaders.

In January 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin]] invited the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party]] to join the [[Communist International]] (Comintern). During the spring of 1919, the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, buoyed by a large influx of new members from countries involved in the [[Russian Revolution]], prepared to wrest control from the smaller controlling faction of moderate socialists. A referendum to join Comintern passed with 90% support, but the incumbent leadership suppressed the results. Elections for the party's National Executive Committee resulted in 12 leftists being elected out of a total of 15. Calls were made to expel moderates from the party. The moderate incumbents struck back by expelling several state organizations, half a dozen [[language federations]] and many locals in all two-thirds of the membership.

The Socialist Party then called an emergency convention on August 30, 1919. The party's Left Wing Section made plans at a June conference of its own to regain control of the party by sending delegations from the sections of the party that had been expelled to the convention to demand that they be seated. However, the language federations, eventually joined by [[C. E. Ruthenberg]] and [[Louis C. Fraina]], turned away from that effort and formed their own party, the Communist Party of America at a separate convention on September 1, 1919. Meanwhile, plans led by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and [[Benjamin Gitlow]] to crash the Socialist Party Convention went ahead. Tipped off, the incumbents called the police, who obligingly expelled the leftists from the hall. The remaining leftist delegates walked out and meeting with the expelled delegates formed the Communist Labor Party on August 30, 1919.&lt;ref name="Buhle, 1987"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2010}}

The Comintern was not happy with two communist parties and in January 1920 dispatched an order that the two parties, which consisted of about 12,000 members, merge under the name United Communist Party and to follow the party line established in Moscow. Part of the Communist Party of America under the leadership of Ruthenberg and [[Jay Lovestone]] did this, but a [[faction (communist)|faction]] under the leadership of Nicholas I. Hourwich and [[Alexander Bittelman]] continued to operate independently as the Communist Party of America. A more strongly worded directive from the Comintern eventually did the trick and the parties were merged in May 1921. Only five percent of the members of the newly formed party were native English-speakers. Many of the members came from the ranks of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW).&lt;ref name="Buhle, 1987"&gt;Buhle, ''Marxism in the USA: From 1870 to the Present Day'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Fraser M. Ottanelli, ''The Communist party of the United States: from the depression to World War II'' (1991) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Red Scare and the Communist Party USA (1919–1923) ==
From its inception, the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) came under attack from state and federal governments and later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). In 1919, after a series of unattributed bombings and attempted assassinations of government officials and judges (later traced to militant adherents of the radical anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]), the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] headed by Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], acting under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], began arresting thousands of foreign-born party members, many of whom the government deported. The Communist Party was forced underground and took to the use of pseudonyms and secret meetings in an effort to evade the authorities.

The party apparatus was to a great extent underground. It re-emerged in the last days of 1921 as a legal political party called the [[Workers Party of America]] (WPA). As the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] and deportations of the early 1920s ebbed, the party became bolder and more open. However, an element of the party remained permanently underground and came to be known as the "CPUSA secret apparatus". During this time, immigrants from Eastern Europe are said to have played a very prominent role in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="(Klehr 1978, p. 37ff)."&gt;Klehr, Harvey. ''Communist Cadre: The Social Background of the American Communist Party Elite''. Stanford, California: Hoover Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the members of the Socialist Party were immigrants and an "overwhelming" percentage of the Communist Party consisted of recent immigrants.&lt;ref name="(Glazer 1961, p. 38 p. 40)."&gt;Glazer, Nathan ''The Social Basis of American Communism.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factional war (1923–1929) ==
[[File:Ruthenberg-c-e.jpg|thumb|[[C. E. Ruthenberg]], Executive Secretary of the Communist Party USA]]
Now that the above ground element was legal, the Communists decided that their central task was to develop roots within the working class. This move away from hopes of revolution in the near future to a more nuanced approach was accelerated by the decisions of the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern held in 1925. The Fifth World Congress decided that the period between 1917 and 1924 had been one of revolutionary upsurge, but that the new period was marked by the stabilization of capitalism and that revolutionary attempts in the near future were to be stopped. The American Communists embarked then on the arduous work of locating and winning allies.

That work was complicated by factional struggles within the Communist Party which quickly developed a number of more or less fixed factional groupings within its leadership: a faction around the party's Executive Secretary C. E. Ruthenberg, which was largely organized by his supporter [[Jay Lovestone]]; and the Foster-Cannon faction, headed by [[William Z. Foster]], who headed the party's [[Trade Union Educational League]] (TUEL); and [[James P. Cannon]], who led the International Labor Defense (ILD) organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States: from the Depression to World War II'' (1991), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster, who had been deeply involved in the [[Steel strike of 1919]] and had been a long-time [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] and a [[Wobbly]], had strong bonds with the progressive leaders of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] (CFL) and through them with the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|Progressive Party]] and nascent farmer-labor parties. Under pressure from the Comintern, the party broke off relations with both groups in 1924. In 1925, the Comintern through its representative [[Sergei Gusev (politician)|Sergei Gusev]] ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg's faction, which Foster complied. However, the factional infighting within the Communist Party did not end as the Communist leadership of the New York locals of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU) lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra-party factional rivalries.&lt;ref&gt;Ottanelli, ''The Communist party of the United States: from the depression to World War II'' (1991), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruthenberg died in 1927 and his ally Lovestone succeeded him as party secretary. Cannon attended the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in 1928 hoping to use his connections with leading circles within it to regain the advantage against the Lovestone faction, but Cannon and [[Maurice Spector]] of the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (CPC) were accidentally given a copy of [[Leon Trotsky]]'s "Critique of the Draft Program of the Comintern" that they were instructed to read and return. Persuaded by its contents, they came to an agreement to return to the United States and campaign for the document's positions. A copy of the document was then smuggled out of the country in a child's toy.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Bryan D., [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/56/palmer.html "Maurice Spector, James P. Cannon, and the Origins of Canadian Trotskyism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309152915/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/56/palmer.html |date=2012-03-09 }}. ''Labour/Le Travail''.56 (2005): 72 pars.

However, as this attempt to develop a [[Left Opposition]] came to light, they and their supporters were expelled. Cannon and his followers organized the [[Communist League of America]] (CLA) as a section of Trotsky's [[International Left Opposition]] (ILO).

At the same Congress, Lovestone had impressed the leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) as a strong supporter of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the general secretary of the Comintern. This was to have unfortunate consequences for Lovestone as in 1929 Bukharin was on the losing end of a struggle with [[Joseph Stalin]] and was purged from his position on the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and removed as head of the Comintern. In a reversal of the events of 1925, a Comintern delegation sent to the United States demanded that Lovestone resign as party secretary in favor of his archrival Foster despite the fact that Lovestone enjoyed the support of the vast majority of the American party's membership. Lovestone traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] and appealed directly to the Comintern. Stalin informed Lovestone that he "had a majority because the American Communist Party until now regarded you as the determined supporter of the Communist International. And it was only because the Party regarded you as friends of the Comintern that you had a majority in the ranks of the American Communist Party".&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lovestone returned to the United States, he and his ally [[Benjamin Gitlow]] were purged despite holding the leadership of the party. Ostensibly, this was not due to Lovestone's insubordination in challenging a decision by Stalin, but for his support for [[American exceptionalism]], the thesis that socialism could be achieved peacefully in the United States. Lovestone and Gitlow formed their own group called the [[Communist Party (Opposition)]], a section of the pro-Bukharin [[International Communist Opposition]] (CO), which was initially larger than the [[Trotskyist]]s, but it failed to survive past 1941. Lovestone had initially called his faction the [[Communist Party (Majority Group)]] in the expectation that the majority of party members would join him, but only a few hundred people joined his new organization.

== Third Period (1928–1935) ==
The upheavals within the Communist Party in 1928 were an echo of a much more significant change as Stalin's decision to break off any form of collaboration with Western socialist parties, which were now condemned as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]". The impact of this policy in the United States was counted in membership figures. In 1928, there were about 24,000 members. By 1932, the total had fallen to 6,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States: from the Depression to World War II'' (1991), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing Stalin's [[Third Period]] policies in the Communist Party was [[James P. Cannon]]. For this action, he was expelled from the party. Cannon then founded the CLA with Max Shachtman and Martin Abern and started publishing ''[[The Militant]]''. It declared itself to be an external faction of the Communist Party until—as the Trotskyists saw it—Stalin's policies in Germany helped [[Adolf Hitler]] take power. At that point, they started working towards the founding of a new international, the [[Fourth International]] (FI).

In the United States, the principal impact of the Third Period was to end the Communist Party's efforts to organize within the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) through the TUEL and to turn its efforts into organizing [[Dual unionism|dual unions]] through the [[Trade Union Unity League]]. Foster went along with this change, even though it contradicted the policies he had fought for previously.

By 1930, the party adopted the slogan of "the united front from below". The Communist Party devoted much of its energy in the [[Great Depression]] to organizing the unemployed, attempting to found "red" unions, championing the rights of [[African Americans]] and fighting evictions of farmers and the working poor.&lt;ref&gt;Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States'', ch 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the party attempted to weave its sectarian revolutionary politics into its day-to-day defense of workers, usually with only limited success. They recruited more disaffected members of the Socialist Party and an organization of African American socialists called the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB), some of whose members, particularly [[Harry Haywood]], would later play important roles in Communist work among blacks.

In 1932, the retiring head of the party, [[William Z. Foster]], published a book entitled ''[[Toward Soviet America]]'', which laid out the Communist Party's plans for revolution and the building of a new socialist society based on the model of [[Soviet Russia]]. In that same year, [[Earl Browder]] became General Secretary of the Communist Party. At first, Browder moved the party closer to Soviet interests and helped to develop its secret apparatus or underground network. He also assisted in the recruitment of espionage sources and agents for the Soviet [[NKVD]]. Browder's own younger sister Margerite was an NKVD operative in Europe until removed from those duties at Browder's request.&lt;ref name="ryan172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that the party's foreign policy platform came under the complete control of Stalin, who enforced his directives through his secret police and foreign intelligence service, the NKVD. The NKVD controlled the secret apparatus of the Communiat Party.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Ryan, "Socialist Triumph as a Family Value: Earl Browder and Soviet Espionage," ''American Communist History'' 1, no. 2 (December 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John E. Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Fridrikh I. Igorevich, ''The Secret World of American Communism'' (Yale University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression in the United States]], many Americans became disillusioned with [[capitalism]] and some found [[communist ideology]] appealing. Others were attracted by the visible activism of American Communists on behalf of a wide range of social and economic causes, including the rights of African Americans, workers and the unemployed. Still others, alarmed by the rise of the [[Franquism|Franquists]] in [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], admired the Soviet Union’s early and staunch opposition to [[fascism]]. The membership of the Communist Party swelled from 7,500 at the start of the decade to 55,000 by its end.

== Popular Front (1935–1939) ==
The ideological rigidity of the third period began to crack with two events: the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as [[President of the United States]] in 1932 and [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in Germany in 1933. Roosevelt's election and the passage of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933 sparked a tremendous upsurge in union organizing in 1933 and 1934. While the party line still favored creation of autonomous revolutionary unions, party activists chose to fold up those organizations and follow the mass of workers into the AFL unions they had been attacking.

The Seventh Congress of the Comintern made the change in line official in 1935, when it declared the need for a [[popular front]] of all groups [[Anti-fascism|opposed to fascism]]. The Communist Party abandoned its opposition to the [[New Deal]], provided many of the organizers for the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) and began supporting [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)|African American civil rights]]. The party also sought unity with forces to its right. Earl Browder offered to run as [[Norman Thomas]]' [[running mate]] on a joint Socialist Party-Communist Party ticket in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]], but Thomas rejected this overture. The gesture did not mean that much in practical terms since by 1936 the Communist Party effectively supporting Roosevelt in much of his trade union work. While continuing to run its own candidates for office, the party pursued a policy of representing the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] as the lesser evil in elections.

Party members also rallied to the defense of the Spanish Republic during this period after a [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] military uprising moved to overthrow it, resulting in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). The Communist Party along with leftists throughout the world raised funds for medical relief while many of its members made their way to Spain with the aid of the party to join the [[Lincoln Brigade]], one of the [[International Brigades]]. Among its other achievements, the Lincoln Brigade was the first American military force to include blacks and whites integrated on an equal basis. Intellectually, the [[Popular Front]] period saw the development of a strong Communist influence in intellectual and artistic life. This was often through various organizations influenced or controlled by the party, or as they were pejoratively known, "[[communist front|fronts]]".

The party under Browder supported Stalin's [[show trials]] in the Soviet Union, called the [[Moscow Trials]].&lt;ref name="ryan154"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therein, between August 1936 and mid-1938 the Soviet government indicted, tried and shot virtually all of the remaining [[Old Bolsheviks]].&lt;ref name="ryan154" /&gt; Beyond the show trials lay a broader purge, the [[Great Purge]], that killed millions.&lt;ref name="ryan154" /&gt; Browder uncritically supported Stalin, likening Trotskyism to "cholera germs" and calling the purge "a signal service to the cause of progressive humanity".&lt;ref name="ryan155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the show trial defendants to domestic traitors [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Aaron Burr]], disloyal [[War of 1812]] [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate secessionists]] while likening persons who "smeared" Stalin's name to those who had slandered [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="ryan155" /&gt;

The Communist Party was adamantly opposed to fascism during the Popular Front period. Although membership in the party rose to about 75,000 by 1938,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/sova.html Soviet and American Communist Parties] in [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/ Revelations from the Russian Archives], Library of Congress, January 4, 1996.

On September 17, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it]] by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland.&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanford"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Sanford (scholar)|last=Sanford|first=George|year=2005|title=Katyn and the Soviet Massacre Of 1940: Truth, Justice And Memory|location=London, New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-33873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British, French and German Communist parties, all originally war supporters, abandoned their anti-fascist crusades, demanded peace and denounced [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] governments.&lt;ref name="ryan164"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|pp=164–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist Party turned the focus of its public activities from anti-fascism to advocating peace, not only opposing military preparations, but also condemning those opposed to Hitler. The party attacked British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French leader [[Édouard Daladier]], but it did not at first attack President Roosevelt, reasoning that this could devastate American Communism, blaming instead Roosevelt's advisors.&lt;ref name="ryan164"/&gt;

In October and November, after the [[Winter War|Soviets invaded Finland]] and [[Occupation of the Baltic states|forced mutual assistance pacts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania]], the Communist Party considered Russian security sufficient justification to support the actions.&lt;ref name="ryan166"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secret short wave radio broadcasts in October from Comintern leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] ordered Browder to change the party's support for Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="ryan166"/&gt; On October 23, the party began attacking Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="ryan168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist Party dropped its boycott of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] goods, spread the slogans "[[The Yanks Are Not Coming]]" and "Hands Off", set up a "perpetual peace vigil" across the street from the White House and announced that Roosevelt was the head of the "war party of the American bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="ryan168"/&gt; By April 1940, the party ''[[Daily Worker|Daily Woker]]'''s line seemed not so much antiwar as simply pro-German.&lt;ref name="ryan186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pamphlet stated the Jews had just as much to fear from Britain and France as they did Germany.&lt;ref name="ryan186"/&gt; In August 1940, after NKVD agent [[Ramón Mercader]] killed Trotsky with an [[ice axe]], Browder perpetuated Moscow's fiction that the killer, who had been dating one of Trotsky's secretaries, was a disillusioned follower.&lt;ref name="ryan189"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1997|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In allegiance to the Soviet Union, the party changed this policy again after Hitler broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|attacking the Soviet Union]] on June 22, 1941.

[[File:Communist Party USA, Workers' Bookshop, New York.jpg|thumb|300px|Communist Party USA bookstore in September 1942 with the pro-war slogan "A [[Western Front (World War II)|Second Front]] Now"]]
Throughout the rest of [[World War II]], the Communist Party continued a policy of militant, if sometimes bureaucratic, trade unionism while opposing strike actions at all costs. The leadership of the Communist Party was among the most vocal pro-war voices in the United States, advocating unity against fascism, supporting the prosecution of leaders of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) under the newly enacted [[Smith Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John Earl Haynes]]. Red Scare or Red Menace?: American Communism and Anticommunism in the Cold War Era 30 (Ivan R. Dee 1996) {{ISBN|1-56663-090-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and opposing [[A. Philip Randolph]]'s efforts to organize a march on Washington to dramatize black workers' demands for equal treatment on the job. Prominent party members and supporters, such as [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Pete Seeger]], recalled anti-war material they had previously released.

Earl Browder expected the wartime coalition between the Soviet Union and [[Western world|the West]] to bring about a prolonged period of social harmony after the war. In order better to integrate the Communist movement into American life, the party was officially dissolved in 1944 and replaced by a Communist Political Association.&lt;ref&gt;Communist Party, United States of America, article at Encyclopedia.com https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/communist-party-united-states-america&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the [[Italian Communist Party]]'s (CPI) Salerno turn accommodation with other anti-fascist parties in 1944. However, that harmony proved elusive and the international Communist movement swung to the left after the war ended. Browder found himself isolated when the [[Duclos letter]] from the leader of the [[French Communist Party]] (FCP), attacking Browderism (an accommodation with American political conditions), received wide circulation amongst Communist officials internationally. As a result of this, he was retired and replaced in 1945 by [[William Z. Foster]], who would remain the senior leader of the party until his own retirement in 1958.

In line with other Communist parties worldwide, the Communist Party also swung to the left and as a result experienced a brief period in which a number of internal critics argued for a more leftist stance than the leadership was willing to countenance. The result was the expulsion of a handful of "premature [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionists]]".

== Second Red Scare (1947–1958) ==
{{main|Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders}}
More important for the party was the renewal of state persecution of the Communist Party. The [[Truman administration]]'s loyalty [[Executive Order 9835|oath program]], introduced in 1947, drove some leftists out of federal employment and more importantly legitimized the notion of Communists as subversives to be exposed and expelled from public and private employment. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), whose hearings were perceived as forums where current and former Communists and those sympathetic to Communism were compelled under the duress of the ruin of their careers to confess and name other Communists, made even brief affiliation with the COmmunist Party or any related groups grounds for public exposure and attack, inspiring local governments to adopt loyalty oaths and investigative commissions of their own. Private parties, such as the motion picture industry and self-appointed watchdog groups, extended the policy still further. This included the still controversial [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist of actors, writers and directors in Hollywood]] who had been Communists or who had fallen in with Communist-controlled or influenced organizations in the pre-war and wartime years. The union movement purged party members as well. The CIO formally expelled a number of left-led unions in 1949 after internal disputes triggered by the party's support for [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]'s candidacy for President and its opposition to the [[Marshall Plan]] while other labor leaders sympathetic to the Communist Party either were driven out of their unions or dropped their alliances with the party.

In 1949's [[Foley Square trial]], the FBI prosecuted eleven members of the Communist Party's leadership, including [[Gus Hall]] and [[Eugene Dennis]]. The prosecution argued that the party endorsed a violent overthrow of the government; but the defendants countered that they advocated for a peaceful transition to socialism and that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech and association protected their membership in a political party. The trial—held in Manhattan's [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square courthouse]]—was widely publicized by the media and was featured on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine twice. Large numbers of protesters supporting the Communist defendants protested outside the courthouse daily. The defense attorneys used a "labor defense" strategy which attacked the trial as a [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist]] venture that would not provide a fair outcome to [[Proletariat|proletarian]] defendants. During the trial, the defense routinely antagonized the judge and prosecution and five of the defendants were sent to jail for contempt of court for disrupting the trial. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants and after a ten-month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and they were sentenced to terms of five years in federal prison. When the trial concluded, the judge sent all five defense attorneys to jail for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred. The government prosecutors, encouraged by their success, arrested and convicted over 100 additional party officers in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, Michal, R., "Foley Square Trial", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CopQakAajYQC American political trials]'' (Michal Belknap, ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994, {{ISBN|9780275944377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread fear of Communism became even more acute after the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviets' detonation of an atomic bomb in 1949]] and discovery of [[First Chief Directorate|Soviet espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postwar.htm History of the FBI: Postwar America: 1945–1960s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106195659/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postwar.htm |date=2015-01-06 }}, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), undated.

In the 1961 case, ''Communist Party v. Catherwood'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the act did not bar the party from participating in New York's unemployment insurance system. No administration has tried to enforce it since.

Because I've financed the Communist Party, in order to know what they are doing".&lt;ref name="Summers, p. 191"&gt;Summers, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; William Sullivan, chief of intelligence operations for the FBI in the 1950s, has also described Hoover's continued zeal in pursuing action against the party as "insincere" as he was fully aware of the party's moribund condition.&lt;ref name="Summers, p. 191" /&gt; Senator McCarthy had also kept up his attacks on the party during the 1950s despite also being aware of its impotency.&lt;ref name="Summers, p. 191" /&gt;

Against the backdrop of these many setbacks, [[William Z. Foster]], who was once again in a leadership role after the ouster of Earl Browder and who due to his poor health had not been brought to trial in 1948 along with a number of other members of the party's leadership, wrote his ''History of the Communist Party of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, William Z., "History of the Communist Party of the United States", International Publishers, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Party history is the record of the American class struggle, of which it is a vital part. It is the story, in general, of the growth of the working class; the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Negro People; the building of the trade union and farmer movements; the numberless strikes and political struggles of the toiling masses; and the growing political alliance of workers, Negroes, farmers, and intellectuals", says Foster in the first chapter, illuminating a very different perspective of the party from within.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, "History of the Communist Party of the United States", 1952, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Party in crisis (1956–1989) ==
The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]] and the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secret Speech]] of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to the CPSU criticizing Stalin had a cataclysmic effect on the previously [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] majority membership Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Fast]], "On Leaving the Communist Party", ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'', November 16, 1957. [http://www.trussel.com/hf/onleave.htm Reproduced at trussel.com], Retrieved August 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership plummeted and the leadership briefly faced a challenge from a loose grouping led by ''Daily Worker'' editor [[John Gates]], which wished to democratize the party. Perhaps the greatest single blow dealt to the party in this period was the loss of the ''Daily Worker'', published since 1924, which was suspended in 1958 due to falling circulation.

Most of the critics would depart from the party demoralized, but others would remain active in progressive causes and would often end up working harmoniously with party members. This [[diaspora]] rapidly came to provide the audience for publications like the ''[[National Guardian]]'' and ''[[Monthly Review]]'', which were to be important in the development of the [[New Left#New Left in the United States|New Left]] in the 1960s.

The post-1956 upheavals in the Communist Party also saw the advent of a new leadership around former steel worker Gus Hall. Hall's views were very much those of his mentor Foster, but he was to be more rigorous in ensuring the party was completely orthodox than Foster in his last years. Therefore, while remaining critics who wished to liberalize the party were expelled, so too were anti-revisionist critics who took an anti-Khrushchev stance.

Many of these critics were elements on both United States coasts who would come together to form the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Movement]] in 1961. Progressive Labor would come to play a role in many of the numerous [[Maoism|Maoist]] organizations of the mid-1960s and early 1970s. [[Jack Shulman]], Foster's secretary, also played a role in these organizations. He was not expelled from the party, but he resigned. In the 1970s, the party managed to grow in membership to about 25,000 members despite the exodus of numerous anti-revisionist and Maoist groups from its ranks.

== From glasnost to the 21st century (1989–present) ==
The rise of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the leader of the CPSU brought unprecedented changes in [[Soviet Union–United States relations|American–Soviet relations]]. Initially, American Communists welcomed Gorbachev's initiative to restructure and revitalize Soviet socialism. However, as reforms were carried out, [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] leaders [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] began to praise Gorbachev, which prompted Communists to double take on their assessment. As the liberalization of the Soviet system began to introduce more negative aspects of Western society into the Soviet Union, party leader Gus Hall came out in condemnation of these reforms in 1989, describing them as a counter-revolution to restore capitalism. This effectively liquidated relations between the two Communist parties which would be dissolved less than two years later.

The cutoff of funds resulted in a financial crisis, which forced the Communist Party to cut back publication in 1990 of the party newspaper, the  ''[[People's World|People's Daily World]]'', to weekly publication, the ''People's Weekly World''. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], a crisis in doctrine ensued. The Communist Party's vision of the future development of socialism had to be completely changed due to the extreme change in the balance of global forces. The more moderate reformists, including [[Angela Davis]], left the party altogether, forming a new organization called the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]] (CCDS). The remaining Communists struggled with questions of identity in the post-Soviet world, some of which that are still part of Communist Party politics today.

[[File:Opening plenary &amp; Keynote speech 30th National Convention.webm.jpg|thumb|right|30th National Convention in Chicago]]
In 2000, after the death of Gus Hall, [[Sam Webb]] became the chairman of the National Committee. Under his leadership, the party's top priority became supporting the Democratic Party in elections in order to defeat the "ultra right". Webb issued a thesis on how he saw the party's position in American politics and its role, rejecting [[Marxism–Leninism]] as "too rigid and formulaic" and putting forward the idea of "moving beyond Communist Parties" which was widely criticized both within the party and internationally as anti-communist and a move towards liquidation. Webb stepped down as chairman and was replaced by [[John Bachtell]] at the party's [[30th National Convention of the Communist Party USA|National Convention]] in 2014. Two years later, Webb renounced his party membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bachtell|first1=John|title=Standing up together in protest: unity will trump hate|url=http://www.cpusa.org/article/standing-together-in-protest-unity-will-trump-hate/|website=Communist Party USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make room for the rental of four floors in the national building, the Communist Party had to move its extensive archives. The archives of the Communist Party were donated in March 2007 to the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives|Tamiment Library]] at the [[New York University]]. The massive donation, in 12,000 cartons, included history from the founding of the party, 20,000 books and pamphlets and a million photographs from the archives of the ''Daily Worker''. The Tamiment Library also holds a copy of the microfilmed archive of Communist Party documents from [[State Archive of the Russian Federation|Soviet Archives]] held by the [[Library of Congress]] and from other materials which documents radical and left history.&lt;ref&gt;"Communist Party USA Gives Its History to N.Y.U.", article by Patricia Cohen in the [[New York Times]], March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home equity''' is the [[market value]] of a homeowner's [[Encumbrance|unencumbered]] interest in their [[real property]], that is, the difference between the home's [[fair market value]] and the outstanding balance of all [[lien]]s on the property. The property's [[Ownership equity|equity]] increases as the debtor makes payments against the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] balance, or as the property value [[capital appreciation|appreciates]]. In [[economics]], ''home equity'' is sometimes called '''real property value'''.

Home equity is not [[Market liquidity|liquid]]. ''Home equity management'' refers to the process of using [[Mortgage equity withdrawal|equity extraction]] via [[loan]]s, at favorable, and often tax-favored, [[interest rate]]s, to invest otherwise [[Market liquidity|illiquid]] equity in a target that offers higher returns.

Homeowners acquire equity in their home from two sources.  They purchase equity with their [[down payment]] and the principal portion of any payments they make against their mortgage.  They also benefit from a gain in equity when the value of the property increases.  Investors typically look to purchase properties that will grow in value, causing the equity in the property to increase, thus providing a return on their investment when the property is sold.

Home equity may serve as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a [[home equity loan]] or [[HELOC|home equity line of credit]] (HELOC). Many home equity plans set a fixed period during which the homeowner can borrow money, such as ten years. At the end of this “draw period,” the borrower may be allowed to renew the credit line. If the plan does not allow renewals, the borrower will not be able to borrow additional money once the period has ended. Some plans may call for payment in full of any outstanding balance at the end of the period. Others may allow repayment over a fixed period, for example, ten years.

The '''Independent Media Center''' (also known as '''Indymedia''' or '''IMC''') is an [[open publishing]] network of journalist collectives that report on political and social issues. It originated during the Seattle [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999]] and remains closely associated with the [[global justice movement]], which criticizes [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and its associated institutions. Several local branches of the network have been raided by law enforcement over the years.

==Aims==
According to the [[umbrella organization|umbrella]] homepage, "Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml|title=Independent Media Center - www.indymedia.org - ((( i )))|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to be an alternative to government and [[corporate media]], and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.{{r|"Hanni"}}

==History==
[[Image:Indymedia Edinburgh DSC04943.JPG|300px|thumb|Temporary IMC in [[Edinburgh]] covering protests at the [[31st G8 summit|2005 G8 summit]]]]
The origins of Indymedia can be traced to the [[global justice movement|global justice]] protest [[Carnival Against Capitalism]], which took place in over forty countries on June 18, 1999.{{r|Ainger}} Activists had networked globally using the internet, and had seen its publishing potential. Events could be reported as they happened, unmediated and without the need for the traditional news outlets. Plans came together for an Independent Media Centre to cover the upcoming Seattle WTO protests in November. The [[open publishing]] software used by the centre was developed from that used to report the carnival in Sydney.{{r|chat}}{{r|j18sydney}}{{r|dissent}}

In late November 1999, the first Indymedia project was ready to cover the protests against the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO meeting]] in [[Seattle]], Washington. It acted as an alternative news source publishing up-to-the-minute reports on the protest days. Additionally it produced a newspaper and five documentaries.{{r|first}}{{r|dissent}}{{r|seattle}}

After Seattle the idea and network spread rapidly. By 2002, there were 89 Indymedia websites in 31 countries (including [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]),{{r|n2002}} growing to over 150 by January 2006. The number of active centres grew from 142, in 2004, to 175 in 2010.{{r|radpar|p=426}} However, by 2014 the network had declined significantly, with the number of active sites down to 68.{{r|radpar|p=426}} A number of reasons for the decline have been put forward. In an article published by the journal [[Convergence (journal)|Convergence]] Eva Giraud summarised some of the different arguments that had been made by academics and activists, which included [[flat organization|informal hierarchy]], [[bureaucracy]], security issues including [[IP address]] logging, lack of regional engagement, lack of [[social class|class]] politics, increase in [[web 2.0]] social media use, website underdevelopment, decline in volunteers and decline in the global justice movement.{{r|radpar}}

Alternative Bristol pointed to security reasons for the decline. It stated that since server seizures Indymedia UK has been used less and less with on average only one new posting per week. It added activists are moving to alternative media content providers and more secure methods since the Snowden leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativebristol.com/events/indymedia-uk-has-closed-meeting-to-discuss-a-replacement/|title=Indymedia UK has closed.  Meeting to discuss a replacement|date=June 23, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most obviously, the rise of corporate social media sites and the massification of 'open publishing' appropriated Indymedia's key innovations for the cultural industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corporatewatch.org/news/2014/oct/28/facebook-killed-internet-star-reflections-radical-media|title=Facebook killed the internet star: reflections on radical media  - Corporate Watch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 2011, the UK national site saw a conflict in which direction it should take. One side wanted the site to remain the same, another group wanted it to become an aggregator for the regional centers.{{r|radpar}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news7706.php|title=SchNEWS 770 - 6th May 2011 - Indymedia: From the Rubble of Double Trouble|publisher=|access-date=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002155602/http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news7706.php|archive-date=October 2, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Ceasefire magazine noted a decline in the use of Nottingham Indymedia, stating that activist use of commercial social media had increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/indymedia-its-time-move/|title=Indymedia: It's time to move on|date=February 17, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Bristol site was archived and closed after police server seizures.&lt;ref&gt;http://bristol.indymedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

==Police and legal action against IMCs==

====Bristol server seizure 2005====
[[Image:Bristol indymedia.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Graffiti|Graffito]] in Bristol, United Kingdom advertising the local chapter of Indymedia with the slogan "Read it, write it, your site, your news"]]
Servers in the UK was seized by police in June 2005. An [[anonymous post]] on the [[Bristol Indymedia]] server, came to police attention for suggesting an "action" against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year's Gleneagles G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;John Leyden, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/ Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server]'', The Register, June 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed that the poster broke the law by "incitement to criminal damage", and sought access logs from the server operators. Despite being warned by lawyers that the servers were "journalistic equipment" and subject to special laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/06/314798.html ''PRESS RELEASE : Bristol Indymedia Server Threatened''], Bristol IMC press release, June 24, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the police proceeded with the seizure and a member of the Bristol Indymedia group was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/4629399.stm ''Indymedia server seized in raid''], BBC News, June 28, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was supported in this matter by the [[National Union of Journalists]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]{{r|bbc2005}} and [[Privacy International]], along with others. This incident ended several months later with no charges being brought by the police and the equipment returned.{{r|bristol688390}}

Prior to the original server being returned, Bristol Indymedia was donated a replacement server by local IT co-operative, Bristol Wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bristol|first=Wireless|title=Indymedia Returns! :)|url=http://www.bristolwireless.net/2005/07/indymedia-returns/|publisher=Bristol Wireless|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bristol server seizure 2014====
In August 2014, Bristol Indymedia's servers were seized by police after arsonists used the site to claim responsibility for a fire at firearms training centre.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/anarchist-website-bristol-indymedia-close/story-22848036-detail/story.html|title=Anarchist website Bristol Indymedia to close following police raid|date=August 29, 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015153857/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Anarchist-website-Bristol-Indymedia-close/story-22848036-detail/story.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol Indymedia stated that they will not cooperate with the authorities and that they "do not intend to voluntarily hand over information to the police as they have requested".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/|title=Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2000, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] temporarily shut down the satellite uplink and production studio of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center on its first night of [[Democratic National Convention]] coverage, claiming explosives were in a van in the adjacent parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lists.indymedia.org/imc-nyc/2000-August/000130.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527121316/http://archives.lists.indymedia.org/imc-nyc/2000-August/000130.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 27, 2011|title=[IMC-NYC] LAPD BLOCKS SATELLITE FEED OF INDYMEDIA COVERAGE OF DNC IN LOS ANGELES|author=|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seizure of servers by the FBI 2004====
On October 7, 2004, the [[FBI]] took possession of several [[Server (computing)|server]] hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by US-based [[Rackspace]] Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected, including the website of a [[Linux distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089554894.html FBI seizes Indymedia servers], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]], 2004-10-08&lt;/ref&gt; No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure, in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml|title=Independent Media Center - www.indymedia.org - ((( i )))|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The documents revealed that the only action requested by the government was to surrender server log files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/08/02|title=Secret Documents About Indymedia Server Disappearance Unsealed|date=August 2, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lettice, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/03/indymedia_texas_docs_unsealed/ ''US court files reveal Italian link to Indymedia server grab''], The Register, August 3, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement by Rackspace&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml ''FBI Seizes IMC Servers in the UK''], Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the [[Mutual legal assistance treaty]], which governs international police co-operation on "international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering". The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail. [[Agence France-Presse]] reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris,&lt;ref name="Mcafee antivirus Activation key"&gt;[https://joom.ag/LY7W Mcafee antivirus Activation key] {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said the incident was not an FBI operation, but that the [[subpoena]] had been issued at the request of the Italian and the Swiss governments. Again, no further details on specific allegations were given. UK involvement was denied in an answer given to a parliamentary question posed by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 MP Richard Allan's website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219152906/http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indymedia pointed out that they were not contacted by the FBI and that no specific information was released on the reasons for seizing the servers.

====Subpoena for IP addresses====
On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana|Southern District of Indiana]] federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all "[[IP address]]es, times, and any other identifying information" for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="subpoena"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation [https://www.eff.org/wp/anatomy-bogus-subpoena-indymedia "Anatomy of a Bogus Subpoena"], Retrieved on 2009-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena also included a [[gag order]] that stated that the recipient is "not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney."&lt;ref name="subpoena" /&gt; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] determined that there was no legal basis for the gag order, and that the subpoena request "violated the [[Stored Communications Act|SCA's]] restrictions on what types of data the government could obtain using a subpoena."&lt;ref name="subpoena" /&gt; Under [[Reporter's privilege#Department of Justice guidelines (United States)|Justice Department guidelines]], subpoenas to news media must have the authorization of the attorney general. According to a CBS News blog, the subpoena of indymedia.us was never submitted to the Attorney General for review.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;Declan McCullagh [http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/09/taking_liberties/entry5595506.shtml "Justice Dept.

===Italy===
In July, 2001 at the [[27th G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]], Italian police assaulted Indymedia journalists at the Armando Diaz School where Indymedia had set up a temporary office and radio station. Twenty-nine police officers were indicted for beating people, planting evidence and wrongful arrest during the night-time raid. Thirteen were convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Arens  | first = Marianne  | title = Italy: Judgement in G8 police raid trial  | work = World Socialist Web Site  | date = November 24, 2008  | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/ital-n24.shtml  | accessdate =June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =  Campaigners fear Italy G8 trouble  |work=BBC News  | date = December 5, 2008  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7767412.stm  | accessdate =June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the federal prosecutor of Bologna Marina Plazzi confirmed that an investigation against Indymedia had been opened because of suspected "support of terrorism", in the context of Italian troops in the Iraqi city of [[Nasiriyah]]. The investigation was triggered after 17 members of the coalition government belonging to the right-wing [[National Alliance (Italy)|Alleanza Nazionale]], including [[Alessandra Mussolini]], demanded that Indymedia be shut down. A senior party member and government official had announced co-operation with US authorities, and party spokesman Mario Landolfi welcomed the FBI's seizure of the Indymedia servers. Left-wing Italian politicians denounced the move and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Valgolio, ''The Censorers Trace leads to Rome and Zurich'', Junge Welt, October 11, 2004, cited at [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml ''Indymedia to U.S., U.K., Swiss and Italian Authorities: "Hands Off Our Websites"''], Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the aftermath of the violent [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit]] protests, the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]] banned the German chapter of the network, Linksunten.indymedia. The ministry described the network as "the central communications platform among far-left extremists prone to violence" and stated that it was used to spread information about violent protest tactics. German [[internet service provider]]s were ordered to block communication to the website. The German police also raided the addresses of several leading members and supporters of the Indymedia network in the [[Baden-Württemberg]] region. They seized knives, batons, pipes and slingshots from the apartments of the activists.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/world/europe/germany-bans-far-left-antifa-website.html |title=Germany, in a First, Shuts Down Left-Wing Extremist Website |last=Heaphy,  |first=Edmund |date=August 25, 2017 |website= The New York Times |publisher= |access-date=4 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41047166 |title=Germany bans far-left protest website over G20 riots |date=August 25, 2017 |website= BBC |publisher= |access-date=4 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People had been demonstrating in the city since May as part of an [[2006 Oaxaca protests|uprising]] prompted by a teachers strike.

The [[Active (software)|Active software]] that was used as the basis for the first Indymedia centers' websites was written for Active Sydney. It went live in January 1999 featuring open publishing, calendars, events and contacts.

==Distribution==
Indymedia collectives distribute print, audio, photographic, and video media. They run open publishing websites which allow anyone to upload news articles. The content of an Indymedia collectives is determined by its participants, both the users who post content, and members of the local collective who administer the site. Centres worldwide are run autonomously, however they all provide [[copyleft]] content. This rule means content on Indymedia sites can be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190906/https://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 3, 2016|title=PrinciplesOfUnity &lt; Global &lt; Foswiki|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and focus==
[[Image:Belgian Indymedia media centre.jpg|300px|thumb| Belgian Indymedia's headquarters in Brussels]]

The origins of Indymedia centres themselves came out of protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in [[corporate media]] reporting. The first Indymedia node, attached as it was to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by [[activists]] as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135"Independent+Media+Center" | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991218&amp;slug=3002212"Independent+Media+Center" | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/22220_gag09.shtml | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=Media center fighting FBI over Web data | date=August 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19980_security24.shtml | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=FBI raids media center | date=April 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://joom.ag/LY7W | title=mcafee internet security activation key }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seattle|first=National Lawyers Guild WTO Legal Group|title=Waging War on Dissent|url=http://www.ratical.org/co-globalize/NLG-REPORT.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports between 1999 and 2001 tended to focus on up-to-the-minute coverage of protests, from local [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s to [[Summit (meeting)|summit]]s where [[anti-globalization movement]] protests were occurring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In 2007, protest coverage was still published.{{r|cc2007}}

Indymedia run a global radio project which aggregates audio RSS feeds from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.indymedia.org/|title= Radio Indymedia|publisher=radio.indymedia.org|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
Indymedia is formed of local collectives. They are run autonomously, but common rules include openness, inclusiveness and diversity. Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collectives often involve removing articles which are believed to promote [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[hate speech]], and [[homophobia]].{{r|principles}} A clearly stated editorial policy is expected to be available on collectives' websites.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=January 2018}}

===Views on Israel and Jews===
In a 2002 op-ed, [[alter-globalisation]] activist [[Naomi Klein]] criticised Indymedia for posting excerpts from ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2002/04/sharon-le-pen-and-anti-semitism|title='Sharon, Le Pen, and Anti-Semitism'|author=Naomi Klein|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Swiss edition of Indymedia was accused of anti-Semitism by [[Aktion Kinder des Holocaust]], which unsuccessfully sued them for publishing a [[Carlos Latuff]] cartoon of a Jewish boy in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] saying "I am Palestinian," though this was criticized by IMC as an attempt to stifle criticism of Israel in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Schärer: [http://www.akdh.ch/ps/woz040402.htm Linke und Antisemitismus: Der Indymedia-Streit&amp;nbsp;– Aufpassen, was im Kübel landet], ''Die Wochenzeitung'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Junge Welt]]: [http://www.akdh.ch/indymedia4.htm Ärger im Internet: Wegen antisemitischer Beiträge hat Indymedia Schweiz den Betrieb gestoppt], February 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aktion Kinder des Holocaust: [http://www.akdh.ch/latuff2.htm Is this cartoon by Latuff, published at indymedia-switzerland, anti-Semitic? An analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Google temporarily stopped including some IMCs in [[Google News]] searches due to the use of the term "zionazi". [[Marissa Mayer]], at the time the product manager of Google News, explained the removal by describing the term as a "degrading, hateful slur" (in her view) and refused to index the [[San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center|Bay Area IMC]] because it had appeared there. While SF Bay Area Indymedia agreed that it "could be considered [[hate speech]]", they considered this a double standard due to Google News indexing articles using language they considered racist and defamatory against Arabs and Muslims, such as the term "[[Islamofascism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/09/03/16398621.php|title=Google News Bans SF Bay Area Indymedia Over Israel/Palestine Controversy : Indybay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation was initiated with the consent of Ministry for Home Affairs Government of India following the unrest in 2016 due to the death of [[Burhan Wani]] and subsequent militant and terrorist attacks in the region such as the Amarnath Yatra terror attack on 10 July 2017 in which eight Hindu pilgrims were killed and at least 18 others injured.&lt;ref name="NDTV2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-militancy-hizbul-mujahideen-indian-army/story/1/20687.html|title=Indian Army's 'Operation All Out' in Kashmir killed 190 terrorists, but there is reason to worry|last=Sandhu|first=Kamaljit|date=20 November 2017|work=Daily News and Analysis India (DNA)|access-date=19 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105042/https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kashmir-militancy-hizbul-mujahideen-indian-army/story/1/20687.html|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Sarp Vinash ===
Operation Sarp Vinash (Snake Destroyer) is an operation undertaken by Indian army to flush out terrorists who made bases in the Hilkaka [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]]-[[Surankote Tehsil|Surankot]] area of the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]] range in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] during April–May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/operation-sarp-vinash-army-clears-hill-kaka/articleshow/47305413.cms?from=mdr|title=Operation Sarp Vinash: Army clears Hill Kaka|last=Kumar|first=Devesh|date=2003-05-24|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the operation the [[Indian army]] killed 64 terrorists belonging to various [[Jihadist terrorism|jihadist]] outfits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/reassessing-operation-sarp-vinash/220439 |title=Reassessing Operation Sarp Vinash |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/23josy1.htm |title=Operation 'Sarp Vinash': Over 60 terrorists killed |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2003-05-24 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of hideouts used by the terrorists found during this operation was the largest ever in the known history of [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hYQsDBIgEkYC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=Operation+Sarp+Vinash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi607y9jtvZAhUKOY8KHYNLDOwQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Operation%20Sarp%20Vinash&amp;f=false|title=Terrorism in Northern India: Jammu and Kashmir and the Punjab|last=Prakash|first=Ved|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178357034|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2003/07/31/stories/2003073102911200.htm|title=The Hindu : Fernandes reveals  'Sarp Vinash' toll|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Background'''

Over several years, terrorists of groups like [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), [[Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami|Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami]], [[Al-Badr (Jammu and Kashmir)|al-Badr]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammed|Jaish-e-Mohammad]] (JeM) had been building up safe houses and safe areas in strategic areas of the region of [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]] in [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] for many years over a region of 150 sq kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-defends-operation-Sarp-Vinash/articleshow/66259.cms|title=Army defends operation Sarp Vinash - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network of bunkers and shelters around the region known as Hill Kaka in Surankote numbered nearly over a hundred, and were intermingled with shelters used by local herdsmen. 9 Para-Commando Regiment were called to capture Peak 3689 in Hill Kaka after surveillance picked up footprints converging at one location. 13 terrorists were killed in this, the single largest number during operation Sarp Vinash.  6 [[Rashtriya Rifles]], 163 Brigade, 100 Brigade and the 15 Corps were also called in for operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/operation-sarp-vinash/220331|title=Operation Sarp Vinash|last=|first=|date=|work=Outlook India|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From diaries captured from killed terrorists, the presence of a rudimentary counter-intelligence system of the terrorist organisations was revealed, which involved killing women and children who had given up information to Indian security forces. An extensive communications system using portable satellite phones was also found which allowed the terrorists to contact handlers in Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/sair/Archives/1_46.htm|title=A Militia Against Terror {{!}} J&amp;K: Operation Sarp Vinash - The Army Strikes Hard {{!}} South Asia Intelligence Review (SAIR), Vol. No. 1.46|website=www.satp.org|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aftermath'''

Paratrooper [[Sanjog Chhetri]], 9 [[Para (Special Forces)|Para (SF)]], was awarded an [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]] in 2004 posthumously for his role in the Operation Sarp Vinash in which he succumbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8LjjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;dq=indian+army+para+special+forces+selection&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyk9nl-NrZAhXGP48KHXrJDkoQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20army%20para%20special%20forces%20selection&amp;f=false|title=Ashoka Chakra Recipients|last=Aggarwal|first=Rashmi|date=101|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Operation Sarp Vinash, media claims of different Indian media houses about what actually happened during the operation were hyped and very contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/reassessing-operation-sarp-vinash/220439|title=Reassessing Operation Sarp Vinash|last=|first=|date=|work=Outlook India|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Operation Sadbhavana (Goodwill) ==
'''Operation Sadbhavana''', also referred to as '''Operation Goodwill''' has been launched in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] by the [[Indian Army]] under their Military Civic Action programmes, which are aimed at "[[Winning hearts and minds|Winning the Hearts and Minds]]" (WHAM) of the people in the region. ''Sadbhavna'' literally means 'harmony', therefore the operation can also be interpreted as Operation Harmony. The catchphrase of the operation is "''Jawan aur Awam, Aman Hai Muqaam''” (peace is the destination for both the people and the soldier).&lt;ref name="Anant"&gt;Dr. Arpita Anant.

Welfare initiatives under Operation Sadbhavana include infrastructure development, medical care, women and youth empowerment, educational tours and sports tournaments among other initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16008">The '''International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace''' is a 1936 [[League of Nations]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] whereby states agreed to prohibit the use of [[broadcasting]] for [[propaganda]] or the spreading of false news. It was the first international treaty to bind states to "restrict expression which constituted a threat to international peace and security".&lt;ref name = kearney&gt;Michael G. Kearney, ''The Prohibition of Propaganda for War in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9780199232451}}) pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
In 1933, the Assembly of the League of Nations authorised the drafting of a multilateral treaty on propaganda. The Convention resulted and it was concluded and signed on 23 September 1936 at a conference in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The Convention entered into force on 2 April 1938.

Article 1 of the Convention obligates the state parties to prohibit and stop any broadcast transmission within their territories that are "of such a character as to incite the population of any territory to acts incompatible with the internal order or the security of a territory"; this article was intended to prohibit and stop propaganda from being broadcast that would incite listeners to revolution.&lt;ref name = kearney/&gt;

Article 2 of the Convention contains a similar mandate by prohibiting broadcasts that would constitute "incitement to war against another high contracting party". The Article makes no distinction between the speech of the state and the speech of private individuals.&lt;ref name = kearney/&gt;

Articles 3 and 4 prohibits the broadcasting of false news, and Article 5 states that parties to the agreement will, upon request, provide information to foreign broadcasting services that can be used to promote knowledge and understanding of the "civilization and conditions of life of his own country".

==History of legacy==
Upon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], there were 22 parties to the Convention. The effect of the Convention was severely limited by the fact that [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]‒states which waged extensive propaganda campaigns throughout the 1930s and World War II–were not parties to the Convention. Significantly, [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]] also chose to not ratify the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;Although the Soviet Union did ratify in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.

After the Second World War, depositary functions for the Convention passed from the League of Nations to the 
[[United Nations]]. In 1954, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] recognised that the Convention "was an important element in the field of freedom of information".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/841(IX)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION Resolution 841 (IX)], 17 December 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The General Assembly authorised the drafting of a Protocol which would supplement and update the Convention; however, when the draft Protocol attracted little support, the UN "abandoned all efforts at reviving the Convention".&lt;ref name = kearney/&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the Convention continued to be ratified by a few states, particularly those in the [[Communist bloc]]. However, during the 1980s, it was [[denunciation|denounced]] by [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was most recently ratified by [[Liberia]] in 2005. As of 2013, it is in force for 29 states.

==Signatories and state parties==
The following states became parties to the Convention by ratifying, acceding to, or declaring succession to it. Parties that signed the Convention on 23 September 1936 are indicated in bold. Parties that have subsequently denounced the Convention are indicated and the date of ratification is in italics.

The  '''Left of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Ljevica Hrvatske}}) is a marginal [[leftist]] [[Croatia]]n [[political party]] with no parliamentary representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hidra.hr/stranke/s028469h.htm STR: Iskaznica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Left of Croatia was created in 2007 by the merger of several parties:
* Vladimir Bebić – Third Block
* Green Left of Croatia
* Social Democratic Union
* Dalmatian Assembly
* Olive
* Socialist Party of Croatia – Left Alternative
* [[Ivan Ninić]], an [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]] [[dissident]]

The '''Social Democratic Union''' ({{lang-hr|Socijalnodemokratska unija}}) was founded in 1992, following Croatian independence, being one of very few political parties to identify itself as left-wing. Most of their members were former Communists or left-wingers displeased embracing Croatian nationalism, the excesses of privatisation and human rights abuses of ethnic minorities. The first leader of the party was [[Branko Horvat]], noted economist and one of the few Croatian intellectuals to oppose dissolution of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. In the early 1990s SDU was one of the few political parties to openly advocate co-operation and integration of Croatia with other republics of former Yugoslavia a view very different from the current Croatian political mainstream. On [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 parliamentary elections]] it turned out that SDU nevertheless enjoyed some degree of support, especially among [[Serbs of Croatia|ethnic Serbs]] living in government-controlled territories. Although it failed to break the 2% vote threshold of entry into the [[Croatian Parliament]], SDU could have hoped to win three seats by fulfilling the constitutional quota of ethnic Serbs in Sabor. Instead, the [[Croatian Constitutional Court]], in one of the most controversial decisions in their history, ruled that the seats should go to [[Serb People's Party (Croatia)|Serb People's Party]] as an "ethnic party", and presumably the only true representative of ethnic Serb minority, despite the fact SNS won fewer votes than SDU.

SDU had some success in the local elections held a few months later, but the biggest boost came to them with parliamentary status gained when [[Vladimir Bebić]], a colourful member of Sabor from [[Rijeka]], decided to join their ranks. Bebić, who enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the Croatian public, gradually became the party's leader. In the 1995 election he managed to increase SDU's vote margin, but with increased vote threshold (5%), SDU failed to enter Sabor. This, the appearance of more mainstream left-wing parties, and the establishment of a rejuvenated SDP as Croatia's main opposition party, led to SDU becoming more marginalised, struck with internal divisions and gradually phased out in late 1990s. After the [[Socialist Labour Party of Croatia]] (SRP) was formed, many SDU members joined that organization.

SDU formed joint lists for local elections in 2005 with the SRP, the Green Party and the Green Left of Croatia, but failed to enter any of the regional assemblies.

The '''Socialist Party of Croatia – Left Alternative''' ({{lang-hr|Socijalistička partija Hrvatske - lijeva alternativa}}) was a leftist party formed in 2004 when several members left the [[Socialist Labour Party of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/u-zagrebu-osnovana-nova-politicka-stranka-socijalisticka-partija-hrvatske--lijeva-alternativa/213540.aspx|title=U Zagrebu osnovana nova politička stranka: Socijalistička partija Hrvatske - Lijeva alternativa|work=[[Index.hr]]|date=17 July 2004|language=Croatian|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the local elections in 2005, the party had a joint lists with the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] in the town of [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]] and with the [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]] in [[Sisak-Moslavina County]], where it gained one seat in the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izbori.hr/arhiva/arhiva2005Lokalni/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531200706/http://www.izbori.hr/arhiva/arhiva2005Lokalni/index.html |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Green Left of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Zelena ljevica Hrvatske}}) was a leftist party formed in 2001 whose political platform was [[Ecological Socialism|ecological socialism]].
On the local elections in 2005, it formed a joint list with [[Social Democratic Union (Croatia)|Social Democratic Union]] and two other [[green parties]]. Coalition got 0.39% vote in Zagreb. It ceased to exist in 2006 and in 2007 merged into the Left of Croatia.

==Ideology==
The Party sees itself as the protector of the workers and other [[disadvantaged]] parts of society. It considers the [[Croatian privatization controversy|privatization process in the nineties]] to be criminal and supports free education and healthcare. [[Antifascism]] is declared to be one of basis of the party and it attended [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s birthday celebration. The party claims to support [[small business]] in competition with “foreign capital”. It also supports [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|EU]] and [[gay rights]], and opposes [[NATO]] membership.

The Left aims to present itself as a strongly [[Political corruption|anti-corruption]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljevica.hr/politika.html Ljevica Hrvatske&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041841/http://www.ljevica.hr/politika.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The Party is led by Croatian politician and former [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Ivan Ninić]], a former [[Member of Parliament]].

Before his death in 2009, a prominent leader was [[Vladimir Bebić]], another former MP.

==Local representation==

Ljevica was represented in the council of [[Rijeka]] by two councillors and by three in assembly of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]]. All were elected from the electoral list "Vladimir Bebić – Third Block list on the [[Croatian local elections, 2005]].

&lt;!-- and after [[Croatian local election, 2009]] ? --&gt;

==2007 elections==
Soon after its founding [[congress]], the Party announced that it will have a joint list with [[Istrian Socialdemocratic Forum]] and [[Croatian Socialdemocrats]] in [[Istria]] and [[Rijeka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/34338/ |title=Stvorena koalicija ISDF-a i Ljevice Hrvatske |trans-title=An ISDF and Croatian Left coalition is formed |language=Croatian |work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |author=Martina Zeković |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |archivedate=30 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ohQ7eLr?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/34338/stvorena-koalicija-isdf-a-i-ljevice-hrvatske |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Left also announced a coalition with [[Socialist Labour Party of Croatia]] one month before the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://izbori.hrt.hr/content/view/548/29/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117063123/http://izbori.hrt.hr/content/view/548/29/ |archivedate=2008-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 local elections==
For the 2009 local elections in Rijeka, Ljevica joined with [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]] and with [[Women's Democratic Party]] for Zagreb local elections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2360">'''Let Veneto Decide''' ({{lang-it|Il Veneto Decida}}) was a cross-party committee campaigning for a referendum on the independence of [[Veneto]] from [[Italy]].

The committee was first launched in [[Venice]] on 25 July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovigooggi.it/articolo/2013-07-26/una-fondazione-per-consultare-i-veneti-sull-autodeterminazione/#.Uh8RG395epM |title=Una Fondazione per consultare i Veneti sull'autodeterminazione - INDIPENDENZA DEL VENETO Presentata l’iniziativa "Il Veneto decida" a sostegno del progetto di legge referendaria 342 appoggiata da tutti gli indipendentisti|publisher=Rovigooggi.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veneto-stato.eu/il-veneto-decida/ |title=Il Veneto decida &amp;#124; Veneto StatoVeneto Stato |publisher=Veneto-stato.eu |date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially presented during a convention in [[Vedelago]] on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindipendenza.com/il-problema-del-veneto-e-litalia-avanti-tutta-verso-lindipendenza/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indipendenzaveneta.com/news/2013/09/05/pressing-sul-consiglio-regionale/ |title=Pressing sul Consiglio Regionale Indipendenza Veneta |publisher=Indipendenzaveneta.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee comprises or is supported by several [[Venetian nationalism|Venetist]] parties, associations and individuals, notably including:
*[[Venetian Independence]]
*[[Veneto State]]
*[[Liga Veneta Repubblica]]
*[[Veneto First]]
*[[Popular Future]]
*[[Independentist Youth]]
*Raixe Venete
*16° Reggimento Treviso
*Pasque Veronesi
*Right to Vote
*[[Lombard Committee for Resolution 44]]

In March 2014 the committee was almost completely supplanted by the birth of United for Independent Veneto, composed of [[Independent Venetians]] (a split of Venetian Independence), Veneto State, Liga Veneta Repubblica and Popular Future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?p=84&amp;n=81&amp;c=5&amp;e=91&amp;t=0&amp;idEvento=6492&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition was later transformed into [[Independence We Veneto]].

This article provides a summary of results for the '''[[general elections]]''' to the Canadian territory of '''[[Yukon Territory|Yukon]]''''s [[unicameral]] legislative body, the [[Yukon Legislative Assembly]]. The number of seats has increased over time, from eight for the first election in 1900, to the current nineteen. Since 1978, each [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] (electoral district) has elected one member by [[first past the post]] to the [[Yukon Legislative Assembly]]. [[Political party|Political parties]] were officially recognized and registered beginning in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=68&amp;art=113 |title=Yukon Celebrates its 100th Anniversary |work=Canadian Parliamentary Review |accessdate=2006-12-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214112538/http://www.parl.gc.ca/infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=68&amp;art=113 |archivedate=February 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart on the right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections on the right (going as far back as the introduction of political parties in 1978).

The [[Yukon New Democratic Party|NDP]] have won three elections, and the [[Yukon Liberal Party|Liberal]] party have won two elections.

==1978–present==

== 1900–74 ==
There were no territorial parties in the [[Yukon]] before 1978. From the territory's creation in 1898 until 1978, the Yukon was governed by a federally appointed [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioner]] advised by the Territorial Council. The Territorial council was wholly appointed from 1898 to 1900; part elected, part appointed from 1900 to 1908; and wholly elected from 1909 to 1978.

The number of members varied considerably during the council's 80-year history. The 1900 election elected just two out of eight members; the elections from 1903 to 1907 elected five out of ten members. The wholly elected Council comprised ten members from 1909, which was reduced to three starting with the 1920 election. The number of members was increased to five as of the 1952 election, seven as of the 1961 election, and twelve for the final general election to the Council in 1974.

'''Marxist Communist Party of India''', MCPI was a [[political party]] in [[India]] that formed in 1983 under the leadership of comrade Mohan Punamia. It emerged as a splinter group of [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] stuck to the original 1964 programme. The party general secretary was [[Jagjit Singh Lyallpuri]] (former [[All India Kisan Sabha]] general secretary).

MCPI was active in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar (India)|Bihar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[West Bengal]], [[Rajasthan]], Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, etc.

The principal  class mass organizations of the party were:
* [[All India Centre of Trade Unions]] (AICTU)
* [[All India Kisaan Federation]] (AIKF)
* [[All India Agricultural Workers Federation]] (AIAWF)
* [[All India Federation of Democratic Youth]] (AIFDY)
* [[All India Federation of Democratic Women]] (AIFDW)
* [[All India Federation of Democratic Students]] (AIFDS)

Ahead of the 2004 [[Lok Sabha]] elections MCPI participated in the front initiated by [[Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Kanu Sanyal)|Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)]].

In 2005 MCPI merged with other splinter groups to form the [[Marxist Communist Party of India (United)]].

'''My Stealthy Freedom''' is an [[online]] [[Social movement|movement]] that was commenced in 2014 by [[Masih Alinejad]],&lt;ref name="StartingFounder"&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 225&lt;br&gt;[[#Rouhof2016|Rouhof 2016]], pp. 1, 4, 18–19 &amp; 31&lt;br&gt;[[#SeddighiTafakori2016|Seddighi; Tafakori 2016]], p. 925&lt;br&gt;[[#TahmasebiBirgani2017|Tahmasebi-Birgani 2017]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; an Iranian-born journalist and activist based in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#NovakKhazraee2014|Novak; Khazraee 2014]], p. 1094&lt;br&gt;[[#Koo2016|Koo 2016]], pp. 142–143&lt;br&gt;[[#SeddighiTafakori2016|Seddighi; Tafakori 2016]], p. 925&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This movement started from a [[Facebook]] page ''My Stealthy Freedom'' where [[Women in Iran|women from Iran]] post their photos without [[scarf]]s, and by the end of 2016 page has surpassed 1 million Facebook likes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The initiative has received wide international and national coverage,&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016225"&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; and has been both praised and criticized.

==Chronology of My Stealthy Freedom==
{{See also|Internet in Iran|Blogging in Iran|Iranian clothing}}
The Facebook page called Stealthy Freedom was set up on 5 May 2014&lt;ref name="StartingFounder"/&gt; and it is dedicated to posting images of women with their hijab (scarf) removed.&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016225"/&gt; Many women have submitted their pictures without hijab, taken in various locations: parks, beaches, markets, streets, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Alinejad said that the campaign began rather simply:
{{Quote|text=Once I posted pictures of myself in London, free, without a scarf. I received messages from Iranian women saying: ''Don't publish there pictures because we envy you.'' Soon after I published another picture of myself driving in my hometown in Iran, again without a scarf. And I said to Iranian women: ''I bet you can do the same.'' Many of them started to send me their photos without hijab, so I created a page called '''My Stealthy Freedom.''' (...) If I were in Iran this website wouldn't exist. From far away those voiceless women can express themselves for the first time in more than 30 years.|author=M. Alinejad&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016225"/&gt;}}
In a few days, the page had received over 100,000 likes, in early 2015 it jumped up to 760,000 followers,&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016225"/&gt; and by the end of 2016 it reached over 968,000 likes.&lt;ref name="TahmasebiBirgani2017186"&gt;[[#TahmasebiBirgani2017|Tahmasebi-Birgani 2017]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview with [[BBC]] in 2014, Alinejad insisted that women who have sent their photos are ''not women activists, but just ordinary women talking from their hearts''. Many of the pictures were accompanied by captions, some in a poetic language, and others were mischievous or defiant. Many captions have placed the emphasis on a '''right to choose''' or '''freedom of choice'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Alinejad also launched '''My Forbidden Song''' as part of '''My Stealthy Freedom''' campaign, and two months later she revived the [[Green movement]] slogan ''You are all media''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

''My Stealthy Freedom'' has been described as an extremely active and lively space, publishing each month around 35–50 new pieces of content which are shared by hundreds of people.&lt;ref name="TahmasebiBirgani2017186"/&gt; In mid 2014, ''#MyStealthyFreedom'' became an internationally used [[hashtag]] on Facebook and Twitter, averaging one million shares per week.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NovakKhazraee2014|Novak; Khazraee 2014]], p. 1094&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2016, the page had shared over 2,000 photos of Iranian women without the hijab.&lt;ref name="Rouhof201621"&gt;[[My Stealthy Freedom#Rouhof2016|Rouhof 2016]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The page has gained many international supporters, posts are published mostly in Persian with [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] translations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koo2016|Koo 2016]], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Alinejad launched the White Wednesdays campaign, encouraging women to remove their headscarves on Wednesdays or wear white shawls as a sign of protest.

==Reactions==

===Related and rival initiatives===
Following Alinejad's initiative, [[LGBT rights in Iran|queers]] also opened a Facebook page, ''My Stealthy Homosexual Freedom'', posting images with the inverted aesthetics of covered faces with [[rainbow flag]]s or headless images.&lt;ref name="Ganji2015114"&gt;[[#Ganji2015|Ganji 2015]], p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Iman Ganji, a doctoral student from [[Free University of Berlin]], sees both pages as a result of general political transformation in mid-2010s, when a new [[Government of Hassan Rouhani (2013–present)|middle-right government]] replaced the [[Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)|far-right one]], and states that the struggle for the liberation of desire has long allied women's and queer movements together in Iran.&lt;ref name="Ganji2015114"/&gt; In mid-2016, some Iranian men started ''Men in hijab'' campaign, expressing their thoughts as well as briefly wearing the hijab themselves. This Facebook page has received over 100,000 likes and is largest among rival initiatives, but it has been criticized by foreign commentators as a "laddish" for containing juvenile jokes, cartoons and videos.&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016228"&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Among other smaller rivals is the ''Real Freedom of Iranian Women'' page, launched exactly a week after the ''My Stealthy Freedom'', with a message celebrating the veil: "Beautiful Hijab, My Right, My Choice, My Life".&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016228"/&gt; Former page has received less than 10,000 likes and has also been criticized for insisting that Stealthy Freedom is part of a soft war against Iran, and also for trying to generate fear.&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016229"&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise===
Sedigheh Karimi, researcher at the [[University of Melbourne]], in 2014 argued that virtual environment like ''My Stealthy Freedom'' provides opportunities for independent representation and for introducing new identities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Karimi2014|Karimi 2014]], pp. 228 &amp; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Alison N. Novak from [[Temple University]] and Emad Khazraee from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] stressed importance of breaking boundaries of the state's [[Internet censorship in Iran|internet censorship]] efforts: ''The goal of My Stealthy Freedom is to mobilize public opinion regarding the issue of women's rights, hijab, and the female body''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NovakKhazraee2014|Novak; Khazraee 2014]], p. 1095&lt;/ref&gt; Gholam Khiabany, a senior lecturer in Media and Communications department at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], has praised Alinejad's campaign,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Khiabany2016|Khiabany 2016]], p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; as has Victoria Tahmasebi-Birgani, an assistant professor of women and gender studies at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#TahmasebiBirgani2017|Tahmasebi-Birgani 2017]], p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Gi Yeon Koo, a cultural anthropologist from [[Seoul National University]],''This online movement finds its value in that it has become a new platform for women to raise their voices in the public sphere''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koo2016|Koo 2016]], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; As Iman Ganji,&lt;ref name="Ganji2015114"/&gt; Koo also aligns the movement with social changes started since [[Hassan Rouhani]] assumed the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koo2016|Koo 2016]], p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the [[Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy]] gave Alinejad its women's rights award for ''stirring the conscience of humanity to support the struggle of Iranian women for basic human rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/masih-alinejad-the-iranian-hijab-campaigner-who-wont-be-silenced-a6688626.html|title=The Iranian hijab campaigner who won't be silenced|date=2015-10-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
There are no official statistics to show what percentage of Iranian women are against mandatory wearing of the hijab. One western researcher says ''It is true that there are still many women in Iranian society who choose, of their own will, to retain the image of the hijab and wear the most conservative type of hijab. Furthermore, it cannot be said that the women participating in this stealthy movement of removing their hijab are the majority.'''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koo2016|Koo 2016]], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khiabany2016229"/&gt;

==== Misinformation ====
In early June 2014, Iranian state television ran a story claiming that Masih Alinejad was in a drug-induced, hallucionatory state when she removed her clothing and was raped by three men in front of her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aparat.com/v/Xt0Q5/%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B2_%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%87%DB%8C_%D8%A8%D9%87_%D9%85%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AD_%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C_%D9%86%DA%98%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D8%AF%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%AF%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B3 |title=Video from IRINN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alinejad said that the story is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/2820082/iranian-state-television-faked-my-rape/ |title= Iranian State Television Faked My Rape|publisher=Time |date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurocentrism and orientalism====
Researchers{{Who|date=January 2018}}{{Where|date=January 2018}} state that although movement focuses primarily on state gendered violence, its message has been disturbed by challenges arising from the embedded normativity of conceptualizations of gender and sexualities in relation to [[Middle East]]ern women in general and [[Women in Iran|Iranian women]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SeddighiTafakori2016|Seddighi; Tafakori 2016]], p. 926&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nabobs.jpg|thumb|alt=Four rows of caricatured profiles of men in 19th-century jackets and cravats, facing alternately right and left |An 1811 caricature of contemporary British nabobs]]

A '''nabob''' {{IPAc-en|'|n|eɪ|b|ɒ|b}} is a conspicuously wealthy man deriving his fortune in the [[Orient]], especially in [[India]] during the 18th century with the privately held [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smylitopoulo, Christina| title=Portrait of a Nabob: Graphic Satire, Portraiture, and the Anglo-Indian in the Late Eighteenth Century| journal=  Canadian Art Review| volume=37| issue=1|year= 2012 |url=http://www.racar-racar.com/uploads/5/7/7/4/57749791/2012_37_1_03_smylitopoulos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

''Nabob'' is an [[Anglo-Indian]] term that came to English from [[Urdu]], possibly from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] [[Nawab|''nawāb'']]/''navāb'',&lt;ref name="OXF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/nabob|title=nabob|quote=from Portuguese nababo or Spanish nabab, from Urdu; see also nawab|publisher=oxforddictionaries.com  |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loanword|borrowed]] into English during [[Colonial India|British colonial rule in India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slang dictionary, etymological, historical and anecdotal|year=1874| publisher=Chatto and Windus|place=London|page=233|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924086360488#page/n250/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible this was via the intermediate  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''nababo'', the Portuguese having preceded the British in [[India]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The word entered colloquial usage in England from 1612. Native Europeans used ''nabob'' to refer to those who returned from India after having made a fortune there.&lt;ref name="ETDIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/nabobical|title=nabobical – Word Origin &amp; History – nabob|quote=1612, "deputy governor in Mogul Empire," Anglo-Indian, from Hindi nabab, from Arabic nuwwab|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memidex.com/nabob+governor|title=nabob (governor) |quote=Etymology:Hindi nawāb, nabāb, from Arabic nuwwāb, plural of nā'ib, deputy, active...|publisher=Memidex.com  |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by [[William Safire]] in a speech written for [[United States]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Pres]]. [[Spiro Agnew]] in 1970, which received heavy media coverage. Agnew, increasingly identified with his attacks on critics of the [[Nixon administration]], described these opponents as "nattering nabobs of negativism".&lt;ref name="Nechtman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nechtman |first=Tillman W. |title=Nabobs: Empire and Identity in Eighteenth-Century Britain |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52-176353-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmY92eTAaloC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Morrow, Lance |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985217,00.html |title=Naysayer to the nattering nabobs |work=Time  |date=30 September 1996 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 19th century [[San Francisco]], rapid urbanization led to an exclusive enclave of the rich and famous on the west coast who built large mansions in the [[Nob Hill, San Francisco|Nob Hill]] neighborhood. This included prominent tycoons such as [[Leland Stanford]], founder of [[Stanford University]] and other members of [[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]] who were known as ''nabobs'', which was shortened to nob, giving the area its eventual name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sftravel.com/article/nob-hill-touch-class|title=Nob Hill - A Touch of Class|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The English use of ''nabob'' was for a person who become rapidly wealthy in a foreign country, typically India, and returned home with considerable power and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Albert Rorabacher|title=Property, Land, Revenue, and Policy: The East India Company, C.1757–1825|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCUlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the name was applied to men who made fortunes working for the [[East India Company]] and, on their return home, used the wealth [[rotten and pocket boroughs|to purchase seats]] in Parliament.&lt;ref name="UKP"&gt;Related Information – Did you know?.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/407089/nawab|title=nawab, English nabob|publisher=britannica.com  |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common fear was that these individuals – the nabobs, their agents, and those who took their bribes – would use their wealth and influence to corrupt Parliament. The collapse of the Company's finances in 1772 due to bad administration, both in India and Britain, aroused public indignation towards the Company's activities and the behaviour of the Company's employees.&lt;ref name="UKP"/&gt; [[Samuel Foote]] gave a satirical look at those men who had enriched themselves through the East India Company in his 1772 play, ''[[The Nabob]]''.

This perception of the pernicious influence wielded by nabobs in both social and political life led to increased scrutiny of the East India Company. A number of prominent Company men underwent inquiries and impeachments on charges of corruption and misrule in India.&lt;ref name="UKP"/&gt; [[Warren Hastings]], first [[Governor-General of India]], was impeached in 1788 and acquitted in 1795 after a seven-year-long trial. [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Shrewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury]], was forced to defend himself against charges brought against him in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="ETDIC"/&gt;{{refn|name=Nechtman}}{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} [[Pitt's India Act]] of 1784 gave the British government effective control of the private company for the first time. The new policies were designed for an elite civil service career that minimized temptations for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tristram Hunt|title=Cities of Empire: The British Colonies and the Creation of the Urban World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pVzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=2014|publisher=Henry Holt |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum'''|長崎原爆資料館|Nagasaki Genbaku Shiryōkan}} is in the city of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. The museum is a remembrance to the [[Bombing of Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by the United States of America 9 August 1945 at 11:02:35 am. Next to the museum is the [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]], built in 2003. The bombing marked a new era in war, making Nagasaki a symbolic location for a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=T. M.|title=The Making of a Peace Museum Tradition: Case-Studies from Japan and Cambodia|journal=Hiroshima Daigaku|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterpart in [[Hiroshima]] is the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]. These locations symbolize the nuclear age, remind visitors of the vast destruction and indiscriminate death caused by nuclear weapons, and signify a commitment to peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duff|first=T|title=Civic zones of peace|year=1997|journal=Peace review|volume=9|series=2|pages=199–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nagasaki museum was completed in April 1996, replacing the deteriorating International Culture Hall.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seltz|first=D|title=Remembering the War and the Atomic Bombs: New Museums, New Approaches|journal=Radical history review|year=1999|issue=75|pages=92–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum covers the history of the event as a story, focusing on the attack and the history leading up to it. It also covers the history of [[nuclear weapons]] development. The museum displays photographs, relics, and documents related to the bombing.&lt;ref name="at-n"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at-nagasaki.jp/foreign/english/spot/003.html|title=Learn about the menace of the atomic bomb and the value of peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Museum==
The museum at the Nagasaki Peace Park replaced the Nagasaki International Culture Hall, where artifacts related to the bombing of Nagasaki were originally exhibited. These artifacts are now supplemented with photographs depicting daily life in Nagasaki before the atomic bomb was dropped, the devastation produced by the bomb, and the history of nuclear arms development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/download/leaflet_e.pdf], Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum English language leaflet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History covered in the museum==
The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum covers the history of the bombing of [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. It portrays scenes of [[World War II]], the dropping of the atomic bomb, the reconstruction of Nagasaki, and present day. Additionally, the museum exhibits the history of [[nuclear weapons]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum|url=http://www.at-nagasaki.jp/foreign/english/spot/003.html|work=Nagasaki City Tourism Guide Amazing Nagasaki|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atomic bomb was developed by scientists working under the [[Manhattan Project]]. The project was granted funding on December 6, 1941, with American leaders aiming for a new invention that would serve as a wartime weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Conrad|title=The Atomic Bomb (6 and 9 August 1945)|url=https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5234.htm|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan had been made by 1943, and a shortlist of candidate target cities was in place in 1945. At the time, it was argued that an atomic bombing would bring about a more rapid end to the war. Hiroshima, the first target, was selected to show the power of America's new weapon. The second bombing, of Nagasaki, was intended to demonstrate that the [[United States of America|USA]] had a large arsenal.&lt;ref name="z" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Zuberi|first=Martin|title=Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|journal=Strategic Analysis|year=2001|volume=25|series=5|pages=623–662|doi=10.1080/09700160108458986}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11:02 A.M. local time on August 9, 1945, the atomic bomb, nicknamed [[Fat Man]] as its code name by [[Robert Serber]] [[Fat Man#Naming|in the United States]] (after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Vincent |title=Manhattan: The Army and the Atomic Bomb |publisher=United States Army Center of Military History |location=Washington, DC |year=1985 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/011/11-10/CMH_Pub_11-10.pdf |page=517 |accessdate=25 August 2013|oclc=10913875 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; was dropped on Nagasaki, forever changing the city's landscape.&lt;ref name="z" /&gt;  A mushroom cloud rose to an altitude of 45,000 feet above the city.

Within the museum is a history of the city before the bomb was dropped. The [[hypocenter]] of the explosion was the Urakami district, which was a traditionally rustic and isolated suburb. However, the population soared after the 1920s when the district was chosen as the site for munitions factories. An industrial zone was quickly created. Additionally, the Urakami district was home to the Nagasaki Medical College. When the bomb was dropped at 11:02 A.M. on August 9, 1945, the 20 neighborhoods within a one-kilometer radius of the hypocenter were completely destroyed by the heat flash and blast winds generated by the explosion. They were then reduced to ashes by the fires which followed. Within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the hypocenter, roughly 80% of the houses collapsed and burned. When the smoke cleared, the area was strewn with corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1945.8.9 At 11:02 a.m. August 9, 1945|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/record/photo/part_2_01.html|work=Nagasaki City-Peace &amp; Atomic Bomb|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523122932/http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/record/photo/part_2_01.html|archivedate=May 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction of the city proceeded slowly. It was not until the latter half of 1946 that the first emergency dwellings were provided to the communities. The need for buildings far surpassed the availabilities. As late as 1950, applications for corporate dwellings exceeded the availability ninety times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After the Bomb: Life in the Ruins|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_ruins.shtml|author=AtomicBombMuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national government of Japan created a war disaster reconstruction plan in November 1945 which projected a city concept which would abandon the old war industries and focus instead on a revival of foreign trade, shipbuilding, and the fishing industry. Today, the city is considered a peace city and has pledged itself to the mission of world peace.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Terence|title=The Peace Museums of Japan|journal=Museum International|date=28 June 2008|volume=49|issue=4|pages=49–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0033.1997.tb00012.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside the Museum==
The residents of Nagasaki consider it their duty to make sure the horrors which they experienced due to the atomic bombing are never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/|publisher=Nagasaki Aatomic Bomb Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64zoZgZS7?url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/|archivedate=2012-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the museum is designed in such a way that the audience can see just what effect the bomb had on the city, the reconstruction, and the lasting effects of the atomic bomb. The museum opens with a room dedicated to the city as it was just before the bomb decimated Nagasaki. A clock which stopped at 11:02, the precise time the bomb hit the city, is also on display to demonstrate how so many people were killed in an instant.

In the next section, visitors enter a room which shows Nagasaki just after the bombings. Included in this room is a water tank with contorted legs which was located at Keiho Middle School, approximately 800m away from the hypocenter of the bombing. The section "Events leading up to the Nagasaki Atomic Bombiing" isolates historical events from contemporary biases.&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt; The permanent exhibition rooms display large materials exposed to the blast, as well as a replica of a sidewall of the [[Urakami Cathedral]] which was hit by the bomb.

The purpose is to reproduce the state which the city was in immediately after the bombing. Photographs and facts are shown alongside artifacts left by the deceased.&lt;ref name="nabmb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum Brochure|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/download/leaflet_e.pdf|work=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the second section contains some of the rosaries found inside the Urakami Cathedral. At the time of the bombing, dozens of people were inside the Cathedral for confession. This section also exhibits a timeline of events which shows a course of events that occurred prior to the bomb being dropped in Nagasaki. Leaflets which American forces dropped on Japan during the early part of 1945 are on display. One gives information on the bombing of Hiroshima and the power of the atomic bomb, warning citizens to leave the city and stop fighting. Also included are melted bottles, the bones of a human hand stuck to a clump of melted glass, burnt clothing, a lunchbox with its contents still charred inside of it, and a helmet with the remains of a victim’s skull on the inner surface. Section B shows damage caused by the [[radiation]], damages caused by the blast, appeals of the [[atomic bomb survivors]], and the rescue and relief activities which were carried out.&lt;ref name="nabmb" /&gt;

After viewing the city scene, museum visitors are invited to think about issues related to war and [[nuclear non-proliferation]]. This section of the museum contains the political sections entitled "The Road to the Atomic Bombing" and "The War between China and Japan and the Pacific War". It is there that the experience of militarism in Japan and the demands of war are juxtaposed with arguments for the end of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt; Visitors are presented with facts on modern [[nuclear weapons]] alongside facts related to victims of the atomic bombing. It is a call for peace and an end of the nuclear age.

The final room in the museum contains videos and documents related to the [[Nagasaki bombing]]. Visitors can also find answers to their questions and documents like Nagasaki’s Peace Declaration.&lt;ref name="nabmb" /&gt;

==Maintenance of Exhibits==
The museum exhibits objects that were exposed to radiation from the atomic bomb. Though some materials are double-cased, display techniques generally are not tailored in any special way for the preservation of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:6vDPJkWZRPAJ:scholar.google.com/+%22nagasaki+atomic+bomb+museum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,9 page 22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
When the museum initially opened in 1966 there was criticism of the re-interpretation of Japanese history. Furthermore, the museum was considered highly political, as it presented only one side of the story and did not promote the concept of peace.&lt;ref name="s" /&gt;

Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] in 1956, became identified with the doctrine of "massive retaliation."]]
The '''New Look''' was the name given to the [[national security]] policy of the [[United States of America|United States]] during the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. It reflected Eisenhower's concern for balancing the [[Cold War]] military commitments of the United States with the nation's financial resources. The policy emphasized reliance on [[Military strategy#Cold War strategy|strategic]] [[nuclear weapon]]s to [[deterrence theory|deter]] potential threats, both [[conventional weapon|conventional]] and nuclear, from the [[Eastern Bloc]] of nations headed by the [[Soviet Union]].

==History==
[[Image:Eisenhower inspects YB52.jpg|thumb|250px|President Eisenhower and members of his Cabinet inspect the YB-52 prototype of the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]].]]
In its narrowest sense, the New Look was the name applied to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget for [[Fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 1955, which was the first defense budget prepared entirely by Eisenhower's own [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. It was based on an extensive reappraisal of U.S. military requirements that began among Eisenhower and his closest advisers immediately following his election in November 1952.&lt;ref name=Wolk&gt;Herman S. Wolk, [http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2003/August%202003/0803look.aspx "The 'New Look',"] ''Air Force Magazine'', v. 65, no. 8, (August 2003). {{ISSN|0730-6784}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formalized in [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] document [[NSC 162/2|162/2]] (NSC 162/2), which Eisenhower approved on October 30, 1953.

NSC 162/2 reflected Eisenhower's desire for a "long-haul" approach to security planning that would maintain a more or less constant level of military preparedness, consistent with the health of the [[U.S. economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, ''The Common Defense'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1961, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–68. {{ISBN|0-231-08566-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, it differed from [[NSC 68]], approved by President Harry S. Truman on September 30, 1950. Truman's advisers believed that Soviet military capabilities would reach a maximum relative to those of the United States and its allies in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=Huntington66&gt;Quoted in Huntington, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenhower rejected the idea that one period would be any more dangerous than another and urged his planners to think in terms of a Soviet threat that was economic as well as military.  He wanted to avoid, in his own words, "an unbearable security burden leading to economic disaster."&lt;ref name=Huntington66/&gt; With the costly experience of the [[Korean War]] in mind, Eisenhower was fearful that U.S. resources would be drained by Soviet-inspired regional conflicts.&lt;ref name=Wolk/&gt;

==Massive Retaliation and the New Look==

[[File:WB-47E.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] long-range bomber was the mainstay of U.S. deterrence during most of the New Look.]]
[[File:B-52A.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] long-range bomber. The first models were deployed just as the New Look took shape.]]

In order to contain defense costs, the New Look brought about a shift in emphasis from conventional military capability to "air-atomic" capability in the form of the [[Strategic Air Command]] within a scaled-down overall military establishment.  Land and naval forces were cut.  Continental air defense was expanded.  Although strategic air power attained a lower level than the Truman administration had projected, it became the centerpiece of U.S. security thinking, embodied in the doctrine of "[[Massive retaliation|Massive Retaliation]]."  Summarized in the popular slogan "more bang for the buck," Massive Retaliation was intended to be both a deterrent to an enemy and an [[economy of scale]] if deterrence failed.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, pp.&amp;nbsp;79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine was proclaimed in its most absolute form by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] in a speech before the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] on January 12, 1954, in which he said, "Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of ''massive retaliatory power'' [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bernard Brodie, ''Strategy in the Missile Age'', (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;/ref&gt; Dulles continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and able to respond vigorously at places and with means of its own choosing.

...

''Now the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can shape our military establishment to fit what is our policy, instead of having to try to be ready to meet the enemy's many choices.  That permits of a selection of military means instead of a multiplication of means,  As a result, it is now possible to get, and share, more basic security at less cost.''&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;248–249. McGeorge Bundy, a national security adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, states that President Eisenhower, although initially put off by the phrase "massive retaliatory power," not only approved the Dulles speech, but had a hand in drafting it.  McGeorge Bundy, ''Danger and Survival'', New York: Random House, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;256. {{ISBN|0-394-52278-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of Massive Retaliation===
What Dulles implied was that the United States was prepared to respond to a Soviet-backed conventional threat anywhere with a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;This was not a new theme for Dulles. In a 1952 article for ''Life'' magazine, he wrote: "There is one solution and only one: that is for the free world to develop the will and organize the means to retaliate instantly against open aggression by Red armies, so that, if it occurred anywhere, we could and would strike back where it hurts, by means of our choosing." John Foster Dulles, '"A Policy of Boldness," ''Life'', May 19, 1952, p.&amp;nbsp;151. Quoted in Townsend Hoopes, ''The Devil and John Foster Dulles'', (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1973), p.&amp;nbsp;127. {{ISBN|0-316-37235-8}} Dulles, however, was not alone in suggesting a nuclear response to a conventional threat. On January 11, 1951, at the height of the Korean War, former [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Stuart Symington]], then chair of the [[National Security Resources Board]], sent President Truman the draft of [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/korea/nsc100.htm NSC 100], which proposed using nuclear weapons not only against [[People's Republic of China|China]], which was engaged in active combat with U.S. forces, but also against the Soviet Union, which was believed to be conducting the war through China. Truman rejected the memorandum. James Carroll, ''House of War'', Boston &amp; New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;193, 202. {{ISBN|0-618-18780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Massive Retaliation such as historian [[John Lewis Gaddis]] have pointed out that the doctrine was not credible in the face of "less-than-total challenges" such as the Soviet intervention in the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], and that whatever credibility it might have had diminished steadily as Soviet strategic power grew.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of Postwar American National Security'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-19-517448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it theoretically provided the Soviet Union with an incentive to strike first to disarm the United States. The Hungarian Revolution involved a matter internal to the Eastern Bloc, so it is unclear whether any sort of conventional military response would have been undertaken regardless.

{{anchor|The "New" New Look}}
=="New" New Look==
[[File:1958-02-06 Atomic Weapons come to Korea.ogv|thumb|1958 deployment of tactical atomic weapons in Korea.]]

The refusal of the United States to act to prevent the defeat of [[France]] by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]]-led [[Viet Minh]] at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], just four months after the Dulles speech, was proof that a situation of "mutual deterrence" had developed with the Soviet Union in which the use of strategic nuclear weapons for any purpose other than to respond to a direct attack on one's homeland or on one's major allies was out of the question.  Defense planners, therefore, began shaping a "new" New Look marked by emphasis on strategic "sufficiency," not superiority; on [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s to fight "limited wars;" and on standing forces as opposed to reserves.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Huntington, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–100. Huntington uses the term "New New Look." So does George E. Lowe, ''The Age of Deterrence'', Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;89. Apparently without access to the then-classified NSC 5440, Huntington placed the beginning of the "New New Look" in December 1955 when Department of Defense planners began budget preparations for fiscal years 1958, 1959 and 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis was still primarily on nuclear weapons and the justification was still that of economy, but a shift toward what would later be called "[[flexible response]]" had begun.

The new approach was embodied in NSC{{nbsp}}5440 (approved as NSC{{nbsp}}5501 on January 7, 1955),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947-1956|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801437113|page=[https://books.google.no/books?id=w6TVdT-q7vcC&amp;pg=PA166 166]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; finalized in December 1954, which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The ability to apply force selectively and flexibly will become increasingly important in maintaining the morale and will of the free world to resist aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United States and its allies must never allow themselves to get into the position where they must choose between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people or our allies would consider entails undue risk of nuclear devastation. However, the United States cannot afford to preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local situation, if such use. . . will best advance U.S. security interests. In the last analysis, if confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b) taking measures risking either general war or loss of allied support, the United States must be prepared to take these risks if necessary for its security.''&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Quoted in Campbell Craig, ''Destroying the Village: Eisenhower and Thermonuclear War'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1998, chapter 3. {{ISBN|0-231-11123-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to historian [[Campbell Craig]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''NSC 5440 was a fundamental revision of the earlier BNSP'' [Basic National Security Policy]. ''Its authors (a) renounced massive retaliation, (b) precisely articulated the strategy of "flexible response" as it would become known seven years later, and (c) predicted, in the last sentence, exactly the dilemma which the Eisenhower administration would face in Berlin four years hence.''&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23551">'''On-demand outsourcing''' is a trend in [[outsourcing]] wherein major internal operations processes of a [[company]] are being shifted to a [[Distribution (business)|provider]] that is paid for by the number of transactions involved. The business transferring the services pays for the quality, special skills and the competence of the service provider's employees. There has been an expansion of the outsourcing concept to include on-demand outsourcing. This refers to the process undertaken by business managers to adopt an outsourcing policy that ensures that the specific business and supplies including technical manpower are accessed as the need arises. It focuses a business strategy to improve its [[goods and services]] and to drive a business towards quality improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurice F. Greaver|title=Strategic Outsourcing: A Structured Approach to Outsourcing Decisions and Initiatives|date=1999|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn, 1999|isbn= 9780814404348|pages=115–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b42-i5zwt5QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=outsourcing&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=outsourcing&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The reasons for general outsourcing can be summarized in following factors: the rising [[wages]] of the [[domestic worker]], or companies wish to gain access to the exceptional capability. The risk of outsourcing service is normally assumed by the outsourcing service provider, not by the companies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Corporate Computer Service,Inc|title=IT Outsourcing: The Reasons, Risks and Rewards|url=http://www.corpcomputerservices.com/articles/outsourcing-reasons|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, outsourcing on demand is preferred by many because of its ability to reap diverse sources of material and labour supply. Under this strategy, the driving motivation is the desire for business diversification and quality.

This type of outsourcing becomes more popular as service providers may not be able to outsource their employees on a daily basis owing to high demand and [[workload]]. Therefore, the service provider has to consider the order of [[resource allocation]] into different departments, according to the needed level and price offset by the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1= Rhode Island(US)|title=On–Demand IT Outsourcing To streamline your business requirements|url=http://www.slideshare.net/clarion_tech/on-demand-it-outsourcing-9437388|publisher=Clarion Technologies|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common that the companies will always outsource for their [[core business]].

==Essence of strategic on-demand outsourcing==
The most important difference between this type of outsourcing and general [[outsourcing]] is the critical transfer of ownership of the organisation from to a service provider. In an ideal on-demand outsourcing, there is an important passage of factors of production from the owner to the service provider. It encourages a system where business exists in a simple but comprehensive relationship. In some cases, the employees and entire [[human resources]] is transferred to the service provider. 
Notably, in order to undertake a strategic outsourcing, there are conditions that have to be met. Firstly, it should include the creation of a [[competitive advantage]]; this is an important element that should form the basis of adopting this type of outsourcing.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Secondly, on-demand outsourcing demands that the managers spend more time in streamlining the activities that are important for business success. In addition, they need to undertake repositioning of the business in the marketplace or achieve a dramatic increase in market share. When these elements and motivating factors are met, it will make the outsourcing strategy a competitive edge.

==Application in IT and financial sectors==
Leading economists {{who|date=November 2015}} suggest that on-demand outsourcing use will drive business from local to international platforms. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of each sourcing strategy, a business can gain a competitive edge over the others.

===HSBC===
[[File:HSBC GLT PUNE.jpg|thumb|HSBC GLT PUNE]]

For instance, [[HSBC]] Holdings has succeeded in acquiring other companies and integrating their customers. Originally, HSBC made the decision on outsourcing mainly because the bank started to find it difficult to update its technology and services at the same pace with the rapidly changing financial and digital world. Besides their core financial business, they also started to consider improvements on their banking services part, where their reputation could be maintained and developed.

"Moreover, we wanted to be able to turn the tap on and off whenever we wanted," says Rumi Contractor, HSBC's chief information officer for Europe, who helped build the company's outsourcing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Extra: HSBC's Lessons in Outsourcing|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-01-29/online-extra-hsbcs-lessons-in-outsourcing|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2014|format=Magazine article}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that HSBC also seeks to put more people to work according to their different talents and skills, as the larger workforce could increase the working efficiency.

Nowadays, HSBC has over 9,500 offices in 80 countries worldwide, a huge increase from the original size of 30 people working on HSBC software maintenance in India in 2002. The "back office" mainly provides call centre and bank process services for HSBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nirmal Pal|author2=Daniel Pantaleo|title=The Agile Enterprise: Reinventing your Organization for Success in an On-Demand World|date=2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387250786|pages=129–130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wZRXeXjGHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM===
IBM entered into a $5 billion manufacturing outsourcing arrangement with the [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]] in 1992. During this outsourcing process, the expanded operations of Sammina-SCI passed the $1 billion mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brown, D|title=It is good to be green: Environment friendly credentials are influencing business outsourcing decisions|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2008 |issn=1753-8297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was the only one of the successes that IBM and their outsourcing services providers achieved from the information technology outsourcing in the early 1990s. IBM has also signed a ten-year outsourcing service plan with [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd in Bangalore, India. In 2013, IBM prepared to renew this IT contract in India to compete with intense multinational and local Indian rivals that they had never faced before. The BPO outsourcing contract for managing software application and computer networks for Airtel is now estimated to be worth over $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anirban Sen|author2=Pankaj Mishra|title=Indian IT firms eye Airtel's IBM outsourcing contract|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/N3ZUp9QeuqaVvtV88HIaKM/Indian-IT-firms-eye-Airtels-IBM-outsourcing-contract.html|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two present good examples of on-demand outsourcing. Both business organizations benefited by acquiring the necessary equipment and labour from the partner company.

==Implications==

===Benefits===
In the past, the purpose of outsourcing was narrow and related to business acquisition. Today, the purpose has transformed into a strategic competitive advantage. Strategic operations and on-demand outsourcing has increased business activities, creating a transformative approach that has allowed businesses to expand their operations. In addition, on-demand outsourcing has reduced unnecessary expenditures and the quality of goods and services has been excellent.
One of the leading social benefits of this strategy is globalization. When this strategy is incorporated with the Internet, it facilitates e-commerce that has succeeded in building inter-business corporations. The formation of strong business relationships between partnering entrepreneurs has been immense. The social drive has been leading business managers to meet and discuss the future of their cooperation partnership jointly, thus enhancing each of their respective operations. Today,{{when|date=November 2015}} the concept of the globalization of business activities and e-commerce is no longer a . In fact, this form of outsourcing has enabled trust-building among partners, and a positive environment of building business has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kirti Sharda|editor1-last=Leena Chatterjee|title=Configurations of outsourcing firms and organizational performance: A study of outsourcing industry in India|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=152–178|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17538291111147991?journalCode=so|accessdate=25 October 2014|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291111147991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic impact has been immense; India has grown it on-demand outsourcing services to over 38% as per 2010.Over 400,000 people are now employed in outsourcing services in India according to the Pricewaterhouse Coopers Survey 2012. In addition, the growth in Europe has led to increasers employment opportunities and overall growth in GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ravi Kumar Jain|author2=Ramachandran Natarajan|title=Factors influencing the outsourcing decisions: a study of the banking sector in India|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=294–322|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17538291111185485|accessdate=25 October 2014|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291111185485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believe that India is an ideal country that has undergone tremendous market revolution through a diverse on-demand outsourcing. Information Technology today commands 43% of on-demand outsourcing while finance, communication and manufacturing industries have significantly embraced this form of outsourcing as significant in achieving quality of services and reduction of costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Outsourcing Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
However, the expansion of outsourcing services brought up the issue of the loss of employees in the host country. For instance, the New York Post reported that IBM employed more workers in their outsourced service provider places, such as India, than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Aidon Bryne|title=IBM now employs more workers in India than US|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/05/ibm-now-employs-more-workers-in-india-than-us/|accessdate=24 October 2014|format=News|date=October 5, 2013|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, outsourcing may be making a big comeback, as word leaked that IBM would cut about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. and move the work to India. This may be the beginning of a new wave of exporting of American jobs to developing countries, which have large pools of well-educated workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Douglas A. McIntyre|title=M and the Rebirth of Outsourcing|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1887779,00.html|accessdate=24 October 2014|magazine=Time|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries involved in on-demand outsourcing==

=== India ===
India is said to be the dominant country in providing outsourcing services in Asia, as India offers more integrated services across the offshoring spectrum, while countries such as China and Malaysia have limitations in the form of their smaller labour pools and lower-end technology in their outsourcing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karl Flinders|title=Asia dominates as outsourcing location and India remains unrivaled|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240230951/Asia-dominates-as-outsourcing-location-and-India-remains-unrivalled|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contract with IBM====
The rapidly growing, integrated outsourcing service in India also attracts some of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies set their outsource operation in India, such as [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM IT Strategic Outsourcing Services|url=http://www-935.ibm.com/services/in/gts/strategic_outsourcing|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's architects department started their outsourcing contract with the fast-growing mobile telecom firm Bharti Airtel—Jai Menon, Bharti’s former CIO, both IBM and the mobile telecom firm gained great benefits from this ten-year deal. India has become one of IBM's biggest platforms, and this resulted in the fact that IBM has more employees in India than in its U.S headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Patrick Thibodeau|title=In a symbolic shift, IBM's India workforce likely exceeds U.S.|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2493565/it-careers/in-a-symbolic-shift--ibm-s-india-workforce-likely-exceeds-u-s-.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=29 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual revenue in India was growing at two-digit rate from 2005, 55% in 2005, 37% in 2006, and stayed over 30% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Heather Timmons|title=India's emerging market roller coaster has been a brutal ride for IBM|url=http://qz.com/173601/ibms-india-problem/|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from ITO outsourcing to India, the biggest UK flag carrier [[airline]], [[British Airways]], began their business process outsourcing in India in 1996. Outsourcing services started to include the British Airways [[customer service]]s, also known as the [[World Network Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dipti Kumar|title=India Still Tops For ITO, BPO Outsourcing|url=http://www.cruxialcio.com/outsourcing-india-pays-some-2851#situation|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some predictions that there will be a recession in the Indian on-demand outsourcing industry in the early years. The analysis reported that India was still the world's [[Back office|backoffice]], whereas it put too much attention to 'servicing' information technology to other countries such as the United States. As a result, India has not yet developed its own technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sramana Mitra|title=The Coming Death of Indian Outsourcing|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/29/mitra-india-outsourcing-tech-enter-cx_sm_0229outsource.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=29 February 2008|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future challenges in India====
It seems that India has overcome these difficulties. However, there will still emerge new challenges that India will have to face in such a rapid-growing, competitive environment, such as they should consider recruiting the workforce based on quality and not quantity. They also need to consider further investments on training highly skilled individuals in order to fulfill the demand for a skilled workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsourcing Challenges in India|url=http://www.tmaworld.com/news-insights/viewpoints-articles/outsourcing-challenges-in-india/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Factors in Europe====
Based on an increase on-demand outsourcing concept in business platform, there has been a paradigm shift in the European market. The business outsourcing strategies now depend on five key factors, including current sourcing strategies in European markets, trends in the market, transition of services, contract laws and risks involved in outsourcing. According to a survey conducted among eight countries in Europe, Finland had 19% of its total goods and services using on-demand outsourcing while the United Kingdom and Spain were at 17%. Germany, the Netherlands and Norway had outsourced 15%, 13% and 10% of all services respectively. Notably, Sweden and Denmark had 9% of their service industries employing on-demand outsourcing. In addition, the survey revealed that the fundamental reasons for adopting this strategy was informed by three key issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geishecker|first1=Ingo|title=Does Outsourcing to Central and Eastern Europe Really Threaten Manual Workers' Jobs in Germany?|journal=The World Economy|date=May 2006|volume=29|issue=5|pages=559–583|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9701.2006.00800.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fundamental reasons====
#The strategy proved to be cost effective in larger-scale firms. Any leading business organizations aims to achieve operational and logistic activities that are cost effective.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} As an advantage, the process of on-demand outsourcing creates a confluence of activities integrated into one overall function, since this specific outsourcing strategy encourages limitation of activities, and encourages cutting down the operational and excess costs.
#The strategy is efficient because it allows [[division of labour]] and duties of all process to the service provider. At the service provider point, there are a series of departments that specifically deals with the delegated responsibilities to achieve quality and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsourcing in Europe|url=http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Advisory/Factors-governing-outsourcing-in-Europe-2013|publisher=© 2013 EYGM Limited|accessdate=23 October 2014|format=Survey|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is marked quality improvement due to use of an external service provider. The primary goal of on-demand outsourcing is the desire of quality goods and standardized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Per Hilletofth|author2=Olli-Pekka Hilmola|title=Role of logistics outsourcing on supply chain strategy and management: Survey findings from Northern Europe|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=46–61|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|format=Research Paper|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291011023070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==
[[Dell]], a privately owned multinational company based in the United States, is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide. However, the call center operation for the OptiPlex desktops and Latitude laptops was moved back to the United States. Dell moved its customer services and technical support centre to Bangalore in India in 2001, and set their second site in Hyderabad in 2003. However, the company found that the brand started to lose its reputation when the language and culture barrier between the customers and the employees hindered communication, especially when the employee in the Bangalore centre had professional skills but weren't experienced enough to service customers. The lack of training time on outsourcing and resolving these cultural barriers could have contributed to the strategy's lack of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elizabeth Corcoran|title=Dell moves outsource back to U.S shores|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4853511/ns/business-forbes_com/t/dell-moves-outsourced-jobs-back-us-shores/#.VEhR1twjJ_Q|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=29 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome was that even though Dell's market continued to grow, customer satisfaction declined. One of the positive outcomes was that Dell started to understand the importance of outsourcing based on the average need and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Andy McCue|title=For Dell, Indian call center failure a lesson|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001_3-5182611.html|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=March 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes also concluded that some factors that may lead to failure for companies using outsourcing services, such as desire for in-house expertise and marketplace pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Savitz|title=Why Some U.S. Companies Are Giving Up On Outsourcing|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/16/why-some-u-s-companies-are-giving-up-on-outsourcing/|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=16 Jan 2013|work=Forbes|series=CIO Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging trends and strategy==
With the growth of the global economy, it is believed that more countries, such as [[Brazil]] and Russia, will put their focus on providing on-demand outsourcing industries and services. From the perspective of individual companies and organisations, their local increasing [[Wage labour|labour]] [[wages]], facilities [[cost]] and other competitive factors will make them use such customized outsourcing service in more areas of their business. The industry experts also predict that such specific outsourcing services will not only be used mainly in the information technology and financial sector, but more focus will be put in industries such as automobile production and medicine production.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The growth of on-demand outsourcing has hugely impacted the overall performance of outpouring in business. A majority of established businesses today have established automated payments that offset the transfer of the important business operation. The expansion of this form of outsourcing to cut a competitive edge has already greatly enriched the competitive market. In a competitive market, Internet-enabled on-demand outsourcing has created an immense cost reduction and achieved higher quality of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=E.Mahmoodzadeh|author2=Sh.Jalalinia|author3=F.Nekui Yazdi|title=A business process outsourcing framework based on business process management and knowledge management|journal= Business Process Management Journal|date=2009|volume=15|issue=6|pages=845–864|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/14637150911003748|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|format=Literature review|issn=1463-7154|doi=10.1108/14637150911003748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, globalization has enabled businesses to expand outsourcing, thus attracting diverse business partnerships that have allowed businesses to continue to flourish by bringing diversity in production and service provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazzawi|first1=Elias|title=Transformational Outsourcing|journal=Business Strategy Review|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=39–43|doi=10.1111/1467-8616.00221|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8616.00221/abstract|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the future of this concept remains positive as competition in the market continues to grow.

The '''Chinese People's Armed Police Force''' (abbreviated: '''PAP''') is a Chinese [[paramilitary]] [[law enforcement|police]] ([[Gendarmerie]]) force primarily responsible for internal security, law enforcement and maritime rights protection in [[China]], as well as providing support to the PLA Ground Force during wartime.

In contrast to police officers in [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Public Security]] and other law enforcement agencies, PAP servicepersons wear olive green instead of the blue uniforms of the People's Police.

The PAP is estimated to have a total strength of 1.5 million.

== History ==
The history of the People's Armed Police is as long as that of the People's Republic, and its origin can be traced back to the [[People's Liberation Army]], which was responsible for both defending the nation from foreign invasions and internal security. Although the force was officially established in 1982, its constituent units stretch back to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Shambaugh, David L. (2004). ''Modernizing China's military: progress, problems, and prospects.'' University of California Press. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, it was soon apparent that the different troops were required for the vastly different missions, and the domestic security functions had to be removed from the People's Liberation Army. As a result, the portion of People's Liberation Army responsible for internal security and other domestic police missions branched out to form the Public Security Forces, under the administration of the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]]. Although under the Ministry of Public Security, the personnel of the PSF were not exactly public security police officers because in addition to regular police work, they were also tasked with secondary military tasks which was not part of the responsibility of regular police officers of the public security ministry but under the PLA proper.

After numerous name changes and reorganization, the PAP was created on June 19, 1982, by an amalgamation of the PLA's border control, security units and fire department, as well as from Ministry of Public Security units. The establishment of the People's Armed Police marked the efforts to professionalize the security apparatus, as well as the absorption of numerous PLA demobilized personnel,&lt;ref name="Guo2012"&gt;{{cite book |title = China's security state : philosophy, evolution, and politics |last = Guo |first = Xuezhi |publisher = Cambridge University Press, Aug |year=2012 |isbn = 9781107688841 |location = Cambridge |oclc = 874118926 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228-229}} in the wake of a growing unrest.&lt;ref name="Guo2012" /&gt;{{rp|229}}

Up until 2013, the [[China Coast Guard]] was a part of the PAP, but it was separated, since then it reports directly to the Ministry of Public Security and the [[State Oceanic Administration]]. However, in March 2018, it has been announced that the Coast Guard shall be placed under the People's Armed Police Force once again as the State Oceanic Administration has been disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-coast-guard-is-now-a-military-police-unit#gs.a7TdUr0 China's Coast Guard is Now a Military Police Unit ] The Martime Executive, March 21st 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
[[File:Tiananmen Square, August 2012 10.JPG|thumb|239x239px|People's Armed Police Guards in front of [[Tiananmen]]]]

The People's Armed Police's primary mission is internal security. The first law on the People's Armed Police, the Law on the People's Armed Police Force (PAPF), was passed in August 2009, giving it statutory authority to respond to riots, terrorist attacks or other emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-08/27/content_8625494.htm Top legislature passes armed police law]. ''[[China Daily]]''. August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wines&gt;Wines, Michael (August 27, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/asia/28china.html China Approves Law Governing Armed Police Force ]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such units guard government buildings at all levels (including party and state organisations, foreign embassies and consulates), provide security to public corporations and major public events, as well as counter-terrorism and handling of public emergencies.&lt;ref name="APF"&gt;{{cite web |title = Armed Police Force |url = http://eng.mod.gov.cn/ArmedForces/armed.htm |website = Ministry of National Defense |access-date = 22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some units perform guard duty in civilian prisons and provide executioners for the state. The PAP also maintains tactical [[counter-terrorism]] (CT) units in the [[Immediate Action Unit]] (IAU), [[Snow Wolf Commando Unit]] (SWCU) and various [[Special Police Unit]]s (SPUs).

The PAP maintains division-sized mechanized infantry unit and a rapid deployment light motorized infantry unit, these units are tasked with responding to any possible armed mutinies by PLA soldiers. In wartime deployments the PAP can act as light infantry supporting the PLAGF in local defense missions and in support of the PLAN in naval operations.&lt;ref name="Blasko2006"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Chinese Army today : tradition and transformation for the 21st century |last=Blasko  |first=Dennis J. |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415770025 |edition=2nd |location=London |oclc=68694731}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

== Organization ==
[[File:Chinese wheeled APC (2008).jpg|thumb|240px|Wheeled APC of the People's Armed Police]]

Until 31 December 2017, the People's Armed Police had a dual command structure including the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] through the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;ref name="Blasko2006" /&gt;{{rp|18}} 

By law however, the PAP operates separately from the PLA.&lt;ref name="Blasko2006"/&gt;{{rp|18}} and, in terms of conducting public security operations and relevant capability building, the PAP Headquarters is under the leadership and command of the Ministry of Public Security.

From 1 January 2018, command of the People's Armed Police is jointly held by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and the [[Central Military Commission]], with the PAP no longer subordinate to the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1082308.shtml |title=Armed police to be commanded by CPC Central Committee, CMC - Global Times |first=Global|last=Times|website=www.GlobalTimes.cn|access-date=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CD28Dec17"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Lei |title = Command of Armed Police Force to be unified - Chinadaily.com.cn|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201712/28/WS5a441fa5a31008cf16da3d96.html |accessdate=26 January 2018 |work=China Daily |date=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform was reportedly carried out in order to deprive the local [[Communist Party of China|Party]] authorities of the power to use the PAP units to commit abuses or even against the leadership in Beijing. With the new organization, local authorities need central approval in order to deploy the PAP.&lt;ref name="SCMP28Dec17"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zhou |first= Viola |title= Why China’s armed police will only take orders from Xi’s army elite |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2126039/reason-why-chinas-armed-police-will-now-only-take |accessdate= 26 January 2018 |work= South China Morning Post |date= 28 December 2017 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2018 reform, the People's Armed Police was further divided into eight corps: Internal Guard, Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, Transportation, Border Defense, Firefighting, and Safeguard Corps.&lt;ref name="Guo2012"/&gt;{{rp|232}} The Internal Guard Corps, which makes up for the bulk of PAP, is under the PAP Headquarters and reports thus to the Party CC and the CMCs. The Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, and Transportation Corps, collectively known as the Specialist Corps, are under the joint leadership of PAP Headquarters and their respective ministries in the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].&lt;ref name="Guo2012" /&gt;{{rp|232}} The Border Defense, Firefighting, and Civil Guard Corps, collectively known as the Public Security Corps, are under the direct supervision of the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]].&lt;ref name="Guo2012" /&gt;{{rp|232}}

On 21 March 2018, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] unveiled a reform plan for the People's Armed Police Force. &lt;ref name="Jamestown24Mar16PAP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zi |first1=Yang |title = Party plan for reform unveiled - China Daily |url = http://www.ecns.cn/2018/03-22/296669.shtml |website = ECNS.cn |accessdate=21 March 2018 |date=22 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this plan, the non-combatant elements of the PAP, the Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, Border Defense, Firefighting, and Civil Guard Corps, are to be removed and the [[China Coast Guard]] is to be consolidated with PAP. &lt;ref name="Ni2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjnews.com.cn/inside/2018/04/06/482152.html |title=武警改革的出与进：八大警种瘦身健体 |last=Ni |first=Wei |date=2018-04-06 |work=The Beijing News |access-date=2018-06-19 |trans-title=The Coming and Going of the PAP Reform: Eight Corps Slimming Down}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2018, the PAP is working with the Central Committee and the relevant organs for the transfer of non-combatant elements into civil service. &lt;ref name="Ni2018"/&gt; The Transportation Corps is the only remaining component of the Specialist Corps.

=== Top-level organization ===
The People's Armed Police Headquarters is the leading and commanding organ that directs and administers all the units and provides guidance to it. The PAP has a commander, a political commissar and several deputy commanders and deputy political commissars.&lt;ref name="CAPF"&gt;{{cite web |title = V. People's Armed Police Force |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/book/194480.htm |accessdate = 22 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAP also has departments responsible for logistical and political matters and several speciality departments.

=== Territorial organization ===
The People's Armed Police is composed of contingents at the level of the [[Provinces of China|province]] (autonomous region or municipality directly under the central government) and armed divisions. 

As of 2016, an Internal Guard Zongdui (总队), equivalent to a PLA Division, is stationed at the [[Provinces of China|provincial level]], with the exception of Macau and Hong Kong; Internal Guard Zhidui (支队), equivalent to a PLA Regiment, is stationed at the [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefectural level]]; Internal Guard ''Dadui'' (大队, equivalent to a PLA battalion) and Internal Guard ''Zhongdui'' (中队, equivalent to a PLA company) are stationed at the [[Counties of China|county level]].&lt;ref name="Jamestown24Mar16PAP" /&gt;

The divisions are further downsized to regiments, battalions and companies in battle order, which are stationed in a number of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the headquarters.  The PAP Headquarters has an educational institution directly under it. All the contingents have elementary command colleges under them.&lt;ref name="CAPF" /&gt;

Using the national information infrastructure, the PAP has established a preliminary system of three-level integrated information networks, linking general headquarters with the grass-roots squadrons.&lt;ref name="CAPF" /&gt;

The Specialist Corps are responsible in constructing and maintaining highways and roads, until 2018 these were responsible for surveying mineral deposits, fighting forest fires, and constructing large scale waterworks like dams and levees as well as for water works maintenance. &lt;ref name="CAPF" /&gt; The PAP is also called upon in emergency rescue and disaster relief operations within the PRC via the specialist and public security forces which can be forward deployed during such operations.&lt;ref name="CAPF" /&gt;

=== Border Defense Corps ===
Prior to the 2018 reform, the People's Armed Police Border Defense Corps ({{zh|s=边防部队|p=Biānfáng Bùdùi}}) guard China's land and sea borders, as well as its ports and airports. Its main responsibilities were the administration of border and coastal public security, ports and border inspection and surveillance, performing patrols and surveillance activities in areas adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, as well as patrols and surveillance activities along the demarcation line of the Beibu Gulf and the prevention of and crack-down on illegal and criminal acts in border and coastal areas, such as illegal border crossing, smuggling and drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="APF" /&gt;

In the 2018 reform, the Border Defense Corps is to be transferred into the civil service and demilitarized. &lt;ref name="Ni2018"/&gt;

===Ranks and insignia ===
Although their uniforms (olive green) and insignia are different from those of the PLA, PAP guards wear military-style uniforms and insignia that often leads to them being mistaken for PLA.&lt;ref&gt;栾, 尚林 (2005) [http://news.xinhuanet.com/mil/2005-01/25/content_2505172.htm 武警统一佩戴新式臂章胸标含义及使用范围 (The People's Armed Police new arm patches and badges and their uses)]. [[Xinhua]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to its history with the PLA, the PAP has a similar rank structure to the PLA and also obeys its regulations. PAP guards are also recruited at the same time and through the same procedures as PLA soldiers. However, the PAP has its own education and training system separate from the PLA. Like the PLA, the PAP also celebrates Army Day on August 1 of every year, and enjoys the same services as the PLA. The CCG, as the naval arm of the PAPF, wears naval-style insignia and uniforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5662">The '''Public Printer of the United States''' was the head of the [[United States Government Publishing Office]] (GPO). Pursuant to {{UnitedStatesCode|44|301}}, this officer was nominated by the [[President of the United States]] and approved by the [[United States Senate]]. In December 2014, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law H.R. 83, which consolidated and continued appropriations for FY 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/app/content/pkg/BILLS-113hr83enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr83enr.pdf|title=H.R. 83 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2015 |website=govinfo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1301 of that act changed the name of the Government Printing Office to the Government Publishing Office and the title of Public Printer to Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/newsroom-media/presspage/14presspage27|title=U.S. GPO press release |date=December 17, 2014 |access-date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Davita Vance-Cooks was the last Public Printer of the United States and the first [[Director of the U.S. Government Publishing Office]].

The Public Printer is responsible for the administration of the GPO. The GPO, a legislative agency of the government, provides electronic access to and produces most printed matter for government, including the [[Congressional Record]], Supreme Court decisions, passports, tax forms, internal government documents, and agency publications. The GPO does not print money, as that is a duty of the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]].

==History==
[[Benjamin Franklin]] served as Public Printer for several of the American colonies prior to the establishment of the United States. The House and Senate had separate printers until 1861, when the GPO was established; its first superintendent was [[John D. Defrees]]. The first man with the title Public Printer of the United States was [[Almon M. Clapp]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/su_docs/fdlp/history/macgilvray.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4927">'''Ricardo Dominguez''' (born 1959) is an American artist and associate professor of visual arts at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]]. He has been the subject of controversy over a number of acts of [[electronic civil disobedience]] on his own and with the [[Electronic Disturbance Theater]], which he co-founded.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

[[Image:Electronic-disturbance-theater.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ricardo Dominguez, center, with Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0, Photo by Kinsee Morlan]]

Dominguez, the founder of the [[Electronic Disturbance Theater]], has organized "virtual sit-ins" that attempted to [[Denial-of-service attack|overload and crash websites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/09/virtual_protest_as_ddos/ |work=The Register |last=Goodin |first=Dan |title='Virtual sit-in' tests line between DDoS and free speech |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/world/hacktivists-of-all-persuasions-take-their-struggle-to-the-web.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title='Hacktivists' of All Persuasions Take Their Struggle to the Web |date=October 31, 1998 |last=Harmon |first=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he and his co-founder developed a program called FloodNet that automatically requests the target page over and over. These events sometimes incorporated a search term, such that the search would return a phrase like "Transparency not found" in the [[University of California, San Diego]] website, or "human rights not found" at the website of Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{Cite news |work=Chronicle of Higher Education |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Digitally-Incorrect/124649/ |title=Digitally Incorrect |last=Goldstein |first=Evan R. |date=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/07/local/la-me-ucsd-professor-20100507-53 |work=Los Angeles Times |title=UC San Diego professor who studies disobedience gains followers -- and investigators |last=Marosi |first=Richard |date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, the [[United States Department of Defense]] diverted a planned attack to a nonexistent website.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; One goal of the movement is solidarity with Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico.

Dominguez also helped develop a phone app called the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), which would use [[GPS]] technology to help immigrants find water stations in the Southern California desert and which also includes a poetry feature.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; It also raises awareness about the number of people who die in the U.S.-Mexico border region and aims to rethink the ways in which "immigrants are always presented as less-than-human and certainly not part of a community which is establishing and inventing new forms of life."&lt;ref name="furtherfield"&gt;Global Positioning: An Interview with Ricardo Dominguez http://www.furtherfield.org/features/global-positioning-interview-ricardo-dominguez&lt;/ref&gt; TBT was subject to considerable controversy initiated by three Republican California congressmen; ultimately the University of California stated that TBT did not misuse research funds, but would not comment on whether it had broken any laws.

In an interview, Dominguez reports that his work, along with that of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, "has been to develop works that can create a performative matrix that activate and take a measure of the current conditions and intensities of power/s, communities and their anxieties or resistances."&lt;ref name="furtherfield"/&gt;

In 2015 the mother of one of his students claimed that her daughter was forced to perform nude for her final exam in the class.&lt;ref&gt;10news, [http://www.10news.com/news/mom-outraged-her-daughter-is-asked-to-perform-naked-for-ucsd-art-class-final-050915 UCSD teacher has students take final in the nude], May 9, 2015, updated May 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; UCSD officials defended Dominguez saying that the course is not required for graduation and that removing clothing is not a requirement to pass.&lt;ref&gt;10news, [http://www.10news.com/news/uc-san-diego-officials-defend-professors-art-class-that-requires-nudity-in-final-exam UC San Diego officials defend professor's art class that requires nudity in final exam], May 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure has changed over time. Version 11 was published in October 2013; it has 20 "Mandatory Requirements" grouped into four policy areas.

A '''security operations center''' ('''SOC''') is a centralized unit that deals with [[Computer security|security]] issues on an organizational and technical level.  A SOC within a building or facility is a central location from where staff supervises the site, using [[data processing]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Security: Defense Against Crime |last=de Leon |first=Sixto O. |year=1976 |publisher=National Book Store |location=Manila |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a SOC is equipped for [[Access control|access]] monitoring, and controlling of lighting, alarms, and vehicle barriers.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book |title=Building Security: Handbook for Architectural Planning and Design |last=Nadel |first=Barbara A. |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-141171-4 |pages=2.20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT ==
An [[information security operations center]] (ISOC) is a dedicated site where enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.

== The United States government ==

The [[Transportation Security Administration]] in the United States has implemented security operations centers for most airports that have federalized security.  The primary function of TSA security operations centers is to act as a communication hub for security personnel, law enforcement, airport personnel and various other agencies involved in the daily operations of airports.  SOCs are manned 24-hours a day by SOC watch officers.  Security operations center watch officers are trained in all aspects of airport and aviation security and are often required to work abnormal shifts.  SOC watch officers also ensure that TSA personnel follow proper protocol in dealing with airport security operations.  The SOC is usually the first to be notified of incidents at airports such as the discovery of prohibited items/contraband, weapons, explosives, hazardous materials as well as incidents regarding flight delays, unruly passengers, injuries, damaged equipment and various other types of potential security threats.  The SOC in turn relays all information pertaining to these incidents to TSA federal security directors, law enforcement and TSA headquarters.

[[File:中山大學南門牌坊正面.JPG|thumb|right|The slogan displayed at [[Sun Yat-sen University]].]]
"'''Serve the People'''" or "'''Service for the People'''" ({{zh|s=为人民服务|p=wèi rénmín fúwù}}) is a political slogan which first appeared in [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]-era [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It originates from the title of a speech by [[Mao Zedong]], delivered on September 8, 1944.  The slogan was also widely used in the [[United States]] by students and youth during the [[Asian American movement]] of the late 1960s and 1970s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The slogan was very popular due to the strong [[Maoist]] influence on the [[New Left]], considerably amongst the [[Red Guard Party]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the Yellow Brotherhood of [[West Los Angeles]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Origins==

Mao Zedong wrote this speech to commemorate the death of a PLA Soldier, [[Zhang Side]], a participant in the [[Long March]] who died in the collapse of a kiln. In the speech he quoted a phrase written by the famous [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]], "Though death befalls all men alike, it may be heavy as Mount Tai or light as a feather." ("人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。"). Mao continued: "To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather. Comrade Zhang Side died for the people, and his death is indeed weightier than Mount Tai."

The concept of "Serving the People", together with other slogans such as "Never benefit oneself, always benefit others" and "Tireless struggle" became core principles of the [[Communist Party of China]].

==Role during the Cultural Revolution==

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the speech was widely read. Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] was frequently seen wearing a pin emblazoned with the slogan "Serve the People" next to a portrait of Mao Zedong.

==Roles in modern society==
===Ceremonial role===
Although less often used in China today, the phrase still plays some important ceremonial roles. It is inscribed on the screen wall facing the front entrance of the [[Zhongnanhai]] compound, which houses the headquarters of the [[Central People's Government]] and the [[Communist Party of China]].

During inspection of troops in the [[People's Liberation Army]], the following ceremonial exchange is carried out:
:Inspecting official: "Greetings, Comrades!" ({{lang|zh-Hans|同志们好}} ''tóng zhì men hǎo'')
:Troops: "Greetings, Leader!" ({{lang|zh-Hans|首长好}} ''shǒu zhǎng hǎo'')
:Inspecting official: "Comrades [you] have worked hard." ({{lang|zh-Hans|同志们辛苦了}} ''tóng zhì men xīn kǔ le'')
:Troops: "'''Serving the people!'''" ({{lang|zh-Hans|为人民服务}} ''wèi rén mín fú wù'')

===Cultural role===

In 2007, actress [[Cameron Diaz]] caused a minor controversy by carrying a bag with the "Serve the People" slogan in Chinese on a tour of Peru. Many Peruvians felt the bag to be a show of support for the Maoist movement [[Shining Path]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A '''referendum on a war tax''' was held in [[Switzerland]] on 6 June 1915.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1907 {{ISBN|9783832956097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they approved of amending the constitution to introduce a one-off war tax.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; It was approved by a large majority of voters and all cantons,&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; the first time a referendum had been passed in every canton.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, pp1900-1907&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The referendum was a [[mandatory referendum]],&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; which required a double majority; a majority of the popular vote and majority of the cantons.&lt;ref name=N2&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1891&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of each canton was based on the vote in that canton.&lt;ref name=N2/&gt; Full cantons counted as one vote, whilst half cantons counted as half.&lt;ref name=N2/&gt;

'''TestPAC''' (formerly known as "TestPAC, Please Ignore") is a [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]], non-connected [[political action committee]] in the [[United States]]. Its Chairman is [[Jeromie Whalen]]. It is best known for its 2012 campaign to defeat incumbent U.S. Representative [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]] (R-TX) in response to the Congressman's introduction of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and H.R.1981 &lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1981:&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TestPAC was registered with the [[Federal Election Commission]] on January 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00511055 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622232113/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00511055 |archivedate=2015-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TestPAC started when several members of the [[Reddit]] community initiated a [[netroots]] boycott of [[GoDaddy.com]] and "Operation Pull Ryan", where Reddit members helped [[Paul Ryan|Paul Ryan's]] opponent, [[Rob Zerban]] raise $15,000 in 48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/12/reddit-forces-paul-ryan-play-defense-sopa/46782/ |title=Reddit Forces Paul Ryan to Play Defense on SOPA – The Atlantic Wire |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ryan eventually came out in opposition of SOPA, activists [[Andy Posterick]] and [[Jeromie Whalen]] formed a political action committee for potential future campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/us/2012/03/30/meet-testpac-an-upstart-political-action-committee-that-calls-reddit-home/ |title=Meet TestPAC: An upstart political action committee that calls Reddit home – The Next Web |publisher=The Next Web |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TestPAC was originally registered as "TestPAC, Please Ignore." The name is a play on an inside joke on Reddit;&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/us/2012/03/30/meet-testpac-an-upstart-political-action-committee-that-calls-reddit-home/&lt;/ref&gt; the site's most popular post ever was titled "Test Post, Please Ignore." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
TestPAC [[crowdsource]]s its mission, goals and campaigns from its member-base on the PAC's discussion forum on Reddit. Although most decisions are made among PAC members, major decisions are put to an official vote on the PAC's website. So far, the organization has held two official votes: one asking members whether to campaign against Lamar Smith and one to decide on a concept for a billboard advertisement.

TestPAC primarily relies on crowdfunding as a means of fundraising and solicits donations on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/internet_pac_goes_after_lamar_smith-213332-1.html |title=Internet PAC Goes After Lamar Smith – RollCall |publisher=Roll Call |date=22 March 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current campaigns==
{{Update|section|date=May 2015}}
In February 2012, TestPAC members voted between removing 13-term incumbent Lamar Smith from office or [[Campaign Finance Reform]] for the PAC's first target issue. With 63% of the vote, members elected to start a campaign against Lamar Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://testpacpleaseignore.org/polls/ |title=What Should TestPAC's First Target Issue Be? |publisher=TestPAC |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was officially titled "Mr. Smith Comes Back From Washington".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2012/02/13/test-pac-aims-unseat-lamar-smith |title= TestPAC Aims To Unseat Lamar Smith Washington |publisher=DailyTexan |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TestPAC had chosen this campaign primarily because of Rep. Smith's support of the controversial [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and introduction of H.R. 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2012/02/13/test-pac-aims-unseat-lamar-smith |title= TestPAC Aims To Unseat Lamar Smith Washington |publisher=DailyTexan |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary strategy for accomplishing this is encouraging registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to vote in the May 29th semi-open Republican Primary against Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testpacpleaseignore.org/unseatlamar/?page_id=57 |title=How To Defeat Smith |publisher=TestPAC |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/03/texmessage-rep-lamar-smith-faces-challenge-from-grassroots-pac/ |title=Mad about SOPA, grassroots group tries to defeat Rep. Lamar Smith |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2012, TestPAC released its first television commercial &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testpacpleaseignore.org/unseatlamar/ |title=Dear Mr. Smith |publisher=TestPAC |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==

Test PAC's leadership structure is volunteer-based and open to anyone. The PAC lists several officers on its website who organize operational elements of the PAC's campaigns and manage day-to-day operations of the organization. According to the Federal Election Commission, [[Andrew J Posterick]] is registered as the PAC Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_detail/C00511055/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623000315/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_detail/C00511055/ |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Wolff''' (2 August 1868 – 23 September 1943) was a [[Germany|German]] writer who was influential as a journalist, critic and newspaper editor.&lt;ref name=Kühn&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108–109|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and died in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdw-berlin.de/vertiefung/biografien/personenverzeichnis/biografie/view-bio/theodor-wolff/?no_cache=1|title=Short biography of Theodor Wolff|publisher= [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]]|access-date= 27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1933 he was the chief editor of the politically liberal newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''.

His talent as a writer won praise from an unlikely quarter: In 1939 [[Joseph Goebbels]] recommended his [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] staff to study Wolff's contributions in back numbers of the newspaper that he had edited. According to Goebbels, despite his being Jewish, the quality of Wolff's writing was matched by only very few in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexander Kühn|title=Mut zur Wahrheit|publisher=''Spiegel Geschichte''|volume=5(2014|pages=108|date=30 September 2014|quote=Das Lob kam von höchster Stelle, doch es war verlogen und zynisch. Sie sollten mal in den alten Bänden des ''Berliner Tageblatts'' nachlesen, empfahl Propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels 1939 seinen Parteischreibern,  bei einem 'gewissen Theodor Wolff', der 'zwar Jude' sei, 'aber schreiben konnte wie nur ganz wenige in Deutschland'.}} What Goebels did not mention was that as a younger man he had himself on at least one occasion applied to work for the newspaper in question.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
Theodor Wolff was born in [[Berlin]], second of the four recorded children of a fabric wholesaler from [[Silesia]] called Adam Wolff by his marriage to Recha, née Davidsohn. Recha was a doctor's daughter from [[Danzig]]. Wolff grew up in a [[Grand Burgher|prosperous]] Jewish family. He rapidly achieved good results at the prestigious [[:de:Königliches Wilhelms-Gymnasium (Berlin)|King William I Grammar school]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Goldmann&gt;Christel Goldmann: ''Distanzierte Beobachtung: Theodor Wolff und das Judentum. "…&amp;nbsp;es sind zwar nicht meine Kerzen, aber ihr Licht ist warm"''. Oldenburg 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married in 1902, in Paris, the actress Marie Louise Charlotte Anna Hickethier (known as Änne), coming from a Protestant [[Prussia]]n family. The couple had three children: Richard Wolff (born in [[Paris]], 14 June 1906), Rudolf Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 9 July 1907) and Lilly Wolff (born in [[Berlin]], 7 August 1909). The children were baptised as Protestants.

===Journalism mostly===
In 1887 Wolff's cousin [[Rudolf Mosse]] recruited him to his successful publishing conglomerate. Mosse was 25&amp;nbsp;years older than Wolff, to whom he provided a thorough commercial and journalistic training across all the departments of his publishing business, the "Mosse-Verlag".&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn&gt;Peter de Mendelssohn: ''Zeitungsstadt Berlin. Menschen und Mächte in der Geschichte der deutschen Presse''. Frankfurt am Main 1982, page 180 et seq&lt;/ref&gt; During these years Wolff also found time to write some early novels, inspired by [[Theodor Fontane]] whom he greatly admired, and several plays which were staged in Berlin,&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; though in his memoirs he would later describe these as "not particularly distinguished". In 1889 he was one of the ten co-founders of the Berlin theatre company, [[:de:Freie Bühne (Verein)|''Freie Bühne'']] ("Free stage").

Wollf's written contributions to the ''Tageblatt'' focused initially on cultural matters and literature, but he soon switched his focus towards political journalism.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; An early journalistic success at the newspaper was a daily bulletin on the health of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|the emperor]] (who was dying of throat cancer). Emperor Frederick died in June 1888 and Wolff embarked on an itinerant career, writing pieces and sending them in to Berlin by telegraph from, successively, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Italy. In 1894 the paper sent him to Paris, where he would live for the next twelve years.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

As the [[Paris]] correspondent of the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' Wolff, identified in print only as "our Paris correspondent", produced numerous contributions covering public life in France. During 1896 he became known for his coverage of the [[Dreyfus affair]], one of the most high-profile news stories of the decade in western Europe.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; His early ambitions to become a novelist were now being overtaken by his success as a journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Editor-in-chief to the ''Berliner Tageblatt''===
====1906–1918====
In autumn 1906, Rudolf Mosse offered Theodor Wolff the top job at the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''. Between 1906 and 1933 Wolff served the ''Tageblatt'' as editor-in-chief, developing it into one of Germany's most influential newspapers. Circulation under his stewardship rose from 100,000 to more than 300,000.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His powerful prose was notably on display in the Monday editions of the paper for which he wrote the [[Editorial|lead article]], frequently exhorting fellow citizens to political participation. In respect of foreign policy, he quickly positioned the ''Tageblatt'' in opposition to "great power politics", imperial and military assertiveness and the risk of international isolation to which these were leading Germany. On domestic issues the paper's attitude under Wolff favoured [[civil rights]] and a liberal-democratic approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Henning Zabel: "Rudolf Mosse". In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie''. Vol. 18. Berlin 1997, pp. 213–217.&lt;/ref&gt; advocating a "parliamentarisation" ("Parlamentarisierung") of the [[Constitution of the German Empire|constitution]] and vigorously opposing the [[Prussian three-class franchise|"Dreiklassenwahlrecht"]]&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; which had been introduced in 1849 and which was, by the beginning of the twentieth century, widely perceived as a badly flawed application of the democratic ideal.

At this time Wolff promoted numerous writers including [[Victor Auburtin]] whose individualistic approach he valued and who played an important part in defining the newspaper's liberal profile.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmar Klute: "Der Kulturkonservative. Die deutsch-französische Geschichte des [[Victor Auburtin]]"  (SZ-Serie über große Journalisten, IX). In: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 3 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Germany's traditionalist [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Bernhard von Bülow]], refused any interviews or statements to the ''Tageblatt'' while his successor, [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]], instructed all government departments to steer well clear of the newspaper's reports and opinions.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

In July 1916, the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' was temporarily banned. Wolff reacted by refusing to publish anything for several months, which was picked up and used abroad in the savage [[British propaganda during World War I|propaganda battle]] that was a major element in the increasingly desperate conduct of the [[First World War]]. Wolff refused to compromise his editorial line, and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' continued to promote the politically toxic view that the only route to a lasting peace was for Germany to come to an understanding with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]] (Ed.): ''Theodor Wolff. Tagebücher 1914–1919. Der Erste Weltkrieg und die Entstehung der Weimarer Republik in Tagebüchern, Leitartikeln und Briefen des Chefredakteurs am "Berliner Tageblatt" und Mitbegründers der "Deutschen Demokratischen Partei"''. München 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1918–1933====
In November 1918 Theodor Wolff was one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP),&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP/&gt; committed to individual freedom and social responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He had himself played a central role in the party's defining manifesto, but he took no leadership position within the DDP preferring, not for the last time, the role of a powerful newspaper editor. It was in this role that he called on the government to reject the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"&gt;[[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]]: ''Theodor Wolff. Ein Leben mit der Zeitung''. Econ Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], who in the early summer was briefly the German Chancellor, invited Wolff to take on the position of German Ambassador to [[Paris]] but, again, Wolff opted to remain a Berlin-based journalist.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

On 4 December 1926 Wolff resigned his [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] membership. The resignation came in response to the acceptance by a large number of the party's [[:de:Liste der Reichstagsabgeordneten der Weimarer Republik|Reichstag Members]] of tightened censorship laws against so-called dirty and trashy literature.&lt;ref name=HorWagDDP&gt;Horst Wagner: [http://luise-berlin.de/BMS/bmstext/9811gesa.htm „Die Gründung der DDP 1918“.]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} In: ''[[Berlinische Monatsschrift]]'', 11/1998 beim [[:de:Luisenstädtischer Bildungsverein|Luisenstädtischen Bildungsverein]].&lt;/ref&gt;   ([[Kurt Tucholsky]], one of the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most high-profile contributors, had also, on the world stage, sharply condemned DDP support for these measures.) Wolff nevertheless remained powerfully influential, a leading advocate for democracy and moderation, welcomed as a dinner guest by various government ministers.&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt; Wolff was also continuing to attract important writers as contributors for the ''Tageblatt''. In 1926 he persuaded the pugnaciously liberal journalist-lawyer [[Rudolf Olden]]&lt;ref&gt;"He was a German Liberal of the best sort, rather more pugnacious than the average British Liberal, because he had more to fight against." – [[Gilbert Murray]] on Rudolf Olden: Foreword to ''The History of Liberty in Germany'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; to move his base from [[Vienna]] to [[Berlin]].

Germany's military defeat and the catastrophic economic aftermath did much to discredit democratic politics during the 1920s, which saw a corresponding growth in support for right wing politics, which in their turn favoured somewhat 'tribal' definitions of the political sphere. Theodor Wolff and his ''Berliner Tageblatt'' (the "Jewish news-sheet", ''das Judenblatt'') were increasingly targeted by [[:de:Deutschnationale Bewegung|nationalists]] and during the 1920s nationalists were increasingly setting the country's political agenda. His name started to appear on the death lists of various radical-right and populist groups, causing Wolff to become anxious that he might share the fate of [[Walther Rathenau]], the generally popular Jewish [[Foreign Minister]] and fellow [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] member who had been shot dead by a gang of [[Ernst Werner Techow|three extremists]] in June 1922. Anxiety that he might be murdered by racist extremists remained with him for the rest of his life. His counterpart at the right wing [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg media group]], editor in chief [[:de:Friedrich Hussong|Friedrich Hussong]], stirred up popular hatred of Wolff, whom he identified as a representing the liberal metropolitan press.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn/&gt;

The [[German federal election, 1930|Reichstag election of September 1930]] transformed the country's political landscape, with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist party]] increasing its share of the popular vote from 2.6% to 18.3%, which under the country's multi-party system left it as the second largest party in the Reichstag. Right wing extremism was suddenly mainstream and at the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' the publisher's proprietor, [[Hans Lachmann-Mosse]], who had taken over from [[Rudolf Mosse|his father-in-law]], mandated a turn towards the right for the newspaper. The business was also in financial trouble thanks to poorly timed investment decisions and intensified competition from the by now openly anti-Semitic [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg Group]].&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt;

===Exile===
The night of 27 to 28 February 1933 was the night of the [[Reichstag fire]]. It was also the night on which Theodor Wolff, whose hostility to a Nazi future was undiminished and who had been warned by colleagues that his name was on the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] death list, fled Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; His initial destination, traveling via [[Munich]], was the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]].  From there he moved on to Switzerland. However, the Swiss refused to issue him with a residence permit and by the end of 1933 Theodor Wolff and his wife had ended up in [[Nice]], which since 1860 had been part of France.

Theodor Wolff's last [[Editorial|lead article]] in the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' appeared on 5 March 1933, the day of the last multi-party [[German federal election, March 1933|German election]] until 1949. In March 1933 the ''Tageblatt''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s proprietor (who himself, being Jewish, was effectively deprived of control over his business later in the month), removed Wolff from his editorship responding to political pressure&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; following the flight from Berlin.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; In May 1933 Wolff's books were among those listed by the government for the public [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]].  Wolff celebrated his 65th&amp;nbsp;birthday in 1933 and played very little part in the political struggles of the many German Jewish exiles who were gravitating to Nice at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff fought vainly against the rise of National Socialism, but as an exile he turned away from political issues: After his former newspaper, the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', reported on the so-called [[Night of the Long Knives|"Röhm-Putsch"]] of 30&amp;nbsp;June 1934 under the headline "Crackdown!" ("Durchgegriffen!") he cancelled his subscription.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions nevertheless remained clear enough, and on 26 October 1937 he was deprived of his German citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the legal consequences of this expatriation, cf. the introduction (p. xii-xiii) to Michael Hepp (Ed.): ''Die Ausbürgerung deutscher Staatsangehöriger 1933–45 nach den im Reichsanzeiger veröffentlichten Listen''. Vol. 1. Munich 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In exile Wolff reverted to writing books, while still contributing occasional pieces of journalism to (non-German) newspapers.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt; Two historical-political works met with little success.&lt;ref name=Kühn/&gt; He dedicated his last novel, ''Die Schwimmerin'' ("The [female] Swimmer") to his secretary from the Berlin days, [[Ilse Stöbe]] (1911–1942). His project to have a film produced on the basis of this novel, with [[Greta Garbo]] in the starring role, could not be realised.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Ulrich Sahm (Botschafter)|Ulrich Sahm]]: ''Ilse Stöbe''. In: Hans Coppi, Jürgen Danyel, Johannes Tuchel (Ed.): ''Die Rote Kapelle im Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus.'' Schriften der [[Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand]], Berlin 1994, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff continued to distance himself from [[Zionism|Zionist separatism]], believing throughout his life in a "German-Jewish symbiosis" ("deutsch-jüdische Symbiose").&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

===Arrest and death===
After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] on 22 June 1940 Theodor Wolff applied, unsuccessfully, for permission to emigrate to United States:  he remained in Nice. The coastal strip along the south-eastern part of France including, from late 1942, [[Nice]] was in the process of being [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|annexed by Italy]], and on 23 May 1943 Theodor Wolff was arrested by the Italian civil authorities. He was handed over to the [[Gestapo]] and interned in a [[Marseilles]] jail before being transferred to the [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy detention centre]] near Paris. Drancy was used as a collection point for Jewish internees scheduled for deportation to internment camps and death camps in Germany, and Wolff now found himself transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] to the east of Berlin. Now aged 75, and ill with [[Phlegmon]], his fellow internees pleaded successfully for him to be sent to the [[:de:Jüdisches Krankenhaus Berlin|Jewish Hospital]] in Berlin. Here he was admitted on 20 September 1943: he died three days later.&lt;ref name=Goldmann/&gt;

Theodor Wolff's body is buried in the "row of honour" at Berlin's [[Weißensee Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="bernd-sösemann"/&gt;

==Posthumous honour==
In 1961 the [[Theodor Wolff Prize]] for newspaper journalism was founded, and it has since 1962 been awarded annually. Since 1973 the prize has been awarded by the [[:de:Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger|German Newspaper Publishers' Association (BDZV / ''Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger'')]].

{{Politics of Venezuela}}
The '''Vice President of Venezuela''' ({{lang-es|Vicepresidente de Venezuela}}), officially known as the '''Executive Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela''' ({{lang-es|Vicepresidente Ejecutivo de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela}}), is the second highest political position in the government of [[Venezuela]]. The Vice President is the direct collaborator of the [[President of Venezuela|President of the Republic]] according to the [[Constitution of Venezuela|Constitution]]. The office of Vice President appeared in the Constitution of 1830 until the Constitution of 1858, and once again in the Constitution of 1999. However, in its current (1999) incarnation, the office is more akin to a [[Prime Minister]] in systems as those of [[Prime Minister of France|France]] and [[Prime Minister of South Korea|South Korea]].

Since June 14, 2018, [[Delcy Rodríguez]] of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] has been Vice President to [[Nicolás Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/2018/06/14/enterate-nicolas-maduro-anuncia-cambio-de-gabinete-via-twitter/|title=¡Entérate!

# To name and to remove, in accordance with the law, the officials or national officials whose designation is not attributed to another authority.
# To substitute for the President of the Republic on temporary and absolute absences.

===Appointment and removal===
The Executive Vice President is appointed and removed by the President. Vice President can also be removed with more than two-thirds of the votes in [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]]. If the National Assembly removes three Vice Presidents from office during a six-year presidential term, the President is authorized to dissolve the Parliament. 

===Presidential succession===
Executive Vice President is the first in line to the succession of the [[President of Venezuela]], when President is unable to fulfill the duties of office in the exceptional cases established in the Article 233 and 234 of the National Constitution.

Former Vice Presidents [[Andrés Navarte]], [[Carlos Soublette]], [[Diosdado Cabello]] (in April 2002) and [[Nicolás Maduro]] (in 2012–2013) were all once acting Presidents of Venezuela. Soublette and Maduro were also later elected as President.

It was active in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives of the Netherlands]] as the '''Group Bontes/Van Klaveren''' ({{lang-nl|Groep Bontes/Van Klaveren}}), a [[parliamentary group]] that was formed on 15 April 2014 by [[Louis Bontes]] and [[Joram van Klaveren]], two [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Members of the House]] that had left the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV), the party they were originally elected to represent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlement.com/id/vjixikpr6dzh/nieuws/ex_pvv_ers_bontes_en_van_klaveren Ex-PVV'ers Bontes en Van Klaveren bundelen krachten in Tweede Kamer], parlement.com, 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22507383/__Nieuwe_Kamerfractie_Bontes_en_Van_Klaveren__.html |title=Bontes en Van Klaveren vormen nieuwe Kamerfractie |website=Telegraaf.nl |language=Dutch |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2014 Louis Bontes, Joram van Klaveren and [[Johan Driessen]] announced the formation of a new political party.

After failing to garner any seats in the 2017 general elections and with no further financial means, members voted to absolve the party on 18 June of that year.

==History==
On May 28, 2014, the group officially founded a new political party, '''VoorNederland''' (VNL) (in English ''For the Netherlands'' or ''Pro-Netherlands''), a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]&lt;ref name=Beginsverklaring/&gt; and [[eurosceptic]] [[list of political parties in the Netherlands|political party]].&lt;ref name=VNL/&gt;

On 13 November 2014, the party announced that it would cooperate with the [[UK Independence Party]] in the [[Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://politiek.eenvandaag.nl/radio-tv-items/55294/bontes_van_klaveren_gaat_samenwerken_met_ukip |title=Bontes/Van Klaveren gaat samenwerken met UKIP |website=EenVandaag Politiek |language=Dutch |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://politicsatsurrey.ideasoneurope.eu/2014/12/16/ukips-euro-party-decision/ |title=UKIP’s Euro-Party decision |website=Politics at Surrey |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 and January 2015, VNL was joined by former PVV leader in the European Parliament [[Laurence Stassen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.powned.tv/nieuws/politiek/2014/12/stassen_terug_in_politiek.html |title=Stassen terug in politiek |website=PowNed |language=Dutch |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, leading up to the [[Dutch provincial elections, 2015|2015 provincial elections]], two provincial PVV representatives from [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Gelderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2012076-pvv-raakt-opnieuw-statenlid-kwijt.html |title=PVV raakt opnieuw Statenlid kwijt |website=NOS |language=Dutch |date=7 January 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January 2015 it was announced that the members of the party [[Article 50 (political party)|Article 50]] had voted to merge it into VoorNederland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Bas |last=Paternotte |date=27 January 2015 |url=http://politiek.thepostonline.nl/2015/01/27/artikel-50-gaat-op-vnl-van-bontesvan-klaveren/ |title=Artikel 50 gaat op in VNL van Bontes/Van Klaveren |website=ThePostOnline |language=Dutch |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2015 it was announced that jurist and former lawyer [[Bram Moszkowicz]] would become the party leader and ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' of VoorNederland at the next Dutch general election, planned for 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/2031532-moszkowicz-voelt-zich-klaar-voor-de-politiek.html "Moszkowicz voelt zich klaar voor de politiek"] NOS.nl, 21 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but after nine months he was rejected by the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/24998632/__VNL_zet_Moszkowicz_uit_partij__.html "VNL zet Moszkowicz uit partij"] Telegraaf.nl. 13 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 Dutch general election]], VoorNederland failed to win a single seat, securing just 0.4% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/adviezen-en-publicaties/rapporten/2017/3/kerngegevens-tweede-kamerverkiezing-2017/kerngegevens-tweede-kamerverkiezing-2017 |title=Kerngegevens Tweede Kamerverkiezing 2017 |website=Kiesraad |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2017 the party was dissolved by its members congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://nos.nl/artikel/2178740-geen-geld-geen-zetel-geen-leider-vnl-heft-zich-op.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==
VNL was a proponent of [[small government]] and proposed the introduction of a low [[flat tax]] rate. Furthermore, it supported investment in the police and defence, and it wanted to limit the powers of the [[European Union]] to a free trade area, and a stricter immigration policy.&lt;ref name=Beginsverklaring/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11273">The '''Webster–Hayne debate''' was a famous debate in the [[United States]] between [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Daniel Webster]] of [[Massachusetts]] and Senator [[Robert Y. Hayne]] of [[South Carolina]] that took place on January 19–27, 1830 on the topic of [[protectionist]] [[tariff]]s.  The heated speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were unplanned, and stemmed from debate over a resolution by Connecticut Senator [[Samuel A. Foot]] calling for the temporary suspension of further land surveying until land already on the market was sold (this would effectively stop the introduction of new lands onto the market). Webster's "Second Reply to Hayne" was generally regarded as "the most eloquent speech ever delivered in [[United States Congress|Congress]]."&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union" (1947) 1:288&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster's description of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] as "made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people," was later paraphrased by [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[Gettysburg Address]] in the words "government of the people, by the people, for the people."

==Analysis==
Massachusetts Senator [[Daniel Webster]]'s "First Reply" to South Carolina Senator [[Robert Y. Hayne]] has long been thought of as a great oratorical celebration of American Nationalism in a period of sectional conflict. The 1834 Webster–Hayne debate centered around the [[South Carolina]] [[nullification crisis]] of the late 1820s, but historians have largely ignored the sectional interests underpinning Webster's argument on behalf of Unionism and a transcendent nationalism. In many respects, his speech betrays the mentality of Massachusetts conservatives seeking to regain national leadership and advance their particular ideas about the nation. Webster realized that if the social, political, and economic elite of Massachusetts and the Northeast were to once again lay claim to national leadership, he had to justify New England's previous history of sectionalism within a framework of nationalistic progression. Though Webster made an impassioned argument, the political, social, and economic traditions of New England informed his ideas about the threatened nation. Even more pointedly, his speech reflected a decade of arguments from other Massachusetts conservatives who argued against supposed threats to New England's social order.&lt;ref&gt;Sheidley, Harlow W.

=== Schroider's analysis ===
{{quote|South Carolina nullification was now coming in sight, and a celebrated debate which belongs to the first session exposed its claims and its fallacies to the country.  The arena selected for a first impression was the Senate, where the arch-heretic himself presided and guided the onset with his eye.  Hayne, South Carolina's foremost Senator, was the chosen champion; and the cause of his State, both in its right and wrong sides, could have found no abler exponent while Calhoun's official station kept him from the floor.  It has been said that Hayne was Calhoun's sword and buckler, and that he returned to the contest refreshed each morning by nightly communions with the Vice-President, drawing auxiliary supplies from the well-stored arsenal of his powerful and subtle mind.  Be this as it may, Hayne was a ready and copious orator, a highly{{As written|-educated}} lawyer, a man of varied accomplishments, shining as a writer, speaker, and counselor, equally qualified to draw up a bill or to advocate it, quick to  memories, well fortified by wealth and marriage connections, dignified, never vulgar nor unmindful of the feelings of those with whom he mingled, Hayne moved in an atmosphere where lofty and chivalrous honor was the ruling sentiment. But it was the honor of a caste; and the struggling bread-winners of society, the great commonalty, he little studied or understood. This was the man to fire an aristocracy of fellow citizens ready to arm when their interests were in danger, and upon him it devolved to advance the cause of South Carolina, break down the tariff, and fascinate the Union with the new rattlesnake theories.

The great debate, which culminated in Hayne's encounter with Webster, came about in a somewhat casual way. Senator Foote, of Connecticut, submitted a proposition inquiring into the expediency of limiting the sales of public lands to those already in the market. This seemed like an Eastern spasm of jealousy at the progress of the West. Benton was rising in renown as the advocate not only of Western settlers, but of a new theory that the public lands should be given away instead of sold to them. He joined Hayne in using this opportunity to try to detach the West from the East, and restore the old cooperation of the West and the South against New England. The discussion took a wide range, going back to topics that had agitated the country before the Constitution was formed. It was of a partizan and censorious character, and drew nearly all the chief senators out. But the topic which became the leading feature of the whole debate and gave it an undying interest was that of nullification, in which Hayne and Webster came forth as chief antagonists. . . .

Hayne launched his confident javelin at the [[New England]] States. He accused them of a desire to check the growth of the West in the interests of protection. Webster replied to his speech the next day, and left not a shred of the charge, baseless as it was. Inflamed and mortified at this repulse, Hayne soon returned to the assault, primed with a two-day speech, which at great length vaunted the patriotism of South Carolina and bitterly attacked New England, dwelling particularly upon her conduct during the late war. It was a speech delivered before a crowded auditory, and loud were the Southern exultations that he was more than a match for Webster. Strange was it, however, that in heaping reproaches upon the Hartford Convention he did not mark how nearly its leaders had mapped out the same line of opposition to the national Government that his State now proposed to take, both relying upon the arguments of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of 1798–99]].

Webster rose the next day in his seat to make his reply. He had allowed himself but a single night from eve to morn to prepare for a critical and crowning occasion. But his reply was gathered from the choicest arguments and the richest thoughts that had long floated through his brain while this crisis was gathering; and bringing these materials together in lucid and compact shape, he calmly composed and delivered before another crowded and breathless auditory a speech full of burning passages, which will live as long as the American Union, and the grandest effort of his life. Two leading ideas predominated in this reply, and with respect to either Hayne was not only answered but put to silence. First, New England was vindicated. As a pious son of [[Federalism]], Webster went the full length of the required defense.

Some of his historical deductions may be questioned; but far above all possible error on the part of her leaders, stood colonial and Revolutionary New England, and the sturdy, intelligent, and thriving people whose loyalty to the Union had never failed, and whose home, should ill befall the nation, would yet prove liberty's last shelter. Next, the Union was held up to view in all its strength, symmetry, and integrity, reposing in the ark of the Constitution, no longer an experiment, as in the days when Hamilton and Jefferson contended for shaping its course, but ordained and established by and for the people, to secure the blessings of liberty to all posterity. It was not a Union to be torn up without bloodshed; for nerves and arteries were interwoven with its roots and tendrils, sustaining the lives and interests of twelve millions of inhabitants. No hanging over the abyss of disunion, no weighing of the chances, no doubting as to what the Constitution was worth, no placing of liberty before Union, but "liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable." This was the tenor of Webster's speech, and nobly did the country respond to it. . . .

Some of Webster's personal friends had felt nervous over what appeared to them too hasty a period for preparation. But his cool, unperturbed manner reassured them in an instant. He entered the Senate on that memorable day with slow and stately step, and took his seat as though unconscious of the loud buzz of expectant interest with which the crowded auditory greeted his appearance. He was dressed with scrupulous care, in a blue coat with metal buttons, a buff vest rounding over his full abdomen, and his neck encircled with a white cravat. He rose, the image of conscious mastery, after the dull preliminary business of the day was dispatched, and with a happy figurative allusion to the tossed mariner, as he called for a reading of the resolution from which the debate had so far drifted, lifted his audience at once to his level. Then he began his speech, his words flowing on so completely at command that a fellow-senator who heard him has likened his elocution to the steady flow of molten gold. There was an end of all apprehension. Eloquence threw open the portals of eternal day. New England, the Union, the Constitution in its integrity, all were triumphantly vindicated; and the excited crowd which had packed the Senate chamber, filling every seat on the floor and in the galleries, and all the available standing room, dispersed after the orator's last grand apostrophe had died away on the air, with national pride throbbing at the heart.

Massachusetts men, gloomy and downcast of late, now walked the avenue as though the fife and drum were before them. Hayne's few but zealous partizans shielded him still, and South Carolina spoke with pride of him. His speech was indeed a powerful one from its eloquence and personalities. But his standpoint was purely local and sectional. The people read Webster's speech and marked him for the champion henceforth against all assaults upon the Constitution. An undefinable dread now went abroad that men were planning against the peace of the nation, that the Union was in danger; and citizens looked more closely after its safety and welfare. Webster's speech aroused the latent spirit of patriotism. Even Benton, whose connection with the debate made him at first belittle these grand utterances, soon felt the danger and repudiated the company of the nullifiers. He remained through his long public career a Southern Unionist, and a good type of the growing class of statesman devoted to slave interests who loved the Union as it was and doted upon its compromises.|from James Schouler, ''History of the United States.''

'''Yellow Springs''' is a [[Village (Ohio)|village]] in [[Greene County, Ohio|Greene County]], [[Ohio]], United States.  The population was 3,487 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. It is part of the [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] [[Greater Dayton|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].  It is home of [[Antioch College]] and [[Antioch University Midwest]].

==History==
In 1825, the village was founded by William Mills and approximately 100 families, followers of [[Robert Owen]], who wanted to emulate the [[utopian]] community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. The [[communitarianism|communitarian]] efforts dissolved due to internal conflicts.  The [[Little Miami Railroad]] was completed in 1846 and brought increased commerce, inhabitants, and tourism. The village was incorporated in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA878#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioch College was founded in 1850 by the [[Christian Connection]], and began operating in 1853 with the distinguished scholar [[Horace Mann]] as its first president.  In 1920, [[Arthur Ernest Morgan|Arthur E. Morgan]] became the innovative president of Antioch College, implementing a much-imitated work-study program for students. An engineer by training, Morgan left Antioch to become head of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Administration. Upon his return to Yellow Springs, Morgan was a key leader of [[Quaker]] intentional community developments in Ohio and [[North Carolina]].  Antioch College was closed by Antioch University in 2008 but reopened, as an independent college, in 2011.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/can-antioch-college-return-from-the-dead-again.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Can Antioch College Return From the Dead Again? |author=Donahue, Bill |date=September 16, 2011 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conway Colony, a group of 30 freed slaves who were transported by [[Moncure D. Conway]], the abolitionist son of their former owner, settled in the village in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ysnews.com/news/2010/02/a-history-of-racial-diversity |title=A history of racial diversity |author=Chiddister, Diane |date=February 4, 2010 |work=Yellow Springs News |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wheeling Gaunt, a former slave who purchased his own freedom, came to Yellow Springs in the 1860s and owned a substantial amount of land upon his death in 1894.  Gaunt bequeathed to the village a large piece of land on its western side, requesting that the rent be used to buy flour for the "poor and worthy widows" of Yellow Springs.  Although the land was used to create Gaunt Park, and thus does not generate rent, the village expanded the bequest to include sugar and still delivers flour and sugar to the village's widows at Christmas time, a tradition that generates annual media coverage.&lt;ref name="YSNews"&gt;

During the [[Red Scare]] of the 1950s, Yellow Springs and Antioch came under scrutiny for alleged sympathies to the [[Communist Party]] due to many locals' support of [[left-wing politics]].&lt;ref name=Red&gt;{{cite book |title=Two Hundred Years of Yellow Springs |last=Chiddister |first=Diane |year=2005 |publisher=Yellow Springs News |location=Yellow Springs, OH |isbn=0976915804 |pages=145–148 |accessdate=July 21, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nM-dwSs0NeEC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=yellow+springs+in+the+1960s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=urOrdgLBgE&amp;sig=Bvni0Q2E-TLNZgFUi5IDy6OAlYI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=yellow%20springs%20in%20the%201960s&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being questioned by the Ohio [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], Antioch president [[Douglas McGregor]] released a statement in 1952 that "Antioch upholds the American tradition of academic freedom.
