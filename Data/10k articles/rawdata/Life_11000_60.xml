'''Saint Abaskhiron the Soldier''' or '''Saint Eskhayron the Soldier''' is an [[Egypt]]ian [[martyr]]. The name “Abaskhyron” is derived from two words, “Abba” which means ''father'', is given to him due to respect (despite his young age in martyrdom). The second part of the name, “skhyron,” sometimes “eshseros,” “eskaros” means ''the strong''&lt;ref&gt;Atiya, Aziz S. ''The Coptic Encyclopedia.'' New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-897025-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Saint Abaskhiron was from the city of [[Qallin]], a governorate of [[Kafr El Sheikh Governorate|Kafr el Sheikh]]. He was one of the soldiers of Arianus, governor of [[Ansena]]. When the [[Edict of Diocletian]] to worship the idols was issued, Abaskhiron arose among the people present, and refused to worship the idols. The governor became furious and struck the saint on his mouth. Immediately the saint stepped up and took off his soldier's uniform and threw it on the ground, in front of the governor. This stirred the governor's anger even more and order to throw him in the dungeon, a suffocating atmosphere and awful odor, where Christians were brutally tortured. Abaskhiron stay in prison, which was in the palace of the Governor, in [[Asyut]], courageously and fearlessly ready to endure any pain. Five other soldiers agreed with Abaskhiron to shed their blood in the Name of Christ. Their names were: Alfius, Armanius, Arkias, Peter, and Cranius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-mary-alsourian.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2987:the-martyrdom-of-st-abaskhiroun-the-soldier&amp;catid=79:english&amp;lang=en|title=St. Mary AlSourian Monastery|last=user2|website=www.st-mary-alsourian.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor crucified some and cut off the heads of the others.

As for Abaskhiron, the Governor tortured him with different kinds of tortures, but the Lord comforted him, strengthened him, and healed his wounds. The Governor order the greatest sorcerer, Alexandros to prepare poison to kill him. Alexandros took out a snake and started to recite santanic verses till the snake split open in two pieces in front of everybody. Then he took the snake's poison and parts of his belly, put it in a cup and began to recite the same satanic names and language again. Abaskhiron took the poison, made the sign of the cross over it, and drank it in the name of Jesus of Nazareth while the sorcerer was calling on Satin, no harm came upon Abaskhiron. The sorcerer marveled, and he believed in the God of Abaskhiron. The Governor cut off the head of the sorcerer, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The Governor became more enraged and tortured Abaskhiron extensively throwing him in the furnace and blinding his eyes, but the Lord sent his [[Archangel Michael]], who drew his wings over the Saints eyes and healed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sheheet.com/abaskhiroun/|title=غفير برية شيهيت|date=2015-08-08|work=شيهيت Sheheet.com|access-date=2018-03-17|language=ar-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly Abaskhiron was beheaded and received the crown of martyrdom.

==Miracle of moving the Church of St. Abaskhiron==
In Abaskhiron hometown of Qallin (north of Egypt), the believers had a tradition where they celebrated group weddings for their sons and daughters. While they were together celebrating their weddings in St. Abaskhiron Church in Qallin, some evildoers surrounded the church planning to kill everyone inside. The congregation asked for the intercession of St. Abaskhiron, who miraculously transported the entire church with its people, a tree and the well to another village called Biho (south of Egypt), which is where the church exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stmarystminacopticchurch.org/saint_abaskhyroon.html|title=Saint AbaSkhyroon|website=stmarystminacopticchurch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
His relics are kept in the [[Monastery of Saint Pishoy]] and [[Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor]]. His feast day is 14 June (7 [[Paoni]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lives of Saints :: Paona 7|url = http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/10_7.html=11&amp;day=24&amp;btn=View&amp;lang=|website = copticchurch.net|accessdate = 2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its causes are numerous. Generally it occurs because of damage to the kidney [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] caused by decreased [[renal blood flow|kidney blood flow]] (kidney [[ischemia]]) from any cause (e.g., [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]), exposure to [[nephrotoxin|substances harmful to the kidney]], an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] process in the kidney, or an obstruction of the [[urinary tract]] that impedes the flow of urine. AKI is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings, such as elevated [[blood urea nitrogen]] and [[creatinine]], or [[oliguria|inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine]].

AKI may lead to a number of complications, including [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hyperkalaemia|high potassium levels]], [[uremia]], changes in body [[fluid balance]], and effects on other [[organ system]]s, including death. People who have experienced AKI may have an increased risk of [[chronic kidney disease]] in the future. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care, such as [[renal replacement therapy]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical picture is often dominated by the underlying cause.The symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name=Skorecki&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Skorecki K, Green J, Brenner BM |veditors=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1653–63 |chapter=Chronic renal failure|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marked increases in the [[potassium]] level can lead to [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], which can be severe and life-threatening.&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weisberg LS | title = Management of severe hyperkalemia | journal = Crit.

Pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions (such as [[thrombosis|clotting]] of the kidneys' blood vessels or [[nephritis|inflammation of the kidney]]); this is the result of stretching of the [[renal capsule|fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the kidney]].&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Brady HR, Brenner BM |veditors=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1644–53 |chapter=Chronic renal failure|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the kidney injury is the result of dehydration, there may be [[thirst]] as well as evidence of fluid depletion on [[physical examination]].&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; Physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the kidney problem, such as a [[rash]] in interstitial nephritis (or [[vasculitis]]) and a palpable [[urinary bladder|bladder]] in obstructive nephropathy.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

==Causes==

===Classification===
Acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of [[clinical history]] and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in [[renal function|kidney function]], as measured by serum [[creatinine]], or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed [[oliguria]] (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).

AKI can be caused by systemic disease (such as a manifestation of an autoimmune disease, e.g. [[lupus nephritis]]), [[crush syndrome|crush injury]], [[Contrast-induced nephropathy|contrast agents]], some antibiotics, and more. AKI often occurs due to multiple processes. The most common cause is dehydration and sepsis combined with nephrotoxic drugs, especially following surgery or [[contrast agents]].

The causes of acute kidney injury are commonly categorized into ''prerenal'', ''intrinsic'', and ''postrenal''.

Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of patients following cardiac surgery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thiele, R. Et al. AKI Associated with Cardiac Surgery. ''Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology''. 2015; Vol 10, n 3. &lt;/ref&gt;  Mortality increases by 60-80% in post-cardiopulmonary bypass patients who go on to require renal replacement therapy.  Preoperative creatinine greater than 1.2mg/dL, combined valve and bypass procedures, emergency surgery, and preoperative intraaortic balloon pump are risk factors most strongly correlated with post-cardiopulmonary bypass acute kidney injury.  Other well-known minor risk factors include: female gender, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Prerenal===
''Prerenal'' causes of AKI ("pre-renal azotemia") are those that decrease effective [[renal blood flow|blood flow to the kidney]] and cause a decrease in the [[glomerular filtration rate|glomerular filtration rate (GFR)]]. Both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function. Notable causes of prerenal AKI include [[hypovolemia|low blood volume]] (e.g., dehydration), [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[heart failure]] (leading to [[cardiorenal syndrome]]), [[liver cirrhosis]] and local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney. The latter include [[renal artery stenosis]], or the narrowing of the [[renal artery]] which supplies the kidney with blood, and [[renal vein thrombosis]], which is the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] in the [[renal vein]] that drains blood from the kidney.

===Intrinsic===
Intrinsic AKI refers to disease processes which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can be due to one or more of the kidney's structures including the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]], [[nephron|kidney tubules]], or the [[interstitium]]. Common causes of each are [[glomerulonephritis]], [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN), and [[acute interstitial nephritis]] (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are [[rhabdomyolysis]] and [[tumor lysis syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Cassidy |author2=Donald Bissett |author3=Roy A. J. Spence |author4=Miranda Payne |title=Oxford Handbook of Oncology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoQW4G0g14C&amp;pg=PA706 |date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=706|isbn=978-0-19-956313-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain medication classes such as [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[tacrolimus]]) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.

===Postrenal===
''Postrenal'' AKI refers to acute kidney injury caused by disease states downstream of the kidney and most often occurs as a consequence of [[urinary tract]] obstruction. This may be related to [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]], obstructed [[urinary catheter]], [[bladder stone]]s, or cancer of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Ureteral cancer|ureters]], or [[prostate cancer|prostate]].

==Diagnosis==

===Definition===
Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group. KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury. Kidney inter.&lt;/ref&gt; specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of AKI.

AKI can be diagnosed if any one of the following is present:
* Increase in SCr by ≥0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours; or
* Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which has occurred within the prior 7 days; or
* Urine volume &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 hours.

===Staging===
The ''RIFLE criteria'', proposed by the [[Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative]] (ADQI) group, aid in assessment of the severity of a person's acute kidney injury. The acronym RIFLE is used to define the spectrum of progressive kidney injury seen in AKI:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellomo R, Ronco C, Kellum JA, Mehta RL, Palevsky P | title = Acute renal failure - definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group | journal = Crit Care | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R204–12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15312219 | pmc = 522841 | doi = 10.1186/cc2872 | url = http://ccforum.com/content/8/4/R204 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110123205645/http://ccforum.com/content/8/4/R204 | archivedate = 2011-01-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lameire N, Van Biesen W, Vanholder R | title = Acute renal failure | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 365 | issue = 9457 | pages = 417–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15680458 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17831-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Acute Renal Failure.svg|thumb|Pathophysiology of acute kidney injury in the proximal renal tubule]]
* Risk: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease by 25 percent, or urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg per hour for six hours.
* Injury: Two-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 50 percent, or urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg per hour for 12 hours
* Failure: Three-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 75 percent, or urine output of &lt;0.3 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours, or no urine output (anuria) for 12 hours
* Loss: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than four weeks
* [[End-stage kidney disease]]: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than three months

===Evaluation===

The deterioration of kidney function may be signaled by a measurable decrease in urine output. Often, it is diagnosed on the basis of [[blood test]]s for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: [[urea]] and [[creatinine]]. Additionally, the [[BUN-to-creatinine ratio|ratio of BUN to creatinine]] is used to evaluate kidney injury. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers has been proposed (such as [[NGAL]], [[KIM-1]], [[Interleukin 18|IL18]] and [[cystatin C]]), but none of them is currently established enough to replace creatinine as a marker of kidney function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=P|year=2018|title=The future for diagnostic tests of acute kidney injury in critical care: evidence synthesis, care pathway analysis and research prioritisation.|url=https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/hta22320#/abstract|journal=Health Technol Assess|volume=22|issue=32|pages=|doi=10.3310/hta22320|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the diagnosis of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50–100&amp;nbsp;ml suggests [[neurogenic bladder dysfunction]].

These may include urine sediment analysis, [[renal ultrasound]] and/or [[kidney biopsy]]. Indications for kidney biopsy in the setting of AKI include the following:&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-159124-9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-159124-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unexplained AKI, in a patient with two non-obstructed normal sized kidneys
# AKI in the presence of the [[nephritic syndrome]]
# Systemic disease associated with AKI
# Kidney transplant dysfunction

In [[medical imaging]], the acute changes in the kidney are often examined with [[renal ultrasonography]] as the first-line modality, where [[CT scan]] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for the follow-up examinations and when US fails to demonstrate abnormalities. In evaluation of the acute changes in the kidney, the echogenicity of the renal structures, the delineation of the kidney, the renal vascularity, kidney size and focal abnormalities are observed.&lt;ref name=Hansen2015&gt;Content initially copied from: {{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Kristoffer|last2=Nielsen|first2=Michael|last3=Ewertsen|first3=Caroline|title=Ultrasonography of the Kidney: A Pictorial Review|journal=Diagnostics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2015|pages=2|issn=2075-4418|doi=10.3390/diagnostics6010002}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC-BY 4.0)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=2017-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CT is preferred in renal traumas, but US is used for follow-up, especially in the patients suspected for the formation of urinomas. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis. However, in AKI, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated as the [[contrast agent]] used is nephrotoxic.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Treatment==
The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a [[nephrologist]]. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called [[nephrotoxin]]s. These include [[NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]], [[iodinated contrast]]s such as those used for [[CT scan]]s, many [[antibiotics]] such as [[gentamicin]], and a range of other substances.&lt;ref name=pmid18492867 /&gt;

Monitoring of kidney function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]] helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.

===Prerenal===
In prerenal AKI without [[hypervolemia|fluid overload]], administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s is typically the first step to improving kidney function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a [[central venous catheter]] to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.

If [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] persists despite providing a person with adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase blood pressure ([[vasopressor]]s) such as [[norepinephrine (drug)|norepinephrine]] and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart's ability to pump (known as [[inotrope]]s) such as [[dobutamine]] may be given to improve blood flow to the kidney. While a useful vasopressor, there is no evidence to suggest that [[dopamine]] is of any specific benefit and may be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes CL, Walley KR | title = Bad medicine: low-dose dopamine in the ICU | journal = Chest | volume = 123 | issue = 4 | pages = 1266–75 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12684320 | doi = 10.1378/chest.123.4.1266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic===
The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to [[steroid]] medication, [[cyclophosphamide]], and (in some cases) [[Plasmapheresis|plasma exchange]]. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, [[aminoglycosides]], [[penicillins]], NSAIDs, or [[paracetamol]].&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt;

The use of [[diuretics]] such as [[furosemide]], is widespread and sometimes convenient in improving fluid overload. It is not associated with higher mortality (risk of death),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Uchino S, Doig GS, Bellomo R, Morimatsu H, Morgera S, Schetz M, Tan I, Bouman C, Nacedo E, Gibney N, Tolwani A, Ronco C, Kellum JA | title = Diuretics and mortality in acute renal failure | journal = Crit. Care Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 1669–77 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15286542 | doi = 10.1097/01.CCM.0000132892.51063.2F }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor with any reduced mortality or length of [[intensive care unit]] or hospital stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis A, Gooch I | title = The use of loop diuretics in acute renal failure in critically ill patients to reduce mortality, maintain renal function, or avoid the requirements for renal support | journal = Emergency Medicine Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 569–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16794108 | pmc = 2579558 | doi = 10.1136/emj.2006.038513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postrenal===
If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a [[nephrostomy]] or [[urinary catheter]]) may be necessary.

===Renal replacement therapy===
[[Renal replacement therapy]], such as with [[hemodialysis]], may be instituted in some cases of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of [[intermittent hemodialysis]] and [[continuous venovenous hemofiltration]] (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis).&lt;ref name="pmid18285591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pannu N, Klarenbach S, Wiebe N, Manns B, Tonelli M | title = Renal replacement therapy in patients with acute renal failure: a systematic review | journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 299 | issue = 7 | pages = 793–805 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18285591 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.7.793 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18285591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis.&lt;ref name="pmid18492867"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Palevsky PM, Zhang JH, O'Connor TZ, Chertow GM, Crowley ST, Choudhury D, Finkel K, Kellum JA, Paganini E, Schein RM, Smith MW, Swanson KM, Thompson BT, Vijayan A, Watnick S, Star RA, Peduzzi P | title = Intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–20 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18492867 | pmc = 2574780 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0802639 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=18492867&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19846848"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellomo R, Cass A, Cole L, Finfer S, Gallagher M, Lo S, McArthur C, McGuinness S, Myburgh J, Norton R, Scheinkestel C, Su S | title = Intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 17 | pages = 1627–38 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19846848 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0902413 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=19846848&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies demonstrated that compared with IRRT, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoenfelder|first1=T|last2=Chen|first2=X|last3=Bless|first3=HH|title=Effects of continuous and intermittent renal replacement therapies among adult patients with acute kidney injury|journal=GMS Health Technol Assess|date=March 2017|volume=13|issue=Doc01 (20170301)|url=http://www.egms.de/static/en/journals/hta/2017-13/hta000127.shtml|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154219/http://www.egms.de/static/en/journals/hta/2017-13/hta000127.shtml|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=AG|last2=Bellomo|first2=R|last3=Bagshaw|first3=SM|last4=Glassford|first4=NJ|last5=Lo|first5=S|last6=Jun|first6=M|last7=Cass|first7=A|last8=Gallagher|first8=M|title=Choice of renal replacement therapy modality and dialysis dependence after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Intensive care medicine|date=June 2013|volume=39|issue=6|pages=987–97|doi=10.1007/s00134-013-2864-5|pmid=23443311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications===
[[Metabolic acidosis]], [[hyperkalemia]], and [[pulmonary edema]] may require medical treatment with [[sodium bicarbonate]], antihyperkalemic measures, and diuretics.

Lack of improvement with [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]], therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate [[renal replacement therapy|artificial support]] in the form of [[dialysis]] or [[hemofiltration]].&lt;ref name=Weisberg/&gt;

==Prognosis==

===Mortality===
Mortality after AKI remains high. Overall it is 20%, 30% if the patient is referred to nephrology, 50% if dialyzed, and 70% if on ICU.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

If AKI develops after major abdominal surgery (13.4% of all people who have undergone major abdominal surgery) the risk of death is markedly increased (over 12-fold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Connor|first1=M. E.|last2=Kirwan|first2=C. J.|last3=Pearse|first3=R. M.|last4=Prowle|first4=J. R.|title=Incidence and associations of acute kidney injury after major abdominal surgery|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=24 November 2015|volume=42|issue=4|pages=521–30|doi=10.1007/s00134-015-4157-7|pmid=26602784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidney function===
Depending on the cause, a proportion of patients (5–10%) will never regain full kidney function, thus entering [[end-stage kidney failure]] and requiring lifelong dialysis or a [[kidney transplant]]. Patients with AKI are more likely to die prematurely after being discharged from hospital, even if their kidney function has recovered.&lt;ref name=harrison18 /&gt;

The risk of developing [[chronic kidney disease]] is increased (8.8-fold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coca|first1=SG|last2=Singanamala|first2=S|last3=Parikh|first3=CR|title=Chronic kidney disease after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Kidney International|date=March 2012|volume=81|issue=5|pages=442–48|doi=10.1038/ki.2011.379|pmid=22113526|pmc=3788581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
New cases of AKI are unusual but not rare, affecting approximately 0.1% of the UK population per year (2000 ppm/year), 20x incidence of new ESKD. AKI requiring dialysis (10% of these) is rare (200 ppm/year), 2x incidence of new ESKD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renalmed.co.uk/database/acute-kidney-injury-aki |title=Renal Medicine: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) |publisher=Renalmed.co.uk |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808022413/http://www.renalmed.co.uk/database/acute-kidney-injury-aki |archivedate=2013-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased incidence of AKI in agricultural workers, particularly those paid by the piece. No other traditional risk factors, including age, BMI, diabetes, or hypertension, were associated with incident AKI. Agricultural workers are at increased risk for AKI because of occupational hazards such as dehydration and heat illness.&lt;ref&gt;Moyce, Sally, RN, BSN; Joseph, Jill, MD, PhD; Tancredi, Daniel, PhD; Mitchell, Diane, PhD; Schenker, Marc, MD, MPH (2016) "Cumulative Incidence of Acute Kidney Injury in California's Agricultural Workers" ''Journal of Environmental Medicine JOEM'' 58 Number 4, April 2016 391–97&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute kidney injury is common among hospitalized patients. It affects some 3–7% of patients admitted to the hospital and approximately 25–30% of patients in the [[intensive care unit]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-4160-3110-3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brenner and Rector's The Kidney |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-3110-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute kidney injury was one of the most expensive conditions seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011, with an aggregated cost of nearly $4.7 billion for approximately 498,000 hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;Torio CM, Andrews RM. National Inpatient Hospital Costs: The Most Expensive Conditions by Payer, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #160. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD.

==History==
Before the advancement of [[modern medicine]], acute kidney injury was referred to as ''uremic poisoning'' while [[uremia]] was contamination of the [[blood]] with [[urine]]. Starting around 1847, ''uremia'' came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called [[oliguria]], which was thought to be caused by the urine's mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the [[urethra]].{{citation needed | date=April 2011}}

Acute kidney injury due to [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) was recognized in the 1940s in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], where [[Crush syndrome|crush injury]] victims during the [[London Blitz]] developed patchy necrosis of kidney tubules, leading to a sudden decrease in kidney function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bywaters EG, Beall D | title = Crush injuries with impairment of renal function. | journal = [[British Medical Journal|Br Med J]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4185 | pages = 427–32 | year = 1941 | pmid = 20783577 | pmc = 2161734 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4185.427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam wars]], the incidence of AKI decreased due to better acute management and administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schrier RW, Wang W, Poole B, Mitra A | title = Acute renal failure: definitions, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy | journal = J.

'''Adolph Coors III''' (January 12, 1916 – February 9, 1960) was the grandson of [[Adolph Coors]] and heir to the [[Coors Brewing Company]] empire.


==Life and career==

Coors was born on January 12, 1915, the son of Alice May (née Kistler; 1885–1970) and [[Adolph Coors II|Adolph Coors Jr]]. He attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[New Hampshire]]. Like his father and his youngest brother [[Joseph Coors]], Adolph graduated from [[Cornell University]], where he was president of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society and a member of The [[Kappa Alpha Society]]. Coors was also a [[semi-professional]] baseball player. At the time of his death, he was CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Coors Brewing Company in Golden, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutcher|first1=Brandon|date=April 1994|title=For Adolph Coors IV, Money Couldn't Fill the Emptiness Inside|url=http://brandondutcher.blogspot.com/2005/11/for-adolph-coors-iv-money-couldnt-fill.html|website=Double Dutch|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coors married Mary Urquhart Grant in November 1940.

On the morning of February 9, a milkman discovered Coors' International Travelall on the bridge, empty of occupants and with the radio on.

On September 15, 1960, a shirt belonging to Coors, and his skull, were found in a remote area near [[Pikes Peak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/today-in-history-throwback-thursday-september-15/6/|title=The way it was: Today in history - Sept. 15|date=2016-10-19|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/crime-history-coors-brewery-heir-killed-in-botched-kidnap-attempt|title=Crime History: Coors brewery heir killed in botched kidnap attempt|date=2011-02-08|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there were no witnesses, prosecutors built their case against Corbett through circumstantial and forensic evidence. Corbett's coworkers overheard him talking about a plan that would earn him over a million dollars and the ransom note [[typeface]] was traced back to Corbett's typewriter.&lt;ref name=mara/&gt; The biggest piece of evidence, however, was the dirt found in the undercarriage of the yellow Mercury.

'''Amastris''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἄμαστρις}}; killed c. 284 BC) also called '''Amastrine''', was a Persian princess. She was the daughter of [[Oxyathres of Persia|Oxyathres]], the brother of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian King]] [[Darius III]].&lt;ref name=arr_7.4 group="Note" /&gt;

==Life==
Amastris was given by [[Alexander the Great]] in marriage to [[Craterus]],&lt;ref name=arr_7.4 group="Note" /&gt; however Craterus later decided to marry [[Phila (daughter of Antipater)|Phila]], one of the daughters of [[Antipater]].  Still, he first arranged his wife's advantageous marriage to [[Dionysius of Heraclea|Dionysius]], [[tyrant]] of [[Heraclea Pontica]]&lt;ref name="harders" /&gt;, in [[Bithynia]], whom she married in 322 BC. She bore him two sons named: Clearchus II and [[Oxyathres of Heraclea|Oxyathres]].&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt;

After the death of [[Dionysius of Heraclea|Dionysius]], in 306, Amastris became guardian of their children. Several others joined in this administration.&lt;ref name="ussher" /&gt; Amastris married [[Lysimachus]] in 302. However, he abandoned her shortly afterwards and married [[Arsinoe II]], one of the daughters of [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the first Pharaoh of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} After her marriage to Lysimachus ended, Amastris retired to Heraclea, which she governed in her own right. She also founded shortly after 300 a city called after her own name [[Amasra|Amastris]], on the sea-coast of [[Paphlagonia]], by the fusion ([[synoecism]]) of the four smaller towns of [[Amasra|Sesamus]], Cromna, [[Cytorus]] and [[Tius|Tium]]. Tium later regained its autonomy, but the other three remained part of the city of Amastris' territory. 

She was drowned by her two sons about 284&lt;ref name=memn_4_5_diod_20.109 group="Note" /&gt; but the matricide was avenged by Lysimachus, who made himself master of Heraclea, and put both Clearchus and Oxyathres to death.&lt;ref name=memn_4-6_diod_20.77 group="Note" /&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]] research, the '''situated approach''' builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment. This requires designing AI "from the bottom-up" by focussing on the basic perceptual and motor skills required to survive. The situated approach gives a much lower priority to abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills.

The approach was originally proposed as an alternative to traditional approaches (that is, approaches popular before 1985 or so).
After several decades, classical [[AI]] technologies started to face intractable issues (e.g. combinatorial explosion) when confronted with real-world modeling problems. All approaches to address these issues focus on modeling intelligences situated in an environment. They have become known as the situated approach to AI.

==Emergence of a concept==

=== From traditional AI to Nouvelle AI===
During the late 1980s, the approach now known as '''Nouvelle AI''' (''Nouvelle'' means new in French) was pioneered at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] by [[Rodney Brooks]]. As opposed to classical or traditional [[artificial intelligence]], Nouvelle AI purposely avoided the traditional goal of modeling human-level performance, but rather tries to create systems with intelligence at the level of insects, closer to real-world robots. But eventually, at least at [[MIT]] new AI did lead to an attempt for humanoid AI in [[Cog (project)|the Cog Project]].

===From Nouvelle AI to behavior-based and situated AI===
The conceptual shift introduced by nouvelle AI flourished in the robotics area, given way to '''behavior-based artificial intelligence''' (BBAI), a [[methodology]] for developing [[AI]] based on a modular decomposition of intelligence. It was made famous by [[Rodney Brooks]]: his [[subsumption architecture]] was one of the earliest attempts to describe a mechanism for developing BBAI. It is extremely popular in [[robotics]] and to a lesser extent to implement [[Intelligent agent|intelligent virtual agents]] because it allows the successful creation of real-time dynamic systems that can run in complex environments.  For example, it underlies the intelligence of the [[Sony]], [[Aibo]] and many [[RoboCup]] robot teams.

Realizing that in fact all these approaches were aiming at building not an abstract intelligence, but rather an intelligence '''situated''' in a given environment, they have come to be known as the situated approach. In fact, this approach stems out from early insights of [[Alan Turing]], describing the need to build machines equipped with sense organs to learn directly from the real-world instead of focusing on abstract activities, such as playing chess.{{Relevance-inline|This theory certainly has been put forward by philosophers long before Turing. There is no need to compete who formulated a vague idea first.}}

==Definitions==
Classically, a software entity is defined as a simulated element, able to act on itself and on its environment, and which has an internal representation of itself and of the outside world. An entity can communicate with other entities, and its behavior is the consequence of its perceptions, its representations, and its interactions with the other entities.

===AI loop===
Simulating entities in a virtual environment requires simulating the entire process that goes from a perception of the environment, or more generally from a stimulus, to an action on the environment. This process is called the AI loop and technology used to simulate it can be subdivided in two categories. ''Sensorimotor or low-level'' AI deals with either the perception problem (what is perceived?) or the animation problem (how are actions executed?). ''Decisional or high-level'' AI deals with the action selection problem (what is the most appropriate action in response to a given perception, i.e. what is the most appropriate behavior?).

===Traditional or symbolic AI===
There are two main approaches in decisional AI. The vast majority of the technologies available on the market, such as [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning algorithms]], [[finite state machines]] (FSA), or [[expert systems]], are based on the '''traditional or symbolic''' AI approach. Its main characteristics are:
* It is '''top-down''': it subdivides, in a recursive manner, a given problem into a series of sub-problems that are supposedly easier to solve.
* It is '''knowledge-based''': it relies on a symbolic description of the world, such as a set of rules.

However, the limits of traditional AI, which goal is to build systems that mimic human intelligence, are well-known: inevitably, a [[combinatorial explosion]] of the number of rules occurs due to the complexity of the environment. In fact, it is impossible to predict all the situations that will be encountered by an autonomous entity.

===Situated or behavioral AI===
In order to address these issues, another approach to decisional AI, also known as '''situated or behavioral''' AI, has been proposed. It does not attempt to model systems that produce deductive reasoning processes, but rather systems that '''behave realistically in their environment'''. The main characteristics of this approach are the following:
* It is '''bottom-up''': it relies on elementary behaviors, which can be combined to implement more complex behaviors.
* It is '''behavior-based''': it does not rely on a symbolic description of the environment, but rather on a model of the interactions of the entities with their environment.

The goal of situated AI is to model entities that are autonomous in their environment. This is achieved thanks to both the intrinsic robustness of the control architecture, and its adaptation capabilities to unforeseen situations.

===Situated agents===
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]], the term '''situated''' refers to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] which is [[embedded systems|embedded]] in an environment. The term ''situated'' is commonly used to refer to [[robot]]s, but some researchers argue that [[software]] agents can also be situated if:

* they exist in a [[dynamical system|dynamic]] (rapidly changing) environment, which
* they can [[wikt:manipulate|manipulate]] or change through their actions, and which
* they can [[sense]] or [[Perception|perceive]].

Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the Internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as [[Second Life]].

Being situated is generally considered to be part of being [[Embodied embedded cognition|embodied]], but it is useful to consider each perspective individually.  The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behavior derives from the environment and the agent's [[interaction]]s with it. The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.

==Implementation principles==

=== Modular decomposition===
The most important attribute of a system driven by situated AI is that the intelligence is controlled by a set of independent semi-[[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] modules. In the original systems, each module was actually a separate [[peripheral|device]] or was at least conceived of as running on its own [[Process (computing)|processing]] [[thread (computer science)|thread]]. Generally, though, the modules are just [[abstraction]]s. In this respect, situated AI may be seen as a [[software engineering]] approach to AI, perhaps akin to [[object-oriented programming|object oriented design]].

Situated AI is often associated with [[reactive planning]], but the two are not synonymous. Brooks advocated an extreme version of [[cognitive minimalism]] which required initially that the behavior modules were [[finite state machines]] and thus contained no conventional [[memory]] or [[learning]]. This is associated with reactive AI because reactive AI requires reacting to the current state of the world, not to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]]'s memory or preconception of that world. However, learning is obviously key to realistic [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]], so this constraint has been relaxed, though not entirely abandoned.

===Action selection mechanism===
The situated AI community has presented several solutions to modeling decision-making processes, also known as action selection mechanisms. The first attempt to solve this problem goes back to ''subsumption architectures'',&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, R. (1986). A robust layered control system for a mobile robot. IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation 2(1):14-23.&lt;/ref&gt; which were in fact more an implementation technique than an algorithm. However, this attempt paved the way to several others, in particular the ''free-flow hierarchies''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt J. and Payton D (1989). A fine-grained alternative to the subsumption architecture for mobile robot control. In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks 2:317-324.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''activation networks''.&lt;ref&gt;Maes P. (1989). How to do the right thing. Technical Report AIM-1180, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the structure and performances of these two mechanisms demonstrated the advantage of using ''free-flow hierarchies'' in solving the action selection problem.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T. (1993). Computational mechanisms for action selection. PhD, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T (1993). The use of hierarchies for action selection. Adaptive Behavior 1(4):387-420.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''motor schemas''&lt;ref&gt;Arkin R. Motor schema based navigation for a mobile robot: an approach to programming by behavior. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 264-271, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''process description languages''&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. (1993). Building agents with autonomous behavior systems. In: The artificial route to artificial intelligence. Building situated embodied agents. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt; are two other approaches that have been used with success for autonomous robots.

A '''brainstem stroke syndrome''' falls under the broader category of [[stroke syndromes]], or specific symptoms caused by vascular injury to an area of brain (for example, the [[lacunar syndromes]]). As the [[brainstem]] contains numerous [[cranial nuclei]] and [[white matter]] tracts, a [[stroke]] in this area can have a number of unique symptoms depending on the particular blood vessel that was injured and the group of cranial nerves and tracts that are no longer perfused. Symptoms of a brainstem stroke frequently include sudden [[vertigo]] and [[ataxia]], with or without weakness. Brainstem stroke can also cause [[diplopia]], slurred speech and decreased level of consciousness. A more serious outcome is [[locked-in syndrome]].

==Classic Syndromes==
* The midbrain syndromes (Significant overlap between these three syndromes)
** [[Superior alternating hemiplegia]] or [[Weber's syndrome]]
** [[Paramedian midbrain syndrome]] or [[Benedikt's syndrome]]
** [[Claude's syndrome]]
* [[Medial pontine syndrome]] or [[Middle alternating hemiplegia]] or [[Foville's syndrome]]
* [[Lateral pontine syndrome]] or [[Marie-Foix syndrome]]
* [[Medial medullary syndrome]] or [[Inferior alternating hemiplegia]] 
* [[Lateral medullary syndrome]] or [[Wallenberg syndrome]]

==History==

A history of locked in syndromes.

===Kate Allatt===
Kate Allatt is a mother-of-three from [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]]. She has successfully recovered from locked-in syndrome. Now she runs ''Fighting Strokes'', and devotes her life to assisting those with locked-in syndrome.&lt;ref name=amazing_spirit&gt;{{cite news|first=Jenna|last=Sloan|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/4529462/Locked-in-Christine-Waddell-Im-mad-on-Facebook-shopping-50-Shades-of-Grey-and-vodka.html|title=I’m mad on Facebook, shopping, 50 Shades of Grey and I like vodka: Amazing spirit of 'locked-in' Christine Waddell|newspaper=The Sun|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Dominique Bauby===
Parisian journalist [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]] suffered a [[stroke]] in December 1995, and, when he awoke 20 days later, he found his body was almost completely paralyzed; he could control only his left eyelid. By blinking this eye, he slowly dictated one alphabetic character at a time and, in so doing, was able over a great deal of time to write his memoir, ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]''. Three days after it was published in March 1997, Bauby died of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="titleThe Diving Bell And The Butterfly | The A.V.

Jean-Dominique was instrumental in forming the ''Association du Locked-In Syndrome'' (ALIS) in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alis-asso.fr/ | title = Association du Locked In Syndrome | language = French | location = FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Ronnie Cahana===
In the summer of 2011, Rabbi Ronnie Cahana, Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation Beth-El in [[Montreal]], suffered a severe brainstem stroke that left him in a locked-in state, able to communicate only with his eyes. With the help of his family, he continued to write poems and sermons for his congregation, letter by letter, through blinking. He has since regained his ability to breathe by himself and speak with his mouth. He describes his experiences as a blessing and a spiritual revelation of body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rabbicahana.com Rabbi Ronnie Cahana]'', Rabbi Ronnie Cahana's poetry and sermons&lt;/ref&gt; His story was told in a [[Ted talk]] given by his daughter called: [http://www.ted.com/talks/kitra_cahana_my_father_locked_in_his_body_but_soaring_free "My Father, Locked-in his Body but Soaring Free"]. He is the son of painter [[Alice Lok Cahana]].

===Tony Nicklinson===
Tony Nicklinson, of [[Melksham]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]], was left paralysed after suffering a stroke in June 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-19341571|title=Tony Nicklinson's legal fight for right to die|date=22 August 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 51. In the years that followed, he started a legal battle for a right to [[assisted death]]. On 16 August 2012, his request was turned down by the [[High Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/locked-man-loses-aided-death-bid-132622494.html|title=Locked-in man devastated at ruling|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=18 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819150225/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/locked-man-loses-aided-death-bid-132622494.html|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On learning the outcome of his appeal, he refused to eat, contracted [[pneumonia]], deteriorated rapidly and died a week later on 22 August 2012, aged 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19341722|title=Right-to-die man Tony Nicklinson dead after refusing food|date=22 August 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Julia Tavalaro===
In 1966, Julia Tavalaro, then aged 32, suffered two strokes and a brain hemorrhage and was sent to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, New York. For six years, she was believed to be in a [[vegetative state]]. In 1972, a family member noticed her trying to smile after she heard a joke. After alerting doctors, a speech therapist, Arlene Kratt, discerned cognizance in her eye movements. Kratt and an occupational therapist, Joyce Sabari, were eventually able to convince doctors she was in a locked-in state. After learning to communicate with eye blinks in response to letters being pointed to on an alphabet board, she became a poet and author. Eventually, she gained the ability to move her head enough to touch a switch with her cheek, which operated a motorized wheelchair and a computer. She gained national attention in 1995 when the Richard E. Meyer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a cover story about Tavalaro. In 1997, Erika Duncan's profile of Julia and her co-author Richard Tayson, "Decades After Silence, a Voice Is Recognized," ran in the Long Island edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and in April 1997, "The Long Road Home" appeared in ''[[Newsday]]''. Julia Tavalaro appears with Richard Tayson on Dateline NBC and Melissa Etheridge's Beyond Chance (Lifetime).  Their book was published by Viking-Penguin in 1998 and was translated into German, where it was published as ''[[Bis auf den Grund des Ozeans]]'' by Verlag Herder.  Tavalaro's story became a bestseller in Germany.  She died in 2003 at the age of 68.&lt;ref name=esquire1&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/unspeakable-odyssey-motionless-boy-1008 The Unspeakable Odyssey of the Motionless Boy] by Joshua Foer, Esquire Magazine, October 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/21/local/me-tavalaro21|title=Julia Tavalaro, 68; Poet and Author Noted for Defying Severe Paralysis|work=Los Angeles Times|page=B16|date=December 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bridgewater''''' was launched in 1785 as an [[East Indiaman]] for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC), which engaged her for six voyages. She then made two more as an "extra ship", that is, under voyage charters, and was lost at sea homeward bound from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] on the eighth voyage.
 
==Career==
'''EIC voyage #1 (1786-1787):''' Captain William Parker sailed from Portsmouth on 14 April 1786, bound for China. ''Bridgewater'' arrived at [[Whampoa Anchorage]] on 11 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the [[Pearl River (China)|Second Bar]] on 1 January 1787, reached [[Saint Helena|St Helena]] on 10 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 29 June.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS045-001114658 British Library: ''Bridgewater'' (3).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''EIC voyage #2 (1788-1789):''' Captain Parker sailed from [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]] on 11 April 1788, bound for [[Chennai|Madras]] and China. ''Bridgewater'' reached Madras on 19 August. She then visited [[Machilipatnam|Masulipatam]] on 13 September, before returning to Madras on 4 October. She reached [[Batavia (Dutch East Indies)|Batavia]] on 18 November, and arrived at Whampoa on 4 February 1789. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 2 March,  was at [[Macao]] on 21 March, and reached St Helena on 28 June.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; She arrived back in England on 1 September.&lt;ref name=Hackman/&gt;

'''EIC voyage #3 (1791-1793):''' Captain Gregory Moffat Lewin sailed from Portsmouth on 25 May 1791, bound for Madras, Bengal, and China. ''Bridgewater'' reached Madras on 9 October and arrived at [[Diamond Harbour]] on 23 November. On 5 December she passed [[Sagar Island|Saugor]], and by 11 January 1792 was at [[Visakhapatnam|Vizagapatam]]. She stopped at Madras on 22 January and [[Nagore]] on 7 February. She returned to Madras on 16 February, and reached [[Mumbai|Bombay]] on 29 March. On 29 May she was again at Madras. Finally bound for China, she reached Penang on 14 July and Malacca on 1 September, before arriving at Whampoa on 19 September.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; Captain Lewin died two days before ''Bridgewater'' left for England.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'', (April 1793), Volume 73, p.378.&lt;/ref&gt; Her chief mate was Robert Reay. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 12 November, reached St Helena on 19 February 1793, and arrived at Long Reach on 22 April.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

[[French Revolutionary Wars|France declared war]] on Great Britain on 1 February 1793.

'''EIC voyage #4 (1794-1795):''' Capt William Parker acquired a [[letter of marque]] on 6 January 1794.&lt;ref name=LoM&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf# |title=Letter of Marque, p.53 - accessed 25 July 2017. |access-date=30 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020052005/http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf# |archive-date=20 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British government held ''Bridgewater'' at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on [[Isle of France (Mauritius)|Île de France]] (Mauritus). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid [[£sd|£]]1,479 3[[shilling|s]] 4[[pence|d]] for having delayed her departure by 71 days.

Captain Parker sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May 1794, bound for Bombay and China. ''Bridgewater'' reached Bombay on 4 September and arrived at Whampoa on 26 February 1795. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 22 April and was at Macao on 22 May. She reached Batavia on 5 August and St Helena on 16 October, and arrived at [[Northfleet]] on 26 December.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; 

'''EIC voyage #5 (1796-1797):''' Captain John Skottowe acquired a letter of marque on 20 April 1796. He sailed from Portsmouth on 17 May 1796, bound for Madras and Bengal. ''Bridgewater'' reached Madras on 10 September and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 21 October. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 2 January 1797. She was at Colombo on 2 February and [[Trincomalee]] on 25 March. She reached the [{Cape of Good Hope on 12 July and St Helena on 11 September, and arrived at [[Gravesend]] on 18 December.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; 

'''EIC voyage #6 (1798-1799):''' Captain Skottowe sailed from Portsmouth on 29 April 1798, bound for China. She reached Rio de Janeiro on 6 July, and arrived at Whampoa on 3 December. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 22 January 1799, reached Malacca on 22 February and St Helena on 17 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 31 July.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; 

'''EIC voyage #7 (1800–1801):''' Captain George Lukin acquired a letter of marque on 9 December 1800.&lt;ref name=LoM/&gt; Messrs Princip &amp; Saunders had tendered her to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (1800), p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Transport vessels for the British Government's importation of rice from Bengal (1800–1802)}}  

Lukin sailed from The Downs on 24 January 1801, bound for Madras. ''Bridgewater'' reached Madras on 21 May and left on 14 August. On 10 October she was reported sailing 'towards England'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS045-001114659 British Library: ''Bridgewater'' (4).]&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived back in England on 4 January 1802.&lt;ref name=Hackman/&gt;

'''EIC voyage #8 (1802–Loss):''' Captain E. H. Palmer sailed from England on 1 August 1802, bound for Botany Bay and China. ''Bridgewater'' arrived at Port Jackson on 12 May 1803, having brought provisions. She left on 10 August, bound for China.&lt;ref name=ATCJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71247621 |title=Arrival of Vessels at Port Jackson, and their Departure |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=Australian Town and Country Journal, Saturday 3 January 1891, p.16 |publisher= |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left in company with {{HMS|Porpoise|1799|6}} and {{ship||Cato|1800 ship|2}}.

On 17 August the three ships got caught near a sandbank, 157 north and 51 miles east of [[Sandy Cape]]. With shrinking leeway, both ''Cato'' and ''Porpoise'' grounded. Both ships beat on the sharp coral, with the result that they sank quickly.&lt;ref name=Hepper&gt;Hepper (1994), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bridgewater'' sailed on and later reported both ships lost with no survivors. Almost all the crew and passengers of ''Cato'' and ''Porpoise'' were able to land on a sandbank as both ships broke up; the survivors were later rescued.&lt;ref name=Hepper/&gt;

==Fate==
''Bridgewater'' sailed from Bombay for England in 1805 and disappeared without a trace. She was believed to have foundered with all hands.

The '''Champawat Tiger''' was a [[Bengal tigress]] responsible for an estimated 436 deaths in [[Nepal]] and the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] area of [[India]], during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17630703 Tiger and leopard attacks in Nepal] BBC News (11 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Her attacks have been listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the highest number of fatalities from a tiger.&lt;ref name="guinness97"&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|title=The Guinness Book of Records 1997|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|date=1997|isbn=9780553576849|last1=Young|first1=Mark C.|last2=Matthews|first2=Peter|last3=McWhirter|first3=Norris}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was shot in 1907 by [[Jim Corbett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
According to Peter Byrne, professional hunter and author from Nepal, the tiger began her attacks in a [[Rupal, Nepal|Rupal]] village in western [[Nepal]], [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Byrne, Shikari Sahib, Safari Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters were sent in to kill the tiger, but she managed to evade them. Eventually, the [[Nepalese Army]] was called in. Despite failing to capture or kill the tiger, soldiers organised a massive [[Patrol|beat]] and managed to force the tiger to abandon her territory and drive her across the border (river [[Sarda river|Sarda]]) into [[India]], where she continued her killing activities in the [[Kumaon District]]. All her kills happened during the daylight (as Corbett writes, he is not aware of a single case of a man-eating tiger killing a human during the night). Life across the region grew paralyzed, with men often refusing to leave their huts for work after hearing the tiger's roars from the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2010/10/16/top-10-worst-man-eaters-in-history/|title=Top 10 Worst Man Eaters In History|work=Listverse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the tiger was killed by British hunter [[Jim Corbett]]. The tiger had killed a 16-year-old girl, Premka Devi, in the village of [[Fungar]],&lt;ref&gt; Premka Devi, the Last Victim of Champawat Man-Eater, by Preetum Gheerawo, from the book "Behind Jim Corbett's Stories" Logos, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; near to the town of [[Champawat]], and left a trail of blood, which Corbett followed. After the whole day pursuit, Corbett had to abandon the hunt, deciding to use villagers and to organize a beat the next day in the Champa River gorge.

With the help of the [[tehsildar]] of Champawat, the beat was organized with about 300 villagers, and the next day, about noon, Corbett shot the tigress dead.

A postmortem on the tigress showed the upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone. This injury, a result of an old gunshot, according to Corbett, probably prevented her from hunting her natural prey, and hence, she started to hunt humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/maneating5.html|title=Man-eaters. The tiger and lion, attacks on humans.|author=Loadstar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champawat town==
In [[Champawat]], near the Chataar Bridge and on the way to [[Lohaghat]], there is a "cement board" marking the place where the tigress was finally brought down. The details about the Champawat Tigress and how she was brought down can be found in the book ''[[Maneaters of Kumaon]]'' (1944), written by Corbett himself.

==Killing site==

The information about the first victim of the tigress, as well as the photos of the overhanging rock at the Champa River, where the tigress was killed, can be seen in the book ''Behind Jim Corbett's Stories'' which is freely available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.josephjordania.com/files/47-Corbert-book.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational human modeling''' is an interdisciplinary [[computational science]] that links the diverse fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], and [[computer vision]] with [[machine learning]], [[mathematics]], and [[cognitive psychology]].

Computational human modeling emphasizes descriptions of human for A.I. research and applications.

==Major topics==
Research in computational human modeling can include computer vision studies on identify ([[face recognition]]), attributes (gender, age, skin color), expressions, geometry (3D face modeling, 3D body modeling), and activity (pose, gaze, actions, and social interactions).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5835">'''Convergent extension''' ('''CE'''), sometimes called '''convergence and extension''' ('''C&amp;E'''), is the process by which the tissue of an embryo is restructured to converge (narrow) along one axis and extend (elongate) along a perpendicular axis by cellular movement.   An example of this process is where the [[anteroposterior axis]] (the axis drawn between the head and tail end of an embryo) becomes longer as the lateral tissues (those that make up the left and right sides of the embryo) move in towards the dorsal midline (the middle of the back of the animal).&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallingford JB, Fraser SE, Harland RM |title=Convergent extension: the molecular control of polarized cell movement during embryonic development |journal=Dev Cell |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=695–706 |year=2002 |pmid=12062082 |doi=10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process plays a crucial role in shaping the body plan during [[embryogenesis]] and occurs during [[gastrulation]], [[neurulation]], axis elongation, and [[organogenesis]] in both [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] embryos.  In [[chordate]] animals, this process is utilized within a vast population of cells; from the smaller populations in the [[notochord]] of the sea squirt (ascidian) to the larger populations of the dorsal mesoderm and neural ectoderm of frogs (Xenopus) and fish.  Many characteristics of convergent extension are conserved in the teleost fish, the bird, and very likely within mammals at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Keller R, Shook D, Skoglund P |title= The forces that shape embryos: physical aspects of convergent extension by cell intercalation.|journal= Phys. Biol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=2008 |pmid=18403829 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Morphogenic movements4567.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Figure 1. Morphogenic Movements (Adapted from &lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;)]]

Convergent extension has been primarily studied in frogs and fish due to their large embryo size and their development outside of a maternal host (in egg clutches in the water, as opposed to in a uterus).&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;  Within frogs and fish, however, there exist fundamental differences in how convergent extension is achieved.  Frog embryogenesis utilizes cell rearrangement as the sole player of this process.  Fish, on the other hand, utilize both cell rearrangement as well as directed migration&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt; (Fig. 1) .  Cellular rearrangement is the process by which individual cells of a tissue rearrange to reshape the tissue as a whole, while cellular migration is the directed movement of a singular cell or small group of cells across a substrate such as a membrane or tissue.

Frog (Xenopus), as well as other amphibian, [[gastrulation]] serves as an excellent example of the role of convergent extension in embryogenesis.  During gastrulation in frogs, the driving force of convergent extension is the morphogenic activity of the presumptive dorsal mesodermal cells; this activity is driven by the [[mesenchymal]] cells that lie beneath the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  These tissues exist within the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of the embryo which lies between the vegetal endoderm and the posterior neural tissue.  The IMZ is integral to gastrulation and R. Keller et al. eloquently exemplify the importance of convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. “…the IMZ, true to its name, involutes or rolls over the blastoporal lip and turns inside out.  As it involutes, it converges along the mediolateral axis and extends along the future anterior-posterior axis of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm.  Convergence and extension of these tissues squeezes the blastopore shut and simultaneously elongate the body axis.  Elongation continues through the neurula and tailbud stages…As these involuted dorsal mesodermal tissues converge and extend on the inside of the gastrula, the presumptive posterior neural tissue converges and extends on the outside of the embryo, parallel to the underlying mesoderm, and then rolls up to form the neural tube, which later forms the hindbrain and spinal cord of the central nervous system".&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Should convergent extension be interrupted or incomplete, the resulting organism will have a short anteroposterior axis, wide notochord, and broad, open neural tube.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;

The cellular signals required for convergent extension are not fully understood, however, it is known that the non-canonical [[Wnt signaling pathway]] plays an important role,.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Current research is shedding light on the cellular mechanisms of convergent extension and recently the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway was implicated in regulating the cell polarity of the factors involved in convergent extension.  This is an interesting development as the PCP pathway is an integral and well-studied pathway in flies, but has classically been thought to be unemployed by vertebrates.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;  In addition to the non-canonical Wnt and PCP pathways involvement in convergent extension, the down-regulation of certain cell-cell adhesion molecules, such as C-cadherin and fibronectin/integrin interactions, may also play a role.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Reduction of the activity of these cell-cell adhesion molecules allows for cells undergoing convergent extension to move more freely.  Consistent with a role for a reduction of cell-cell adhesion in convergent extension, when cell-cell adhesion is not reduced, convergent extension cannot occur.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;

'''Cyberforce''' is an [[Image Comics]] [[superhero]] team created by writer/artist [[Marc Silvestri]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nadler |first=Lonnie |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3198571/review-cyber-force-1/ |title=Review: 'Cyber Force' #1 |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atrant|first1=Chris|title=Marc Silvestri Strikes Back With CYBER FORCE|url=https://www.newsarama.com/10687-marc-silvestri-strikes-back-with-cyber-force.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=2016-01-11|language=en|date=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional team biography== 
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}} 
===Volumes 1 &amp; 2===
The original comic book focused on a team of [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]] who were captured by Cyberdata, an enormous corporation planning to take over the world. The mutants were experimented on and had their abilities enhanced with cybernetic implants in hopes to become S.H.O.C.s (Special Hazardous Operations Cyborgs). The mutants subsequently escaped and banded together as Cyberforce, determined to defeat Cyberdata.

===Volume 3===
The 2006 series began with the team's return from their final mission and centered on a confrontation with their alien forebears. The team was given an updated look, a new base of operations, and changes to its roster. Heatwave, [[Codename: Strykeforce|Stryker]] and Impact served as recurring characters throughout the series, while important subplots included the death of Impact and the initiation of a romantic relationship between Ripclaw and [[Velocity (comics)|Velocity]].

===Volume 4===
In October 2012, a rebooted version of the comic was released that incorporated elements of [[cyberpunk]].

==Publication history==
''Cyberforce'' was initially written and illustrated by its creator Marc Silvestri though he later turned his duties over to other artists, including [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/talent/david-finch |title=David Finch |publisher=DC Comics |date= |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally published in 1992-93 as a four-part miniseries through [[Homage Studios]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} After Silvestri founded [[Top Cow Productions]], ''Cyberforce'' ran as a monthly series from 1994 to 1997, running 35 issues. The first few issues crossed over with ''[[Wildcats (comics)|Wild C.A.T.s]]'' for the "Killer Instinct" storyline spanning ''Wild C.A.T.S'' #5-7 and ''Cyberforce'' vol. 2 #1-3.

The series was revived in 2006 (April-September) as a six issue limited series written by [[Ron Marz]] and drawn by [[Pat Lee (comics)|Pat Lee]] titled ''Rising From the Ashes''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

On October 17, 2012, Top Cow debuted the fourth volume of a rebooted ''Cyberforce'' as part of the company's "Top Cow Rebirth" initiative. Funded through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, the first five issues were released for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=SDCC '12: Silvestri Reboots CYBER FORCE, Offers It for Free|url=https://www.newsarama.com/9850-sdcc-12-silvestri-reboots-cyber-force-offers-it-for-free.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=2015-07-24|language=en|date=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietsch|first1=TJ|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Kickstarting "Cyber Force" At Top Cow|url=https://www.cbr.com/cci-exclusive-kickstarting-cyber-force-at-top-cow/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2016-09-04|date=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvestri provided [[cyberpunk]]-influenced art for the rebooted series, while Khoi Pham was brought aboard as illustrator after five years of exclusive work for [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/620244384/cyber-force-returns/description |title=Cyber Force Returns! by Top Cow Productions |publisher=Kickstarter |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue received a positive review from Benjamin Bailey of [[IGN]], who described the post-apocalyptic setting as both interesting and genuine. Commenting on Pham's art, he cited some inconsistencies, particularly with respect to renderings of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benjamin Bailey |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/18/cyberforce-1-review |title=Cyberforce #1 Review |publisher=IGN |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cyberforce'' was relaunched in fall of 2015 as a digital-only series written by Matt Hawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Brett|title=Silvestri Brings New "Cyber Force" Chapters To LINE Webtoon|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/silvestri-brings-new-cyber-force-chapters-to-line-webtoon|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2015-08-30|date=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Newsarama Staff|title=CYBERFORCE To Return As Digital Series By SILVESTRI &amp; HAWKINS|url=https://www.newsarama.com/25051-cyberforce-to-return-as-digital-series-by-silvestri-hawkins.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=27 December 2017|language=en|date=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNA separation by silica adsorption''' is a method of DNA separation that is based on DNA molecules binding to silica surfaces in the presence of certain salts and under certain pH conditions, usually conducted on a microchip coated in silica channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size-fselective separation of DNA fragments by using lysine-functionalized silica particles|journal=Scientific Reports|first1=Lingling |last1=Liu|first2=Zilong |last2=Guo|first3=Zhenzhen |last3=Huang |first4=Jiaqi|last4= Zhuang |first5=Wensheng |last5= Yang|volume=6|date=25 February 2016|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep22029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Isolation of Nucleic Acids Using Silica-Gel Based Membranes: Methods Based on the Use of QIAamp Spin Columns|journal=Molecular Tools for Screening Biodiversity|first1=Angela |last1=Karp|first2=Peter G. |last2=Isaac|first3=David S. |last3=Ingram|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Conventional methods for [[DNA extraction]], such as ethanol precipitation or preparations using commercial purification kits, cannot be integrated onto microchips because they require multiple hands-on processing steps. In addition, they also require large equipment and high volumes of reagents and samples. Silica resins avoid these issues through integration on microchips, where solid phase extraction provides accurate analysis of DNA on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of silica resins for direct and efficient extraction of DNA from complex biological matrices in a miniaturized format.|journal=Journal of Analytical Biochemistry|last1=Tian |first1=H|last2=Hühmer |first2=AF|last3=Landers |first3=JP|volume=283|issue=2|date=August 2000|pmid=10906238|pages=175–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
In order to conduct DNA separation by silica adsorption, a sample (this may be anything from purified cells to a tissue specimen) is placed onto a specialized chip and [[lysis|lysed]]. The resultant mix of [[protein]]s, [[DNA]], [[phospholipid]]s, etc., is then run through the channel where the DNA is adsorbed by a [[silica]] surface in the presence of solutions with high ionic strength. The highest DNA adsorption efficiencies occur in the presence of buffer solution with a pH at or below the pKa of the surface silanol groups.

The mechanism behind DNA adsorption onto silica is not fully understood; one possible explanation involves reduction of the silica surface’s negative charge due to the high ionic strength of the buffer. This decrease in surface charge leads to a decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged DNA and the negatively charged silica. Meanwhile, the buffer also reduces the activity of water by formatting hydrated ions. This leads to the silica surface and DNA becoming dehydrated. These conditions lead to an energetically favorable situation for DNA to adsorb to the silica surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Graaf et al |title=Separation of DNA by silica adsorption: a review of techniques and literature |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2009 |volume=25 |issue=18 |pages=314-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further explanation of how DNA binds to silica is based on the action of guanidium HCl (GuHCl), which acts as a chaotrope. A chaotrope denatures biomolecules by disrupting the shell of hydration around them.  This allows positively charged ions to form a salt bridge between the negatively charged silica and the negatively charged DNA backbone in high salt concentration. The DNA can then be washed with high salt and ethanol, and ultimately eluted with low salt.

After the DNA is adsorbed to the silica surface, all other molecules pass through the column. Most likely, these molecules are sent to a waste section on the chip, which can then be closed off using a gated channel or a pressure- or voltage-controlled chamber. The DNA is then washed to remove any excess waste particles from the sample and then eluted from the channel using an elution buffer for further [[downstream processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Graaf et al |title=Separation of DNA by silica adsorption: a review of techniques and literature |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2009 |volume=25 |issue=18 |pages=314-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following solutions have been proposed and validated for use in this process DNA binding: GuHCl- based loading buffer; Channel Wash: 80% isopropanol; DNA elution: TE at pH 8.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Graaf et al |title=Separation of DNA by silica adsorption: a review of techniques and literature |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2009 |volume=25 |issue=18 |pages=314-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silicon micro DNA extraction surfaces==
Methods using silica beads and silica resins have been created that can isolate DNA molecules for subsequent PCR amplification. However, these methods have associated problems.  First, beads and resins are highly variable depending on how well they are packed and are thus hard to reproduce. Each loading of a micro-channel can result in a different amount of packing and thus change the amount of DNA that adsorbed to the channel. Furthermore, these methods result in a two step manufacturing process.

Silica structures are a much more effective method of packing material because they are etched into the channel during its fabrication and is thus the result of a one step manufacturing processes via [[soft lithography]]. Silica structures are therefore easier to use in highly parallelized designs than  beads or resins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3364">'''Dewa Cawu''' (died April or May 1673) was a prince on the Island of [[Bali]], who possibly reigned as king for a short while in the 1650s. He belonged to a dynasty that claimed descent from the [[Hindu]]-[[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Majapahit]] [[Empire]], and kept its [[palace]] ([[puri]]) in [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]] near Bali's south coast.

==Assistant to Dalem Di Made==

According to [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[historiography]], written much later, he was one of the fourteen sons of the king [[Dalem Seganing]], and born from a co-wife (penawing).&lt;ref&gt;I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), ''Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan''. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tengkat I Bali 1986, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have held a high position during the reign of his brother [[Dalem Di Made]] (1623?-1642?). [[Netherlands|Dutch]] sources from the 1630s mention a brother of the current ruler called 'T'jouw' or 'Tchau' who negotiated with the [[Dutch East Indies Company]] on the ruler's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Colenbrander, ''Dagh-Register, gehouden int Casteel Batavia''. 's-Gravenhage: Departement van Koloniën 1898, p. 177-82.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to an annual entry in the Balinese text ''Pawawatekan'' the Gelgel [[monarchy|kingdom]] fell apart in 1651, at the same time as Dewa Cawu was enthroned as king. The outbreak of internal fighting on Bali in 1651 is likewise mentioned in Dutch sources.&lt;ref&gt;H. Hägerdal, 'From Batuparang to Ayudhya; Bali and the Outside World, 1636-1656', ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 154 1998, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Exile and death==

Dewa Cawu is not mentioned as ruler in his own right in later Balinese [[historiography]]. Also, his time as ruler or [[pretender]]-ruler was apparently short and hampered by the ongoing internal [[warfare]]. By 1665 the old chief [[Minister (government)|minister]] of the kingdom, [[Anglurah Agung]], had usurped power, which he retained until his death in 1686. An annal entry states that Dewa Cawu died in Guliang in the present [[Bangli]] [[Regency (Indonesia)|regency]], in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;http://vxu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206791/FULLTEXT01 p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century [[chronicle]] [[Babad Dalem]] likewise speaks of a ruler who died in exile in Guliang, although this ruler is identified with his elder brother Dalem Di Made.&lt;ref&gt;H. Hägerdal, 'Bali in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries; Suggestions for a Chronology of the Gelgel Period', ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 151 1995, p. 119-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The dynastic conditions on Bali at this time are therefore partly obscure, with largely contradictive sources.&lt;ref&gt;H. Creese, 'Balinese Babad as Historical Sources; A Reinterpretation of the Fall of Gelgel', ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 147 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duizendjarige den''' was a [[scots pine]]  in the [[Wolfhezerbossen]] near [[Wolfheze]], [[Netherlands]]. The tree fell down at 28 May 2006. It is estimated that the tree was nearly four hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npogeschiedenis.nl/ovt/afleveringen/2006/Ovt-04-06-2006/Duizendjarige-den-in-Wolfheze-zomaar-omgevallen.html |title=‘Duizendjarige’ den in Wolfheze zomaar omgevallen |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Geschiedenis 22=4 |publisher= |accessdate=|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree did not show any sings of illness but the trunk was hollow. The trunk had a perimeter of 430 centimeters and was 22 meters long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bomeninfo.nl/duizd.htm |title= Duizendjarige den|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Bomeninfo |publisher= |accessdate=|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the tree is germinated around the year 1600 and that it was one of the oldest trees in the Netherlands before it fell down.

The name Duizendjarige den is thought up during the second half of the nineteenth centaury by a group of landscape painters connected with the [[Oosterbeekse school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvvarnhemnijmegen.nl/media/1907129/RBT_220412_veluwe_Oosterb_Wolf_DEF.pdf|title=Wandelen met wetenswaardigheden|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=VVV Arnhem-Nijmegen|publisher=VVV|accessdate=|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722123523/http://www.vvvarnhemnijmegen.nl/media/1907129/RBT_220412_veluwe_Oosterb_Wolf_DEF.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimating  the age ==  

The most reliable estimation of the age is according to Xander van der Burg done by E.J. Dik with the help of a branch that broke off the tree in 1971. With the help of an [[accretion drill]] it was possible to drill a piece of wood out of the branch with as result that the [[growth rings]] could be counted. The branch had a total of 238 growth rings and the researchers concluded that the tree must be around 400 years old. 

The calculation has taken place in 1995 which makes it 24 years after the branch broke off the tree. They estimated that it took four years for the tree to reach chest height and which sets the minimum age of the tree at 266. However, a part of the drill core was missing so the researchers estimated that the tree was probably a hundred to a hundred and fifty years older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/114937 |title=Jaarringen versus geruchten. ..

'''Ectogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ecto'', "outer," and ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'') is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ectogenesis yourdictionary.com &gt; ectogenesis] In turn citing: Webster's New World College Dictionary, 2010 by Wiley Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] outside the mother's body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Ectogenesis ectogenesis]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by British scientist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artificial Wombs Are Coming, but the Controversy Is Already Here |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/artificial-wombs-are-coming-and-the-controversys-already-here |work=Motherboard |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=16 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ECTOGENESIS: A REPLY TO SINGER AND WELLS|first=DAVID N.|last=JAMES|date=1 January 1987|journal=Bioethics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=80–99|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.1987.tb00006.x|pmid = 11649763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human embryos and fetuses==
{{Further|Artificial uterus}}
Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an [[artificial uterus]]. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the [[placenta]]. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human [[reproductive rights]].

Ectogenesis could also be a means by which [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and single men could have genetic offspring without the use of [[surrogate pregnancy]] or a [[sperm donor]], and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle.

==Bioethical considerations==
The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few [[bioethics|bioethical]] and legal considerations, and also has important implications for [[reproductive rights]] and the [[abortion debate]].

Artificial uteri may expand the range of [[fetal viability]], raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within [[abortion law]]. Within severance theory, for example, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. If transferring the fetus from a woman's womb to an artificial uterus is possible, the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could provide an alternative to aborting the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Vernellia|author2=Randall, Tshaka C.|title=Built in Obsolescence: The Coming End to the Abortion Debate|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=22 March 2008|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1112367|url=https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=vernellia_randall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chessen|first1=Matt|title=Artificial Wombs Could Outlaw Abortion|url=http://www.mattlesnake.com/2013/03/02/artificial-wombs-could-outlaw-abortion/|website=Mattlesnake.com|date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack "some essential bond with their mothers that other children have";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smajdor|first=Anna|title=The Moral Imperative for Ectogenesis|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|date=Summer 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–45|pmid=17695628|url=http://annasmajdor.me.uk/ectogenesis_final.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0963180107070405}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secondary issue to woman's rights over their own body.

In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando de Valenzuela, 1st Marquis of Villasierra''', [[Grandee of Spain]], (in full, {{lang-es|[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Fernando de Valenzuela y Enciso, Núñez y Dávila, primer marqués de Villasierra, Grande de España, Virrey de Granada}}), (8 January 1630, [[Naples]] – 7 February 1692) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] royal favourite and minister.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Early life==
His father, Francisco de Valenzuela, was a gentleman from [[Ronda]] who had been compelled to flee from [[Spain]] as a consequence of a brawl, and who enlisted as a soldier in [[Naples]], where he married Leonora de Encisa. Francisco having died young, his son was placed by his mother as a page in the household of the [[Duke of Infantado]]. He lost his place owing to a reduction of the Duke's establishment, and for several years he lived obscurely. By good fortune he succeeded in persuading Maria de Uceda, one of the ladies-in-waiting to Queen [[Mariana of Austria]], second wife of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], to marry him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Royal favourite==
[[File:Fernando de valenzuela.jpg|thumb|Don Fernando de Valenzuela, Marquis of Villasierra, portrait by [[Juan Carreño de Miranda]], c. 1675.]]
With the help of his wife, Valenzuela obtained a footing in the palace. He was appointed introducer of [[ambassador]]s on 12 October 1671, and it became notorious that whoever had a petition to present or a place to ask for must apply to him. He became popularly known as the ''duende'', the "fairy" or "brownie" of the palace, and was believed to be the lover of the queen. He was considered as successor of the previous [[valido]], [[Juan Everardo Nithard]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1675 a court intrigue, conducted by his rivals and supported by Don [[John of Austria the Younger]], was so far successful that he was driven from court; but the queen gave him the title of Marquis of Villasierra and appointed him ambassador to [[Venice]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Valenzuela succeeded in getting the embassy exchanged for the governorship of [[Granada]]. His stay at this post was short, for he was able to organize a counter-intrigue which soon brought him back to court. The queen-regent now openly appointed him [[prime minister]], gave him official quarters in the palace, and conferred a [[grandee]]ship on him, to the profound indignation of the other grandees.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In January 1677 a palace revolution broke out against the queen-regent, who was driven from [[Madrid]], and Valenzuela fled for refuge to the monastery of [[El Escorial]]. He was, however, taken out by force, and his house was pillaged and his property confiscated. His jewels, furniture and ready money were estimated to amount to 120,000 [[peso]]s. He was degraded from the grandeeship and exiled to the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Later life==
At a later period he was released from close confinement and allowed to settle in [[Mexico]], where a pension was given him. He died in Mexico, from the kick of a horse he was breaking in, on February 7, 1692. Part of his property, and the title of Villa Sierra, but not the grandeeship, were restored to his wife and children. The career of de Valenzuela probably helped to suggest the subject of [[Ruy Blas]] to [[Victor Hugo]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23272">The '''Fixer''' is the name of two different fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]: '''Roscoe Sweeney''' and '''Paul Norbert Ebersol'''.

==Publication history==
The first Marvel Comics character known as the Fixer was Roscoe Sweeney. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #1 (Apr. 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and [[Bill Everett]].

The second iteration of Fixer was long-time supervillain Paul Norbert Ebersol, first appearing in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #141 (February 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Much later, he appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'', until he was forced to leave the team in issue #174.

'''Roscoe Sweeney''' was a [[gangster]] and crooked fight promoter who was involved in [[extortion]] and illegal [[gambling]] who operated as the "Fixer". He paid [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Jack Murdock (comics)|"Battling Jack" Murdock]] to take a fall and lose a fight. Murdock accepted the money, however, the boxer became determined to continue the fight and eventually won by a knockout. The Fixer's right-hand man Slade killed Jack after the fight in retaliation. Learning of his father's murder and vowing to bring men like the Fixer to justice, Matt Murdock became a lawyer as well as the [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to do so. Fixer and Slade went to Fogwell's Gym where they encountered the Daredevil. When Fixer and Slade ran for it upon their being disarmed, the Daredevil pursued them into the subway station. After the Man Without Fear tripped Slade, the Fixer had a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] when confronted by the Daredevil and died. As Fixer's body fell onto the subway tracks, the Man Without Fear stopped a subway from running over Fixer's body. Slade was arrested and sentenced to death by the electric chair.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Norbert Ebersol''' was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He was a [[scientist]] who held a number of odd jobs, including auto mechanic, television repairman, and electronics laboratory assistant. He then became the second and more prominent "Fixer", a [[supervillain]] and [[genius]]-level criminal [[inventor]] who has often worked for criminal cartels like [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].

In his first appearance, he escaped from prison,&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Tales'' #141&lt;/ref&gt; teamed with his partner [[Mentallo]] in an attempted takeover of the New York [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters, and even captured [[Nick Fury]].&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Tales'' #142&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops.&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Tales'' #143&lt;/ref&gt; His connection with THEM was revealed; and THEM was later revealed as part of HYDRA.&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Tales'' #145&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the scenes, he was even revealed as the chief of the HYDRA Science Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #121&lt;/ref&gt;

With Mentallo, the Fixer later escaped prison again. They invaded the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and captured the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. They then invaded the [[Baxter Building]], battled the Thing and Nick Fury, and used [[Doctor Doom]]'s time machine to bring [[Deathlok#Luther Manning|Deathlok]] from his alternate future.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26&lt;/ref&gt; Mentallo then mind-controlled Deathlok in an attempted assassination of the U.S. President, but Fixer and Mentallo were defeated by the [[Fantastic Four]] and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; The pair was freed from prison by a HYDRA force controlled by Baron Karza. Fixer created the living machine-intelligence Computrex, which was destroyed by the [[Micronauts (comic book)|Micronauts]] who then defeated Fixer and Mentallo.&lt;ref&gt;''Micronauts'' #24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixer and Mentallo then aided [[Professor Power]] in his attempt to add [[Professor X]]'s powers to Mentallo's, but they were defeated by [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #118&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer attempted to loot Northwind Observatory of [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]'s inventions, but was captured by [[Captain America]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Annual'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer then invaded the [[West Coast Avengers]] Compound in an attempt to steal [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|armor]], but was defeated by Iron Man and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #202&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] formed the fourth incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]], Fixer served as his right-hand man. When the Masters of Evil invaded [[Avengers Mansion]], Fixer created a device enabling Baron Zemo to control [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]]. Fixer helped engineer the capture of Captain America, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and [[Edwin Jarvis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #273-274&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer was apprehended by [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]. Behind the scenes, Fixer was overpowered by the [[Super-Adaptoid]] which changed places with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #276&lt;/ref&gt; The Super-Adaptoid disguised as the Fixer later escaped prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #286&lt;/ref&gt; The real Fixer was discovered by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the android's former confinement tube at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #287&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer later escaped prison with [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] who then spurned his romantic advances. The Fixer followed Yellowjacket and battled Yellowjacket and the Black Knight before escaping.&lt;ref&gt;''Solo Avengers'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zemo's second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, the team changed their identity to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while Fixer adopted the alias of '''Techno'''. He was then apparently killed when his neck was broken by Iron, one of the Elements of Doom, and he transferred his mind into a [[robot]]ic body, and this Techno sided, alone among the Thunderbolts, with Zemo when he went ahead with his scheme to conquer the planet.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Zemo and Techno decamped to one of Zemo's bases, where Techno began to experiment with cloning, offering to clone Zemo an unscarred body, and even cloning [[Kevin Costner]] for fun at one point. After the two fell out, Techno infiltrated the Thunderbolts by replacing [[Ogre (Marvel Comics)|Ogre]], while continuing his experiments behind-the-scenes, including recovering [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]]'s body when she was killed and placing it in a healing tube.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Techno's impersonation of Ogre ended when [[Scourge of the Underworld]] stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his body from the inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again to allow him to construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially [[amnesia]]c of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Fixer then became one of the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]], a government-backed team whereby criminals could use it to accelerate their sentences and clear their record, until most of that team was slaughtered by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]. He joined with the reunited Thunderbolts to stop Graviton, and he was one of the team members exiled to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]]. By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo's consciousness ended up in Fixer's tech-pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him [[quadriplegic]], Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron's consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart's body.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

The team remained on Counter-Earth for some time, until, in sealing a rift, they returned home, leaving Jolt (whom Fixer saved from burning out in helping to seal the rift) behind. Finally, after [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] went insane, Fixer furnished a device that could give the combined Avengers and Thunderbolts a couple of seconds to make their move; he then left.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Later, [[Deadpool]] visited Fixer at his holiday home to enlist his help in saving [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. After a brief fight, Fixer accepted the challenge (and Deadpool's monetary inducement), and successfully bonded new, benign, techno-organic mesh to Cable. Some time after this, Fixer suddenly reappeared to save his former teammate [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]] from a fall. Fixer recruited MACH-IV to join a secretive group headed by Zemo to combat and destroy Genis-Vell, a member of the Thunderbolts whom Zemo had brought back to life. The process was flawed, however, and Genis' existence now threatened the universe.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After Genis was destroyed, Fixer remained with the Thunderbolts, who were now helmed by Zemo. He helped the team recruit supervillains to the pro-registration cause during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]. He also helped Zemo save the Wellspring of Power from the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. After Zemo was betrayed and the Thunderbolts were placed under [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] control, Fixer and MACH-IV were offered jobs with the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Ebersol has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Fixer works as the Raft's supervisor in its section for male supervillains when Captain Steve Rogers and [[Luke Cage]] arrive to recruit [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #144&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as working with the Thunderbolts, Fixer has also been seen working with Baron Zemo.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #606&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Fixer was seen working on a forcefield to secure the rounded up prisoners that escaped from the Raft after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, leveled it.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #159&lt;/ref&gt;

After escaping the Raft by time-traveling, the Thunderbolts wound up meeting their counterparts - the first Thunderbolts team.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #170&lt;/ref&gt; Being as arrogant as they are, present-Fixer and past-Fixer got into an argument in which Fixer impulsively killed his past self.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #173&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the timeline, Fixer surgically changed himself to restore his younger appearance and preserved his age by a blood-transfusion from Centurius. Fixer and the past Thunderbolts' memories were wiped, stranding Fixer in a stable time-loop and preserving the timeline after his mistake.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #174&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Fixer resurfaces where is shown to be a prisoner of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-established [[gated community]] Pleasant Hill where [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]], fragments of a [[Cosmic Cube]] transformed into a nigh-omnipotent child, turned him into a mild-mannered [[mechanic]] named Phil. Phil was able to see through this and arranged a meet-up with a man named Jim. Upon showing the training video he stole that featured the details about Pleasant Hill by Mayor [[Maria Hill]] to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Cadets, Phil used a machine he invented to turn himself back into Fixer and Jim back into Baron Helmut Zemo. Both of them vowed to use the device on the other brainwashed supervillains and reduce Pleasant Hill to dust.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer and Baron Zemo began to restore the memories of the other inmates one by one.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Fixer later invented a device that would help Baron Zemo and his fellow villains find Kobik.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Pleasant Hill incident, Fixer joined up with Winter Soldier's incarnation of the Thunderbolts with the goal to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from continuing the Kobik Project.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time when Baron Zemo formed the third incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Fixer joined the Thunderbolts into fighting them which ends with the Thunderbolts being defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Fixer defected to the Masters of Evil after Winter Soldier was sent back in time to World War II and Kobik had shattered. While Atlas and Moonstone worked to gather Kobik's pieces, Fixer maintained the inventory of the pieces he has with [[Erik Selvig]]. Fixer was later present when Baron Helmut Zemo is advised by the Kobik-reprogrammed Captain America into having the Masters of Evil be part of the Army of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The second version of Fixer is an intuitive genius at invention of weapons and other electrical and mechanical devices. He has designed numerous devices and paraphernalia for himself, including his body armor. As weaponry, he has used various devices including bombs, electronic jamming devices, guided missiles, sonic amplifiers, brain-wave scanners, and mind-control pods. He has also built anti-gravity discs which are affixed to his feet and allow flight at the speed of sound, as well as a special mask which contains a three-hour air supply and acts as an air pressure reduction valve, together enabling flight at high velocity and high altitude. Fixer's Techno body can mentally control his robotic body which is capable of assuming virtually any form from blast cannons to pile-drivers to even the form of a space station. To take on larger shapes, Techno absorbed mass from other mechanical materials nearby. Techno's body also could morph into forms that appeared completely organic, as with his assumed guise of Thunderbolt machine-smith Ogre.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Mr. Fix (Paul Norbert Ebersol) appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by Donny Lucas.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He is a genius inventor and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode "Whiplash", Mr. Fix orders [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]] to kill [[Pepper Potts]]’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); then, Mr. Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, [[Iron Man]] defeats him. In the episode "Man and Iron Man", Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] and [[Killer Shrike]] upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] and [[Justin Hammer]] (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode "Look Into the Light", Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the [[Titanium Man]] armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet found a way to properly bond the armor's titanium to vibranium following the first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. Fix that his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body and that now he can work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the successful test drive of the vibranium-bonded Titanium Man armor, and gives him the User Interface chip that he took from Black Widow and Hawkeye. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 to find a way to make the chip work or he will dispose of him. In the episode "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that [[War Machine]] is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on [[Count Nefaria]]. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in, causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.
* The Paul Norbert Ebersol version of Fixer appears in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-disk-wars-the-avengers-bandai-bachicombat-pokemon-pogs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715135331/http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-disk-wars-the-avengers-bandai-bachicombat-pokemon-pogs/ |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Van Ness Lothrop''' (August 8, 1817 – July 12, 1897) was a politician in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]], serving as the seventh [[Michigan Attorney General]] from 1848 until 1851.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Lothrop was born in [[Easton, Massachusetts]], the son of Howard Lothrop and Sally (Williams) Lothrop.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; George grew up on the family farm in Easton. George's sister Sarah married [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], railroad industrialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=William T.|title=The New England states, their constitutional, judicial, educational, commercial, professional and industrial history|date=1897|publisher=D.H. Hurd &amp; Co.|page=390|edition=Vol 1|url=https://archive.org/details/newenglandstates01davi|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George studied for one year at [[Amherst College]], and graduated from [[Brown University]] in 1838. He started law school at [[Harvard College]], but didn't finish due to ill health. He was a member of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

He moved to live on his brother Edwin's farm in [[Prairie Ronde Township, Michigan|Prairie Ronde]], Michigan, to recover.&lt;ref name=SMOA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Henry|title=America's Successful Men of Affairs|date=1896|publisher=New York Tribune|page=511|url=https://archive.org/details/americassuccessf01hallrich|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Lothrop moved to Detroit to finish his law studies, and found success as a lawyer.&lt;ref name=SMOA/&gt; Lothrop was married in 1847 to Almira Strong of [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name=SMOA /&gt;

Lothrop was a candidate for [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] from [[Michigan's 1st congressional district]], losing to Republican [[William Alanson Howard]] in 1856 and to [[Bradley F. Granger]] in 1860. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]] from Michigan in 1860 and a delegate to the [[Michigan State Constitution]]al convention in 1867 (which did not produce a constitution approved by the voters). Lothrup served as [[United States Ambassador to Russia|U.S. Minister to Russia]] from 1885 to 1888.

He died on July 12, 1897 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] of [[hyperthermia]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=George V.N. Lothrop Dead. Ex-Minister to Russia Succumbs to Heat Prostration at His Home. in Detroit |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06E3D71230E333A25750C1A9619C94669ED7CF |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date= |accessdate=2015-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred [[Elmwood Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan)|Elmwood Cemetery]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

==Family==
Lothrop's brother, [[Edwin H. Lothrop]], was Speaker of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]] in 1844. Lothrop's daughter, Emily Anne "Nan" Lothrop (1860–1927), married Baron Barthold Theodorevitch von Hoyningen-Huene (1859–1942), a Baltic nobleman and military officer, and their son was the noted fashion photographer [[George Hoyningen-Huene]]. His brother-in-law, [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], was affiliated with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].

==Memorials==
A Michigan historical marker on Charlevoix Avenue in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan commemorates a stand of pine trees that George V.N. Lothrop planted on the site in 1878. These trees became the "feeder stock" for many of the pine groves that are now widespread in the eastern suburbs of Detroit. The street just across Charlevoix Avenue from the pine plantation is named Lothrop Road in George V.N. Lothrop's honor.

'''HCT116''' is a human [[colon cancer]] [[cell line]] used in therapeutic research and drug screenings.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480407002788|title=Characterization of HCT116 Human Colon Cancer Cells in an Orthotopic Model|date=15 June 2008|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2007.04.021|volume=147|issue=2|pages=276-281|first1=Ashwani|last1=Rajput|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
HCT116 cells have a mutation in codon 13 of the [[KRAS]] [[Oncogene#Proto-oncogene|proto-oncogene]], and are suitable [[transfection]] targets for gene therapy research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atcc.org/products/all/CCL-247.aspx|publisher=ATCC|access-date=4 May 2018|title=HCT 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells have an epithelial morphology and can metastasize in [[xenograft]] models.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; When [[Transduction (genetics)|transducted]] with [[viral vectors]] carrying the [[p53]] gene, HCT116 cells remain arrested in the [[G1 phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Regulation of p53 Stability and Function in HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480407002788|date=9 December 2003|doi=10.1074/jbc.M311732200|first1=Matthias|last1=Kaeser|display-authors=etal|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=279|pages=7598-7605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of HCT116 colonies was found to be inhibited by 5-Fu/P85 copolymer micelles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inhibition of Growth and Metastasis of Colon Cancer by Delivering 5-Fluorouracil-loaded Pluronic P85 Copolymer Micelles|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20896#f2|first1=Pengxi|last1=Zhu|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|date=11 February 2016|doi=10.1038/srep20896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it was found that the [[Gene knockout|knockout]] of [[MARCH2]] limited growth of HCT116 cells via stress on the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Knockout of MARCH2 inhibits the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2017347|first1=Dan|last1=Xia|doi=10.1038/cddis.2017.347|journal=Cell Death and Disease|volume=8|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Use in research==
HCT116 cells are used in a variety of biomedical studies involving colon cancer proliferation and corresponding inhibitors. The cell line has been used in [[Carcinogenesis|tumorigenicity]] studies, along with other research that has shown that [[Cyclin D1]] holds large importance for the activity of lithocholic acid hydroxyamide. HCT116 cells can also function in [[xenografts]], with [[docetaxel]], [[5-FU]], and [[flavopiridol]] limiting tumor growth ''in vitro''.

The HCT116 cell line was found to have two variations; one with a large expression of the Insp8 gene, and the other without. The Insp8 gene is part of a cell's [[energy metabolism]] process, and can affect the cellular [[phenotype]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inositol Pyrophosphate Profiling of Two HCT116 Cell Lines Uncovers Variation in InsP8 Levels|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165286|date=27 October 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165286|first1=Chunfang|last1=Gu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''homeobox''' is a [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]], around 180 [[base pair]]s long, found within [[gene]]s that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development ([[morphogenesis]]) in [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s. These genes encode '''homeodomain''' [[protein]] products that are [[transcription factor]]s sharing a characteristic [[protein fold]] structure that binds [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="PUB00005390"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gehring WJ | title = The homeobox in perspective | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 277–80 | date = Aug 1992 | pmid = 1357790 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(92)90434-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7903947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gehring WJ | title = Exploring the homeobox | journal = Gene | volume = 135 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 215–21 | date = Dec 1993 | pmid = 7903947 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(93)90068-E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bürglin, TR, Affolter, M | title = Homeodomain proteins: an update | journal = Chromosoma | volume =  125| issue = 3 | pages = 1–25 | date = Oct 2015 | pmid = 26464018 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-015-0543-8 | pmc=4901127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "homeo-" prefix in the words "homeobox" and "homeodomain" stems from the [[mutation|mutational phenotype]] known as "[[homeosis]]", which is frequently observed when these genes are mutated in [[animals]]. [[Homeosis]] is a term coined by [[William Bateson]] to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part. Homeobox genes are not only found in animals, but have also been found in [[fungus|fungi]], for example the [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[yeast]]s, in plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt;

== Discovery ==
Homeoboxes were discovered independently in 1983 by [[:de:Ernst Hafen|Ernst Hafen]], [[Michael Levine (biologist)|Michael Levine]], and [[William McGinnis]] working in the lab of [[Walter Jakob Gehring]] at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]]; and by [[Matthew P. Scott]] and Amy Weiner, who were then working with [[Thomas Kaufman]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]].&lt;ref name="pmid6323992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinnis W, Levine MS, Hafen E, Kuroiwa A, Gehring WJ | title = A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the Drosophila Antennapedia and bithorax complexes | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5958 | pages = 428–33 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6323992 | doi = 10.1038/308428a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6330741"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Weiner AJ | title = Structural relationships among genes that control development: sequence homology between the Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and fushi tarazu loci of Drosophila | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 81 | issue = 13 | pages = 4115–9 | date = Jul 1984 | pmid = 6330741 | pmc = 345379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.13.4115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of homeobox genes were first discovered in ''[[Drosophila]]'', where mutations in homeobox genes caused the radical alterations known as "[[homeosis|homeotic]] transformations". One of the most famous such mutation is ''[[antennapedia]]'', in which legs grow from the head of a fly instead of the expected antennae.

== Homeodomain proteins ==
A homeobox is about 180 DNA [[base pair]]s long and encodes a [[protein domain]] that binds [[DNA]]. The following shows the [[consensus sequence|consensus]] homeodomain (~60 amino acid residue chain):&lt;ref name="urlwww.csb.ki.se"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csb.ki.se/groups/tbu/homeo/consensus.gif | title = The homeobox page| format = gif | author = Bürglin  TR | publisher = Karolinksa Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===

The characteristic homeodomain [[protein fold]] consists of a 60-[[amino acid]] long domain composed of three alpha helixes. Helix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called [[helix-turn-helix]] (HTH) structure, where the two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] are connected by a short loop region. The [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] two helices of the homeodomain are [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] and the longer [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with [[DNA]] via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific [[side chain]]s and the exposed [[nucleotide|base]]s within the [[major groove]] of the DNA.&lt;ref name="PUB00005540" /&gt;

Homeodomain proteins are found in [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt; Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to  prokaryotic transcription factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_0_0/superfamily/1.10.10.60|title=CATH Superfamily 1.10.10.60|author=|date=|website=www.cathdb.info|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[lambda phage]] proteins that alter the expression of genes in [[prokaryote]]s. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., [[Lambda phage#Protein function overview|cro]] and [[repressor protein]]s, homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereo-chemical requirement for [[glycine]] in the turn which is needed to avoid [[steric]] interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.

===Sequence specificity===

Homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to [[B-DNA]] with the C-terminal recognition helix aligning in the DNA's major groove and the unstructured peptide "tail" at the N-terminus aligning in the minor groove. The recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in [[arginine]] and [[lysine]] residues, which form [[hydrogen bond]]s to the DNA backbone; [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] [[hydrophobic]] residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. Homeodomain proteins show a preference for the DNA sequence 5'-TAAT-3'; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity.

===Biological function===

Through the DNA-recognition properties of the homeodomain, homeoproteins are believed to regulate the expression of targeted genes and direct the formation of many body structures during early embryonic development.&lt;ref name="pmid1357628"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corsetti MT, Briata P, Sanseverino L, Daga A, Airoldi I, Simeone A, Palmisano G, Angelini C, Boncinelli E, Corte G | title = Differential DNA binding properties of three human homeodomain proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 20 | issue = 17 | pages = 4465–72 | date = Sep 1992 | pmid = 1357628 | pmc = 334173 | doi = 10.1093/nar/20.17.4465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many homeodomain proteins induce [[cellular differentiation]] by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual [[biological tissue|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. Other proteins in the family, such as [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] are involved in maintaining [[pluripotency]]. Homeobox genes are critical in the establishment of body axes during [[embryogenesis]].

Homeoprotein transcription factors typically switch on cascades of other genes. The homeodomain binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. However, the specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize only its desired target genes. Most of the time, homeodomain proteins act in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter region]] of their target genes as complexes with other transcription factors. Such complexes have a much higher target specificity than a single homeodomain protein. Homeodomains are encoded both by genes of the [[Hox gene|Hox gene clusters]] and by other genes throughout the genome.

The homeobox domain was first identified in a number of ''Drosophila'' [[Homeosis|homeotic]] and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="PUB00005390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00005540"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schofield PN |title=Patterns, puzzles and paradigms - The riddle of the homeobox |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue= |pages=3–6 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(87)90113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00000591"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Tamkun JW, Hartzell GW | title = The structure and function of the homeodomain | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 989 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–48 | date = Jul 1989 | pmid = 2568852 | doi = 10.1016/0304-419x(89)90033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant homeobox genes ==
As in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long DNA-binding homeodomain or in case of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an "atypical" homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. According to their conserved intron–exon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: HD-ZIP I to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX, PHD, DDT, NDX, LD, SAWADEE and PINTOX.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukherjee K, Brocchieri L, Bürglin TR | title = A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 2775–94 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19734295 | pmc = 2775110 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for TALE&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bürglin TR | title = Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 21 | pages = 4173–80 | date = Nov 1997 | pmid = 9336443 | pmc = 147054 | doi =  10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-TALE homeodomain proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derelle R, Lopez P, Le Guyader H, Manuel M | title = Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal = Evolution &amp; Development | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17501745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POU genes==
{{further|POU family}}
Proteins containing a POU region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, [[structurally homologous]] POU domain that contains two [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with [[consensus sequence]] 5'-ATGCAAAT-3'. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in [[bacteriophage]]s, particularly [[lambda phage]].

In humans, the POU genes are [[HDX (gene)|HDX]]; [[POU1F1]]; [[POU2F1]]; [[POU2F2]]; [[POU2F3]]; [[POU3F1]]; [[POU3F2]]; [[POU3F3]]; [[POU3F4]]; [[POU4F1]]; [[POU4F2]]; [[POU4F3]]; [[POU5F1]]; [[POU5F1P1]]; [[POU5F1P4]]; [[POU5F2]]; [[POU6F1]]; and [[POU6F2]].

They are essential [[metazoa]]n genes as they determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterio-posterior axis.&lt;ref name="pmid12445403"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso CR | title = Hox proteins: sculpting body parts by activating localized cell death | journal = Current Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 22 | pages = R776-8 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12445403 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01291-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in ''[[Xenopus]]'' by Eddy De Robertis and colleagues in 1984, marking the beginning of the young science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo").&lt;ref name="pmid6327066"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrasco AE, McGinnis W, Gehring WJ, De Robertis EM | title = Cloning of an X. laevis gene expressed during early embryogenesis coding for a peptide region homologous to Drosophila homeotic genes | journal = Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 409–14 | date = Jun 1984 | pmid = 6327066 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(84)90371-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in these [[homeotic gene]]s cause displacement of organs.

In vertebrates, the four [[homology (biology)|paralog]] clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. In particular, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] axis.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behaviour. They are typically found in an organized cluster. The linear order of the genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order of the regions they affect as well as the timing in which they are affected. This phenomenon is called colinearity. Due to this linear relationship, changes in the gene cluster due to mutations generally result in similar changes in the affected regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

For example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. This is called [[Ectopic expression|ectopia]]. Famous examples are [[Antennapedia]] and [[Bithorax complex|bithorax]] in ''Drosophila'', which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the [[Cnidaria]] since before the earliest true [[Bilateria|Bilatera]], making these genes pre-[[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref name="pmid17252055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan JF, Mazza ME, Pang K, Matus DQ, Baxevanis AD, Martindale MQ, Finnerty JR | title = Pre-bilaterian origins of the Hox cluster and the Hox code: evidence from the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e153 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17252055 | pmc = 1779807 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human homeobox genes==
The Hox genes in humans are organized in four chromosomal clusters:

[[ParaHox]] genes are analogously found in four areas. They include [[CDX1]], [[CDX2]], [[Cdx protein family|CDX4]]; [[GSX1]], [[GSX2]]; and [[PDX1]]. Other genes considered Hox-like include [[Evx1|EVX1]], [[EVX2]]; [[GBX1]], [[GBX2]]; [[MEOX1]], [[MEOX2]]; and [[MNX1]]. The NK-like (NKL) genes, some of which are considered "MetaHox", are grouped with Hox-like genes into a large ANTP-like group.&lt;ref name=pmc2211742/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coulier |first1=François |last2=Popovici |first2=Cornel |last3=Villet |first3=Régis |last4=Birnbaum |first4=Daniel |title=MetaHox gene clusters |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |date=15 December 2000 |volume=288 |issue=4 |pages=345–351 |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001215)288:4&lt;345::AID-JEZ7&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have a [[DLX gene family|"distal-less homeobox" family]]: [[DLX1]], [[DLX2]], [[DLX3 (gene)|DLX3]], [[DLX4]], [[DLX5]], and [[DLX6]]. Dlx genes are involved in the development of the nervous system and of limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kraus P, Lufkin T | title = Dlx homeobox gene control of mammalian limb and craniofacial development | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A | volume = 140 | issue = 13 | pages = 1366–74 | date = Jul 2006 | pmid = 16688724 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.31252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered a subset of the NK-like genes.&lt;ref name=pmc2211742/&gt;

Human TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) homeobox genes for an "atypical" homeodomain consist of 63 rather than 60 amino acids:
[[IRX1]], [[IRX2]], [[IRX3]], [[IRX4]], [[IRX5]], [[IRX6]]; [[MEIS1]], [[MEIS2]], [[MEIS3]]; [[MKX]]; [[PBX1]], [[PBX2]], [[PBX3]], [[PBX4]]; [[PKNOX1]], [[PKNOX2]]; [[TGIF1]], [[TGIF2]], [[TGIF2LX]], [[TGIF2LY]].&lt;ref name=pmc2211742/&gt;

== Mutations ==
Mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible [[phenotype|phenotypic]] changes.

Two examples of homeobox mutations in the above-mentioned fruit fly are legs where the antennae should be ([[antennapedia]]), and a second pair of wings.

Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the [[evolution]] of segmented animals. However, Hox genes typically determine the identity of body segments.

There is one [[insect]] family, the [[Xyelidae|xyelid sawflies]], in which both the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and mouthparts are remarkably leg-like in structure. This is not uncommon in arthropods as all arthropod appendages are homologous.

== Regulation ==
Hox genes and their associated microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24996520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatlekar S, Fields JZ, Boman BM | title = HOX genes and their role in the development of human cancers | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 92 | issue = 8 | pages = 811–23 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 24996520 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-014-1181-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. [[Drosophila]] is known to use the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] and [[Trithorax]] Complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. [[Polycomb-group proteins]] can silence the HOX genes by modulation of [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name="Portoso"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | vauthors = Portoso M, Cavalli G | year = 2008 | chapter = The Role of RNAi and Noncoding RNAs in Polycomb Mediated Control of Gene Expression and Genomic Programming | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | publisher = Caister Academic Press | url = http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | isbn = 978-1-904455-25-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary Origin ==
The homeobox itself may have evolved from a non-DNA-binding transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the MraY enzyme. This is based on metagenomic data  acquired from the transitional archaeon, Lokiarchaeum, that is regarded as the prokaryote closest to the ancestor of all eukaryotes. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328511976_The_origin_of_the_Homeobox_at_the_C-terminus_of_MraY_in_Lokiarchaea&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insect thermoregulation''' is the process whereby insects maintain body temperatures within certain boundaries. [[Insects]] have traditionally been considered as ''[[poikilotherms]]'' (animals in which body temperature is variable and dependent on ambient temperature) as opposed to being ''[[homeothermic]]'' (animals which maintain a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influences). However, the term ''temperature regulation'', or ''[[thermoregulation]]'', is currently used to describe the ability of insects and other animals to maintain a stable temperature (either above or below ambient temperature), at least in a portion of their bodies by  physiological or behavioral means.&lt;ref name="Heinrich"&gt;{{Citation |first=Bernd |last=Heinrich |year=1993 |title= The hot-blooded insects: Strategies and mechanisms of thermoregulation |pages=601 |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn= 0-674-40838-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NHYuT94xvWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many insects are ''[[ectotherms]]'' (animals in which their heat source is primarily from the environment), others are ''[[Endothermy|endotherms]]'' (animals which can produce heat internally by biochemical processes). These endothermic insects are better described as ''[[Heterothermy|regional heterotherms]]'' because they are not uniformly endothermic.  When heat is being produced, different temperatures are maintained in different parts of their bodies, for example, [[moths]] generate heat in their [[thorax]] prior to flight but the [[abdomen]] remains relatively cool.&lt;ref name="Heinrich2"&gt;{{Citation |editor= Heinrich, Bernd |year=1981 |title= Insect thermoregulation |pages=328 |place= New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-05144-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ww6LAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:VVOId1Kwp40C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-flight thermoregulation==

[[Animal flight]] is a very energetically expensive form of locomotion which requires a high [[metabolic rate]]. In order for an animal to fly, its '''flight [[muscles]]''' need to be capable of high mechanical power output which in turn, due to biochemical inefficiencies, end up producing large amounts of [[heat]].&lt;ref name=Josephson&gt;{{Citation |first=R.K. |last=Josephson |first2=R.D. |last2=Stevenson |year=1991 |title= The efficiency of a flight muscle from the locust Schistocerca americana |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=442 |issue=1 |pages=413–429 |doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1991.sp018800|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/442/1/413.full.pdf+html |pmid=1798034 |pmc=1179896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a flying insect produces heat which, as long as it does not exceed an upper lethal limit, will be tolerated. However, if the flying insect is also exposed to external sources of heat (for example, [[radiation]] from the sun) or ambient temperatures are too high, it should be able to thermoregulate and stay in its temperature comfort zone. The first mechanism that comes to mind for insects to lose heat during flight is [[convection]] because higher speeds necessarily increase convective cooling. Nonetheless, higher flying velocities have been shown to result in an increase, instead of a reduction, of thoracic temperature.&lt;ref name=Heinrich3&gt;{{Citation |first=B. |last=Heinrich |year=1971 |title= Temperature regulation of the sphinx moth, ''Manduca sexta''. I. Flight energetics and body temperature during free and tethered flight |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=54 |pages=141–152 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/54/1/141.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably caused by the flight muscles working at higher levels and consequently, increasing thoracic heat generation. The first evidence for insect thermoregulation in flight came from experiments in moths demonstrating that dissipation of heat occurs via [[hemolymph]] movement from the thorax to the abdomen.&lt;ref name=Heinrich4&gt;{{Citation |first=B. |last=Heinrich |year=1970 |title= Nervous control of the heart during thoracic temperature regulation in a sphinx moth |journal=Science |volume=169 |issue=3945 |pages=606–607 |doi=10.1126/science.169.3945.606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of these moths makes a loop through the center of the thorax facilitating heat exchange and converting the abdomen into both a [[heat sink]] and a [[heat radiator]] that helps the flying insect in maintaining a stable thoracic temperature under different ambient temperature conditions. Thus, it was believed that heat regulation was only achieved by varying heat loss until evidence for varying heat production was observed in honeybees.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{Citation |first=Jon F. |last=Harrison |first2=Jennifer H. |last2=Fewell |first3=Stephen P. |last3=Roberts |first4=H. Glenn |last4=Hall |doi=10.1126/science.274.5284.88 |year=1996 |title=Achievement of thermal stability by varying metabolic heat production in flying honeybees |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5284 |pages=88–90 |pmid=8810252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, it was then suggested that thermal stability in honeybees, and probably many other heterothermic insects, was primarily attained by varying heat production. Whether flying insects are able or not to regulate their thoracic temperature by regulating heat production or only by varying heat loss, is still a matter of debate.

== Pre-flight thermoregulation==

[[File:Insect warm-up.jpg|thumb|Thoracic temperature changes in a moth recorded with an infra-red camera]]
Several large insects have evolved to warm-up previous to flight so that energetically demanding activities, such as flight, are possible.&lt;ref name=Heinrich5&gt;{{Citation |first=Bernd |last=Heinrich |doi= 10.1126/science.185.4153.747 |year=1974 |title= Thermoregulation in Endothermic Insects |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4153 |pages=747–756 |pmid=4602075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect [[behavior]] involves inefficient muscle operation which produces excess heat and establishes the thermal range in which specific muscles best function. The high metabolic cost of insect flight muscles means that great amounts of chemical energy are utilized by these specific muscles. However, only a very small percentage of this energy translates into actual mechanical work or wing movement.&lt;ref name=Josephson/&gt; Thus, the rest of this chemical energy is transformed into heat that in turn produces body temperatures significantly greater than those of the ambient.

These high temperatures at which flight muscles work impose a constraint on low temperature take-off because an insect at rest has its flight muscles at ambient temperature which is not the optimal temperature for these muscles to function. So, heterothermic insects have adapted to make use of the excess heat produced by flight muscles to increase their thoracic temperature pre-flight. Both the '''dorsolongitudinal muscles''' (which flip down the wings during flight) and the '''dorsoventral muscles''' (which cause the wings to flip upward during flight) are involved in the pre-flight warm-up behavior but in a slightly different way. During flight, these function as [[antagonistic muscles]] to produce the wing flapping that allows for sustained flight. However, during warm-up these muscles are contracted simultaneously (or almost simultaneously in some insects)&lt;ref name=Kammer&gt;{{Citation |first=Ann E. |last=Kammer |year=1968 |title= Motor patterns during flight and warm-up in Lepidoptera |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=48 |pages=89–109  |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/48/1/89.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce no wing movement (or a minimal amount of wing movement) and produce as much heat as possible to elevate thoracic temperatures to flight-levels. 
The pre-flight warm-up behavior of male moths (''[[Helicoverpa zea]]'') has been shown to be affected by olfactory information.&lt;ref name=Crespo&gt;{{Citation |first=Jose G. |last=Crespo |first2=Franz |last2=Goller |first3=Neil J. |last3=Vickers |year=2012 |title= Pheromone mediated modulation of pre-flight warm-up behavior in male moths |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |pages=2203–2209 |doi=10.1242/jeb.067215  |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2203.full.pdf+html |pmid=22675180 |pmc=3368620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crespo2&gt;{{Citation |first=Jose G. |last=Crespo |first2=Neil J. |last2=Vickers |first3=Franz |last3=Goller |year=2013 |title= Female pheromones modulate flight muscle activation patterns during preflight warm-up |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=110 |pages=862–871 |doi=10.1152/jn.00871.2012 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/110/4/862.full.pdf+html |pmid=23699056 |pmc=3742977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crespo3&gt;{{Citation |first=Jose G. |last=Crespo |first2=Neil J. |last2=Vickers |first3=Franz |last3=Goller |year=2014 |title= Male moths optimally balance take-off thoracic temperature and warm-up duration to reach a pheromone source quickly |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=98 |pages=79–85 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.031 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214003765|pmc=4224300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in many moths, the males of this species respond to female pheromone by flying towards the female and trying to mate with her. During the warm-up of their flight muscles, and when in presence of the female pheromone, males generate heat at higher rates so as to take off earlier and out-compete other males that might have also sensed the pheromone.

Achieving elevated temperatures as stated above fall under the term '''physiological thermoregulation''' because heat is generated by a physiological process inside the insect. The other described way of thermoregulation is called '''behavioral thermoregulation''' because body temperature is controlled by behavioral means, such as basking in the sun. Butterflies are a good example of insects that are heliotherms (deriving heat almost exclusively from the sun).&lt;ref name=Clench&gt;{{Citation |first=N. S. |last=Clench |year=1966 |title= Behavioral thermoregulation in butterflies |journal=Ecology |volume=47 |pages=1021–1034  |jstor=1935649 |doi=10.2307/1935649 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other thermoregulatory examples==

Some nocturnal [[dung beetles]] have been shown to increase their ball-making and ball-rolling velocity when their thoracic temperature increases.&lt;ref name=Bartholomew&gt;{{Citation |first=George A. |last=Bartholomew |first2=Bernd |last2=Heinrich |year=1978 |title= Endothermy in African dung beetles during flight, ball making, and ball rolling |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=73 |pages=65–83 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/73/1/65.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these beetles, dung is a precious commodity that allows them to find a mate and feed their larvae. Discovering the resource soon is important so that they can start rolling a ball as soon as possible and take it to a distant place for burying. The beetles first detect the dung by olfactory cues and fly towards it rapidly. As they first arrive, their body temperatures are still high due to their flight metabolism which allows them to make and roll balls faster; and the bigger the ball, the better chances they have of getting a mate. However, as time passes, a grounded beetle making a ball starts to cool off and it becomes harder to increase the size of the dung ball and also transport it. So, there is a trade-off between making a large ball that would guarantee a mate but might be not easily transported and a smaller ball which might not attract a mate but can be safely taken to the burying place. Additionally, other beetles that arrive later (which are hotter), can actually fight over balls and have been shown to usually win against beetles that are cooler.&lt;ref name=Heinrich6&gt;{{Citation |first=Bernd |last=Heinrich |first2=George A. |last2=Bartholomew |year=1979 |title= Role of endothermy and size in inter- and intraspecific competition for elephant dung in an African dung beetle, ''Scarabaeus laevistriatus'' |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=484–496 |jstor=10.2307/30155939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of thermoregulation is that of heat being used as a defensive mechanism. The Japanese honeybee (''[[Apis cerana japonica]]'') is preyed upon by a hornet (''[[Vespa simillima xanthoptera]]'') that usually waits at the entrance of their hive. Even though the hornets are many times bigger  than the bees, bees numbers make the difference. These bees are adapted to survive temperatures above {{convert|46|°C|°F}} but the hornet is not. Thus, bees are able to kill their attacker by making a ball around the hornet and then increasing their body temperature above {{convert|46|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name=Ono&gt;{{Citation |first=M. |last=Ono |first2=I. |last2=Okada  |first3=M. |last3=Sasaki |year=1987 |title=Heat production by balling in the Japanese noneybee, ''Apis cerana japonica'' as a defensive behavior against the hornet, ''Vespa simillima xanthoptera'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)
 |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=1031–1034 |doi=10.1007/BF01952231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of Malaria, thermoregulate each time they take a blood meal on a warm-blooded animal. During blood ingestion, they emit a droplet composed of urine and fresh blood that they keep attached to their anus.  The liquid of the drop evaporates dissipating the excess of heat in their bodies consequence of the rapid ingestion or relatively high amounts of blood much warmer than the insect itself.  This evaporative cooling mechanism helps them to avoid the thermal stress associated to their haematophagous way of life.&lt;ref name="Lahondère"&gt;{{Citation |first=Chloé |last=Lahondère |first2=Claudio R.|last2=Lazzari |year=2012 |title= Mosquitoes Cool Down during Blood Feeding to Avoid Overheating |journal=Current Biology |volume=22 |pages=40–45 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.029 |pmid=22177900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grayling butterfly (''[[Grayling (butterfly)|Hipparchia semele]]'') engages in thermoregulation as well. The species prefers to live in open habitats with easy access to the sun, and can be seen orienting its body to maximize exposure to the sun. At lower temperatures, the grayling can be observed exposing as much of its body as possible to the sun, whereas at higher temperatures, it exposes as little of its body as possible. This behavior is often used by male butterflies defending their territory, as this thermoregulatory behavior allows them to maximize their flight efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreisig|first=H.|date=1995-02-01|title=Thermoregulation and flight activity in territorial male graylings, Hipparchia semele (Satyridae), and large skippers, Ochlodes venata (Hesperiidae)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317280|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=101|issue=2|pages=169–176|doi=10.1007/BF00317280|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers.jpg|thumb|280px|A portion of [[Hippolyte Delaroche]]'s 1836 oil painting ''[[Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers]]'']]

An '''insult''' is an expression or statement (or sometimes behavior) which is [[Respect|disrespectful]] or scornful. Insults  may be intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; An insult may be [[fact]]ual, but at the same time [[pejorative]], such as the word "[[Inbreeding|inbred]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Vos|first1=George|title=Status inequality: the self in culture|date=1990|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jocular exchange==

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered insults a primary form of [[social interaction]], central to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary order]] – "a situation that is symbolised in the 'Yah-boo, so are you' of the transitivist quarrel, the original form of aggressive communication".{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- WTF with this transitivist yah-boo? This is encyclopedia, supposed to explain things, not for wisecracks--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] points out that every "crack or remark set up the possibility of a counter-riposte, topper, or squelch, that is, a comeback".&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; He cites the example of possible interchanges at a dance in a school gym:
{{quotation|
* A one-liner:  Boy: "Care to dance?" Girl: "No, I came here to play basketball" Boy: "Crumbles"
* A comeback:  Boy: "Care to dance?" Girl: "No, I came here to play basketball" Boy: "Sorry, I should have guessed by the way you're dressed".&lt;ref&gt;''Mad'', quoted in Goffman, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Backhanded compliment}} Backhanded compliments ==

Backhanding is referred to as [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]] someone using the back of the hand instead of the palm—that is generally a symbolic, less forceful blow.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}} Correspondingly, a backhanded (or left-handed) compliment, or [[wikt:asteism|asteism]], is an insult that is disguised as, or accompanied by, a [[wikt:compliment|compliment]], especially in situations where the belittling or condescension is intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded |title=Backhanded — Definition of Backhanded at Dictionary.com: |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211212617/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backhanded| archivedate= 11 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of backhanded compliments include, but not limited to:

*"I did not expect you to ace that exam. Good for you.", which could impugn the target's success as a fluke.&lt;ref name=AboutRela&gt;{{cite web|last=Burbach|first= Cherie|title=Backhanded Compliment. About Relationships. n.d. |website=about.com|accessdate=2 January 2015 |url=http://friendship.about.com/od/Friendship_Definitions/g/Backhanded-Compliment.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"That skirt makes you look far thinner.", insinuating hidden fat.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;
*"I wish I could be as straightforward as you, but I always try to get along with everyone.", insinuating an overbearing attitude.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;
*"I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger person.", insinuating decline with age.&lt;ref name=AboutRela/&gt;

==Sexual==

Verbal insults often take [[Prick (slang)|a phallic form]]; this includes offensive [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Renold, ''Girls, Boys, and Junior Sexualities'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and may also include insults to ones [[sexuality]].

==Formal==

The [[flyting]] was a formalized sequence of literary insults: invective or flyting, the literary equivalent of the spell-binding curse, uses similar incantatory devices for opposite reasons, as in [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]]'s ''Flyting with Kennedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973 )p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

"A little-known survival of the ancient 'flytings', or contests-in-insults of the Anglo-Scottish bards, is the type of [[xenophobic]] humor once known as 'water wit' in which passengers in small boats crossing the [[Thames]] ... would insult each other grossly, in all the untouchable safety of being able to get away fast."&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol I (1973) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson]] once triumphed in such an exchange: "a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery, Johnson answered him thus, 'Sir, your wife, ''under pretence of keeping a bawdy-house'', is a receiver of stolen goods.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson|The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomies==
[[File:Uwot.jpg|thumb|The use of the [[V sign]] as an insult, combined with the upwards swing movement]]

Various typologies of insults have been proposed over the years. [[Ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]], noting that "almost any action can operate as an Insult Signal if it is performed out of its appropriate context – at the wrong time or in the wrong place", classes such signals in ten 'basic categories":&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''Manwatching'' (London 1987) p. 186-192. {{ISBN|9780810913103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Disinterest signals
# Boredom signals
# Impatience signals
# Superiority signals
# Deformed-compliment signals
# Mock-discomfort signals
# Rejection signals
# Mockery signals
# Symbolic insults
# Dirt signals

[[Elizabethans]] took great interest in such analyses, distinguishing out, for example, the "fleering frump ... when we give a mock with a scornful countenance as in some smiling sort looking aside or by drawing the lip awry, or shrinking up the nose".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Puttenham]] in Boris Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) p. 72=3&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare humerously set up an insult-hierarchy of seven-fold "degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Shakespeare]]. ''[[As You Like It]]'', Act V, Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions==

What qualifies as an insult is also determined both by the individual social situation and by changing social [[mores]]. Thus on one hand the insulting "obscene invitations of a man to a strange girl can be the spicy endearments of a husband to his wife".&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paris - Playing chess at the Jardins du Luxembourg - 2966.jpg|thumb|Intellect is often referred to the rational and logical side of the human mind.]]&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: See talk page: this mini-article is an attempt to provide a suitable target for the many current and future article text links to "Intellect". It is not appropriate to leave them as "links to disambiguation page". It may be non-standard, but seems appropriate in this case where experts in the field cannot agree which article is really "Intellect". --&gt;

'''Intellect''' is a term used in studies of the [[human]] [[mind]], and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]], and about how to [[problem solving|solve problems]]. Historically the term comes from the Greek philosophical term ''nous'', which was translated into Latin as ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]]'' (derived from the verb ''intelligere'', "to understand", from ''inter'', "between" and ''legere'', "to choose"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Andrew M.|title=A dictionary of psychology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=9780191726828|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and into French and then English as ''[[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]]'' (other than ''intellect''). Intellect is in fact considered as a branch of [[intelligence]] (see [[#Intellect vs intelligence|Intellect vs intelligence]]).

Discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of these areas, the terms "intellect" and "intelligence" have continued to be used as related words.

* In philosophy, especially in [[classical philosophy|classical]] and [[medieval philosophy]] the intellect or ''[[nous]]'' is an important subject connected to the question of how humans can [[knowledge|know things]]. Especially during [[late antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], the intellect was often proposed as a concept which could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] with [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the [[cosmos]] itself. (During the Latin Middle Ages a distinction developed whereby the term "intelligence" was typically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which governed the celestial spheres in many of these accounts.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also see: [[passive intellect]] and [[active intellect]].
* In modern [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], intelligence and intellect are used as terms describing mental ability (or [[Theory of multiple intelligences|abilities]]) that allow people to [[understanding|understand]]. A distinction is sometimes made whereby intellect is considered to be related to "facts" in contrast to intelligence concerning "feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-consciousness-question/201205/intellect-and-intelligence|title=Intellect and Intelligence|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellect refers to the cognition and rational mental processes gained through external input rather than internal.

A person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and [[critical thinking|critical]] or [[Logic|analytical]] reasoning in either a [[profession]]al or a [[Individual capacity|personal capacity]] is often referred to as an [[intellectual]].

== Intellect vs intelligence ==
Intellect is often considered to be a branch of [[intelligence]] reflecting mainly its logical and rational side.

Because of the lack of [[emotion]]al and sensitive engagement, intellect is sometimes considered to be strictly limited to [[fact]]s and not going beyond mere raw knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/article/instinct-intellect-intelligence-intuition#gsc.tab=0|title = Instinct, intellect, intelligence, intuition|date = |accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = Nithyananda Sangha|publisher = |last = Sangha|first = Nithyananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, intellect can carry a high level of complexity and thus avoid linear and formal logic patterns by referring to such mental processes as, for example, [[fuzzy logic]] and [[dialectical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John (1989). ''The Intellect''. SAGE Social Science Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of intellect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology of Knowledge, Development of the Intellect|url = http://augustinianparadigm.com/psychology_of_knowledge.htm|website = augustinianparadigm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[Experience]] plays a crucial role in the formation of intellect. Through solving life problems people can reach intellectual enlightenment and improve their [[behavior]]al patterns to act more reasonably and appropriately in the future. Therefore, intellectual development is encouraged by the feeling of dissatisfaction gained from particular situation’s outcome and the emanating search for better solutions. Only experience can provide people with genuine and thoughtful [[understanding]] of [[reality]], which consequently contributes to intellectual development.

Understanding is built upon creating a [[conceptual model|model]] of the reality through human [[perception]] and [[cognition|cognitive reflection]]. The process of finding solutions to life problems enriches human mental “database” of reality attributes. When acquiring the most accurate understanding of the surrounding world, the model mirrored in human [[mind]] becomes very similar or identical to the reality and that is when the intellect releases its full potential.

Intellect that reaches its maturity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=chief|first1=Gary R. VandenBos, editor in|title=APA dictionary of psychology|date=2006|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-1-59147-380-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; is referred as self-management. At this state intellect can encounter every problem it faces and not only change itself in the most efficient manner, but also alter the reality in the most desirable way. Overall, success and [[failure]] turn to depend primarily on the extent of intellectual capabilities.
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|349x349px|Intellect structure by J.P.Guilford]]

== Intellect structure ==
According to [[J. P. Guilford|J.P.Guilford]], intellect consists of three key parameters: operations, contents and products. Each parameter contains specific elements, which are independent and therefore should be measured individually and considered as autonomous units of human intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Structure of Intellect (J.P. Guilford)|url = http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/intellect.html|website = www.instructionaldesign.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations are represented by [[cognition]], [[memory]], [[divergent thinking|divergent]] and [[convergent thinking|convergent production]], and [[evaluation]]. Content can be figural, [[symbol]]ic, [[semantics|semantic]] and behavioral. Products are divided into units, classes, [[Relation of Ideas|relations]], systems, transformations and implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilford's 'structure of intellect' model|url = http://homepages.which.net/~gk.sherman/mbaaaaab.htm|website = homepages.which.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellect in therapy ==
[[Intellectualization]] is a therapeutic method, which is based on avoiding emotional penetration through intense intellectual focus. When exercising this technique, the problem that can cause psychological disturbance is approached from rational, cool and scientific attitude. It is one of the [[defense mechanisms]] described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] that blocks [[feeling]]s to prevent human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] from [[anxiety]] and [[Stress (psychological)|stress]].
	
The principle that shapes intellectualization involves Freud’s concept of [[Id, ego and super-ego]]. [[Ego psychology|Ego]] is a conscious part of [[Personality|human personality]], Id refers to unconscious, “dark” side of human nature driven by animal instincts, and super-ego is a controlling mechanism that adjusts people’s actions and behavior to social norms and expectations. The purpose of intellectualization is to isolate Id and make conscious aspects of life the only object of reflection and consideration. Therefore, this defense mechanism aims to protect ego from unconscious processes, which are often impossible to handle and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching Psychology - Defense Mechanisms|url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/13951/1/Teaching-Psychology--Defense-Mechanisms.html|website = www.healthguidance.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25|last = Lemouse, M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways to launch intellectualization is to use [[jargon]] and complex [[Scientific terminology|scientific terms]] instead of regularly used words. A common example is saying “carcinoma” instead of “cancer” if a doctor wants to mitigate the effect of announcing the disease by driving patient’s attention away from the illness and approaching it more systematically to avoid emotional outburst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intellectualization: isolation from emotions!(A Psychological Tranquilizer) {{!}} Mindful Cogitations|url = http://abhakhetarpal.in/blog/intellectualization-isolation-from-emotions|website = abhakhetarpal.in|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Khetarpal, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, intellectualization is sometimes criticized because of its disregard of feelings. That subsequently leads to the full denial of [[intuition]], which sometimes contributes to [[Decision-making|decision-making process]]. Moreover, the absence of emotional stimuli can deprive people from [[motivation]] and therefore lead to dissatisfaction and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. Furthermore, “emotional constipation” threats human [[Creativity|creativity capabilities]] by replacing them with more matter-of-fact solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Finding Out How We Don't Know Ourselves in Therapy and Counselling.

'''James Abram Garfield''' (November 19, 1831&amp;nbsp;– September 19, 1881)  was the 20th [[President of the United States]], serving from March 4, 1881 until his death [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|by assassination]] six and a half months later. Garfield had served nine terms in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and had been elected to the Senate before his candidacy for the [[White House]], though he declined the Senate seat once elected president. He was the first sitting member of Congress to be elected to the presidency, and remains the only sitting House member to gain the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-election-of-President-James-Garfield-of-Ohio/|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]|title=The election of President James Garfield of Ohio|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield was raised by his widowed mother in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm. He worked at various jobs, including on a [[Barge|canal boat]], in his youth.  Beginning at age 17, he attended several Ohio schools, then studied at [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], graduating in 1856. A year later, Garfield entered politics as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He married [[Lucretia Garfield|Lucretia Rudolph]] in 1858, and served as a member of the [[Ohio Senate|Ohio State Senate]] (1859–1861). Garfield opposed [[Confederate States of America|Confederate secession]], served as a major general in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and fought in the battles of [[Battle of Middle Creek|Middle Creek]], [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent [[Ohio's 19th congressional district|Ohio's 19th District]]. Throughout Garfield's extended congressional service after the Civil War, he firmly supported the [[gold standard]] and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. Garfield initially agreed with [[Radical Republican]] views regarding [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for [[Freedman|freedmen]].

At the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], Senator-elect Garfield attended as campaign manager for [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[John Sherman]], and gave the presidential nomination speech for him.  When neither Sherman nor his rivals&amp;nbsp;– [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[James G. Blaine]]&amp;nbsp;– could get enough votes to secure the nomination, delegates chose Garfield as a compromise on the 36th ballot. In the [[United States presidential election, 1880|1880 presidential election]], Garfield conducted a low-key [[front porch campaign]], and narrowly defeated Democrat [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].

Garfield's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against [[senatorial courtesy]] in executive appointments, energizing [[United States Navy|American naval]] power, and purging corruption in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]], all during his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judicial appointments, including a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justice. He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] by appointing [[William H. Robertson]] to the lucrative post of [[Collector of the Port of New York]], starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for [[African Americans]]. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, [[Chester A. Arthur]], as the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]].

On July 2, 1881, he [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|was shot]] at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] in [[Washington D.C.]] by [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disappointed [[Spoils system|office seeker]]. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple [[assault]] by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered other than for his assassination. Historians often forgo [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents]] due to the short length of his presidency.

==Childhood and early life==
[[File:MorelandHillsGarfieldCabin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A log cabin with a statue and a tree in front|Replica of the [[log cabin]] where Garfield was born]]
James Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in [[Orange Township, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Orange Township]], now [[Moreland Hills, Ohio]]. Orange Township had been in the [[Western Reserve]] until 1800, and like many who settled there, Garfield's ancestors were from New England, his ancestor, Edward Garfield immigrating from [[Hillmorton]], [[Warwickshire]], England, to Massachusetts in around 1630. James' father Abram had been born in [[Worcester, New York]], and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named for an older brother, dead in infancy.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=4–6}}

In early 1833, Abram and Eliza Garfield joined the [[Church of Christ]], a decision that would help shape their youngest son's life.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=6–7}} Abram Garfield died later that year; his son was raised in poverty in a household led by the strong-willed Eliza.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=8–10}} James was her favorite child, and the two remained close for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=4}} Eliza Garfield remarried in 1842, but soon left her second husband, Warren Belden (possibly Alfred Belden), and a then-scandalous divorce was awarded against her in 1850.  James took his mother's side and when Belden died in 1880, noted the fact in his diary with satisfaction.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=10–11}} Garfield enjoyed his mother's stories about his ancestry, especially his [[Welsh people|Welsh]] great-great-grandfathers and his ancestor who served as a knight of [[Caerphilly Castle|Caerffili Castle]].{{sfn|Brown|1881|p=23}}

Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by his fellow boys, and throughout his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=10–11}} He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it.{{sfn|Brown|1881|pp=30–33}} This labor would be used to good effect by [[Horatio Alger]], who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=10}}

After six weeks, illness forced Garfield to return home and, during his recuperation, his mother and a local education official got him to promise to postpone his return to the canals for a year and go to school. Accordingly, in 1848, he began at [[Geauga Seminary]], in nearby [[Chester Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Chester Township]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=14–17}} Garfield later said of his childhood, "I lament that I was born to poverty, and in this chaos of childhood, seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration&amp;nbsp;... a precious 17 years when a boy with a father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=13}}

==Education, marriage and early career==
[[File:Garfield-at-16.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=An unsmiling young man with curly hair wearing a three piece suit|Garfield at age 16]]

At [[Geauga Academy]], which he attended from 1848 to 1850, Garfield learned academic subjects he had not previously had time for. He shone as a student, and was especially interested in languages and elocution.  He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform "creates some excitement. I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=6}} Geauga was co-educational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his fellow students, [[Lucretia Garfield|Lucretia Rudolph]], whom he later married.{{sfn|Brown|1881|pp=71–73}} To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and as a teacher.{{sfn|Brown|1881|pp=47–49}} The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield, and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called "place-seeking", which became, he said, "the law of my life."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=16}} In later years, he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=16}} Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening, and attended many [[camp meeting]]s, at one of which he was [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]. The next day, March 4, 1850, he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the [[Chagrin River]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=17}}{{efn|Church of Christ, Christian Church, and Disciples of Christ were names that were used interchangeably amongst members of a unified movement until the turn of the 20th century when [[Churches of Christ#Christian churches and churches of Christ separation|they separated]].{{sfn|McAlister|Tucker|1975|p=252}} }}

[[File:Lucretia Garfield - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lucretia Garfield]] in the 1870s]]
After leaving Geauga, Garfield worked for a year at various jobs, including teaching.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=21}} Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield determined to do the same, and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named [[Hiram College]]) in [[Hiram, Ohio]], a school run by the Disciples. While there, he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin, but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=27–28}} Securing a position on entry as [[janitor]], he was hired to teach while still a student.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=22–23}} Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute, and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=29}} He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches, in some cases earning a [[gold dollar]] per service. By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher.{{sfnm|Brown|1881|1p=56|Peskin|1978|2p=30}} Garfield then enrolled at [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], as a [[junior (education)|third-year student]], given credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was impressed with the college president, [[Mark Hopkins (educator)|Mark Hopkins]], who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=34}} Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days, "There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=8}} After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby [[Pownal, Vermont]], a post whose previous incumbent was [[Chester A. Arthur]].{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=8}}

Garfield graduated from Williams in August 1856 as [[salutatorian]], giving an address at the [[Graduation|commencement]]. Garfield biographer Ira Rutkow pointed out that the future president's years at Williams gave Garfield the opportunity to know and respect those of different social backgrounds, and despite his origin as an unsophisticated Westerner, he was liked and respected by socially conscious New Englanders. "In short", as Rutkow later wrote, "Garfield had an extensive and positive first experience with the world outside the Western Reserve of Ohio."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=8}}

On his return to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He returned to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=11}} In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=44}} Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to [[read law]] at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram.{{sfn|Brown|1881|pp=74–75}} He was admitted to the bar in 1861.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=82}}

Local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leaders invited Garfield to enter politics upon the death of Cyrus Prentiss, the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot, and was elected, serving until 1861.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=60–61}} Garfield's major effort in the state senate was a bill providing for Ohio's first [[geological survey]] to measure its mineral resources, though it failed.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=73}}

==Civil War==
[[File:General James Garfield - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Seated portrait in army uniform. Garfield has a full beard and mustache|Garfield as a brigadier general during the Civil War]]
After [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s election as president, several Southern states announced their [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the Union to form a new government, the [[Confederate States of America]]. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp = 86–87}} In April 1861, the rebels [[Battle of Fort Sumter|bombarded Fort Sumter]], one of the last federal outposts in the South, beginning the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=86–87}}

At Governor [[William Dennison Jr.|William Dennison's]] request, Garfield deferred his military ambitions to remain in the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=87–89}} Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=87–89}} Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[42nd Ohio Infantry]] regiment.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=90–93}} The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=90–93}} The regiment traveled to [[Camp Chase]], outside [[Columbus, Ohio]], to complete training.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=90–93}} In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the [[Army of the Ohio]] under [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Don Carlos Buell]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=98–101}}

===Buell's command===
Buell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the [[40th Ohio Infantry]], two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=101–103}} They departed [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]], in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=101–103}} The march was uneventful until Union forces reached [[Paintsville, Kentucky]], on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=106–112}} Confederate troops under Brigadier General [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]] held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=106–112}} Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=112–115}} They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the [[Battle of Middle Creek]], the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=76–78}} At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent his troops to [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky|Prestonsburg]] to reprovision.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=116–120}}

[[File:Middle Creek Battlefield.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Middle Creek battlefield; Garfield commanded from the distant hill in the center of the photo.]]
In recognition of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, at the age of 30.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=128}} After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=122–127}} The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=122–127}} Following a brief skirmish at [[Pound Gap]], the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=81–82}}

Garfield's promotion gave him command of the 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which was ordered in early 1862 to join [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s forces as they advanced on [[Corinth, Mississippi]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=131–133}} Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] surprised Grant's men in their camps, driving them back.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=134–135}} Garfield's troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly, joining the rest of the army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=135–137}} The action, later known as the [[Battle of Shiloh]], was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day, but emerged uninjured.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=135–137}} Major General [[Henry W. Halleck]], Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=138–139}}

That summer Garfield suffered from [[jaundice]] and significant weight loss.{{efn|Biographer Allan Peskin speculated this may have been [[infectious hepatitis]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=632–633}}}}{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=146–147}} He was forced to return home, where his wife nursed him back to health.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=146–147}} While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=147–148}} He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=149–151}} During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=160–161}} Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=161–162}} In the meantime, he served on the [[court-martial of Fitz John Porter]] for his tardiness at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=162–165}} He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=162–165}} The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, and by the end of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General [[William S. Rosecrans]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=166}}

===Chief of staff for Rosecrans===
[[File:GenWmSRosecrans.jpg|thumb|upright|General William S. Rosecrans]]
The position of Chief of Staff for a general was usually held by a more junior officer, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond mere communication of orders to duties that involved actual management of his [[Army of the Cumberland]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=176}} Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation, especially when he was unable to sleep; in Garfield, he found "the first well read person in the Army" and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=169}} The two became close in spite of Garfield's being twelve years junior to Rosecrans, and their talks covered all topics, especially religion; Rosecrans, who had converted from [[Methodism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]], succeeded in softening Garfield's view of his faith.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=170}} Garfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders [[Alexander McCook]] and [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Thomas Crittenden]], whom he believed ineffective, but Rosecrans ignored the suggestions.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=177}} With Rosecrans, Garfield devised the [[Tullahoma Campaign]] to pursue and trap Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]] in [[Tullahoma]]. After initial Union success, Bragg retreated toward [[Chattanooga]], where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=180–182}} Garfield argued for an immediate advance, in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=180–182}} After a council of war and lengthy deliberations, Rosecrans agreed to attack.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=183–189}}

At the ensuing [[Battle of Chickamauga]] on September 19 and 20, 1863, confusion among the wing commanders over Rosecrans's orders created a gap in the lines, resulting in a rout of the right flank. Rosecrans concluded that the battle was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to establish a defensive line.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=205–208}} Garfield, however, thought that part of the army had held and, with Rosecrans's approval, headed across [[Missionary Ridge]] to survey the scene. Garfield's hunch was correct.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=205–208}} His ride became legendary, while Rosecrans' error reignited criticism about his leadership.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=205–208}} While Rosecrans's army had avoided disaster, they were stranded in Chattanooga, surrounded by Bragg's army. Garfield sent a telegram to Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] alerting Washington to the need for reinforcements to avoid annihilation, and Lincoln and Halleck delivered 20,000 troops by rail within nine days.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=210}} In the meantime, Grant was promoted to command of the western armies, and quickly replaced Rosecrans with [[George H. Thomas]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=213}} Garfield was ordered to report to Washington, where he was promoted to major general, a commission he would resign before taking a seat in the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=219–220}} According to historian [[Jean Edward Smith]], Grant and Garfield had a "guarded relationship", since Grant promoted Thomas to command of the Army of the Cumberland, rather than Garfield, after Rosecrans was dismissed.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=550–551}}

==Congressional career==

===Election in 1862; Civil War years===
[[File:Mathew Brady, Portrait of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, officer of the United States government (1860–1865).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salmon P. Chase]] was Garfield's ally until Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial.]]

While serving in the Army in early 1862, Garfield was approached by friends about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn, heavily Republican [[Ohio's 19th congressional district|19th district]].  He was worried that he and other state-appointed generals would get obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career.  The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863{{efn|Until the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, Congress convened annually in December.}} would allow him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862, on the eighth ballot. In October, he defeated D.B. Woods by a two-to-one margin in the general election for a seat in the [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]].{{sfnm|Rutkow|2006|1p=17|Peskin|1978|2p=148}}

Soon after the nomination, Garfield was ordered to report to War Secretary [[Edwin Stanton]] in Washington to discuss his military future.  There, Garfield met Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]], who befriended him, seeing him as a younger version of himself. The two men agreed politically, and both were part of the [[Radical Republican|Radical]] wing of the Republican Party.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=18}} Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's [[Thaddeus Stevens]], wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's [[Glorious Revolution]], hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=139–142}} Although Garfield had supported Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the congressman marveled that it was a "...strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=25–26}}

Garfield not only favored abolition of slavery, but believed that the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights. He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure the permanent destruction of slavery.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=233}} Garfield felt Congress was obliged "to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons, without regard to color."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=234}} Garfield was more supportive of Lincoln when Lincoln took action against slavery.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=152}} Early in his tenure, he differed from his party on several issues; his was the solitary Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in recruiting. Some financially able recruits had used the bounty system to buy their way out of service (called commutation), which Garfield considered reprehensible.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=224}} Garfield gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law: that of 300,000 called upon to enlist, barely 10,000 had, the remainder claiming exemption or providing money or a substitute.  Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served, demanding a more effective bill; even if it cost him re-election, Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=145–147}} After many false starts, Garfield, with the support of Lincoln, procured the passage of a conscription bill that excluded commutation.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=232}}

Under Chase's influence, Garfield became a staunch proponent of a dollar backed by a [[gold standard]], and was therefore a strong opponent of the "[[Greenback (money)|greenback]]"; he regretted very much, but understood, the necessity for [[Specie Payment Resumption Act|suspension of payment in gold or silver]] during the emergency presented by the Civil War.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=156}} Garfield voted with the Radical Republicans in passing the [[Wade–Davis Bill]], designed to give Congress more authority over [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but it was defeated by Lincoln's [[pocket veto]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=241}}

Garfield did not consider Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. "He will probably be the man, though I think we could do better."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=25–26}} The Ohioan attended [[1864 National Union National Convention|the party convention]] and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee [[Andrew Johnson]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=240}} Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected.{{sfn|Brown|1881|pp=134–137}} By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], and his relations with Garfield became more distant.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=153}}

Garfield took up the practice of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it: "Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!"{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=250}} The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell "...quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did."{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=154–155}} In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," and in 1878 called Lincoln "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power."{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=155–156}}

===Reconstruction===
Garfield was as firm a supporter of black suffrage as he had been of abolition, though he admitted that the idea of African Americans as political equals with whites gave him "a strong feeling of repugnance."{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=47–48}}{{efn|In a July 1865 letter to Governor [[Jacob Dolson Cox]], Garfield wrote that he felt "a strong sense of repugnance when I think of the negro being made our political equal and I would be glad if they could be colonized, sent to heaven, or got rid of in any decent way .... but colonization has proved a hopeless failure everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;George M. Fredrickson, ''The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on Afro-American Character and Destiny, 1817-1914'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1971), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The new president, Johnson, sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865; Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment. Johnson, an old friend, sought Garfield's backing, and their conversations led Garfield to assume that differences between president and Congress were not large.  When Congress assembled in December (to Johnson's chagrin without the elected representatives of the Southern states, who were excluded), Garfield urged conciliation on his colleagues, although he feared that Johnson, a former Democrat, might combine with other Democrats to gain political control if he rejoined the party. Garfield foresaw conflict even before February 1866 when Johnson vetoed a bill to extend the life of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], charged with aiding the former slaves. By April, Garfield had concluded that Johnson was either "crazy or drunk with opium."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=279}}
[[File:Garfield Monument1.JPG|thumb|A black statue of Garfield atop an elaborate pillar. The United States Capitol rotunda is visible in the background.|[[James A. Garfield Monument|Garfield Monument]], by the Capitol, where he served almost twenty years]]

The conflict between the branches of government was the major issue of the 1866 campaign, with Johnson taking to the campaign trail in a [[Swing Around the Circle]] and Garfield facing opposition within his party in his home district.  With the South still disenfranchised and Northern public opinion behind the Republicans, they gained a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress.  Garfield, having overcome his challengers at his district nominating convention, was easily re-elected.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=170–172}}

Garfield opposed the initial talk of impeaching President Johnson when Congress convened in December 1866.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=278}} However, he supported legislation to limit Johnson's powers, such as the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], which restricted Johnson in removing presidential appointees. Distracted by committee duties, he rarely spoke in connection with these bills, but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson.  Due to a court case, he was absent on the day in April 1868 when the House [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached Johnson]], but soon gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson's removal. When the president was acquitted in trial before the Senate, Garfield was shocked, and blamed the outcome of the trial on its presiding officer, Chief Justice Chase, his onetime mentor.{{sfnm|Caldwell|1965|1pp=173–174|Peskin|1978|2pp=287–289}}

By the time Ulysses S. Grant succeeded Johnson in 1869, Garfield had moved away from the remaining radicals (Stevens, their leader, had died in 1868). He hailed the ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] in 1870 as a triumph, and he favored the re-admission of Georgia to the Union as a matter of right, not politics. In 1871, Garfield opposed passage of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]], saying, "I have never been more perplexed by a piece of legislation." He was torn between his indignation at "these terrorists" and his concern for the freedoms endangered by the power the bill gave to the president to enforce the act through suspension of [[habeas corpus]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=332–334}}

===Tariffs and finance===
[[File:US-$1-LT-1862-Fr-16c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The greenback so despised by Garfield]]
Throughout his political career, Garfield favored the [[gold standard]] and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the [[free silver|free and unlimited coinage of silver]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=205–218}} In 1865, Garfield was placed on the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]], a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues. He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, "Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=261}}  In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=268}}

Tariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of financial affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful [[House Appropriations Committee]], but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=31–32}} Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, [[Horace Greeley]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=265, 327}}

[[File:Black Friday 1869.jpg|thumb|alt=A blackboard with columns of numbers. Across the top is a banner that says "Black Friday" and below is a hand written note|Garfield's handwriting on evidence used during the Gold Panic investigation in 1870]]

In September 1870, Garfield, who was then chairman of the [[House Banking Committee]], led an investigation into the [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]] Gold Panic scandal. The committee investigation into corruption was thorough, but found no indictable offenses. Garfield blamed the easy availability of [[fiat money]] greenbacks for financing the speculation that led to the scandal.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1p=328|Peskin|1978|2p=311}}

Garfield was not at all enthused about the re-election of President Grant in 1872—until Horace Greeley, who emerged as the candidate of the Democrats and [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], became the only serious alternative. Garfield opined, "I would say Grant was not fit to be nominated and Greeley is not fit to be elected."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=350–351}} Both Grant and Garfield won overwhelming re-election victories.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=350–351}}

===Crédit Mobilier scandal; Salary Grab===
The [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal]] involved corruption in the financing of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], part of the [[transcontinental railroad]] that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the [[Crédit Mobilier of America]] company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake the construction of the railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at [[par value]], well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, [[Oakes Ames]] of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=219}}

[[File:Keppler Credit Mobilier Hari-Kari.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Editorial cartoon: [[Uncle Sam]] directs U.S. Senators and Representatives implicated in the Crédit Mobilier scheme to commit [[Hara-Kiri]].]]

The story broke in July 1872, in the middle of the presidential campaign.  Among those named were Vice President (and former House Speaker) [[Schuyler Colfax]], Grant's second-term [[running mate]] (Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Wilson]]), Speaker [[James G. Blaine]] of Maine, and Garfield. Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal. When Congress reconvened after the election, Blaine, seeking to clear his name, demanded a House investigation. Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine. Garfield had stated, in September 1872, that Ames had offered him stock, but he had repeatedly refused it. Testifying before the committee in January, Ames alleged that he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value, but that Garfield had never taken the shares, or paid for them. A year had passed, from 1867 to 1868, before Garfield had finally refused it. Garfield, appearing before the committee on January 14, 1873, confirmed much of this. Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit, and that it was paid for by the company's huge dividends.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|pp=224–226}} The two men differed over a sum of some $300 that Garfield received and later paid back, with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=354–359}}

Garfield's biographers were unwilling to exonerate him in Crédit Mobilier, with Allan Peskin writing, "Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. Did he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement&amp;nbsp;... influenced his behavior."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=362}} Rutkow wrote that "Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock and that he had also received a dividend of $329."{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=34}} Caldwell suggested that Garfield "...while he told the truth [before the committee], certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty."{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=230}} That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=362}}

Another issue that caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 re-election bid was the so-called "[[Salary Grab Act|Salary Grab]]" of 1873, which increased the compensation for members of Congress by 50 percent, retroactive to 1871. Garfield was responsible, as Appropriations Committee chairman, for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House; during the debate in February 1873, Massachusetts Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] offered the increase as an amendment, and despite Garfield's opposition, it passed the House and eventually became law. The law was very popular in the House, as almost half the members were [[lame duck (politics)|lame ducks]], but the public was outraged, and many of Garfield's constituents blamed him, though he refused to accept the increase.  In what was a bad year for Republicans, who lost control of the House for the first time since the Civil War, Garfield had his closest congressional election, winning with only 57 percent of the vote.{{efn|Garfield typically won two or three times his Democratic opponents' votes.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=148, 244, 277, 292}}}}{{sfnm|Caldwell|1965|1pp=233–236|Rutkow|2006|2pp=34–35}}

===Minority leader; Hayes administration===

With the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875, Garfield lost his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee.  The Democratic leadership in the House appointed Garfield as a Republican member of Ways and Means.  With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican [[floor leader]] and the likely Speaker should the party regain control of the chamber.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=37–39}}

As the 1876 presidential election approached, Garfield was loyal to the candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]] in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=398–400}} Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time to the practice of law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with [[whooping cough]] shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=401–405}}

[[File:Electoral Commission (United States).jpg|thumb|left|Garfield (second from right in the row of commissioners just below the gallery) served on the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] that decided the disputed 1876 presidential election. (Painting by [[Cornelia Adele Strong Fassett]])]]
When Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat [[Samuel Tilden]], the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship: South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida. If Hayes won all three states, he would take the election by a single electoral vote. Grant asked Garfield to serve as a "neutral observer" in the recount in Louisiana. The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner—Garfield recommended that the entire vote of [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|West Feliciana Parish]], which had given Tilden a sizable majority, be thrown out. The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states, to the outrage of Democrats, who had the state legislatures submit rival returns, and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote—under the Constitution, Congress is the final arbiter of the election. Congress then passed a bill establishing the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]], to determine the winner. Although he opposed the Commission, feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious, Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of Democrats that he was too partisan. Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7, with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court.  As part of the deal whereby they recognized Hayes as president, Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction.{{sfnm|Caldwell|1965|1pp=251–261|Rutkow|2006|2p=40}}

Although a Senate seat would be disposed of by the [[Ohio General Assembly]] after the resignation of [[John Sherman (Ohio)|John Sherman]] to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise to protect him from the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=41}} When Congress debated what became the [[Bland-Allison Act]], to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender [[Morgan dollar|dollar coins]], Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=261}}

Garfield during this time purchased the property in [[Mentor, Ohio|Mentor]] that reporters later dubbed [[James A. Garfield National Historic Site|Lawnfield]],{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=498}} and from which he would conduct the first successful [[front porch campaign]] for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, [[Allen G. Thurman]]. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield was elected to the Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=442–447}}

===Legal career and other activities===
Garfield was one of three attorneys who argued for the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court case ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' in 1866. His clients were pro-Confederate northern men who had been found guilty and sentenced to death by a military court for treasonous activities. The case turned on whether the defendants should instead have been tried by a civilian court, and resulted in a ruling that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals while the civil courts were operating.  The oral argument was  Garfield's first court appearance. [[Jeremiah Black]] had taken him in as a junior partner a year before, and assigned the case to him in light of his highly regarded oratory skills. With the result, Garfield instantly achieved a reputation as a preeminent appellate lawyer.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=270}}

During Grant's first term, discontented with public service, Garfield pursued opportunities in the law, but declined a partnership offer when told his prospective partner was of "intemperate and licentious" reputation.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=347}} In 1873, after the death of Chase, Garfield appealed to Grant to appoint Justice [[Noah H. Swayne]] as Chief Justice. Grant, however, appointed [[Morrison R. Waite]].{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=387–389, 392}}

Garfield thought the [[Public Land Survey System#Railroad land grants|land grants]] given to expanding railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, as well as the power sought by workers' unions.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=331}} Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the [[United States civil service]] as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to [[Kickback (bribery)|kick back]] a percentage of their wages as political contributions.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=335–338}}

In 1876, Garfield displayed his mathematical talent when he developed a trapezoid proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  His finding was placed in the ''New England Journal of Education''.  Mathematics historian [[William Dunham (mathematician)|William Dunham]] wrote that Garfield's trapezoid work was "really a very clever proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunham |first1=William |authorlink1=William Dunham (mathematician)|title=The Mathematical Universe: An Alphabetical Journey Through the Great Proofs, Problems, and Personalities |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons |page=99 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential election of 1880==

===Republican nomination===

Lee]]'s surrender to him at Appomattox by depicting Grant giving up his sword to Garfield.]]

Having just been elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 campaign season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=454–455}} Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including [[Wharton Barker]] of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=454–455}} Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=456–457}} Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former President Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=17–19}}

As the convention began, Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] of New York, the floor leader for the Grant forces (known as the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=81–83}} When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from the convention. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense of their right to reserve judgment.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=81–83}} The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=81–83}} The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=464–465}}

After speeches in favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little excitement for the idea of Sherman as the next president.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=466–469}} The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=96–101}} [[Jeremiah McLain Rusk]], a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and [[Benjamin Harrison]], an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a [[dark horse]] candidate—Garfield.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=472–475}} Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=475–477}} In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=110–114}} To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former [[Collector of the Port of New York|New York customs collector]] [[Chester A. Arthur]], a member of Conkling's [[political machine]], was chosen as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=480–481}}

===Campaign against Hancock===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1880}}
[[File:1880RepublicanPoster.png|thumb|Garfield–Arthur election poster]]

Despite including a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=488–491}} After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=498–500}} Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] of Pennsylvania, a career military officer.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=488–491}} Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the [[Solid South]], while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=501–502}}

[[File:Garf 07-04-2008 02;10;53PM.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large three-story house of wood and stone|The rear of the house at Garfield's Lawnfield estate, from which he conducted his "[[front porch campaign]]"]]
[[File:ElectoralCollege1880.svg|right|thumb|1880 electoral vote results]]

Practical differences between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of [[waving the bloody shirt]]: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if Democrats held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=175–180}} With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=493–494}} With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the [[tariff]]. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=232–233}} Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, "The tariff question is a local question."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=493–494}} The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=511–513}} In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1880 |title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996 |publisher=U.S. National Archives |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=510–511}}

===Cabinet and inauguration===

Between his election and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=519–521}} Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=554–555}} Garfield nominated [[William Windom]] of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, [[William H. Hunt]] of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] as Secretary of War, and [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]] of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by [[Thomas Lemuel James]] as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's [[Wayne MacVeagh]], an adversary of Blaine's, as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]].{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=33–36}} Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, [[William E. Chandler]], as [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=555–561}}

Distracted by cabinet maneuvering, Garfield's inaugural address was not up to his typical oratorical standards.{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=330}} In one high point, Garfield emphasized the civil rights of [[African-Americans]], saying "Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=538–540}} After discussing the gold standard, the need for education, and an unexpected denunciation of [[Mormon polygamy]], the speech ended. The crowd applauded, but the speech, according to Peskin, "however sincerely intended, betrayed its hasty composition by the flatness of its tone and the conventionality of its subject matter."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=539}}

Garfield's appointment of James infuriated Conkling, a factional opponent of the Postmaster General, who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction, such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury. The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield's brief presidency. The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president, at Blaine's instigation, nominated Conkling's enemy, Judge [[William H. Robertson]], to be Collector of the Port of New York. This was one of the prize patronage positions below cabinet level, and was then held by [[Edwin Atkins Merritt|Edwin A. Merritt]]. Conkling raised the time-honored principle of [[senatorial courtesy]] in an attempt to defeat the nomination, to no avail. Garfield, who believed the practice was corrupt, would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed, intending to "settle the question whether the president is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States."{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|p=38}} Ultimately, Conkling and his New York colleague, Senator [[Thomas C. Platt]], resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication, but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places. Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield's victory was clear. To Blaine's chagrin, the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions, and nominated a number of Conkling's Stalwart friends to offices.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=572}}

===Reforms===
[[File:Left Puck.jpg|thumb|alt=A cartoon. Garfield, in night clothes and slippers, is on the doorstep looking at an ugly crying baby in a basket on the ground. |An 1881 ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' cartoon shows Garfield finding a baby at his front door with a tag marked "Civil Service Reform, compliments of [[Rutherford B. Hayes|R.B. Hayes]]." Hayes, his predecessor in the presidency, is seen in the background dressed like a woman and holding a bag marked "R.B. Hayes' Savings, [[Fremont, Ohio]]."]]
Grant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, believing that the [[spoils system]] damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=39–41}} Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=39–41}}

Corruption in the post office also cried out for reform. In April 1880, there had been a congressional investigation into corruption in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]], in which profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars, securing bogus mail contracts on [[star routes]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=578}} After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid, costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among ring members. That year, Hayes stopped the implementation of any new star route contracts. Shortly after taking office, Garfield received information from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader, Second Assistant Postmaster-General [[Thomas J. Brady]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=580}} Garfield demanded Brady's resignation and ordered prosecutions that would end in trials for conspiracy. When told that his party, including his own campaign manager, [[Stephen W. Dorsey]], was involved, Garfield directed MacVeagh and James to root out the corruption in the Post Office Department "to the bone", regardless of where it might lead.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=578}} Brady resigned and was eventually indicted for conspiracy. After two "star route" ring trials in 1882 and 1883, the jury found Brady not guilty.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=94–95}}

===Civil rights and education===

[[File:Jgarfield.jpeg|thumb|alt=Formal seated portrait in oils|Official White House portrait of James Garfield]]
Garfield believed that the key to improving the state of African American civil rights would be found in education aided by the federal government.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|p=48}} During Reconstruction, [[freedman|freedmen]] had gained citizenship and suffrage that enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and was concerned that blacks would become America's permanent "[[peasantry]]."{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=48–49}} He answered by proposing a "universal" education system funded by the federal government. Congress and the northern white public, however, had lost interest in African-American rights, and federal funding for universal education did not find support in Congress during Garfield's term.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=48–49}} Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: [[Frederick Douglass]], recorder of deeds in Washington; [[Robert B. Elliott|Robert Elliot]], special agent to the Treasury; [[John M. Langston]], [[Haiti]]an minister;  and [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], register to the Treasury. Garfield believed that Southern support for the Republican party could be gained by "commercial and industrial" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=49–50}} He appointed [[William H. Hunt]], a [[carpetbagger]] Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=49–50}} To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator [[William Mahone]] of the biracial independent [[Readjuster Party]], hoping to add the independents' strength to the Republicans' there.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=50–53}}

===Foreign policy and naval reform===
[[Image:James G. Blaine - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb |upright|left|[[James G. Blaine]], Garfield's Secretary of State]]
Entering the presidency, Garfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. Blaine, a former [[Protectionism|protectionist]], now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the [[Western Hemisphere]].{{sfn|Crapol|2000|pp=62–64}} Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with [[Latin America]] would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region.{{sfn|Crapol|2000|pp=62–64}} Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity.{{sfn|Crapol|2000|pp=62–64}} Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade.{{sfnm|Crapol|2000|1pp=65–66|Doenecke|1981|2pp=55–57}} At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the [[War of the Pacific]] then being fought by [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]].{{sfnm|Crapol|2000|1pp=65–66|Doenecke|1981|2pp=55–57}} Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, [[Lima]], rejected any settlement that restored the previous ''status quo''.{{sfnm|Crapol|2000|1p=70|Doenecke|1981|2pp=57–58}} Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the [[Clayton-Bulwer Treaty]] to allow the United States to construct [[Panama Canal|a canal through Panama]] without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].{{sfnm|Crapol|2000|1pp=74–80|Peskin|1978|2pp=576–577}} Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with [[Joseon Dynasty|Korea]] and [[Merina Kingdom|Madagascar]].{{sfnm|Crapol|2000|1p=81|Doenecke|1981|2pp=71–73}} Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=145–147}} In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=130–131}}{{efn|In October 1883, the War of the Pacific was settled without American involvement, with the [[Treaty of Ancón]].}} Naval reform continued under Arthur, if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the [[Squadron of Evolution]].{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=148–149}}

==Assassination==
{{Main|Assassination of James A. Garfield}}

===Guiteau and shooting===
Garfield was shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disgruntled office seeker, at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. After eleven weeks of intensive and other care Garfield died in [[Elberon, New Jersey]], the second of four presidents to be assassinated, following Abraham Lincoln. 

Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=114}}  He composed a speech, "Garfield vs. Hancock", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee. One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=151–152}} On one occasion, according to Kenneth D. Ackerman in his book about Garfield's candidacy and assassination, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves. Guiteau, who considered himself a [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]], deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact he spoke no French, nor any foreign language.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=189–190, 237}}  Guiteau has since been described by one medical expert as possibly being a narcissistic schizophrenic;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/this-is-the-brain-that-shot-president-james-garfield/454212/|title=This Is the Brain that Shot President James Garfield|first=Brian|last=Resick|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; author Kent Kiehl assessed him as being a clinical psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiehl|first1=Kent|title=The Psychopath Whisperer: The Science of Those Without Conscience|date=2015|publisher=Crown Publishers|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oemMDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780770435868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garfield assassination engraving cropped.jpg|thumb|Garfield, shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]], collapses as Secretary of State Blaine gestures for help. Engraving from ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]''.]]

One of President Garfield's more wearying duties was seeing office seekers, and he saw Guiteau at least once. White House officials suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=237–238}} Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=278–279}} Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=299}}

Guiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart. The office-seeker decided that the only way to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=305–308}}

The [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why the president should be guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=313–316}} His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=328–330}}

Guiteau concealed himself by the ladies' waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]], from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=596}} As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=335–340}}

===Treatment and death===
Garfield was hit by two shots; one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen. "My God, what is this?" he exclaimed.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=333–334}} Guiteau, as he was led away, stated, "I did it. I will go to jail for it. I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President."{{efn|The words vary in some sources}}{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=335}}

Among those at the station was [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], whose [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|father was killed]] sixteen years earlier by an assassin. Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him, probing the wound with unwashed fingers.  At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=335–336}} Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=88–89}}

[[File:B&amp;PStation1908.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An ornate Victorian Gothic style building with a square tower|[[Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad]] Passenger Terminal in Washington, where Garfield was shot July 2, 1881]]

Although [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]]'s pioneering work in antisepsis was known to American doctors, with Lister himself having visited America in 1876, few of them had confidence in it, and none of his advocates were among Garfield's treating physicians.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|pp=106–107}} The physician who took charge at the depot and then at the White House was [[Doctor Willard Bliss]].{{efn|"Doctor" was his given name.}} A noted physician and surgeon, Bliss was an old friend of Garfield, and about a dozen doctors, led by Bliss, were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments.  Garfield was given morphine for the pain, and asked Bliss to frankly tell him his chances, which Bliss put at one in a hundred. "Well, Doctor, we'll take that chance."{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=346}}

Over the next few days, Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, he was able to sit up and write several times, and his recovery was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence.  He was nourished on oatmeal [[porridge]] (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief [[Sitting Bull]], a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, "Let him starve," then, "Oh, no, send him my oatmeal."{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=601–602}} X-radiation (or [[X-ray]]) usage, which likely would have helped the president's physicians determine exactly where the bullet was lodged in his body, would not be invented for another fourteen years.  [[Alexander Graham Bell]] tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector; he was not successful. One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington's summer heat was one of the first successful [[air conditioning]] units: air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=601–602}}

Beginning on July 23, Garfield took a turn for the worse. His temperature increased to {{convert|104|F}}; doctors, concerned by an [[abscess]] that had developed by the wound, operated and inserted a drainage tube. This initially seemed to help, and Garfield, in his bed, was able to hold a brief cabinet meeting on July 29, though members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=603}} Doctors probed the abscess, which went into Garfield's body, hoping to find the bullet; they most likely only made the infections worse. Garfield performed only one state act in August, signing an extradition paper. By the end of the month, the president was much more feeble than he had been, and his weight had decreased to {{convert|130|lb}}.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=374–375}}

Garfield had long been anxious to escape hot, unhealthy Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to [[Elberon, New Jersey|Elberon]], part of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]], where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House for the last time on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, [[Joe Stanley Brown]], wrote 40 years later, "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy."{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=374–376}}

On September 18, Garfield asked A.&amp;nbsp;F. Rockwell, a friend, if he would have a place in history. Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him. But his response was, "No, my work is done."{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=355}} The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well, and went to sleep without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15 p.m. with great pain in his chest. The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious. Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and died at 10:35 p.m. that evening.{{sfnm|Ackerman|2003|1pp=376–377|Rutkow|2006|2p=127}} Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death, [[Chester A. Arthur|Arthur]] took the presidential oath of  office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice [[John R. Brady]]. {{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=608}}

According to some historians and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors attending him had at their disposal today's medical research, knowledge, techniques, and equipment.{{sfn|Schaffer|2006}} Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating the path of the bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their [[Asepsis|unsterilized]] fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s.{{sfn|Schaffer|2006}} Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's demise.{{sfn|Schaffer|2006}} Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=607}} Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]], has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests that "Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days."{{sfn|Schaffer|2006}}

Guiteau was indicted on October 14, 1881, for the murder of the president. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often interrupted and argued, and in which his counsel used the [[insanity defense]], the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had [[neurosyphilis]], a disease that causes physiological mental impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Funeral, memorials and commemorations==
Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=608–609}} More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body [[lying in state|lay in state]] at the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to the entire population of that city—likewise paid their respects.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=608–609}} His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's [[Lake View Cemetery]] until his permanent memorial was built.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=608–609}}

Memorials to Garfield were erected across the country.

On May 19, 1890, Garfield's body was permanently interred, with great solemnity and fanfare, in a [[mausoleum]] in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. Attending the dedication ceremonies were former President Hayes, President Benjamin Harrison, and future president [[William McKinley]].{{sfn|Memorial 1890|pp=46–49}} Garfield's Treasury Secretary, William Windom, also attended.{{sfn|Memorial 1890|pp=46–49}} Harrison said that Garfield was always a "student and instructor" and that his life works and death would "...continue to be instructive and inspiring incidents in American history."{{sfn|Memorial 1890|p=51}} Three panels on the monument display Garfield as a teacher, Union major general, and [[orator]]; another shows him taking the presidential oath, and a fifth shows his body lying in state at the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Memorial 1890|pp=34–35}}

Garfield's murder by a deranged office-seeker awakened public awareness of the need for civil service reform legislation. Senator [[George H. Pendleton]], a Democrat from Ohio, launched a reform effort that resulted in the [[Pendleton Act]] in January 1883.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=100–102}} This act reversed the "spoils system" where office seekers paid up or gave political service to obtain or keep federally appointed positions.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=100–102}} Under the act, appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=102–103}} To ensure the reform was implemented, Congress and Arthur established and funded the [[Civil Service Commission]]. The Pendleton Act, however, covered only 10% of federal government workers.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=102–103}} For Arthur, previously known for having been a "veteran spoilsman," civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=610}}

A [[James A. Garfield (Niehaus)|marble statue of Garfield]] by [[Charles Niehaus]] was added to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington D.C.]], a gift from the State of [[Ohio]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt; Architect of the Capitol Under the Direction of the Joint Committee on the Library,  Compilation of Works of Art and Other Objects in the United States Capitol,  United States Government Printing Office, Washington  1965 p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and historical view==
For a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States. Peskin noted that, "In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations."{{sfn|Peskin|2000}} As the rivalry between Stalwarts and [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breeds]] faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. Beginning in 1882, the year after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late president. Despite his short term as president, nine different issues were printed over the years.{{sfn|Smithsonian 2006}} In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes. Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=136}}

The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield. [[Thomas Wolfe]] deemed the presidents of the [[Gilded Age]], including Garfield, "lost Americans" whose "gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed, melted, swam together."{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=399}} The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye, their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time: the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]], the inventors, those who had sought social reform, and others who had lived as America rapidly changed. Current events and more recent figures occupied America's attention: according to Ackerman, "the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield's era seem remote and irrelevant, its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity."{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=399}}

Garfield's biographers, and those who have studied his presidency, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian [[Justus D. Doenecke]], while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched."{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|p=182}} Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation.{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|p=183}} According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more."{{sfn|Caldwell|1965|p=363}} Rutkow writes, "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.{{Single double}}{{sfn|Rutkow|2006|p=136}}

Peskin believes Garfield deserves more credit for his political career than he has received:

{{quote|
True, his accomplishments were neither bold nor heroic, but his was not an age that called for heroism.  His stormy presidency was brief, and in some respects, unfortunate, but he did leave the office stronger than he found it. As a public man he had a hand in almost every issue of national importance for almost two decades, while as a party leader he, along with Blaine, forged the Republican Party into the instrument that would lead the United States into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=611}}

[[File:Pinus pinea foliage.jpg|thumb|Juvenile (left) and adult (right) leaves of [[Stone Pine]]]]

A '''juvenile''' is an individual [[organism]] that has not yet reached its [[adult]] form, [[sexual maturity]] or size. Juveniles sometimes look very different from the adult form, particularly in colour. In many organisms the juvenile has a different name from the adult (see also [[List of animal names]]).

Some organisms reach sexual maturity in a short [[metamorphosis]], such as [[eclosion]] in many [[insect]]s. For others, the transition from juvenile to fully mature is a more prolonged process—[[puberty]] for example. In such cases, juveniles during this transformation are sometimes called '''subadults'''.

Many [[invertebrate]]s, on reaching the adult stage, are fully mature and their development and growth stops. Their juveniles are [[larva]]e or [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].

In [[vertebrate]]s and some invertebrates (e.g. [[spider]]s), larval forms (e.g. [[tadpole]]s) are usually considered a development stage of their own, and "juvenile" refers to a post-larval stage that is not fully grown and not sexually mature. In [[amniote]]s and most [[plant]]s, the [[embryo]] represents the larval stage. Here, a "juvenile" is an individual in the time between hatching/birth/germination and reaching maturity.

The '''''Kashmir Princess''''' was a chartered [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation|Lockheed L-749A Constellation]] aircraft owned by [[Air India]].  On 11 April 1955, it was damaged in midair by a bomb explosion and crashed into the [[South China Sea]] while en route from [[Bombay]], India, and Hong Kong to [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web

==Explosion==
The aircraft departed Hong Kong at 0425 [[GMT]] carrying Chinese and Eastern European delegates, mainly journalists, to the Asia-Afro [[Bandung Conference]] in Jakarta.&lt;ref name="CD"/&gt; At approximately 0925 GMT the crew heard an explosion; smoke quickly entered the cabin from a fire on the right wing directly behind the No. 3 (or right inboard) engine. Upon hearing the explosion and seeing the fire-warning light for the baggage compartment come on, the captain shut off the No. 3 engine and feathered its propeller, fearing the engine would catch fire. This left three engines running. The crew sent out three distress signals giving their position over the [[Natuna Islands]] before the radio went dead.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;

The captain tried to land the plane on the sea, but the [[depressurisation|depressurising]] cabin and the failing circuits made that impossible. Additionally, smoke was seeping into the cockpit. Left with no other option, the crew issued [[life jacket]]s and opened the emergency doors to ensure a quick escape as the plane plunged into the sea below.

==Crash==
The starboard wing struck water first, tearing the plane into three parts. The aircraft maintenance engineer (ground engineer), navigator and first officer escaped and were later found by the [[Indonesian Coast Guard]]. The remaining 16 passengers and crew members, however, drowned at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendis |first=Sean |url=http://www.airwhiners.net/whine_cheez/20040726.htm |title=Air India : The story of the aircraft |work=Airwhiners.net  |date=26 July 2004 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators believed that the explosion had been caused by a [[Time bomb (explosive)|time bomb]] placed aboard the aircraft by a [[Kuomintang]] [[secret service|secret agent]] who was attempting to assassinate [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]], who had been scheduled to board the plane to attend the conference but had changed his travel plans at the last minute.&lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

== Passengers ==
Passengers of the chartered flight included three staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Bandung Conference and one staff member of the delegation of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. The rest of the passengers were journalists – five from China, one from the US, and one from Japan. Raymond Wong, the Hong Kong branch director of [[Xinhua News Agency]], was also on the aircraft.

=== Zhou Enlai ===
The target of the assassination attempt, Zhou Enlai, had planned to fly from Beijing to Hong Kong and then on to Jakarta on ''Kashmir Princess''. An emergency [[appendectomy]] delayed his arrival in Hong Kong;&lt;ref name="Itoh2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mayumi Itoh|title=''The Making of China’s Peace with Japan: What Xi Jinping Should Learn from Zhou Enlai''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weAqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=13 July 2017| publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-4008-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left China three days after the crash and flew to [[Rangoon]] to meet with [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] before continuing on to Bandung to attend the conference.&lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

Some historians have argued that Zhou may have known about the assassination plot beforehand and that the premier did not undergo an appendectomy at the time. [[Steve Tsang]] of [[Oxford University]] wrote in the September 1994 edition of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', "Evidence now suggests that Zhou knew of the plot beforehand and secretly changed his travel plans, though he did not stop a decoy delegation of lesser cadres from taking his place."&lt;ref&gt;"Target Zhou Enlai: The `Kashmir Princess' Incident of 1955," ''[[The China Quarterly]]''. Number 139, September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
The day after the crash, China's [[Foreign Ministry]] issued a statement that described the bombing as "a murder by the special service organizations of the United States and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]"&lt;ref&gt;Steve Tsang, The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK (New York: IB Tauris, 2006), 181.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Hong Kong Governor]] Sir [[Alexander Grantham]] maintained that the plane was not tampered with in Hong Kong. However, on 26 May, an Indonesian board of inquiry later announced that a time bomb with an American-made MK-7 detonator was responsible for the crash and it was highly probable that the bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}

The Hong Kong authorities offered [[HK$]]100,000 for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. They questioned 71 people connected with the servicing of the Air India flight. When police began to focus on Chow Tse-ming, a janitor for Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co., he stowed away to Taiwan on a [[CIA]]-owned [[Civil Air Transport]] aircraft. The Hong Kong police reported that a warrant charging a murder conspiracy was issued, but the man with the name Chow Tse-ming in the warrant had flown to Taiwan on 18 May 1955, and Chow Tse-ming had three aliases.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Seek Chinese in Crash Case" from Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 3 September 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong police concluded that the [[Kuomintang]] had recruited Chow to plant the bomb to kill Zhou Enlai. Apparently, he had bragged to friends about his role in the bombing, and had also spent large amounts of money before he left Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Police tried to [[extradite]] Chow, but Taiwan refused and denied that Chow was a [[Kuomintang|KMT]] agent.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}

Steve Tsang collected evidence from British, Taiwanese, American and Hong Kong archives that points directly to KMT agents operating in Hong Kong as the perpetrators of the aircraft bombing. According to him, the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] had a special-operations group stationed in Hong Kong responsible for assassination and sabotage. Designated the Hong Kong Group under [[Major-General]] [[Kong Hoi-ping]], it operated a network of 90 agents. In March 1955, the group recruited Chow for the assassination because his job at the airport gave him easy access to the Air India plane, and offered him HK$600,000 and refuge in Taiwan, if necessary.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}

A Chinese{{Specify|date=January 2012}} document declassified in 2005 also indicates that the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] secret service was responsible for the bombing.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}

China had from the outset accused the United States of involvement in the bombing, but while the CIA had considered a plan to assassinate Zhou Enlai at this time,&lt;ref&gt;Minnick, Wendell L. "Target: Zhou Enlai", Far Eastern Economic Review, 1995-07-13, pages 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church Committee]] reported that these plans were disapproved of and "strongly censured" by Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1978), 517.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1971 face-to-face meeting in the [[Great Hall of the People]] in Beijing, Zhou directly asked [[Henry Kissinger]] about US involvement in the bombing. Kissinger responded, "As I told the Prime Minister the last time, he vastly overestimates the competence of the CIA."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Commemorations ==
The captain of the plane, [[D.K. Jatar]] who perished in the crash, later along with co-pilot [[M.C Dixit]], ground maintenance engineer [[Anant Karnik]] and navigator [[J.C. Pathak]] became the first civilians to be awarded the [[Ashoka Chakra Award]] for "most conspicuous bravery, daring and self-sacrifice".

In 2005, the [[Xinhua News Agency]] hosted a [[symposium]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the crash; three Xinhua journalists had been among the victims.&lt;ref name="XN"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Yupeilun.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yu Peilun]] (1887 - 1911) who was martyred leading a suicide squad against Qing forces in the Xinhai Revolution.]]

Revolutionaries of the [[Tongmenghui]] who died in attempts to overthrow the [[Qing dynasty]] were recognized as martyr's by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] after the [[Xinhai Revolution]].

During the [[Xinhai Revolution]] itself, many Chinese revolutionaries became martyrs in battle. "[[Dare to Die Corps (Chinese)|Dare to Die]]" student corps were founded, for student revolutionaries wanting to fight against Qing dynasty rule. Dr. [[Sun Yatsen]] and [[Huang Xing]] promoted the Dare to Die corps. Huang said, "We must die, so let us die bravely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51Fpis0D1v0C&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=dare+to+die+china&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GeSrTOz6DYL48Aak3ZSzCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dare%20to%20die%20china&amp;f=false|title=Sun Yat Sen and the Chinese Republic|author=Aul Linebarger|year=2008|publisher=READ BOOKS|location=|page=263|isbn=1-4437-2438-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the revolution, suicide squads were formed by Chinese students going into battle, knowing that they would be killed fighting against overwhelming odds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_UnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=This+is+a+suicide+squad%3B+don't+come+with+us,+please.%22&amp;dq=This+is+a+suicide+squad%3B+don't+come+with+us,+please.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_OOrTLfaGcL58AaBqIT0Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=China yearbook|year=1975|publisher=China Pub.

The Kuomintang continued to promote the concept of martyrdom, the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang and the revolution and the party founder Dr. Sun Yatsen were sent to heaven according to the Kuomintang party.

===Revolutionary martyrs in art===
Two of the earliest revolutionary martyrs in Chinese culture were [[Liu Hulan]], a 14-year-old school girl, and [[Jiang Zhuyun]]. Both were immortalized in operas - [[Liu Hulan (opera)]] and [[Sister Jiang]] respectively.

== Islam ==
{{main article|Shahid}}
Islam has its own concept of martyrdom, which the [[Kuomintang]] promoted among [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] through the [[Chinese Muslim Association]]. The Muslim General [[Ma Fuxiang]] stated on how Chinese Muslims were willing to die to accomplish tasks assigned to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQa22PJutwC&amp;dq=arab+mercenaries+china&amp;q=They+have+not+enjoyed+the+educational+and+political+privileges+of+the+Han+chinese%2C+and+they+are+in+many+respects+primitive#v=snippet&amp;q=They%20have%20not%20enjoyed%20the%20educational%20and%20political%20privileges%20of%20the%20Han%20chinese%2C%20and%20they%20are%20in%20many%20respects%20primitive&amp;f=false|title=In the Land of the Laughing Buddha – The Adventures of an American Barbarian in China|author=Upton Close|year=2007|publisher=READ BOOKS|location=|page=271|isbn=1-4067-1675-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imam]]s sponsored by the Kuomintang called for Muslims to go on [[Jihad]] to become [[Shahid|shaheed]] (Muslim term for martyr) in battle, where Muslims believe they will go automatically to heaven.

They are integral membrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices, the last of which contains the attachment point for [[retinal]] (a conserved lysine).

This protein family includes light-driven [[proton pumps]], [[ion pumps]] and [[ion channels]], as well as light sensors. For example, the proteins from [[halobacteria]] include [[bacteriorhodopsin]] and [[archaerhodopsin]], which are light-driven [[proton pump]]s; [[halorhodopsin]], a light-driven chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both [[Phototropism|photoattractant]] (in the red) and [[photophobic]] (in the ultra-violet) responses. Proteins from other bacteria include [[proteorhodopsin]].

Contrary to their name, microbial rhodopsins are found not only in [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], but also in [[Eukaryota]] (such as [[algae]]) and [[viruses]]; although they are rare in complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref name="BoeufAudic2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boeuf|first1=Dominique|last2=Audic|first2=Stéphane|last3=Brillet-Guéguen|first3=Loraine|last4=Caron|first4=Christophe|last5=Jeanthon|first5=Christian|title=MicRhoDE: a curated database for the analysis of microbial rhodopsin diversity and evolution|journal=Database|volume=2015|year=2015|pages=bav080|url=http://database.oxfordjournals.org/content/2015/bav080.full|issn=1758-0463|doi=10.1093/database/bav080|pmid=26286928|pmc=4539915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YawoKandori2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yawo|first1=Hiromu|last2=Kandori|first2=Hideki|last3=Koizumi|first3=Amane|title=Optogenetics: Light-Sensing Proteins and Their Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M3WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=30 September 2015|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-55516-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
'''Rhodopsin''' was originally a synonym for "[[Rhodopsin|visual purple]]", a visual [[Biological pigment|pigment]] (light-sensitive molecule) found in the [[retina]]s of frogs and other [[vertebrate]]s, used for [[Scotopic vision|dim-light vision]], and usually found in [[rod cells]]. This is still the meaning of rhodopsin in the narrow sense, any protein evolutionarily [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to this protein. In a broad non-genetic sense, rhodopsin refers to any molecule, whether related by genetic descent or not (mostly not), consisting of an opsin and a chromophore (generally a variant of retinal). All animal rhodopsins arose (by gene duplication and divergence) late in the history of the large GPCR [G-Protein Coupled Receptor] gene family, which itself arose after the divergence of plants, fungi, choanflagellates and sponges from the earliest animals. The retinal chromophore is found solely in the opsin branch of this large gene family, meaning its occurrence elsewhere represents convergent evolution, not homology.

The term '''bacterial rhodopsin''' originally referred to the first microbial rhodopsin discovered, known today as [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. The first bacteriorhodopsin turned out to be of archaeal origin, from ''[[Halobacterium salinarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grote|first=Mathias|last2=O'Malley|first2=Maureen A.|date=2011-11-01|title=Enlightening the life sciences: the history of halobacterial and microbial rhodopsin research|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1082–1099|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00281.x|issn=1574-6976|pmid=21623844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other microbial rhodopsins have been discovered, rendering the term ''bacterial rhodopsin'' ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=19 December 2012 |title =rhodopsin, n. |encyclopedia=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |id=|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Peggy|title=Medical Neurobiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcRqgPnstUUC&amp;pg=PA375|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=26 May 2011|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-533997-0|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ion-Translocating Microbial Rhodopsin Family==
The '''Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1 TC# 3.E.1]) is a member of the [[TOG Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the MR family [[Catalysis|catalyze]] light-driven ion translocation across microbial cytoplasmic membranes or serve as light receptors. Most proteins of the MR family are all of about the same size (250-350 amino acyl residues) and possess seven [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] helical spanners with their [[N-terminus|N-termini]] on the outside and their [[C-terminus|C-termini]] on the inside. There are 9 subfamilies in the MR family:&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1#ref9955|title = 3.E.1 The Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The association of sensory rhodopsins with their transducer proteins appears to determine whether they function as transporters or receptors. Association of a sensory rhodopsin receptor with its transducer occurs via the transmembrane helical domains of the two interacting proteins. There are two sensory rhodopsins in any one halophilic archaeon, one (SRI) that responds positively to orange light but negatively to blue light, the other (SRII) that responds only negatively to blue light. Each transducer is specific for its cognate receptor. An x-ray structure of SRII complexed with its transducer (HtrII) at 1.94 Å resolution is available ({{PDB2|1H2S}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular basis of transmembrane signalling by sensory rhodopsin II-transducer complex|journal = Nature|date = 2002-10-03|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 12368857|pages = 484–487|volume = 419|issue = 6906|doi = 10.1038/nature01109|first = Valentin I.|last = Gordeliy|first2 = Jörg|last2 = Labahn|first3 = Rouslan|last3 = Moukhametzianov|first4 = Rouslan|last4 = Efremov|first5 = Joachim|last5 = Granzin|first6 = Ramona|last6 = Schlesinger|first7 = Georg|last7 = Büldt|first8 = Tudor|last8 = Savopol|first9 = Axel J.|last9 = Scheidig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular and evolutionary aspects of the light-signal transduction by microbial sensory receptors have been reviewed.&lt;ref name="Inoue 562–577"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular and evolutionary aspects of microbial sensory rhodopsins|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmid = 23732219|pages = 562–577|volume = 1837|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.05.005|first = Keiichi|last = Inoue|first2 = Takashi|last2 = Tsukamoto|first3 = Yuki|last3 = Sudo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the MR family homologues in yeast and fungi are of about the same size and topology as the archaeal proteins (283-344 amino acyl residues; 7 putative transmembrane α-helical segments), but they are heat shock- and toxic solvent-induced proteins of unknown biochemical function.

===Bacteriorhodopsins and Halorhodopsins===

Bacterio- and halorhodopsins pump 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per photon absorbed, respectively. Specific transport mechanisms and pathways have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Kolbe 1390–1396"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanism of proton transport in bacteriorhodopsin from crystallographic structures of the K, L, M1, M2, and M2' intermediates of the photocycle|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-04-25|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12691752|pages = 439–450|volume = 328|issue = 2|first = Janos K.|last = Lanyi|first2 = Brigitte|last2 = Schobert|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00263-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crystallographic structures of the M and N intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin: assembly of a hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules between Asp-96 and the retinal Schiff base|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-07-11|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12842471|pages = 553–570|volume = 330|issue = 3|first = Brigitte|last = Schobert|first2 = Leonid S.|last2 = Brown|first3 = Janos K.|last3 = Lanyi|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00576-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism involves:

(1) photo-isomerization of the retinal and its initial configurational changes,

(2) deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and the coupled release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface,

(3) the switch event that allows reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side.

Six structural models describe the transformations of the retinal and its interaction with water 402, Asp85, and Asp212 in atomic detail, as well as the displacements of functional residues farther from the [[Schiff base]]. The changes provide rationales for how relaxation of the distorted retinal causes movements of water and protein atoms that result in vectorial proton transfers to and from the Schiff base.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin|journal = Nature|date = 2000-08-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 10949307|pages = 645–648|volume = 406|issue = 6796|doi = 10.1038/35020599|first = A.|last = Royant|first2 = K.|last2 = Edman|first3 = T.|last3 = Ursby|first4 = E.|last4 = Pebay-Peyroula|first5 = E. M.|last5 = Landau|first6 = R.|last6 = Neutze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most residues participating in the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure in the absence of bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between archaerhodopsin-2 and bacteriorhodopsin. Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle, it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural role of bacterioruberin in the trimeric structure of archaerhodopsin-2|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 1089-8638|pmid = 18082767|pages = 1267–1281|volume = 375|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.039|first = Keiko|last = Yoshimura|first2 = Tsutomu|last2 = Kouyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine Bacterial Rhodopsin===

A marine bacterial rhodopsin has been reported to function as a proton pump. However, it also resembles sensory rhodopsin II of archaea as well as an Orf from the fungus ''Leptosphaeria maculans'' (AF290180). These proteins exhibit 20-30% identity with each other.

===Channelrhodopsins===

[[Channelrhodopsin]]-1 (ChR1) or channelopsin-1 (Chop1; Cop3; CSOA) of ''C. reinhardtii'' is closely related to the archaeal sensory rhodopsins. It has 712 aas with a signal peptide, followed by a short amphipathic region, and then a hydrophobic N-terminal domain with seven probable TMSs (residues 76-309) followed by a long hydrophilic C-terminal domain of about 400 residues. Part of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain is homologous to intersectin (EH and SH3 domain protein 1A) of animals (AAD30271).

Chop1 serves as a light-gated proton channel and mediates phototaxis and photophobic responses in green algae.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Based on this phenotype, Chop1 could be assigned to [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A TC category #1.A], but because it belongs to a family in which well-characterized homologues catalyze active ion transport, it is assigned to the MR family. Expression of the ''chop1'' gene, or a truncated form of that gene encoding only the hydrophobic core (residues 1-346 or 1-517) in frog oocytes in the presence of all-trans retinal produces a light-gated conductance that shows characteristics of a channel passively but selectively permeable to protons. This channel activity probably generates bioelectric currents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A homologue of ChR1 in ''C. reinhardtii'' is channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2; Chop2; Cop4; CSOB). This protein is 57% identical, 10% similar to ChR1. It forms a cation-selective ion channel activated by light absorption. It transports both monovalent and divalent cations. It desensitizes to a small conductance in continuous light. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a negative membrane potential. It may be a photoreceptor for dark adapted cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2003-11-25|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 283525|pmid = 14615590|pages = 13940–13945|volume = 100|issue = 24|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1936192100|first = Georg|last = Nagel|first2 = Tanjef|last2 = Szellas|first3 = Wolfram|last3 = Huhn|first4 = Suneel|last4 = Kateriya|first5 = Nona|last5 = Adeishvili|first6 = Peter|last6 = Berthold|first7 = Doris|last7 = Ollig|first8 = Peter|last8 = Hegemann|first9 = Ernst|last9 = Bamberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transient increase in hydration of transmembrane α-helices with a t(1/2) = 60 μs tallies with the onset of cation permeation. Aspartate 253 accepts the proton released by the Schiff base (t(1/2) = 10 μs), with the latter being reprotonated by aspartic acid 156 (t(1/2) = 2 ms). The internal proton acceptor and donor groups, corresponding to D212 and D115 in bacteriorhodopsin, are clearly different from other microbial rhodopsins, indicating that their spatial positions in the protein were relocated during evolution. E90 deprotonates exclusively in the nonconductive state. The observed proton transfer reactions and the protein conformational changes relate to the gating of the cation channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient protonation changes in channelrhodopsin-2 and their relevance to channel gating|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2013-04-02|issn = 1091-6490|pmc = 3619329|pmid = 23509282|pages = E1273–1281|volume = 110|issue = 14|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1219502110|first = Víctor A.|last = Lórenz-Fonfría|first2 = Tom|last2 = Resler|first3 = Nils|last3 = Krause|first4 = Melanie|last4 = Nack|first5 = Michael|last5 = Gossing|first6 = Gabriele|last6 = Fischer von Mollard|first7 = Christian|last7 = Bamann|first8 = Ernst|last8 = Bamberg|first9 = Ramona|last9 = Schlesinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaerhodopsin===

Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2) was found in the claret membrane of ''Halorubrum sp''. It is a light-driven proton pump. Trigonal and hexagonal crystals revealed that trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these crystals, the carotenoid bacterioruberin binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer. Its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about 20 degrees and, on the cytoplasmic side, it is surrounded by helices AB and DE of neighboring subunits. This peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a structural role for the trimerization of aR2. When compared with the aR2 structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin, the proton release channel takes a more closed conformation in the P321 or P6(3) crystal; i.e., the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein-bacterioruberin complex.

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction for bacterio- and sensory rhodopsins is:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + hν → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out).

That for halorhodopsin is:

:Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + hν → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

'''Skylar Annette Neese''' (February 10, 1996{{spaced ndash}}July 6, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] girl who disappeared from her home in [[Star City, West Virginia]] around midnight on July 6, 2012.&lt;ref name="father"/&gt; Neese's remains were found on January 16, 2013, in Wayne Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="remains"/&gt;

Neese was murdered by two of her high school friends, '''Rachel Shoaf''' and '''Shelia Eddy'''. In December 2012, Shoaf told authorities that she and Eddy planned and carried out Neese's murder. Shoaf pleaded guilty to second-degree murder on May 1, 2013.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite news | first = Kim | last = Freda | title = Court Transcript: Shoaf and Co-conspirator Planned Skylar Neese's Murcer | publisher = WBOY news | date = May 16, 2013 | url = http://www.wboy.com/story/22274120/court-transcript-shoaf-and-co-conspirator-planned-skylar-neeses-murder | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neese's disappearance led to new [[West Virginia]] legislation that made changes to the [[AMBER Alert]] missing child alert system.&lt;ref name="skylarslaw" /&gt;

==Background information==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
===Victim===
Skylar Annette Neese was the only child of Mary and Dave Neese. At that time Mary Neese worked as an administrative assistant in a cardiac lab and Dave Neese was a product assembler at [[Walmart]]. Skylar was an honors student at [[University High School (Morgantown)|University High School]] who wanted to become a criminal lawyer. She worked at [[Wendy's]] with two close friends.

===Perpetrators===
Shelia Rae Eddy (born September 28, 1995) is the only child of Tara Clendenen and Greg Eddy. Shelia was born in [[Blacksville, West Virginia]]. Her parents divorced in 2000 when her father got into a car accident that left him with a traumatic brain injury and permanent disability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Tara struggled as a single mother, working as an accountant for a car dealership. In October 2010, Tara and Shelia moved with Tara's new husband, Jim Clendenen, to [[Morgantown, West Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Rachel Shoaf (born June 10, 1996) grew up in Morgantown. She is the only daughter of Rusty and Patricia Shoaf.

Both perpetrators attended University High School along with their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2014/01/24/teen-killer-shelia-eddy-admits-guilt/|title=WV MetroNews  – Teen killer Shelia Eddy admits guilt|website=wvmetronews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance == 
On July 5, 2012, Neese returned to her family's [[Star City, West Virginia]] apartment after working a shift at Wendy's. Her apartment complex's surveillance video shows Neese left the apartment via her bedroom window at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 6 and got into a sedan.&lt;ref name="father"&gt;{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Rippin | title = Father of Star City Teen Begs for Return Home | publisher = WBOY News | date = August 2, 2012 | url = http://www.wboy.com/story/19069371/father-of-star-city-teen-begs-for-return-home | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neese's father said she did not take her cell phone charger, her window was left open, and that she planned on coming home.&lt;ref name="investigation"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = WPXI News | title = Target 11 Investigates How Authorities Handle Missing Persons | date = May 21, 2013 | url = http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/target-11-investigates-how-authorities-handle-miss/nXyDw/ | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2015}}
On the night of the murder, Shelia Eddy and Rachel Shoaf had invited Neese to sneak out with them. Neese, who had recently fallen out with the two, was initially hesitant. After a series of phone calls and texts from the girls, Neese changed her mind.

At approximately 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Neese climbed out of her bedroom window, crossed the street and got into the back seat of a four-door sedan. Law enforcement officers later determined that the sedan had been in the possession of Shelia Eddy that evening. The three girls then headed northwest from Star City toward [[Blacksville, West Virginia|Blacksville]] via [[U.S. Route 19]]. The perpetrators had planned to travel along [[West Virginia Route 7|W.V. Route 7]], but turned around after spotting a state police car parked in front of a gambling lounge.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

They eventually arrived at their destination just across the Pennsylvania state border, a spot where all three of the girls would occasionally smoke marijuana. Shoaf and Eddy had been planning Neese's murder for months. They left Eddy's house prepared to carry out the assault on Neese, bringing with them kitchen knives, paper towels, bleach, cleaning cloths, clean clothes, and a shovel. They concealed the knives on their persons, and hid the remaining items in the trunk of Eddy's vehicle.

Once the girls were out of the vehicle, the perpetrators told Neese they had forgotten to bring a lighter. Neese volunteered to go back to the vehicle to fetch her own lighter. Once Neese had turned her back, Shoaf and Eddy began counting to three—their agreed-upon signal. Upon giving the signal, Shoaf and Eddy began to stab Neese. The victim attempted to run, but was only able to run a few feet before Shoaf tackled her to the ground and continued the assault. During the attack, Neese managed to wrestle Shoaf's knife from her and, in an apparent attempt to defend herself, cut Shoaf's knee. Eddy continued to stab Neese until there was complete silence and, according to Shoaf, "Neese's neck stopped making gurgling sounds." Neese's post-mortem revealed more than 50 stab wounds.

Afterwards Shoaf and Eddy attempted to bury the body,  first dragging Neese to the side of the road which would not work because the road ran along a creek and the soil there was too hard and rocky to dig a hole, which had been their original plan. They instead covered Skylar's body with rocks, fallen branches, and dirt. Shoaf and Eddy then returned to the car to clean themselves and the murder scene. Upon completing the murder and cleaning up, Shoaf and Eddy left the scene, disposed of their blood-soaked clothing and returned to their homes.

== Investigation ==
For months, police investigated several unproductive leads in Neese's disappearance.&lt;ref name="shock"/&gt; Neese was initially considered to be a runaway by law enforcement authorities, and an [[Amber Alert]] was not immediately issued in connection with her disappearance.&lt;ref name="skylarslaw"&gt;{{cite news | first = Shauna | last = Johnson | title = House Approves Skylar's Law | publisher = West Virginia MetroNews | date = March 27, 2013 | url = http://wvmetronews.com/house-approves-skylars-law/ | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early tip indicated that Neese had been seen in [[North Carolina]], but the [[Star City, West Virginia|Star City]] Police Department determined that the person spotted was not Neese.&lt;ref name="tip"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = WBOY News | title = Update:  Star City Police Continue Looking for Missing Girl | date = July 23, 2012 | url = http://www.wboy.com/story/18980671/update-star-city-police-continue-looking-for-missing-girl | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neese's parents posted flyers about their missing daughter in the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] region.&lt;ref name="policeblotter"&gt;{{Cite news | agency = The Associated Press | title = High School Horror in Mon County:  Star City Transfixed by Teen Girls' Murder Plot | newspaper = Saturday Gazette-Mail | date = May 25, 2013 | url = http://www.wvgazette.com/News/policeblotter/201305250019 | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police determined that the unknown sedan in which Skylar Neese was last seen belonged to Eddy and interviewed her. Eddy admitted to picking up Neese but stated that she had dropped her off an hour later.&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Lohr | title = Skylar Neese's Family Fears for Her Safety | publisher = Huffington Post | date = September 10, 2012 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/skylar-neese-missing_n_1871268.html | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the West Virginia State Police joined the search for Skylar Neese on September 10, 2012, and began interviewing Neese's school friends.&lt;ref name="missing"/&gt;

The break in the case came when Rachel Shoaf admitted plotting with Shelia Eddy to kill Neese.&lt;ref name="shock"&gt;{{cite news | agency = The Associated Press | title = Shock as 16-Year-Old Confesses to Stabbing Classmate Who Was Missing for Two Months 'Just Because She Didn't Like Her Anymore' | newspaper = Daily Mail | date = May 25, 2013 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2330904/Shock-16-year-old-confesses-luring-classmate-house-stabbing-death-premeditated-attack.html | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = 9 News MSN | title = US Teen Admits to Plotting Best Friend's Murder | date = May 29, 2013 | url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/2013/05/29/16/03/us-teen-admits-to-plotting-best-friend-s-murder | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tweets"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Deutsch| first1=Gail| last2=Valiente| first2=Alexa| last3=Effron| first3= Lauren | title=Shocking Tweets from Skylar Neese's Killer After She Stabbed Her to Death |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/07/shocking-tweets-from-skylar-neeses-killer-after-she-stabbed-her-to-death/|accessdate=24 December 2016|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures.|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation Shoaf gave for the murder was they "didn't like her".&lt;ref name="shock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC2014-07-17"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Gail | last1 = Deutsch | first2 = Alexa | last2 = Valiente | title = From Best Friends to Killers: Teens Murder Friend Because They 'Didn't Like Her' | publisher = ABC News | date = Jul 16, 2015 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/best-friends-killers-teens-murder-friend-didnt/story?id=24573749#all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Neese stated that these two girls were among his daughter's best friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Parents of slain girl say 1 of 2 teens accused in her stabbing death was 'like our daughter' | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = June 26, 2013 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/parents-of-slain-girl-say-1-of-2-teens-accused-in-her-stabbing-death-was-like-our-daughter/2013/06/26/b736f00a-de4a-11e2-bc84-8049224b33e1_story.html | accessdate = June 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Shelia Eddy had even helped the family look for her by distributing missing person fliers.&lt;ref name="Eddy2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57601480-504083/skylar-neese-update-prosecutors-id-2nd-suspect-in-w-va-teens-murder/ |title=Skylar Neese Update:  Prosecutors ID 2nd suspect in W.

Neese maintained a close relationship with Eddy from when they were children but the friendship became strained when they met Shoaf while at high school. Neese reportedly became upset to see Eddy and Shoaf become close and allegedly witnessed the pair have sex at a sleepover.  It was said the girls may have feared their secret tryst would become public.

== Criminal charges ==
On May 1, 2013, Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{cite news | agency = The Associated Press | title = W. Va. Girl Pleads Guilty in Slaying of Fellow Teen | newspaper = Charleston Daily Mail | date = May 1, 2013 | url = http://www.dailymail.com/News/breakingnews/201305010078?page=1&amp;build=cache | accessdate = May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the court transcript, Shoaf said that she and Shelia Eddy picked up Neese in Eddy's car. The girls drove to Pennsylvania, got out of the car, and began socializing. At a pre-arranged time, Shoaf and Eddy stabbed Skylar to death on the count of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Vicki | last = Smith | title = Skylar Neese:  What mother says about her suspected killers | agency = Associated Press | date = June 29, 2013 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0629/Skylar-Neese-What-mother-says-about-her-suspected-killers | accessdate =July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The teens attempted to bury Neese's body, but were unable to do so and instead covered the body with branches. The court transcript indicates that other students overheard conversations between Shoaf and Eddy about the murder plot, but failed to report it, thinking they were joking.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;  According to Shoaf's plea agreement,&lt;ref name="plea"&gt;{{cite web | title = State of West Virginia Vs.

In the plea agreement, the State of West Virginia will recommend a sentence of 40 years incarceration.&lt;ref name ="guilty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plea" /&gt; Shoaf's family issued a public apology for her actions through their lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=The Shoaf Family |author2=Angoiti and Straface L.C. |title=Statement |date=2013 |url=http://www.wdtv.com/content/files/neese-statement.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170052/http://www.wdtv.com/content/files/neese-statement.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2013 |accessdate=May 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2013, West Virginia prosecutors publicly identified Shelia Eddy as the second alleged perpetrator of the murder of Skylar Neese and announced that she would be tried as an adult.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{cite news | first = Philip | last = Caulfield | title = Second teen girl suspected of slaying best friend in shocking West Virginia murder will be tried as an adult | newspaper = New York Daily News | date = September 5, 2013 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teen-girl-suspected-slaying-best-friend-shocking-west-virginia-murder-adult-article-1.1446955#ixzz2e39yEopL | accessdate = Sep 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy was indicted by a grand jury on September 6, 2013 with one count of [[kidnapping]], one count of [[Murder|first-degree murder]], and one count of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder.&lt;ref name="Eddy_indicted"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tara | last = Kinsell | title = Making the case for jurisdiction | newspaper = Observer-Reporter | date = Sep 10, 2013 | url = http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20130909/NEWS02/130909392#.Ui9lDz_zFf0 | accessdate = September 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelia Eddy pleaded not guilty to these charges.&lt;ref name="Eddy_plead"&gt;{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | first = Ryan | last = Gorman | title = Teenage girl accused of stabbing her best friend to death because she didn't like her any more denies the charge in court | newspaper = Daily Mail | date = Sep 17, 2013 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2423972/Sheila-Eddy-pleads-guilty-killing-best-friend-Skylar-Neese-didnt-like-more.html | accessdate = September 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Eddy was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Beth |last= Stebner |date= January 25, 2014 |title= West Virginia teen Sheila Eddy pleads guilty to murdering friend, sentenced to life in prison |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/west-virginia-teen-sheila-eddy-life-murdering-best-friend-article-1.1591070 |location= New York |publisher= [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate= November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phædo''''' or '''''Phaedo''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|əʊ}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Φαίδων|Φαίδων]]}}, ''Phaidōn'', {{IPA-el|pʰaídɔːn}}), also known to ancient readers as ''On The Soul'',&lt;ref name="Ancient name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-soul/#3.2 |author=Lorenz, Hendrik|title=Ancient Theories of Soul |accessdate=2013-12-10 |date=22 April 2009 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best-known [[dialogue]]s of [[Plato]]'s middle period, along with the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]].''  The philosophical subject of the dialogue is the immortality of the soul. It is set in the last hours prior to the death of [[Socrates]], and is Plato's fourth and last [[dialogue]] to detail the philosopher's final days, following ''[[Euthyphro]]'', ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', and ''[[Crito]]''.

One of the main themes in the ''Phaedo'' is the idea that the [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]]. In the dialogue, Socrates discusses the nature of the [[afterlife]] on his last day before being executed by drinking [[conium maculatum|hemlock]]. Socrates has been imprisoned and sentenced to death by an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] jury for not believing in the [[State religion|gods of the state]] (though some scholars think it was more for his support of "[[philosopher king]]s" as opposed to democracy)&lt;ref&gt;I. F. Stone is among those who adopt a political view of the trial. See the transcript of an interview given by Stone here: http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/socrates/ifstoneinterview.html. For ancient authority, Stone cites Aeschines (''Against Timarchus'' 173).&lt;/ref&gt; and for corrupting the youth of the city.

By engaging in [[dialectic]] with a group of Socrates' friends, including the two [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]], [[Cebes]], and [[Simmias of Thebes|Simmias]], Socrates explores various arguments for the soul's immortality in order to show that there is an afterlife in which the soul will dwell following death. Phaedo tells the story that following the discussion, he and the others were there to witness the death of Socrates.

The ''Phaedo'' was first translated into Latin from Greek by [[Henry Aristippus]] in 1160. Today, it is generally considered one of Plato's great works.

==Summary==
The dialogue is told from the perspective of one of Socrates' students, [[Phaedo of Elis]], who was present at Socrates' death bed. Phaedo relates the dialogue from that day to [[Echecrates of Phlius|Echecrates]], a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[philosopher]].

Socrates offers four arguments for the soul's immortality:

* The ''Cyclical Argument'', or ''Opposites Argument'' explains that [[The Forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of [[magnet]]s.

* The ''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]]'' explains that we possess some [[empiricism|non-empirical]] knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge.  Another account of the theory is found in Plato's ''[[Meno]]'', although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in ''Phaedo''.

* The ''Affinity Argument'', explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things.  Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The ''[[Theory of Forms|Argument from Form of Life]],'' or ''The Final Argument'' explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms.  For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc.  The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Introductory conversation===
The scene is set in Phlius where Echecrates who, meeting Phaedo, asks for news about the last days of Socrates. Phaedo explains why a delay occurred between his trial and his death, and describes the scene in a prison at Athens on the final day, naming those present. He tells how he had visited Socrates early in the morning with the others. Socrates' wife [[Xanthippe]] was there, but was very distressed and Socrates asked that she be taken away. Socrates' relates how, bidden by a recurring dream to "make and cultivate music", he wrote a hymn and then began writing poetry based on [[Aesop's Fables]].{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=57a–61c ([[Stephanus pagination|Stph. p.]])}}

Socrates tells Cebes to "bid him (his friend) farewell from me; say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man" Simmias expresses confusion as to why they ought hasten to follow Socrates to death. Socrates then states "...&amp;nbsp;he, who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die; but he will not take his own life." Cebes raises his doubts as to why [[suicide]] is prohibited. He asks, "Why do you say ... that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow one who is dying?" Socrates replies that while death is the ideal home of the soul, man, specifically the philosopher, should not commit suicide except when it becomes necessary.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=61d–62a}}

Man ought not to kill himself because he possesses no actual ownership of himself, as he is actually the property of the [[deity|gods]]. He says, "I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we men are a chattel of theirs". While the philosopher seeks always to rid himself of the body, and to focus solely on things concerning the soul, to commit suicide is prohibited as man is not sole possessor of his body. For, as stated in the ''Phaedo'': "the philosopher more than other men frees the soul from association with the body as much as possible". Body and soul are separate, then. The philosopher frees himself from the body because the body is an impediment to the attainment of truth.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=62b–65a}}

Of the senses' failings, Socrates says to Simmias in the ''Phaedo'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Did you ever reach them (truths) with any bodily sense?&amp;nbsp;– and I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and, in short, of the reality or true nature of everything. Is the truth of them ever perceived through the bodily organs? Or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing he considers?{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=65e}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher, if he loves true wisdom and not the passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true knowledge and wisdom in death, as he is no longer confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=65c}} Death, however, is a rite of purification from the "infection" of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially "good," why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: "And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead ..., something better for the good than for the wicked."{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=66a–67d}}

The soul attains virtue when it is purified from the body: "He who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements when they associate with the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge&amp;nbsp;– who, if not he, is likely to attain to the knowledge of true being?"{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=65e–66a}}

===The Cyclical Argument===
Cebes voices his fear of death to Socrates: "...&amp;nbsp;they fear that when she [the soul] has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on the very day of death she may perish and come to an end immediately on her release from the body ... dispersing and vanishing away into nothingness in her flight."{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=70a}}

In order to alleviate Cebes' worry that the soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the ''Cyclical Argument''. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?". He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot can become cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes to conclude that the dead are generated from the living, through death, and that the living are generated from the dead, through birth. The souls of the dead must exist in some place for them to be able to return to life.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=69e–72d}}

===The Theory of Recollection Argument===
Cebes realizes the relationship between the ''Cyclical Argument'' and Socrates' ''Theory of Recollection''. He interrupts Socrates to point this out, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that our learning is simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in which we have learned that which we now recollect. But this would be impossible unless our soul had been somewhere before existing in this form of man; here then is another proof of the soul's immortality.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=72e-73a}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Socrates' second argument, the ''Theory of Recollection'', shows that it is possible to draw information out of a person who seems not to have any knowledge of a subject prior to his being questioned about it ([[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] knowledge). This person must have gained this knowledge in a prior life, and is now merely recalling it from memory. Since the person in Socrates' story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that his answers arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=72e–77a}}

===The Affinity Argument===
Socrates presents his third argument for the immortality of the soul, the so-called ''Affinity Argument'', where he shows that the soul most resembles that which is invisible and divine, and the body resembles that which is visible and mortal. From this, it is concluded that while the body may be seen to exist after death in the form of a corpse, as the body is mortal and the soul is divine, the soul must outlast the body.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=78b–80c}}

As to be truly virtuous during life is the quality of a great man who will perpetually dwell as a soul in the underworld. However, regarding those who were not virtuous during life, and so favored the body and pleasures pertaining exclusively to it, Socrates also speaks. He says that such a soul as this is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;polluted, is impure at the time of her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always and is in love with and bewitched by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see, and drink and eat, and use for the purposes of his lusts, the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid that which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, but is the object of mind and can be attained by philosophy; do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed?{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=81b}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persons of such a constitution will be dragged back into corporeal life, according to Socrates. These persons will even be punished while in Hades. Their punishment will be of their own doing, as they will be unable to enjoy the singular existence of the soul in death because of their constant craving for the body. These souls are finally "imprisoned in another body". Socrates concludes that the soul of the virtuous man is immortal, and the course of its passing into the underworld is determined by the way he lived his life. The philosopher, and indeed any man similarly virtuous, in neither fearing death, nor cherishing corporeal life as something idyllic, but by loving truth and wisdom, his soul will be eternally unperturbed after the death of the body, and the afterlife will be full of goodness.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=82d–85b}}

Simmias confesses that he does not wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the immortality of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their [[skepticism]]. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors that he does indeed believe in the soul's immortality, regardless of whether or not he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is not upset facing death and assures them that they ought to express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the [[lyre]]. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=85b–86d}}

Socrates pauses, and asks Cebes to voice his objection as well. He says, "I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been ... proven; but the existence of the soul after death is in my judgment unproven."  While admitting that the soul is the better part of a man, and the body the weaker, Cebes is not ready to infer that because the body may be perceived as existing after death, the soul must therefore continue to exist as well. Cebes gives the example of a weaver. When the weaver's cloak wears out, he makes a new one. However, when he dies, his more freshly woven cloaks continue to exist. Cebes continues that though the soul may outlast certain bodies, and so continue to exist after certain deaths, it may eventually grow so weak as to dissolve entirely at some point. He then concludes that the soul's immortality has yet to be shown and that we may still doubt the soul's existence after death. For, it may be that the next death is the one under which the soul ultimately collapses and exists no more. Cebes would then, "...&amp;nbsp;rather not rely on the argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the soul after death."{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=86d–88b}}

Seeing that the Affinity Argument has possibly failed to show the immortality of the soul, Phaedo pauses his narration. Phaedo remarks to Echecrates that, because of this objection, those present had their "faith shaken," and that there was introduced "a confusion and uncertainty". Socrates too pauses following this objection and then warns against misology, the hatred of argument.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=88c–91c}}

===The Argument from Form of Life===
Socrates then proceeds to give his final proof of the immortality of the soul by showing that the soul is immortal as it is the cause of life. He begins by showing that "if there is anything beautiful other than absolute beauty it is beautiful only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty".

Consequently, as absolute beauty is a ''Form'', and so is the soul, then anything which has the property of being infused with a soul is so infused with the Form of soul. As an example he says, "will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?". Forms, then, will never become their opposite. As the soul is that which renders the body living, and that the opposite of life is death, it so follows that, "...&amp;nbsp;the soul will never admit the opposite of what she always brings." That which does not admit death is said to be immortal.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=100c–104c}}

Socrates thus concludes, "Then, Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will truly exist in another world. "Once dead, man's soul will go to [[Hades]] and be in the company of," as Socrates says, "...&amp;nbsp;men departed, better than those whom I leave behind."  For he will dwell amongst those who were true philosophers, like himself.{{sfn|Plato, ''Phaedo''|loc=63c}}

==Legacy==
Plato's ''Phaedo'' had a significant readership throughout antiquity, and was commented on by a number of ancient philosophers, such as Harpocration of Argos, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Iamblichus]], Paterius, [[Plutarch of Athens]], [[Syrianus]] and [[Proclus]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of references to the fragments that survive from these commentaries, see now Gertz 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important commentaries on the dialogue that have come down to us from the ancient world are those by [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] of Alexandria and [[Damascius]] of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Both are translated in two volumes by L.G. Westerink (1976–7), ''The Greek Commentaries on Plato's'' Phaedo, vols. I &amp; II, Amsterdam: North-Holland Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Phaedo'' has come to be considered a seminal formulation, from which "a whole range of dualities, which have become deeply ingrained in Western philosophy, theology, and psychology over two millennia, received their classic formulation: soul and body, mind and matter, intellect and sense, reason and emotion, reality and appearance, unity and plurality, perfection and imperfection, immortal and mortal, permanence and change, eternal and temporal, divine and human, heaven and earth."{{sfn|Gallop|1996|p=ix}}

'''Rape trauma syndrome''' ('''RTS''') is the [[psychological trauma]] experienced by a [[rape]] victim that includes disruptions to normal physical, emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal behavior. The theory was first described by psychiatrist [[Ann Wolbert Burgess]] and sociologist Lynda Lytle Holmstrom in 1974.&lt;ref name="psychiatryonline1974"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1176/ajp.131.9.981|author1=Burgess, Ann Wolbert  |author2=Lynda Lytle Holmström|title=Rape Trauma Syndrome|journal= Am J Psychiatry |volume=131|pages=981–986|year=1974|pmid=4415470|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTS is a cluster of psychological and physical signs, symptoms and reactions common to most rape victims immediately following a rape, but which can also occur for months or years afterwards.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Sandoval|title=Handbook of crisis counseling, intervention, and prevention in the schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwycCgCFIQsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA140|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8058-3615-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most research into RTS has focused on female victims, sexually abused males (whether by male or female perpetrators)  also exhibit RTS symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01541979|author=Philip M. Sarrel1 and William H. Masters|year=1982|title= Sexual molestation of men by women|journal= Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume= 11|issue=2|pages=117–31|pmid=7125884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tewksbury, Richard|title=Effects of Sexual Assaults on Men: Physical, Mental and Sexual Consequences|journal= International Journal of Men's Health|volume= 6|issue=1|year=2007|doi=10.3149/jmh.0601.22|pages=22–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTS paved the way for consideration of [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]], which can more accurately describe the consequences of serious, protracted trauma than [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16281237|author=Bessel A. van der Kolk, Susan Roth, David Pelcovitz, Susanne Sunday, and Joseph Spinazzola|title=Disorders of Extreme Stress: The Empirical Foundation of a Complex Adaptation to Trauma|journal= Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume= 18|issue= 5|year=2005|pages= 389–399|url=http://www.traumacenter.org/products/pdf_files/SpecialIssueComplexTraumaOct2006JTS3.pdf|doi=10.1002/jts.20047}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms of RTS and post-traumatic stress syndrome overlap.  As might be expected, a person who has been raped will generally experience high levels of distress immediately afterward. These feelings may subside over time for some people; however, individually each syndrome can have long devastating effects on rape victims and some victims will continue to experience some form of psychological distress for months or years.  It has also been found that rape survivors are at high risk for developing substance use disorders, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=A.L.|author2=Testa, M. |author3=Messman-Moore, T.L. |title=Psychological consequences of sexual victimization resulting from force, incapacitation, or verbal coercion.|journal=Violence Against Women|date=2009|volume=15|pages=898–919|doi=10.1177/1077801209335491|pmid=19502576|issue=8|pmc=2761643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common stages==
RTS identifies three stages of [[psychological trauma]] a rape survivor goes through: the acute stage, the outer adjustment stage, and the renormalization stage.

===Acute stage===
The acute stage occurs in the days or weeks after a rape. Durations vary as to the amount of time the victim may remain in the acute stage. The immediate symptoms may last a few days to a few weeks and may overlap with the outward adjustment stage.

According to Scarse,&lt;ref&gt;Scarce, M. (1997). Male on male rape: The  toll of stigma and Shame. New York: Insight
Books.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no "typical" response amongst rape victims. However, the U.S. [[Rape Abuse and Incest National Network]]&lt;ref name="rainn1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402000429/http://www.rainn.org/get-information/effects-of-sexual-assault/rape-trauma-syndrome Rape Trauma Syndrome]. rainn.org&lt;/ref&gt; (RAINN) asserts that, in most cases, a rape victim's acute stage can be classified as one of three responses: expressed ("He or she may appear agitated or hysterical, [and] may suffer from crying spells or anxiety attacks"); controlled ("the survivor appears to be without emotion and acts as if 'nothing happened' and 'everything is fine'"); or shock/disbelief ("the survivor reacts with a strong sense of disorientation. They may have difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or doing everyday tasks. They may also have poor recall of the assault"). Not all rape survivors show their emotions outwardly. Some may appear calm and unaffected by the assault.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

[[Behavior]]s present in the acute stage can include:
* Diminished alertness.
* Numbness.
* Dulled sensory, affective and memory functions.
* Disorganized thought content.
* Vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;Desirée Hansson [https://web.archive.org/web/20080317034912/http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/sjrp/publicat/rape.htm What is Rape Trauma Syndrome?]. Occasional Papers Series 1992. Institute of Criminology. University of Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nausea.
* Paralyzing [[anxiety]].
* Pronounced internal tremor.
* Obsession to wash or clean themselves.
* [[Hysteria]], confusion and crying.
* Bewilderment.
* Acute [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to the reaction of other people.

===The outward adjustment stage===
Survivors in this stage seem to have resumed their normal lifestyle. However, they simultaneously suffer profound internal turmoil, which may manifest in a variety of ways as the survivor copes with the long-term trauma of a rape. In a 1976 paper, Burgess and Holmstrom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coping behavior of the rape victim |volume=133 |issue=4|pmid=1267040|pages= 413–8 |journal=Am J Psychiatry|year=1976|last1=Burgess|first1=AW|last2=Holmstrom|first2=LL |doi=10.1176/ajp.133.4.413}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that all but 1 of their 92 subjects exhibited maladaptive coping mechanisms after a rape. The outward adjustment stage may last from several months to many years after a rape.

RAINN&lt;ref name="rainn1"/&gt; identifies five main coping strategies during the outward adjustment phase:
* [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] (pretending 'everything is fine')
* dramatization (cannot stop talking about the assault)
* [[Thought suppression|suppression]] (refuses to discuss the rape)
* explanation (analyzes what happened)
* flight (moves to a new home or city, alters appearance)

Other [[coping mechanism]]s that may appear during the outward adjustment phase include:
* poor health in general.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;
* continuing [[anxiety]]
* sense of helplessness
* [[hypervigilance]]
* inability to maintain previously close relationships
* experiencing a general response of nervousness known as the "startle response"
* persistent [[fear]] and or [[Depression (mood)|depression]] at much higher rates than the general population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, M., Coxell, A. and Mezey, G. |year=2002|title= Sexual molestation of males: Associations with psychological disturbance|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume= 181|pages= 153–157|pmid=12151287| doi = 10.1192/bjp.181.2.153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[mood swings]] from relatively happy to depression or anger
* extreme [[anger]] and hostility (more typical of male victims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Groth, N., &amp; Burgess, A. W. (1980). Male rape: Offenders and victims|journal= American Journal of Psychiatry|volume= 137|pages= 806–810|pmid=7386658|year=1980|title=Male rape: Offenders and victims|issue=7|doi=10.1176/ajp.137.7.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* sleep disturbances such as vivid dreams and recurring nightmares
* [[insomnia]], wakefulness, night terrors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Choquet, M., Darves-Bornoz, J. M., Ledoux, S., Manfredi, R. and Hassler, C. |year=1997|title= Selfreported health and behavioral problems among adolescent victims of rape in France: Results of a cross-sectional survey|journal= Child Abuse and Neglect|volume= 21|pages= 823–832|doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00044-6|pmid=9298260|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]]
* [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] (feeling like one is not attached to one's body)
* [[panic attacks]]
* reliance on coping mechanisms, some of which may be beneficial (e.g., philosophy and family support), and others that may ultimately be counterproductive (e.g., [[self harm]], [[drug abuse|drug]], or [[alcohol abuse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burnam |year=1988|title= Sexual assault and mental disorders in a community population |volume= 56|pages= 843–850 |first=M. A. |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1037/0022-006x.56.6.843 |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Choquet, M., Darves-Bornoz, J. M., Ledoux, S., Manfredi, R. and Hassler, C. |year=1997|title= Self-reported health and behavioral problems among adolescent victims of rape in France: Results of a cross-sectional survey|journal= Child Abuse and Neglect|volume=21|pages= 823–832|doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00044-6|pmid=9298260|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Lifestyle====
Survivors in this stage can have their lifestyle affected in some of the following ways:
* Their sense of personal security or safety is damaged.
* They feel hesitant to enter new relationships.
* Questioning their [[sexual identity]] or [[sexual orientation]] (more typical of men raped by other men or women raped by other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Garnets, L.  |author2=Herek, G. |year=1990|title=Violence and victimization of lesbians and gay men: Mental health consequences|journal= Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume= 5|pages= 366–383|doi=10.1177/088626090005003010|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Struckman-Johnson, C.  |author2=Struckman-Johnson, D. |year=1994|title= Men pressured and forced into sexual experience|journal= Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume= 23|pages=93–114|doi=10.1007/BF01541620|pmid=8135654|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Sexual relationships become disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=deVisser, R. O., Smith, A. M., Rissel, C. E., Richters, J. and Grulich, A. E. |year=2003|title=Sex in Australia: Experiences of sexual coercion among a representative sample of adults|journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume= 27|pages= 198–203|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.2003.tb00808.x|pmid=14696711|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many survivors have reported that they were unable to re-establish normal sexual relations and often shied away from sexual contact for some time after the rape. Some report inhibited sexual response and [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to the rape during intercourse.  Conversely, some rape survivors become hyper-sexual or promiscuous following sexual attacks, sometimes as a way to reassert a measure of control over their sexual relations.

Some rape survivors may see the world as a more threatening place to live in, so they will place restrictions on their lives, interrupting their normal activity. For example, they may discontinue previously active involvements in societies, groups or clubs, or a parent who was a survivor of rape may place restrictions on the freedom of their children.

====Physiological responses====
Whether or not they were injured during a sexual assault, rape survivors exhibit higher rates of poor health in the months and years after an assault,&lt;ref name=t/&gt; including acute [[somatoform disorder]]s (physical symptoms with no identifiable cause).&lt;ref name="psychiatryonline1974"/&gt;  [[Physiological]] reactions such as [[tension headaches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], general feelings of soreness or localized pain in the chest, throat, arms or legs. Specific symptoms may occur that relate to the area of the body assaulted. Survivors of oral rape may have a variety of mouth and throat complaints, while survivors of vaginal or anal rape have physical reactions related to these areas.

====Nature of the assault====
*The nature of the act, the relationship with the offender, the type and amount of force used, and the circumstances of the assault all influence the impact of an assault on the victim.
*When the assault is committed by a stranger, fear seems to be the most difficult emotion to manage for many people. (Feelings of vulnerability arise).
*More commonly, assaults are committed by someone the victim knows and trusts. May be heightened feelings of [[self-blame]] and guilt.

====Underground stage====
*Victims attempt to return to their lives as if nothing happened.
*May block thoughts of the assault from their minds and may not want to talk about the incident or any of the related issues. (They don't want to think about it).
*Victims may have difficulty in concentrating and some depression.
*Dissociation and trying to get back to their lives before the assault.
*The underground stage may last for years and the victim seems as though they are "over it", despite the fact the emotional issues are not resolved.

====Reorganization stage====

*May return to emotional turmoil
*The return of emotional pain can extremely frighten people in this stage.
*Fears and phobias may develop. They may be related specifically to the assailant or the circumstances or the attack or they may be much more generalized.
*Appetite disturbances such as [[nausea]] and vomiting. Rape survivors are also prone to developing [[anorexia nervosa]] and/or [[bulimia]].
*Nightmares, night terrors feel like they plague the victim.
*Violent fantasies of revenge may also arise.

====Phobias====
A common psychological defense that is seen in rape survivors is the development of fears and [[phobias]] specific to the circumstances of the rape, for example:

* A fear of being in crowds.
* A fear of being left alone anywhere.
* A fear of men or women. (androphobia or gynophobia)
* A fear of going out at all, [[agoraphobia]].
* A fear of being touched, [[hapnophobia]].
* Specific fears related to certain characteristics of the assailant, e.g. side-burns, straight hair, the smell of alcohol or cigarettes, type of clothing or car.
* Some survivors develop very suspicious, [[paranoia|paranoid]] feelings about strangers.
* Some feel a pervasive fear of most or all other people.

===The renormalization stage===
In this stage, the survivor begins to recognize his or her adjustment phase.   Recognizing the impact of the rape for survivors who were in [[denial]], and recognizing the secondary damage of any counterproductive coping tactics (e.g., recognizing that one's drug abuse began to help cope with the aftermath of a rape) is particularly important.  Male victims typically do not seek psychotherapy for a long time after the sexual assault—according to Lacey and Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lacey, H. G.  |author2=Roberts, R. |year=1991|title=Sexual assault on men|journal= International Journal of STD and AIDS|volume= 2|pages= 258–260|pmid=1911957|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than half of male victims sought therapy within six months and the average interval between assault and therapy was 2.5 years; King and Woollett's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=King, M.  |author2=Woollett, E. |year=1997|title=Sexually assaulted males: 115 men consulting a counseling service|journal= Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume= 26|pages= 579–588|doi=10.1023/A:1024520225196|pmid=9415795|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; study of over 100 male rape victims found that the mean interval between assault and therapy was 16.4 years.

During renormalization, survivors integrate the sexual assault into their lives so that the rape is no longer the central focus of their lives; negative feelings such as [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]] become resolved, and survivors no longer [[blame]] themselves for the attack.

==Legal issues==
Prosecutors sometimes use RTS evidence to disabuse jurors of prejudicial misconceptions arising from a victim's ostensibly unusual post-rape behavior. The RTS testimony helps educate the jury about the psychological consequences surrounding rape and functions to dispel [[rape myth]]s by explaining counterintuitive post-rape behavior.

Especially in cases in which prosecutors have introduced RTS testimony, defendants have also sometimes proffered RTS evidence, a practice that has been criticized as undermining core values embodied in [[rape shield law]]s, since it can involve subjecting victims to compelled psychological evaluations and searching cross-examination regarding past sexual history. Since social scientists have difficulty distinguishing symptoms attributable to rape-related PTSD from those induced by previous traumatic events, rape defendants sometimes argue that an alternative traumatic event, such as a previous rape, could be the source of the victim's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=49|journal=Hastings L.J.|pages=1512|date=1997–1998|title=Rape, Resurrection, and the Quest for Truth: The Law and Science of Rape Trauma Syndrome in Constitutional Balance with the Rights of the Accused|author=Davis, Kathryn M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A criticism of rape trauma syndrome as currently conceptualized is that it delegitimizes a person's reaction to rape by describing their coping mechanisms, including their rational attempts to struggle through, survive the pain of sexual assault, and to adapt to a violent world, as symptoms of disorder. People who installed locks and purchased security devices, took self-defense classes, carried mace, changed residence, and expressed anger at the criminal justice system, for example, were characterized as exhibiting pathological symptoms and "adjustment difficulties". According to this criticism, RTS removes a person's pain and anger from their social and political context, attributing a person's anguish, humiliation, anger, and despair after being raped to a disorder caused by the actions of the rapist, rather than to, say, insensitive treatment by the police, [[rape kit#examiners|examining physicians]], and the judicial system; or to family reactions permeated with rape mythology.

Another criticism is that the literature on RTS constructs rape survivors as passive, disordered victims, even though much of the behavior that serves as the basis for RTS could be considered the product of strength. Words like "fear" are replaced with words like "phobia", with its connotations of irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=88|journal=Nw. U. L. Rev.|pages=1275|date=1993–1994|title=Protection Racket: Rape Trauma Syndrome, Psychiatric Labeling, and Law|author=Stefan, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the scientific validity of the RTS construct are that it is vague in important details; it is unclear what its boundary conditions are; it uses unclear terms that do not have a basis in psychological science; it fails to specify key quantitative relationships; it has not undergone subsequent scientific evaluation since the 1974 Burgess and Holstrom study; there are theoretical [[allegiance effect]]s; it has not achieved a consensus in the field; it is not falsifiable; it ignores possible mediators; it is not culturally sensitive; and it is not suitable for being used to infer that rape has or has not occurred. PTSD has been described as a superior model since unlike RTS, empirical examination of the PTSD model has been extensive, both conceptually and empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Examining the Scientific Validity of Rape Trauma Syndrome|doi=10.1080/13218719.2014.918067|author1=O'Donohuea, William |author2=Carlsona, Gwendolyn C. |author3=Benutoa, Lorraine T. |author4=Bennetta, Natalie M. |date=10 July 2004|journal=Psychiatry, Psychology and Law|volume=21|issue=6|pages=858–876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lucas was born on February 25, 1953 in [[Flushing, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref name= legacy.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/reggie-lucas-who-worked-with-miles-davis-and-madonna-dies/2018/05/19/c0c5b1d4-5b94-11e8-9889-07bcc1327f4b_story.html|title=Reggie Lucas, who worked with Miles Davis and Madonna, dies|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2018-05-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Early in his career, Lucas was an R&amp;B and jazz guitarist, playing with [[Billy Paul]] in the early 1970s and then with [[Miles Davis]] from 1972 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tingen|first=Paul|title=Miles Beyond : Electric Explorations of Miles Davis, 1967-1991|year=2001|isbn=0823083462}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Davis' electric band (one that included [[Pete Cosey]], [[Michael Henderson]] and [[Al Foster]]) that Lucas met percussionist Mtume, who would later become his production partner. The two joined singer [[Roberta Flack]]'s band in 1976, and toured with Andrew Baijnath for several years.

Following his stint as a touring jazz guitarist, Lucas shifted his focus to songwriting and producing, where he gained both fame and critical praise, at first working as part of a production team with percussionist [[James Mtume]]. The two would later go on to write and produce hits for a number of artists, including [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[Lou Rawls]], [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|the Spinners]] and [[Roberta Flack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taraborrelli|first=J. Randy|title=Madonna: An Intimate Biography|year=2001|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0743227093|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1970s came to a close, Lucas branched out and began to write and produce material by himself. In addition to his own instrumental record (1978), "Survival Themes", one of his first solo projects was Madonna's 1983 self-titled debut album, including the song "[[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Lucy|title=Madonna: Like an Icon|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0060898992|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas produced the majority of the album, which sold more than five million copies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lucas later worked with [[Rebbie Jackson]], [[Randy Crawford]], and [[The Four Tops]] on his own. He was also a member of the short-lived group Sunfire, who released one album in 1982. Lucas produced their single "Young Free and Single".

In 1986, Lucas founded the [[Jersey City]] recording studio [[Quantum Sound]].&lt;ref name="Page 67"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Companies|newspaper=Billboard|date=Nov 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients  of the studio included the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Jodeci]], [[Jeff Buckley]] and [[Sepultura]].

==Personal life and death==
Lucas's daughter, [[Lisa Lucas (publisher)|Lisa Lucas]], is executive director of the [[National Book Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellogg|first1=Carolyn|title=Lisa Lucas, head of the National Book Foundation, wants you to love reading|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/features/la-ca-jc-lisa-lucas-20160509-snap-story.html|accessdate=19 October 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas died of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] in New York City, at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/19/us/ap-us-obit-reggie-lucas.html |title=Reggie Lucas, Who Worked With Miles Davis and Madonna, Dies |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/reggie-lucas-madonna-producer-dead-at-65-w520529 |title=Reggie Lucas, Miles Davis Guitarist and Madonna Producer, Dead at 65 |first=Daniel |last=Kreps |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 19, 2018 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1981, Lucas and James Mtume won a [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song]] for their composition "[[Never Knew Love Like This Before]]", which was performed by Stephanie Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/reggie-lucas |title=Grammy Award Results for Reggie Lucas |website=[[The Recording Academy]] |access-date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notability|date=February 2018}}

'''Ricardo Armbruster''' (1944 – 1976) was a Spanish ecologist, adventurer and entrepreneur.

Ricardo Armbruster Blecher (Nano) was born in [[Madrid]] to the German/Spanish family Armbruster/Blecher. His father Eugen Armbruster was a successful industrialist in Spain (tubes, plastics, metals, energy, banks, forests) and his mother, Trude Armbruster ([[Given name|née]] Blecher) was a renowned violinist.

At an early age, Ricardo Armbruster and his family discovered that schooling and academic life were not going to be his preferred way of advancing personally. He developed a wide interest in animals and nature in the 1950s, spending long periods at the family farm in [[Camorritos]], Spain, and becoming a respected naturalist at a very early stage. Soon afterwards, at the age of 17, he decided to travel and learn. He spent some time at several academies and jobs in Switzerland, Germany and [[London]], before returning to Madrid and, from there, to the American continent. First, he traveled around the United States and Mexico with his brother and friends, before accepting a job at a bookstore in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. After feeling frustrated by the fact that the store sold books by length for decoration rather than for reading, he felt the call of the wild, embarked on a trip to the south and disappeared in the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corbillón |first1=Antonio |title=En el Amazonas sin mapas, guía, ni GPS |url=https://www.eldiariomontanes.es/on-extra/201703/19/amazonas-mapas-guia-20170318190826.html |work=El Diario Montañes |date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later Ricardo Armbruster reappeared in [[Tenerife]], on the [[Canary Islands]]. He had made a living by hunting in the forest, making research films, helping national armies explore new territories and, in the end, smuggling coffee to pay for a ship fare back to Europe.

Back in Spain, Ricardo Armbruster settled down, married Erika Born, another German/Spanish national, and had two children: Yaukuma (named after a [[Mehinako people|Mehinaku]] Indian of the [[Xingu River|Xingú River]] Basin) and Thurit Armbruster. The couple moved to [[Valladolid]], in the north of Spain, where Ricardo Armbruster became a successful entrepreneur but was mostly recognized for his activist ecologism and political positioning (against the [[Spanish State]] of [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]].

Ricardo Armbruster was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the [[AEORMA]] ecologist group, a strictly forbidden activity under the [[Francoist State]]. He was also, with Julio Valdeón Baruque, José Luis Martín, José Luis Barrigón, Carlos Santamaría, Carlos Carrasco, Manuel Conde and others, the driving force behind the creation of the [[Instituto Regional Castellano-Leonés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adiós a Rafa Álvarez-Taladriz, pionero del ecologismo |url=http://ultimocero.com/noticias/2016/11/03/adios-a-rafa-alvarez-taladriz-pionero-del-ecologismo/ |publisher=Ultimocero |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an autonomy-enhancing entity that was subject to severe persecution by Franco´s authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berzal |first1=Enrique |title=Gran medievalista, profesor e impulsor de Castilla y León |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/22/opinion/16330706.html |work=El Mundo |date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Historia del movimiento castellano leonés&gt;

Erika and Ricardo Armbruster's home in the Castillian countryside ([[La Corala]]) soon became a preferred stop for zoologists and naturalists in the early 1970s, who brought over every kind of fauna to be treated and cured. This made the premises look more like a zoo than a private home. The property also became a hot spot for debates about democracy and ecology among Spanish intellectuals, artists and oligarchs who appreciated Armbruster's views on these subjects.

A rebel [[Christian]] (he married under scrutiny and press coverage following the [[Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] rituals at a time of [[National Catholicism]] in Spain), Ricardo Armbruster died on Easter Sunday in April 1976, at the age of 32, in [[Ribadesella]], [[Asturias]] (Spain), while scuba diving in search of eels and other sea species in the cold waters of the [[Cantabrian Sea]].&lt;El Norte de Castilla&gt;

'''School bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] that occurs in any [[learning space|educational setting]].

For an act to be considered bullying it must meet certain criteria. This includes hostile intent, imbalance of power, repetition, distress, and provocation. Bullying can have a wide spectrum of effects on a student including anger, depression, stress and suicide. Additionally, the bully can develop different social disorders or have a higher chance of engaging in criminal activity.

If there is suspicion that a child is being bullied or is a bully, there are warning signs in their behavior. There are many programs and organizations worldwide which provide bullying prevention services or information on how children can cope if they have been bullied.

== Definition ==
There is no universal definition of school bullying; however, it is widely agreed that bullying is a subcategory of [[aggressive behavior]] characterized by the following three minimum criteria:&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheri_Bauman/publication/282641314_How_teachers_respond_to_school_bullying_An_examination_of_self-reported_intervention_strategy_use_moderator_effects_and_concurrent_use_of_multiple_strategies/links/56277c7808aefb81befbab5d.pdf |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51 |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*hostile intent (i.e., the harm caused by bullying is deliberate, not accidental),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldsmid |first1=S. |last2=Howie |first2=P. |year=2014 |title=Bullying by definition: An examination of definitional components of bullying |url= |journal=Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=210–225 |doi=10.1080/13632752.2013.844414}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*imbalance of power (i.e., bullying includes a real or perceived power inequity between the bully and the victim),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
*repetition over a period of time (i.e., more than once with the potential to occur multiple times).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

The following two additional criteria have been proposed to complement the above-mentioned criteria:
* victim distress (victim suffers mild to severe psychological, social or physical trauma)&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
* provocation (bullying is motivated by perceived benefits of their aggressive behaviors).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

Some of these characteristics have been disputed (e.g., for power imbalance: bullies and victims often report that conflicts occur between two equals); nevertheless, they remain widely established in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"/&gt;

== Underlying causes ==
The underlying causes of school violence and bullying include gender and social norms and wider contextual and structural factors.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf |title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report |last=UNESCO |first= |publisher=Paris, UNESCO |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-3-100197-0 |location= |pages=17, 29, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory [[Gender role|gender norms]] that shape the dominance of men and the subservience of women and the perpetuation of these norms through violence are found in some form in many cultures. [[Gender inequality]] and the prevalence of [[violence against women]] in society exacerbate the problem. Similarly, social norms that support the authority of teachers over children may legitimise the use of violence to maintain discipline and control.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The pressure to conform to dominant gender norms is also high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Doug |date= |title=The Disregarding of Heteronormativity: Emphasizing a Happy Queer Adulthood and Localizing Anti-Queer Violence to Adolescent Schools |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy |volume=14 |issue=3 |page=331 |via= |doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people who cannot or who choose not to conform to these norms are often punished for this through violence and bullying at school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Schools themselves can "teach" children to be violent through discriminatory practices, curricula and textbooks. If unchecked, gender discrimination and power imbalances in schools can encourage attitudes and practices that subjugate children, uphold unequal gender norms and tolerate violence, including corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Some attribute part of the cause of bullying to the [[Bullying culture|atmosphere]] in which it occurs. Thornberg and Knutsen state in their study, "School attributing refers to attributing the cause of bullying to the school setting." They say that school attributing has two subcategories which are "boredom in school" and "poor antibullying practices". Boredom in school involves a student who does not have anything else to do other than bully. Poor antibullying practices may include teachers and staff not caring enough to intervene, or a school not having enough teachers for students. This may lead to the students feeling unwanted or unimportant due to the lack of care from the school's staff.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thornberg, Robert, and Sven Knutsen |title=Teenagers' Explanations of Bullying |journal=Child &amp; Youth Care Forum |volume=40 |issue=3 |page=177 |doi=10.1007/s10566-010-9129-z |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools and the education system also operate within the context of wider social and structural factors and may reflect and reproduce environments that do not protect children and adolescents from violence and bullying. For example, physical and sexual violence may be more prevalent in schools in contexts where it is also more prevalent in wider society. Studies suggest that sexual violence and harassment of girls is worse in schools where other forms of violence are prevalent, and in conflict and emergency contexts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107E.pdf School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all]. UNESCO Policy Paper 17 (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Gang|gang violence]] is more common in schools where gangs, weapons and drugs are part of the local culture.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In their paper "Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior," Connell, Morris and Piquero identify three primary aspects of a child's life- family, school and peers- as major indicators to whether or not that child exhibits behavior akin to bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Connell |first=Nadine M. |last2=Morris |first2=Robert G. |last3=Piquero |first3=Alex R. |date=July 2016 |title=Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1082–1096 |doi=10.1177/0306624X15573760 |issn=1552-6933 |pmid=25759430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
Bullying can threaten students' physical and emotional safety at school and can negatively impact their ability to learn. The best way to address bullying is to stop it before it starts. There are many different groups that can intervene to address bullying (and cyberbullying) in schools: parents, teachers, and school leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=H |title=Malicious Use of Technology: What Schools, Parents, and Teachers Can Do to Prevent Cyberbullying |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.2013.792636 |journal=Childhood Education |volume=89 |pages=146–151 |via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used strategies by teachers to prevent it are to communicate, mediate and seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Giménez-Gualdo |first=Ana-M. |last2=Arnaiz-Sánchez |first2=Pilar |last3=Cerezo-Ramírez |first3=Fuensanta |last4=Prodócimo |first4=Elaine |date=2018-07-01 |title=Teachers' and students' perception about cyberbullying.

There are no federal mandates for bullying curricula or staff training. In addition to addressing bullying before it occurs, a great prevention strategy is to educate the students on bullying.&lt;ref name="US Govt"/&gt;

Examples of activities to teach about bullying include:

* Internet or library research, such as looking up types of bullying, how to prevent it, and how kids should respond
* Presentations, such as a speech or role-play on stopping bullying
* Discussions about topics like reporting bullying
* Creative writing, such as a poem speaking out against bullying or a story or skit teaching bystanders how to help
* Artistic works, such as a collage about respect or the effects of bullying
* Classroom meetings to talk about peer relations&lt;ref name="US Govt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/prevention/at-school/index.html |title=Prevention at School |date=2012-02-29 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=2018-04-26}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A victim, in the short term, may feel [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], anxious, angry, have [[Stress (psychological)|excessive stress]], [[learned helplessness]], feel as though their life has fallen apart, have a significant drop in school performance, or may commit [[suicide]] ([[bullycide]]). In the long term, they may feel [[Emotional security|insecure]], lack [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], exhibit extreme sensitivity ([[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]), or develop a mental illness such as [[psychopathy]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] or [[PTSD]].  They may also desire [[Revenge|vengeance]], sometimes leading them to torment others in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dombeck, Mark |title=The Long Term Effects of Bullying |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-bullying/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety, depression and psychosomatic symptoms are common among both bullies and their victims. Among these participants alcohol and substance abuse are commonly seen later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KALTIALA HEINO |first=RIITTAKERTTU |last2=RIMPELÄ |first2=MATTI |last3=RANTANEN |first3=PÄIVI |last4=RIMPELÄ |first4=ARJA |date=1 December 2000 |title=Bullying at school—an indicator of adolescents at risk for mental disorders |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197100903518 |journal=Journal of Adolescence |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=661–674 |doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that people suffering from depression feel much better when they talk to others about it, but victims of bullying fear may not talk to others about their feelings in fear of being bullied, which can worsen their depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olweus |first1=D |title=Bullying at school |date=1993 |publisher=Malden, MA |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short term, being a bystander "can produce feelings of anger, fear, guilt, and sadness.... Bystanders who witness repeated victimizations of peers can experience negative effects similar to the victimized children themselves."&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

While most bullies, in the long term, grow up to be emotionally functional adults, many have an increased risk of developing [[antisocial personality disorder]], which is linked to an increased risk of committing criminal acts (including [[domestic violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Long-Term Effects Of Bullying: Pain Lasts Into Adulthood (STUDY) |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=15 April 2014 |date=20 February 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/long-term-effects-of-bullying_n_2728190.html |author=Pappas, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative impact on educational quality and outcomes ===
The educational effects on victims of school violence and bullying are significant. Violence and bullying at the hands of teachers or other students may make children and adolescents afraid to go to school and interfere with their ability to concentrate in class or participate in school activities. It can also have similar effects on bystanders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The consequences include missing classes, avoiding school activities, playing truant or dropping out of school altogether. This in turn has an adverse impact on academic achievement and attainment and on future education and employment prospects. Children and adolescents who are victims of violence may achieve lower grades and may be less likely to anticipate going on to higher education. Analyses of international learning assessments highlight the impact of bullying on learning outcomes. These analyses clearly show that bullying reduces students' achievement in key subjects, such as mathematics, and other studies have documented the negative impact of school violence and bullying on educational performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24298004 |year=2014 |author1=Devries |first1=K. M |title=School violence, mental health, and educational performance in Uganda |journal=Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=e129–37 |last2=Child |first2=J. C |last3=Allen |first3=E |last4=Walakira |first4=E |last5=Parkes |first5=J |last6=Naker |first6=D |doi=10.1542/peds.2013-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bystanders and the school climate as a whole are also affected by school violence and bullying. Unsafe learning environments create a climate of fear and insecurity and a perception that teachers do not have control or do not care about the students, and this reduces the quality of education for all.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Social and economic costs ===
The 2006 UN World Report on Violence against Children shows that victims of corporal punishment, both at school and at home, may develop into adults who are passive and over-cautious or aggressive. Involvement in school bullying can be a predictor of future antisocial and criminal behaviour. Being bullied is also linked to a heightened risk of eating disorders and social and relationship difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF (2014). [https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_74865.html Hidden in plain sight: A statistical analysis of violence against children]. {{ISBN|978-92-806-4767-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other studies have shown the longer-term effects of bullying at school. One study of all children born in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in 1958 analyzes data on 7,771 children who had been bullied at ages 7 and 11. At age 50, those who had been bullied as children were less likely to have obtained school qualifications and less likely to live with a spouse or partner or to have adequate social support. They also had lower scores on word memory tests designed to measure cognitive IQ even when their childhood intelligence levels were taken into account and, more often reported, that they had poor health. The effects of bullying were visible nearly four decades later, with health, social and economic consequences lasting well into adulthood. For children, "peers are a much more important influence than has been realised. It is a terrible thing to be excluded by your peers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rebecca (18 April 2014). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10772302/Bullying-at-school-affects-health-40-years-later.html Bullying at school affects health 40 years later]. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2017-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The economic impact of violence against children and adolescents is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2016). Inspire. Seven strategies for ending violence against children.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth violence in Brazil alone is estimated to cost nearly US$19 billion every year, of which US$943 million can be linked to violence in schools. The estimated cost to the economy in the USA of violence associated with schools is US$7.9 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (2012). Tackling violence in schools: A global perspective bridging the gap between standards and practice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Analytic work supported by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) shows that school-related gender-based violence alone can be associated with the loss of one primary grade of schooling, which translates to an annual cost of around US$17 billion to low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;RTI International. (2015). [http://www.ungei.org/resources/6089.htm What is the cost of school-related gender-based violence?] USAID.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the East Asia and Pacific region, it is estimated that the economic costs of just some of the health consequences of child maltreatment were equivalent to between 1.4% and 2.5% of the region's annual GDP.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Argentina, the forgone benefit to society from overall early school dropout is 11.4% of GDP, and in Egypt, nearly 7% of potential earnings is lost as a result of the number of children dropping out of school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A study has shown that each year Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria lose US$974 million, US$301 million and US$1,662 million respectively for failing to educate girls to the same standard as boys, and violence in school is one of the key factors contributing to the under-representation of girls in education.&lt;ref&gt;Plan (2008).

=== Bullies ===
Proactive aggression is a behavior that expects a reward.  With bullying each individual has a role to defend.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Some children act proactively but will show aggression to defend themselves if provoked.  These children will react aggressively but tend to never be the ones to attack first.

There have been two subtypes created in bully classification; popular aggressive and unpopular aggressive. Popular aggressive bullies are social and do not encounter a great deal of social stigma from their aggression. Unpopular aggressive bullies, however, are most often rejected by other students and use aggression to seek attention.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* In a recent national survey 3,708,284 students reported being a perpetrator of bullying in the U.S. school system.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* Studies have shown bullies actually report more success in making friends than other children.

In a survey by the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), students were asked to complete a questionnaire.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A total of 10.6% of the children replied that they had sometimes bullied other children, a response category defined as moderate bullying. An additional 8.8% said they had bullied others once a week or more, defined as frequent bullying. Similarly, 8.5% said they had been targets of moderate bullying, and 8.4% said they were bullied frequently. Out of all the students, 13% said they had engaged in moderate or frequent bullying of others, while 10.6% said they had been bullied either moderately or frequently. Some students — 6.3% — had both bullied others and been bullied themselves. In all, 29% of the students who responded to the survey had been involved in some aspect of bullying, either as a bully, as the target of bullying or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=NIH |title=Bullying Widespread in U.S. Schools, Survey Finds |work=NICHD Archive |date=26 June 2006 |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/pages/bullying.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tara Kuther, an associate professor of psychology at [[Western Connecticut State University]], "...bullying gets so much more sophisticated and subtle in high school. It's more [[relational aggression|relational]]. It becomes more difficult for teens to know when to intervene; whereas with younger kids, bullying is more physical and, therefore, more clear-cut."&lt;ref name="greatschools.org" /&gt;

== Types of bullying ==
There are four basic types of bullying: verbal, physical, psychological, and cyber. Cyberbullying is becoming one of the most common types. While victims can experience bullying at any age, it is witnessed most often in school-aged children.

Direct bullying is a relatively open attack on a victim that is physical and/or verbal in nature.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Weinstein Books |isbn=978-1-60286-184-8 |oclc=792879631 |last1=Hirsch |first1=Lee |last2=Lowen |first2=Cynthia |last3=Santorelli |first3=Dina |title=Bully: An action plan for teachers and parents to combat the bullying crisis |location=New York |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect bullying is more subtle and harder to detect, but involves one or more forms of relational aggression, including [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|social isolation]] via intentional exclusion, spreading rumors to defame one's character or reputation, making faces or obscene gestures behind someone's back, and manipulating friendships or other relationships.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

Pack bullying is bullying undertaken by a group. The 2009 Wesley Report on bullying found that pack bullying was more prominent in high schools and lasted longer than bullying undertaken by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About School Bullies and Bullying Behaviors |work=Bullying Statistics |url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/school-bullying.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical bullying is any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim. This is one of the most easily identifiable forms of bullying. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220222902/http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis | archive-date=20 February 2009 |url=http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis |title=So what is bullying? |work=Stop Bullying Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Boys Town Press |isbn=978-1-889322-67-4 |author1=Bolton, José |author2=Graeve, Stan |title=No room for bullies: from the classroom to cyberspace |location=Nebraska |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional ===
{{See also|Psychological abuse}}
Emotional bullying is any form of bullying that causes damage to a victim's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and/or [[emotional well-being]]. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Spreading malicious [[rumor]]s about people
* Getting certain people to "gang up" on others (this could also be considered physical bullying)
* Ignoring people on purpose (via the [[silent treatment]] or pretending the victim is non-existent)
* Provoking others
* Belittling, making fun of people, or saying hurtful things (which are also forms of verbal bullying)&lt;ref name=belittling&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=3021 |title=The Effects of Belittling |publisher=Counselling Connect |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verbal ===
{{See also|Verbal abuse}}
Verbal bullying is any slanderous statements or accusations that cause the victim undue emotional distress. Examples include:&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Directing foul language ([[profanity]]) at the target
* Using [[derogatory]] terms or deriding the person's name
* Commenting negatively on someone's looks, clothes, body, etc. ([[personal abuse]])

*Inappropriate sexual comments&lt;ref name="stopbullying.gov"/&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
Cyberbullying is the quickest growing form of harassment of school campuses in the U.S. and 40% of adolescent report being a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hvidston |first=David |date= |title=Cyberbullying: Implications for Principal Leadership |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0192636513504452 |journal=NASSP Bulletin |volume=97 |pages=297–313 |via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions of cyberbullying come from definitions of school bullying. Thus, this conduct is often described as an intentional aggressive behavior that takes place via new technologies, during which groups or individuals hurt classmates who cannot easily defend themselves. Cyberbullying events can occur via cellphones or computers, by means of text messages, e-mails, online social networks, chatrooms or blogs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2015-02-01 |title=Does cyberbullying overlap with school bullying when taking modality of involvement into account? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321400572X |journal=Computers in Human Behavior  |volume=43 |pages=49–57 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.049 |issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of the lack of parental or authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Like the bullying that occurs in school, the following four profiles have been identified: cyberneutral, cyberbully, cybervictim and cyberbully-victim.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Many who are bullied in school are likely to be bullied over the Internet and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;  Since students have become more reliant on internet, the advancement in social media and technology has altered the fear of in-person bullying away from schoolyards but has rather increase cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kowalski, R. M., Limber, S. &amp; Agatston, P.

Cyberbullying can happen 24 hours a day and seven days a week and reach a child even when they are alone.
Deleting inappropriate or harassing messages, texts or pictures is extremely difficult after being posted or sent.&lt;ref&gt;stopbullying.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
According to the website Stop Cyberbullying, "When schools try and get involved by disciplining the student for cyberbullying actions that took place off campus and outside of school hours, they are often sued for exceeding their authority and violating the student's free speech right." &lt;ref name="Stop Cyberbullying"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is cyberbullying, exactly? |url=http://stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |publisher=Stop cyberbullying |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest for schools to make revisions to their policies that would allow for disciplinary actions to take place even if off campus or after hours. They say if the act is likely to affect a student mentally or physically while in school then the revision of the policy would allow for the staff to intervene without violating the student's constitutional rights. Many principals are hesitant to act because school discipline codes and states laws do not define cyberbullying. According to professor Bernard James, "educators are empowered to maintain safe schools, the timidity of educators in this context of emerging technology is working in advantage of the bullies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/style/28bully.html |title=How Should Schools Handle Cyberbullying? |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |date=2010-06-27 |work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying has become extremely prevalent; 95% of teens who use [[social media]] reported having witnessed malicious behavior on social media from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boschert |first=Sherry |title=Cyberbullying triples suicide risk in teens |work=Pediatric News |url=http://www.pediatricnews.com/specialty-focus/mental-health/single-article-page/cyberbullying-triples-suicide-risk-in-teens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sites like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] offer no routine monitoring, children from a young age must learn proper internet behavior, say Abraham Foxman and Cyndi Silverman. "This is a call for parents and educators to teach these modern skills... through awareness and advocacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Networking Sites Can Be Forums for Cyberbullying |work=Opposing Viewpoints in Context |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Viewpoints&amp;jsid=338bbf8461b0eccf737c3bc28daee63f&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010744205&amp;u=plan_smcol&amp;zid=9df104e26321ef3abe1a4c867b490850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Scott Eidler, "Parents and educators need to make children aware at a young age of the life-changing effects cyberbullying can have on the victim. The next step for prevention is advocacy. For example, three high school students from [[Melville, New York]] organized a Bullying Awareness Walk, where several hundred people turned out to show their support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eidler |first=Scott |title=Anti-bullying walk held in North Hempstead |work=Newsday |accessdate=21 September 2013 |date=6 March 2013 |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/anti-bullying-walk-held-in-north-hempstead-1.5022005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clara Wajngurt writes, "Other than organizing events, calling for social media sites to take charge could make the difference between life and death. Cyberbullying is making it increasingly difficult to enforce any form of prevention."&lt;ref name="wajngurt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wajngurt |first=Clara |title=Anti-Bullying Policies in Higher Ed |url=http://www.niot.org/node/7125 |publisher=Not in Our Town |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna Wojcik concludes, "The rapid growth of social media is aiding the spread of cyberbullying, and prevention policies are struggling to keep up. In order for prevention policies to be put in place, the definition of cyberbullying must be stated, others must be educated on how to recognize and prevent bullying, and policies that have already attempted to be enacted need to be reviewed and learned from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojcik |first=Joanne |title=Cyber bullying cases test schools' legal reach |work=Business Insurance |date=4 March 2012 |url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20120304/NEWS05/303049991}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Charisse Nixon found that students do not reach out for help with cyberbullying for four main reasons: they do not feel connected to the adults around them; the students do not see the cyberbullying as an issue that is worth bringing forward; they do not feel the surrounding adults have the ability to properly deal with the cyberbullying; and the teenagers have increased feelings of shame and humiliation regarding the cyberbullying.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/AHMT.S36456 |volume=5 |pages=143–158 |last=Nixon |first=Charisse L |title=Current perspectives: the impact of cyberbullying on adolescent health |journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics |date=1 July 2014 |pmid=25177157 |pmc=4126576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon also found that when bystanders took action in helping end the cyberbullying in adolescents, the results were more positive than when the adolescents attempted to resolve the situation without outside help.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"/&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
Sexual bullying is "any bullying behavior, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls—although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or [[Cyber-bullying|through the use of technology]]."&lt;ref name="NSPCC02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025646/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' commissioned a questionnaire aimed at people aged 11 to 19 in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name="BBC01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=BBC [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 respondents, 28 had been forced to do something sexual, and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name="NSPCC01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying, and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.K. government figures show that in the 2007–2008 school year, there were 3,450 fixed-period exclusions and 120 expulsions from schools in England due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="DCSF01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included incidents such as [[groping]] and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children, 26,134 of whom spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of whom spoke specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025631/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.K. charity [[Beatbullying]] has claimed that as [[gang culture]] enters, children are being bullied into providing sexual favours in exchange for protection.&lt;ref name="BBC02"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title=Girls bullied for 'sex favours' |publisher=BBC |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this.&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt;

Sexting cases are also on the rise and have become a major source of bullying. The circulation of explicit photos of those involved either around school or the internet put the originators in a position to be scorned and bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyepat.org/sexting |title=Sexting |publisher=EyePAT |date= |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports of some cases in which the bullying has been so extensive that the victim has taken their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Katy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161112/Teenager-commits-suicide-sexting-nude-photo-boyfriend-life-misery.html |title=Teenager commits suicide after 'sexting' a nude photo to her boyfriend made her life a misery |work=Daily Mail |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education bullying ===
According to HealthDay News, 15 percent of college students claim to have been victims of bullying while at college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Michelle |title=The Truth About Bullying in College |url=http://www.hercampus.com/health/mental-health/truth-about-bullying-college |website=HerCampus.com |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article, "Bullying not a thing of the past for college students," Kaitlyn Krasselt writes, "Bullying comes in all forms but is usually thought of as a K-12 issue that ceases to exist once students head off to college."&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krasselt |first1=Kaitlyn |title=Bullying not a thing of the past for college students |url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/21/bullying-not-a-thing-of-the-past-for-college-students/ |website=usatoday.com |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The misconception that bullying does not occur in higher education began to receive attention after the death of college student [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]]. According to an experiment conducted by Dr. Gary R. Walz,  "21.47% of participants reported rarely being victims of cyberbullying; 93.29% reported rarely cyberbullying others. Overall, there was a low prevalence rate for cyberbullying."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walz |first=Garry |date=2016 |title=Cyberbullying on Social Media Among College Students |url=https://www.counseling.org/docs/default-source/vistas/article_03b0bf24f16116603abcacff0000bee5e7.pdf?sfvrsn=4 |journal=Vistas Online |volume= |pages=8 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power imbalance ==
Bullying is usually associated with an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Doug |date= |title=The Gentle Neoliberalism of Modern Anti-bullying Texts: Surveillance, Intervention, and Bystanders in Contemporary Bullying Discourse |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9 |journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=356 |via= |doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bully has a perceived authority over another due to factors such as size, gender, or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sylvester, Ruth |title=Teacher as Bully: Knowingly or Unintentionally Harming Students |journal=Morality in Education |year=2011 |pages=42–45 |volume=77 |issue=2 |url=http://www.deltakappagamma.org/NH/dkgbulletinwinter2011.PDF#page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys tend to bully peers based on the peer's physical weakness, short temper, friend group, and clothing.

== Locations ==
Bullying locations vary by context. Most bullying in elementary school happens in the playground. In middle school and high school, it occurs most in the hallways, which have little supervision. According to the [[US Department of Education|U.S Department of Education]]'s [[National Center for Education Statistics]], more than 47% of kids reported getting bullied in hallways and stairway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.jrn.msu.edu/bullying/2012/02/16/bullying-locations/ |title=Hallways, stairwells are bullying hot spots |work=The New Bullying | access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus stops and bus rides to and from school tend to be hostile environments as well; children tend to view the driver as someone with no disciplinary authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepyourchildsafe.org/bullying/where-bullying-occurs.html |title=The places where bullying occurs; where bullying takes place |website=Child Safety and Abuse Prevention Programs| access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying may also follows people into adult life and university. Bullying can take over the lives of both lecturers and students, and can lead to supervisors putting pressure on students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Norman, O'Higgins |first=Jmes |year=2016 |title=2.

== Warning signs ==
Victims of bullying typically are physically smaller, more sensitive, unhappy, cautious, anxious, quiet, and withdrawn. They are often described as [[passivity (behavior)|passive]] or submissive. Possessing these qualities make these individuals vulnerable, as they are seen as being less likely to retaliate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

* '''Bully''': student with social and/or physical power who repeatedly picks on another student or group of students with the intent to inflict harm or discomfort
* '''Victim''': the target of the bullying
* '''Bystander''': student who observes bullying; they may ignore it, encourage it, or defend the victim
* '''Student who assists''': does not start the bullying, but helps and is encouraged by surrounding peers to do so. They may feel that their social status will be damaged if they are not involved.
* '''Student who reinforces''': play a minor role in bullying, such as laughing at the bully's insults
* '''Outsider''': not involved in the bullying but witnesses it
* '''Defendant''': defends the victim or consoles them afterwards

In her book, ''[[The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander]]'', Barbara Coloroso divides bullies into several types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Collins Living [HarperResource] |isbn=978-0-06-174460-0 |last=Coloroso |first=Barbara |title=The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool To High School – How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle of Violence |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=11–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''confident bully''' has a very high opinion of themselves and feels a sense of superiority over other students.
*The '''social bully''' uses rumors, gossip, and verbal taunts to insult others. Social bullies are typically female and possess low self-esteem, and therefore try to bring others down.
*The '''fully armored bully''' shows very little emotion and often bullies when no one will see or stop them.
*The '''hyperactive bully''' typically has problems with academics and social skills. This student will often bully someone, then place the blame on someone else.

In 2016, a legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied at his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the [[Ottawa-Carleton District School Board]], making this the first case in North America where a [[school board]] has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "[[duty of care]]" that the school board owes to its students).

There have been 82 recorded '''Shark attacks in South Australia''' since the establishment of the colony in 1836. 20 of those have involved a single fatality. Victims were involved in a range of aquatic activities, including surfing, diving, spear-fishing, snorkeling, boating and swimming. Six of the fatalities occurred off the coast of greater metropolitan Adelaide, with the remainder distributed across South Australia's extensive coastline. Many of the fatal attacks have been attributed to [[Great white sharks]]

A '''standing cell''' is  a special cell constructed so as to prevent the prisoner from doing anything but stand.  The ''Stehbunker'' was used in [[Nazi concentration camps]] during the [[Third Reich]], as a punishment.&lt;ref name="LaqueurBaumel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Laqueur|author2=Judith Tydor Baumel|title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPbr0XzlTzcC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=30 June 2012|date=29 March 2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08432-0|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing cells (called [[Kishka (prison cell)|kishkas]]) were also used during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purges|purges in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Conquest2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Conquest|title=The Great Terror: A Reassessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXQSk2qfXMC&amp;pg=PA278|accessdate=1 July 2012|date=15 November 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531699-5|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some standing cells were large enough for only one person, others held as many as four people. Punishment in standing cells was ordered for asking for two portions of soup, picking apples, or accidental breakages.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
The [[Armenians|Armenian]] hosiery-manufacturer and musician Samuel Hovannes Zorian was arrested in 1895 by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities for being a political activist. He was beaten and incarcerated in a so-called "police room", measuring barely two feet square in size and with no windows. On the second day, he was dragged out and beaten almost senseless with sticks. Zorian was then sent back to the "police room" where he was confined for a further week and was only sustained on a diet of bread and water, with no medical attention given to him during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIHG4mld7oMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22merchants+in+exile%22+%22shaken+and+bleeding%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1EpkOH5ykm&amp;sig=uBeP1loE_7Th-gMYcgzZJ9r5Kto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib1rySiJzOAhXHBsAKHfqOAn0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22merchants%20in%20exile%22%20%22shaken%20and%20bleeding%22&amp;f=false |title=Merchants in Exile: The Armenians in Manchester, England, 1835{{ndash}}1935 |page=98 |first=Joan |last=George |publisher=Taderon Press |isbn=978-1903656082 |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oranienburg ==
[[Sturmabteilung|SA]] camp kommandant [[Werner Schäfer]] had two cells built in the basement of the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]] in 1933. The dimensions of the cell were such that a person could only stand. A prisoner surnamed Neumann was held there for 192 hours and was allegedly driven mad as a result of his confinement. At times, prisoners were held in small coffin-sized closets in which they could only stand.

== Dachau ==
The number of prisoners in [[Dachau concentration camp]] increased dramatically in the last years of the [[Second World War]]. The concentration camp was overcrowded. In late 1944, the camp command erected standing cells. The stone chambers were similar to chimneys and measured 75 x 80 cm (29.5 x 31.5 inches).&lt;ref group=note&gt; The surfaces were measured after camps had been liberated, using foundation ruins.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a small hatch on top for air, and a narrow door with an iron bar bolted to the cell. The intensified punitive measure saved room and reinforced the punitive agony. There were also standing cells at the [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach subcamp]], where the cells were smaller than at Dachau. Some at other camps were bigger, about 90 x 90 cm (35.5 x 35.5 inches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/glossary/en/Stehbunker Glossary entry for ''Stehbunker''] Wollheim Memorial, official website. Retrieved June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the prisoner K. A. Gross and the [[Poland|Polish]] prisoner Max Hoffmann spent days in the standing cell. Hoffmann described it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a terrible state, as I thought that it was over for me, everything was so callous and distant for me. I couldn't lie down, couldn't crouch, the best was to stand, stand, six days and six nights long. [...] You touch the walls on both sides with your elbows, your back touches the wall behind you, your knees the wall in front of you. [...] This is no punishment or pre-trial detention, it is [[torture]], straight forward, Middle Ages torture. I had bloodshot eyes, numb from bad air, I was just waiting for the end.&lt;ref&gt; Karel Kasak, ''Cesi v koncentracnim tabore Dachau.'' in ''Almanch Dachau. Kytice udalosti a vzpominek'', Prague, 1946. Cited in Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Johannes Neuhäusler]], an inmate in the standing cell received a single piece of bread in three days.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Neuhäusler refers here to two clergymen, Theissig from Aachen, and Johann Lenz.&lt;/ref&gt; On the fourth day, the prisoner was removed from the standing cell, given a normal camp meal ration and allowed to sleep on a wooden cot. On the next day, the three-day confinement in the standing cell began anew.

The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] did not always adhere to the interruption after the third day. A Czech prisoner, Radovan Drazan, spent eight days without a break in a standing cell.&lt;ref&gt;Zuzana Mosnáková, [http://www.hagalil.com/czech/dachau/dachau-4.htm "Tschechische Häftlinge im Konzentrationslager Dachau"] German Jewish website.

== Auschwitz ==
There were four standing cells at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in the basement of [[Block 11]], which measured about one yard square, and in which four persons were crammed, able only to stand. There was only a 2" opening for air, so that prisoners wouldn't suffocate.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leni Yahil|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA374|accessdate=30 June 2012|date=17 October 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504523-9|pages=373–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in these cells was usually imposed for a period of 10 days.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"/&gt;  Auschwitz survivor Josef Kral testified at the [[Auschwitz Trials]] about the standing cells where he had been held for six weeks with three meals during that time, and about how one prisoner was so hungry, he ate his shoes.&lt;ref name="Wittmann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Wittmann|title=Beyond Justice: The Auschwitz Trial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q7JRhA9ACUC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01694-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyvx-Gzb6kM Audio clip of Kral testimony (excerpt) with photos and prisoner drawings] Youtube video.

==Stalin's Soviet Union==
According to [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov]], standing cells were used as part of the [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]] of the 1930s. After two days in a standing cell, a Secretary of the [[Tatar]] Provincial Committee was removed in an unconscious state.&lt;ref name="Conquest2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5933">'''Tenaya''' (died 1853) was a leader of the [[Ahwahnechee people]] in [[Yosemite Valley]], [[California]].

==Background==
Tenaya's father was a leader of the [[Ahwahnechee people]] (or Awahnichi).&lt;ref name=h18&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abovecalifornia.com/lib/Houghton/18.php|title=Discovery of Yosemite, Chapter XVIII|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ahwahneechee had become a tribe distinct from the other tribes in the area. [[Lafayette Bunnell]], the doctor of the Mariposa Battalion, wrote that "Ten-ie-ya was recognized, by the [[Mono tribe]], as one of their number, as he was born and lived among them until his ambition made him a leader and founder of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] colony in Ah-wah-ne."&lt;ref name=h18 /&gt;

The Ahwahneechee occupied Yosemite Valley until a sickness destroyed most of them.
The few Ahwahneechee left [[Yosemite]] Valley and joined the [[Mono Lake Paiutes]] in the eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Tenaya's father married a Mono Paiute woman and Tenaya was born from that union. Tenaya grew up amongst his mother's people.

==Leadership==
An Ahwahneechee medicine man and friend of his Father persuaded a young Tenaya to return.  Tenaya took the few remnants of the Ah-wah-nee-chees that had been living with the Monos and Paiutes and reestablished themselves in Yosemite Valley with him as their leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/discovery_of_the_yosemite/05.html|title=Discovery of the Yosemite, Chapter V, by Lafayette H. Bunnell|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yosemite.ca.us|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenaya had four wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/discovery_of_the_yosemite/06.html|title=Discovery of the Yosemite, Chapter VI, by Lafayette H. Bunnell|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yosemite.ca.us|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahwahneechee were a powerful tribe feared by the surrounding [[Miwok]] tribes.
The surrounding tribes called them ''Yosemite'' meaning "they are killers."&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/history/origin_of_word_yosemite.html|title=Origin of the word Yosemite|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the name is a corruption of the word "Uzumati" meaning "grizzly bear" which was the totem of the larger of the two main social subdivisions of the band.&lt;ref&gt;''Yosemite Indians'' by Elizabeth Godfrey&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1851, conflicts between the non-indigenous miners and the Native Americans in the Sierra started to increase. The state of [[California]] decided to send the Natives to [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s. The [[Mariposa Battalion]] was formed to carry out the relocation.  Tenaya agreed to move to the [[Fresno Reservation]], instead of the destruction of his entire band. Many of his band left Yosemite Valley instead of following Tenaya. As they approached the Fresno reservation, they fled back to the Yosemite Valley. The Brigade then re-entered the Valley, captured Tenaya's sons, and killed his youngest son. Tenaya then agreed to go back to the reservation.

==Death==
By the summer of 1851, Tenaya grew tired of the reservation. He gave his pledge that he would not disturb any non-indigenous people. However, in 1852, a group of [[Prospecting|prospector]]s were killed in the Valley. Tenaya and his band fled to join the Mono Paiutes. He returned to the Valley in 1853. He was [[stoned to death]] in a dispute with the Mono Paiutes over stolen horses. The remaining survivors who were not killed were taken back to Mono Lake and absorbed into the Mono Lake Paiute population.

Another version of the story says that in the spring of 1852, a party of eight prospectors entered the Valley. One of the prospectors had lured his comrades there to kill them and take possession of a mine they held in partnership. He had incited the Yosemites to kill the intruders, arranging his escape and letting the blame fall on them.  Late in the summer of 1853, Tenaya and some of the men of his band were playing a hand bone game with some Mono Indians. The gambling became tense and a fight broke out which ended with Tenaya being struck in the head with a rock crushing his skull along with several others of his band killed as well. As was their custom, they were cremated and wailing was heard for two weeks. After the death of their leader, the few remaining members dispersed  between Mono Lake and to the near west.

==Legacy==
[[Tenaya Lake]] was named after Tenaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/thedirt/article/Roots-of-native-names-2712675.php | title=Roots of native names | work=SFGate | date=December 7, 2002 | accessdate=27 March 2018 | author=Sullivan, Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenaya Middle Schools in [[Fresno, California]] and [[Merced, California]] are named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28561">Due to the convenience, affordability, and broad reach of [[social media]] platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], [[terrorist]] groups have increasingly used social media to further their goals and spread their message. Attempts have been made by various governments and agencies to thwart the use of social media by terrorist organizations.

==Traditional media==

Many authors have proposed that media attention increases perceptions of risk of fear of terrorism and crime and relates to how much attention the person pays to the news.&lt;ref&gt;Nellis and Savage (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between terrorism and the media has long been noted.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Paul|title=The media and terrorism:  a reassessment|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|year=1997|volume=9|issue=2|pages=51–64|doi=10.1080/09546559708427402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist organizations depend on the open media systems of democratic countries to further their message and goals.In order to garner publicity towards their cause, terrorist organizations resort to acts of violence and aggression that deliberately target civilians.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; This method has proven to be effective in gathering attention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be denied that although terrorism has proved remarkably ineffective as the major weapon for taking down governments and capturing political power, it has been a remarkably successful means of publicizing a political cause and relaying the terrorist threat to a wider audience, particularly in the open and pluralistic countries of the West. When one says 'terrorism' in a democratic society, one also says 'media'.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While a media organization may not support the goals of terrorist organizations, it is their job to report current events and issues. In the fiercely competitive media environment, when a terrorist attack occurs, media outlets scramble to cover the event. In doing so the media help to further the message of terrorist organizations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To summarise briefly on the symbiotic nature of the relationship between terrorists and the media, the recent history of terrorism in many democratic countries vividly demonstrates that terrorists do thrive on the oxygen of publicity, and it is foolish to deny this. This does not mean that the established democratic media share the values of the terrorists. It does demonstrate, however, that the free media in an open society are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation by ruthless terrorist organisations.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One notable example of the  relationship between terror groups and the media was the release of the [[Osama bin Laden tapes|Osama bin Laden audio and video recordings]].  These tapes were sent directly to mainstream Arabic television networks including [[Al-Jazeera]].

Media can often be the source of discontent for terrorist groups. [[Irene Khan|Irene Kahn]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;New seeds of social discord and insecurity are sprouting between citizens and noncitizens. Racism and xenophobia are latent in all societies, but in some European countries they feature blatantly as some politicians exploit people's fears and prejudices for short-term electoral gains. Some aspects of the media have played into this strategy, dehumanizing and demonizing foreigners, foreign-born citizens, refugees, and asylum seekers. They are pointed out as a source of danger and become an easy target for hate speech and violence. Those who need their rights protected the most have become the ones most at risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, I. (2013). A Human Rights Agenda for Global Security. In CAHILL K. (Ed.), ''History and Hope: The International Humanitarian Reader'' (pp. 112-122). Fordham University Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c1d.15&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most terrorist groups use social media as a means to bypass the traditional media and spread their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1157402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media surveillance==

[[Michel Foucault]]'s theory of surveillance, [[panopticism]], describes a networks of power, where all parties are transfixed by the actions of the others in the network. This model can be transposed on the network of power that media-outlet consumers and producers enter. In a network of power that includes consumers and producers, both parties have fixed gazes' on each other. The consumers transfix their gazes' on the stories that media outlets produce. And, the needs of the consumers, which is in this case their need to be updated regularly, becomes the producers gaze. The producers or media outlets are in competition with other media outlets to supply their constituents with the most up-to-date information. This network of fixed gazes' is both "privileged and imperative" for the system to satisfy the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmelzer|first=Mary|title=Panopticism in the Postmodern Pedagogy|year=1993|publisher=University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This network is especially imperative when major events in the world occur, which is usually the case with terrorism. Consumers looks to media outlets to provide news on terrorism. If consumers believe terrorism is a threat to their safety, they want to be informed of the threats against them. Media outlets fulfill their viewers' needs, and portray terrorism as a threat because of the cycle that surveillance engenders. As terrorism flourishes as a prominent discourse of fear, consumers want information faster because they feel their safe being is in peril. The idea of total surveillance, as prescribed by Foucault, becomes a cycle where the disruption of power causes scrutiny by various players in system. If the media-outlets are not constantly looking for stories that fulfill consumer needs, then they are scrutinized. In addition to the surveillance aspect of news dissemination, therein is the notion that "needs" drive the network of power: both the media outlets and consumers have needs that are fulfilled by broadcasting the news. It is this idea expressed in the uses and gratifications theory. It stipulates that the active audience and the terrorist "seek to satisfy their various needs" through media transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=B.|title=Inside Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While media outlets know the stories they show have astounding effects on the political and sociological perspective in society, the impetus on economic gains is of greater importance.

==Use of social media==
In a study by [[Gabriel Weimann]] from the [[University of Haifa]], Weimann found that nearly 90% of organized terrorism on the internet takes place via social media.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|last=CBC|title=Terrorist groups recruiting through social media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/01/10/tech-terrorist-social-media.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weimann, terror groups use social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and internet forums to spread their messages, recruit members and gather intelligence.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Terror groups take to social media because social media tools are cheap and accessible, facilitate quick, broad dissemination of messages, and allow for unfettered communication with an audience without the filter or "selectivity" of mainstream news outlets.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dark|first=Calvin|title=Social Media and Social Menacing…|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/12/20/social-media-and-social-menacing/|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy Association|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, social media platforms allow terror groups to engage with their networks. Whereas previously terror groups would release messages via intermediaries, social media platforms allow terror groups to release messages directly to their intended audience and converse with their audience in real time:&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Oremus|first=Will|title=Twitter of Terror|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/al_shabaab_twitter_a_somali_militant_group_unveils_a_new_social_media_strategy_for_terrorists_.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Slate Magazine|date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weimann also mentions in "Theater of Terror", that terrorists use the media to promote the theatrical like nature of the premeditated terror.

&lt;blockquote&gt;HSMPress is using Twitter the way social media experts have always advised- not just broadcasting, but engaging in conversation. Spend some time following the account, and you realize that you're dealing with a real human being with real ideas—albeit boastful, hypocritical, violent ideas.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Terror groups using social media===

[[Al-Qaeda]] has been noted as being one of the terror groups that uses social media the most extensively.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-jihadist-use-social-media-how-prevent-terrorism-and-preserve-innovation|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the [[Rand Corporation]], commented on Al-Qaeda's dominant presence on the web:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While almost all terrorist organizations have websites, al Qaeda is the first to fully exploit the internet. This reflects al Qaeda's unique characteristics.  It regards itself as a global movement and therefore depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived constituents. It sees its mission as not simply creating terror among its foes but awakening the Muslim community. Its leaders view communications as 90 percent of the struggle. Despite the risks imposed by intense manhunts, its leaders communicate regularly with video and audio messages, which are posted on its websites and disseminated on the Internet. The number of websites devoted to the al Qaeda-inspired movement has grown from a handful to reportedly thousands, although many of these are ephemeral.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Isis-viceo 2941899c.jpg|thumb|Islamic State Propaganda Video]]
Known terrorist group the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], also translated to [[ISIS]], uses the widespread of news over social media to their advantage when releasing threatening videos of beheadings. As of November 16, 2014, following the beheading of former [[U.S. Army Ranger]] [[Peter Kassig]], there have now been five recorded executions of Westerners taken captive in Syria.&lt;ref name="markthompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3589350/peter-kassigs-powerful-silence-before-isis-beheaded-him/|title=Peter Kassig Bravely Said Nothing Before His Execution|author=Mark Thompson|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], [[David Cawthorne Haines]], [[Alan Henning]], and [[Steven Sotloff]] are also among the men kidnapped and executed by ISIS. The videos of the brutal beheadings are both posted online by ISIS, where they can be viewed by anyone using their own discretion, and sent to government officials as threats. Posting the executions online allows the terrorist groups the power to manipulate and cause havoc among the population viewing them,&lt;ref&gt;http://numun.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BOP-Syria-Committee-Dossier.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the videos have the ability to instill fear within the Western world. The videos are typically high production quality and generally show the entirety of the gruesome act, with the hostage speaking a few words before they are killed on camera.

In the case of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig, his video did not show the actual beheading act and he did not speak any final words before the execution.&lt;ref name="markthompson"/&gt; His silence and the fact that the actual execution was not included in the video raised question about his video was different than the rest.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;http://time.com/3587620/isis-us-aid-worker-peter-kassig/?xid=time_readnext&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kassig's beheading, his family expressed their wish that news media avoid doing what the group wants by refraining from publishing or distributing the video.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; By refusing to circulate the video of the beheading, it therefore loses the ability to manipulate Americans or further the cause of the terrorist group.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;
   
The [[Taliban]] has been active on Twitter since May 2011, and has more than 7,000 followers. Tweeting under the handle @alemarahweb, the Taliban tweets frequently, on some days nearly hourly. This account is currently suspended.&lt;ref name=taliban&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of the Taliban|url=https://twitter.com/alemarahweb|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In December 2011, it was discovered that the [[Somalia]]-based terror cell [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] was using a Twitter account under the name @HSMPress.&lt;ref name=shabab&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of Al-Shabab|url=https://twitter.com/HSMPress|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening on December 7, 2011, the account has amassed tens of thousands of followers and tweets frequently.&lt;ref name=shabab/&gt;

Shortly after a series of coordinated [[Christmas]] bombings in [[Kono, Nigeria|Kono]], [[Nigeria]], in 2011, the Nigerian-based terror group Boko Haram released a video statement defending their actions to YouTube.&lt;ref name="Boko Haram"&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC|title=Boko Haram: Nigerian Islamist leader defends attacks|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16510929|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AQAP and Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/DAESH)'''

[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] has emerged as one of the most potent users of social media. In many respects, Islamic State learned their propaganda craft from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). However, IS quickly eclipsed its mentor, deploying a whole range of narratives, images and political proselytizing through various social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jeff Lewis (2015/6) Media, Culture and Human Violence, Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Berger and Morgan estimated that at least 46,000 Twitter accounts were used by ISIS supporters between September and December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/03/isis-twitter-census-berger-morgan|title=Defining and describing the population of ISIS supporters on Twitter|last=Berger, Morgan|date=2015-03-05|website=The Brookings Institution|language=en|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as ISIS supporters regularly get suspended and then easily create new, duplicate accounts,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; counting ISIS Twitter accounts over a few months can overestimate the number of unique people represented by 20–30%.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

However, as the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, IS also uses old-fashioned methods of communication and propaganda. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent the sort of 'propaganda in action' which was a method developed by the 19th century [[anarchists]] in Europe. The November 2015 IS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to-face and used other non-digital means of communication.

==Attempts to thwart the use of social media by terror groups==
Some U.S. government officials have urged social media companies to stop hosting content from terror groups.  In particular, [[Joe Lieberman]] has been especially vocal in demanding that social media companies not permit terror groups to use their tools.&lt;ref name=Liberman&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Lieberman, Would-Be Censor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/opinion/25sun1.html?_r=2|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lieberman and the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] issued a report titled "Violent Islamist Extremism, the Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat". The report stated that the internet is one of the "primary drivers" of the terrorist threat to the United States.&lt;ref name=Liberman/&gt;
  
In response to the news that Al-Shabab was using Twitter, U.S. officials have called for the company to shut down the account. Twitter executives have not complied with these demands and have declined to comment on the case.&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Uri|title=U.S. officials may take action again al-Shabab's Twitter account|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/12/20/us_officials_may_take_action_again_al_shababs_twitter_account|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Twitter announced changes to their censorship policy, stating that they would now be censoring tweets in certain countries when the tweets risked breaking the local laws of that country.&lt;ref name=twitter&gt;{{cite web|title=Tweets still must flow|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/tweets-still-must-flow.html|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind the move was stated on their website as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries' limits was to remove content globally. Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country — while keeping it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why.&lt;ref name=twitter/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The move drew criticism from many Twitter users who said the move was an affront to free speech.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|last=El Akkad|first=Omar|title=Why Twitter's censorship plan is better than you think|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/digital-culture/social-networking/why-twitters-censorship-plan-is-better-than-you-think/article2320773/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the users threatened to quit tweeting if the policy was not rescinded, including Chinese artist and activist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

In December 2010, in response to growing demands that YouTube pull video content from terrorist groups from its servers, the company added a "promotes terrorism" option under the "violent or repulsive content" category that viewers can select to "flag" offensive content.&lt;ref name=Huffpo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanalley|first=Craig|title=YouTube Gives Users Ability To Flag Content That Promotes Terrorism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/13/youtube-terrorism-flag_n_796128.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting the terrorists access to conventional mass media and censoring news coverage of terrorist acts and their perpertrators and also minimising the terrorists allowance to manipulate mass media, the mass fear impact that is usually created will decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann,1999&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Effectiveness of suspension ===
Western governments have been actively trying to surveil and censor IS social media sites. As [[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] explains, as quickly as platform managers close down accounts, IS and its supporters continually create new IDs which they then use to resurge back with new accounts and sites for propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A case study of an al Shabaab account&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ISIS: The state of terror.|last=Stern, Berger|first=|publisher=William Collins|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[George Washington University]] [[white paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger, Perez|first=|date=2016|title=Occasional Paper The Islamic State's Diminishing Returns on Twitter How suspensions are limiting the social networks of English-speaking ISIS supporters.|url=https://cchs.gwu.edu/sites/cchs.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Berger_Occasional%20Paper.pdf|journal=GW Program on Extremism|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that accounts that resurged did not regain the high number of followers they had had originally. However this picture is complicated as a May 2016 article in the Journal of Terrorism Research found that resurgent accounts acquire an average ([[median]]) of 43.8 followers per day, while regular jihadist accounts accrue only 8.37 followers on average per day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Shaun|last2=Denney|first2=David|last3=Pinkerton|first3=Alasdair|last4=Jansen|first4=Vincent A.A.|last5=Bryden|first5=John|date=2016-05-17|title=Resurgent Insurgents: Quantitative Research Into Jihadists Who Get Suspended but Return on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1213|journal=Journal of Terrorism Research|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.15664/jtr.1213|issn=2049-7040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free speech and terrorism ===
U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, has said that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to terrorists and that they have given up their rights to free speech. He cited a Supreme Court ruling that anyone providing "material support" to a terrorist organization is guilty of a crime, even if that support only involves speaking and association. He also cited terrorist speech as being like child pornography in that it does harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISIS getting social media megaphone (Opinion) - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/25/opinion/poe-terrorism-social-media/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeland security subcommittee==
On December 6, 2011 the US Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence held a hearing entitled "Jihadist Use of Social Media - How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation."

At the hearing, members heard testimony from [[William McCants]], an analyst for the Center for Naval Analyses, Aaron Weisburd, director of the [[Society for Internet Research]], Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the Rand Corporation and Evan Kohlmann, senior partner from [[Flashpoint Global Partners]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;
  
McCants stated that while terror groups were actively using social media platforms to further their goals, research did not support the notion that the social media strategies they adopted were proving effective:&lt;ref name=McCants&gt;{{cite web|last=McCants|first=William|title=McCants Testimony|url=https://homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20McCants.pdf|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are talking about a relatively small number of people.  Because the number of people is so small, it is difficult to say why some become active supporters of al-Qaeda and others do not. What we can say is that the vast majority of people who watch and read al-Qaeda propaganda will never act violently because of it.  Put metaphorically, the material may be incendiary but nearly everyone is fireproof.  Since that is the case, it is better to spend our resources putting out the fires and issuing warnings about the dangers of fire rather than trying to fireproof everyone or remove incendiary material.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
McCants added that he did not believe that closing online user accounts would  be effective in stopping radicalization and stated that closing online accounts could even disadvantage US security and intelligence forces:&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not put much stock in closing online user accounts that do not violate our laws.  I also do not put much stock in intervening with well-meaning outreach programs or removing propaganda.  There are too many downsides to these approaches.  They are also unnecessary.  The FBI and local law enforcement in the United States have done an excellent job in finding al-Qaeda supporters online and arresting them before they hurt anyone.  They have gotten very good at following the smoke trails and putting out fires.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCants stressed that not enough research has been conducted on this topic and he would be willing to change his opinion on the matter if there was empirical evidence that proved that social media has a major role in radicalizing youth.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;

Weisburd stated that any organization that played a part in producing and distributing media for terrorist organizations were in fact supporting terrorism:&lt;ref name=Weisburd&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisburd|first=Aaron|title=How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Weisburd%20testimony.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would argue that a service provider who knowingly assists in the distribution of terrorist media is also culpable.  While it is in no one's interest to prosecute internet service providers, they must be made to realize that they can neither turn a blind eye to the use of their services by terrorist organizations, nor can they continue to put the onus of identifying and removing terrorist media on private citizens.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Weisburd argued that social media lends an air of legitimacy to content produced by terror organizations and provides terrorist organizations an opportunity to brand their content: "Branding in terrorist media is a sign of authenticity, and terrorist media is readily identifiable as such due to the presence of trademarks known to be associated with particular organizations."&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt; He concluded that the goal of intelligence and security forces should not be to drive all terrorist media offline, but rather to deprive terror groups from the branding power gleaned from social media.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;  
 
Jenkins stated that the risks associated with al Qaeda's online campaign do not justify an attempt to impose controls on content distributors.  Any attempted controls would be costly and would deprive the intelligence officials of a valuable source of information.&lt;ref name="Jenkinstwo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Jenkins%20.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins also stated that there was no evidence that attempts to control online content would be possible:&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even China, which has devoted immense resources to controlling social media networks with far fewer concerns about freedom of speech, has been unable to block the micro blogs that flourish on the web.  Faced with the shutdown of one site, jihadist communicators merely change names and move to another, dragging authorities into a frustrating game of Whac-a-mole and depriving them of intelligence while they look for the new site.  Is this, then the best way to address the problem?"&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Kohlmann stated US government officials must do more to pressure social media groups like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to remove content produced by terror groups:&lt;ref name=Kohlmann&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohlmann|first=Evan|title=The Antisocial Network: Countering the Use of Online Social Networking Technologies by Foreign Terrorist Organizations|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Kohlmann%5B1%5D.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, current U.S. law gives few incentives for companies like YouTube for volunteering information on illicit activity, or even cooperating when requested by U.S. law enforcement. If such companies are to be trusted to self-police their own professed commitments to fighting hate speech, then they must be held to a public standard which reflects the importance of that not unsubstantial responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kohlmann/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps''''' by [[Marshall Savage|Marshall T. Savage]] is a book (published in 1992 and reprinted in 1994 with an introduction by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]) in the field of [[Exploratory engineering]] that gives a series of concrete stages the author believes will lead to interstellar colonization. Many specific scientific and engineering details are presented, as are numerous issues involved in [[Space colonization]].

==The book's thesis==
Savage takes a [[Malthusian]] view of the [[exponential growth]] of human [[population]] and life in general, and also recommends the exponential growth of [[blue-green algae]] for [[sustenance]]. He states that it is humanity's [[manifest destiny]] to colonize every star in the galaxy. He draws heavily on the [[Fermi paradox]] (briefly stated as, "If there is intelligent life in space, why haven't we found it yet?") to support his position that it is humanity's burden alone to ignite the universe with the "spark of Life."
In ''The Millennial Project'', he calls for the creation of an international [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] to realize these goals. Originally known as the ''First Millennial Foundation'' (founded by Savage in 1987), the organization changed its name to the Living Universe Foundation.

==The steps of the project==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LUF Logo.jpg|right|thumb|The Living Universe Foundation logo]] --&gt;
The "Eight Easy Steps" proposed by Savage are as follows:
# Foundation{{spaced ndash}}Constitute an organization convened to realize these destinies
# Aquarius{{spaced ndash}}[[Arcology|Arcologies]] built in the tropical [[oceans]] as a first step to learning how to build ("grow"&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Marshall T., The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, 2nd edition, 1994, p 73&lt;/ref&gt;) colonies in space using a method not unlike that used by living [[coral]]s&lt;ref&gt;Hilbertz, W. H, et al., "Electrodeposition of Minerals in Sea Water:  Experiments and Applications", ''IEEE, Journal of Oceanic Engineering'', Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 94-113, July 1979&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Wolf Hilbertz|Prof. Wolf Hartmut Hilbertz]] and applying his concept of Cybertecture.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbertz, W. H, "Toward Cybertecture",''Progressive Architecture'', May 1970&lt;/ref&gt; They also would generate income to fund later steps.
# [[Bifrost]]{{spaced ndash}}First step in actually getting off the [[Earth]] using ground-based [[Free-electron laser|free-electron-laser]]-powered [[Beam-powered propulsion|laser-propelled]] [[Waverider]]. [[Leik Myrabo]], an aerospace engineering professor at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], demonstrated the feasibility of using ground-based lasers to propel objects into orbit in 1988.
# Asgard{{spaced ndash}}Build a [[space station]] in [[geosynchronous orbit]].
# [[Avalon]]{{spaced ndash}}Build colonies on the [[Moon]] by doming over the [[Impact crater|crater]]s and creating miniature ecologies.
# [[Elysium]]{{spaced ndash}}Start [[terraforming]] [[Mars]] to "create a living planet to sustain us" connected with Earth through [[Buzz Aldrin]]'s proposed Mars Transit System,&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin, Buzz, "The Mars Transit System", Air &amp; Space, Oct/Nov 1990, pp40-47&lt;/ref&gt; an example of [[Mars cycler|Earth-Mars cycler]].
# Solaria{{spaced ndash}}Mine asteroids to create asteroid colonies and Asgard-like stations throughout the Solar System to create a [[Dyson sphere|Dyson cloud]].
# Galactia{{spaced ndash}}Colonize beyond the Solar System, expand throughout the [[galaxy]] heading to a level 3 on the [[Kardashev scale]], a method of measuring a civilization's level of energy production and consumption
In the early stages of the Project, Savage recommends [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] algae as a primary foodstuff, supplemented by seafood [[mariculture]] from the cities of the Aquarius phase.

The Living Universe Foundation, previously known as the First Millennial Foundation, is an [[organization]] that supports [[Ocean colonization|ocean]] and [[space colonization]] more or less based upon the book ''The Millennial Project''. Space Environments Ecovillage in Bastrop, Texas, is one of the few LUF projects that have materialized so far.

==Criticisms==
The book has drawn some criticism in that while it is replete with details concerning [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|OTEC]] construction and [[space colonization]], it touches very little on the subject of how [[government]]s and societies will need to change to enact the Project. Defenders and the author himself&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Marshall T., The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, 2nd edition, 1994, p 363&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that one man writing one book cannot be expected to write out the entire course of human development over the next millennium, and that others more suited to the field of [[social psychology]] will be needed for the Project's completion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{Influenza virus life cycle}}
'''Viral replication''' is the formation of biological [[virus]]es during the infection process in the target host cells.  Viruses must first get into the cell before viral replication can occur.  Through the generation of abundant copies of its [[genome]] and packaging these copies, the virus continues infecting new hosts.  Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them. Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts RJ, "Fish pathology, 3rd Edition", Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viral Production / Replication==
Viruses multiply only in living cells. The [[Host (biology)|host]] cell must 
provide the [[energy]] and synthetic machinery and the low molecular-weight precursors for the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. F. Brooks, M.D et al. "Jawetz, Melnick &amp; Adelberg's MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY.pdf, 26th Edition, McGraw Hill, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-07-181578-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virus replication occurs in seven stages, namely;
# [[Adsorption]],
# Entry, 
# Uncoating,
# [[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] / [[mRNA]] production,
# Synthesis of [[virus]] components, 
# [[Virion]] assembly and 
# Release (Liberation Stage).

=== Adsorption===
The virus attaches to the [[cell membrane]] of the host [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. It then injects its [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] into the host to initiate infection.
In animal cells these viruses get into the cell through the process of [[endocytosis]] which works through fusing of the virus and fusing of the [[viral envelope]] with the cell membrane of the animal cell and in plant cell it enters through the process of [[pinocytosis]] which works on pinching of the viruses.

=== Entry===
The cell membrane of the host cell invaginates the virus particle, enclosing it in a [[pinocytosis|pinocytotic]] [[vacoule]]. This protects the cell from [[antibodies]] like in the case of the [[HIV]] virus.

=== Uncoating===
Cell [[enzymes]] (from [[lysosomes]]) strip off the virus [[protein]] coat.
This releases or renders accessible the virus nucleic acid or [[genome]].

===Transcription / mRNA production===
For some [[RNA]] viruses, the infecting RNA produces messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]). This is translation of the genome into protein produces.
For others with negative stranded RNA and DNA, viruses are produced by [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] then translation.

The mRNA is used to instruct the host cell to make virus components. The virus takes advantage of the existing cell structures to replicate itself.

===Synthesis of virus components===
The following components are manufactured by the virus through the host's existing [[organelle]]s:
* Viral protein synthesis: virus mRNA is translated on cell [[ribosomes]] into two types of virus protein.
* Structural: the proteins which make up the virus particle are manufactured and assembled.
* Non – structural: not found in particle, mainly enzymes for virus genome replication.
* Viral nucleic acid synthesis (genome replication) new virus genome are synthesized, templates are either the parental genome or with single stranded nucleic acid genomes, newly formed complementary strands. By a virus called [[polymerate]] or replicate in some DNA viruses by a cell enzyme.  This is done in rapidly dividing cells.

===Virion Assembly===
A [[virion]] is simply an active or intact virus particle. In this stage, newly synthesized genome(nucleic acid), and proteins are assembled to form new virus particles.

This may take place in the cell's nucleus, [[cytoplasm]], or at [[plasma membrane]] for most developed viruses.

===Release (Liberation Stage)===
The viruses, now being mature are released by either sudden rupture of the cell, or gradual extrusion(budding) of enveloped viruses through the [[cell membrane]].

The new viruses may invade or attack other cells, or remain [[Dormancy|dormant]] in the cell.
In the case of bacterial viruses, the release of progeny virions takes place by lysis of the infected bacterium. However, in the case of animal viruses, release usually occurs without cell lysis.

==Baltimore Classification System==
{{main article|Baltimore Classification System}}

Viruses are classed into 7 types of genes, each of which has its own families of viruses, which in turn have differing replication strategies themselves.  [[David Baltimore]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning biologist, devised a system called the [[Baltimore Classification System]] to classify different viruses based on their unique replication strategy. There are seven different replication strategies based on this system (Baltimore Class I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII).  The seven classes of viruses are listed here briefly and in generalities.&lt;ref&gt;N.J. Dimmock et al. "Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition." Blackwell Publishing, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Class 1: Double Stranded DNA Viruses ===

This type of virus usually must enter the host [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] before it is able to replicate.  Some of these viruses require host cell [[DNA polymerase|polymerases]] to replicate their [[genome]], while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. However, in either cases, replication of the viral genome is highly dependent on a cellular state permissive to DNA replication and, thus, on the [[cell cycle]]. The virus may induce the cell to forcefully undergo [[cell division]], which may lead to [[cell transformation|transformation]] of the cell and, ultimately, [[cancer]].  An example of a family within this classification is the [[Adenoviridae]]

There is only one well-studied example in which a class 1 family of viruses does not replicate within the nucleus. This is the [[Poxvirus]] family, which comprises highly pathogenic viruses that infect [[vertebrate]]s.

=== Class 2: Single-stranded DNA viruses ===

Viruses that fall under this category include ones that are not as well-studied, but still do pertain highly to vertebrates.  Two examples include the [[Circoviridae]] and [[Parvoviridae]].  They replicate within the nucleus, and form a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication.  A human Anellovirus called [[Torque Teno Virus|TTV]] is included within this classification and is found in almost all humans, infecting them [[asymptomatic]]ally in nearly every major [[organ (biology)|organ]].

=== Class 3: Double-stranded RNA viruses ===

Like most viruses with [[RNA]] genomes, double-stranded RNA viruses do not rely on host polymerases for replication to the extent that viruses with [[DNA]] genomes do. Double-stranded RNA viruses are not as well-studied as other classes. This class includes two major families, the [[Reoviridae]] and [[Birnaviridae]].  Replication is [[monocistronic]] and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation.

=== Classes 4 &amp; 5: Single-stranded RNA viruses ===

These viruses consist of two types, however both share the fact that replication is primarily in the cytoplasm, and that replication is not as dependent on the cell cycle as that of DNA viruses.  This class of viruses is also one of the most-studied types of viruses, alongside the double-stranded DNA viruses.

==== Class 4: Single-stranded RNA viruses - Positive-sense ====

The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as '''[[positive-sense]]''' can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins.  These can be divided into two groups, both of which replicate in the cytoplasm:

* Viruses with [[polycistronic]] [[mRNA]] where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a [[polyprotein]] product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins.  This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, all in the sake of reducing the size of its gene.
* Viruses with complex transcription, for which [[subgenomic]] mRNAs, [[ribosomal frameshifting]] and [[proteolytic]] processing of polyproteins may be used.  All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.

Examples of this class include the families [[Coronaviridae]], [[Flaviviridae]], and [[Picornaviridae]].

==== Class 5: Single-stranded RNA viruses - Negative-sense ====

The negative-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as '''[[negative-sense]]''' cannot be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins.  Instead, they must be [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] by viral polymerases into the "readable" complementary positive-sense. These can also be divided into two groups:

* Viruses containing nonsegmented [[genomes]] for which the first step in replication is transcription from the negative-stranded genome by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to yield monocistronic mRNAs that code for the various viral proteins.  A positive-sense genome copy that serves as template for production of the negative-strand genome is then produced.  Replication is within the cytoplasm.
* Viruses with segmented genomes for which replication occurs in the cytoplasm and for which the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase produces monocistronic mRNAs from each genome segment.

Examples in this class include the families [[Orthomyxoviridae]], [[Paramyxoviridae]], [[Bunyaviridae]], [[Filoviridae]], and [[Rhabdoviridae]] (which includes [[rabies]]).

=== Class 6: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate ===

A well-studied family of this class of viruses include the [[retroviruses]].  One defining feature is the use of [[reverse transcriptase]] to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA.  Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using [[integrase]].  Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases

=== Class 7: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate ===

This small group of viruses, exemplified by the [[Hepatitis B]] virus, have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle ([[cccDNA]]) that serves as a template for production of viral [[mRNA]]s and a [[subgenomic]] RNA.  The pregenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase and for production of the DNA genome.

In the Islamic tradition, the '''Year of Sorrow''' ({{lang-ar|عام الحزن|‘Ām al-Ḥuzn}}, also translated  '''Year of Sadness''') is the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] year in which [[Muhammad]]'s wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadijah]] and his uncle and protector [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] died. The year approximately coincided with 619 CE{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=98}}{{sfn|Armstrong|2007|p=13}} or the tenth year after [[Muhammad's first revelation]].

After the death of Abu Talib, Muhammad became vulnerable due to the loss of clan protection granted by Abu Talib (who was also the chief of [[Banu Hashim]]). He began to be the target of physical attacks by his Meccan opponents. He [[Muhammad's visit to Ta'if|visited Ta'if]] to look for help and invite the inhabitants to Islam, but was rejected. On the way back to Mecca, he petitioned several prominent Meccans to ask for protection. Chief [[Mut'im ibn 'Adi]], from the [[Banu Nawfal]] clan, acceded to his request, escorted Muhammad into the city and announced the clan's protection of Muhammad.

== Death of Khadija ==
[[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]], Muhammad's first and only wife for the 25 years up to her death, died in 619 CE when she was about 65 years old.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=98}} Muhammad was almost 50 at this time, and the death happened not long after the end of the [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites|boycott against Muhammad's clan]].{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=98}} The boycott prohibited, among other things, trade with Muhammad's family.{{sfn|Armstrong|2007|pp=12–13}} The food shortage that it caused probably contributed towards Khadija's death.{{sfn|Armstrong|2007|p=13}}

==Death of Abu Talib==
Muhammad's uncle [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] was the chief of Muhammad's clan, [[Banu Hashim]], in whose household Muhammad (who was an orphan) had lived since the death of his grandfather [[Abd al-Muttalib]].{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=28}} As the clan chief, he granted protection to Muhammad, even as Muhammad gained enmity from some in the Quraish tribe due to his call to Islam.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=55}} Per the Meccan customs at the time, such protection was considered inviolate, and therefore Muhammad's enemies were unable to attack him.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=55}}

Abu Talib fell gravely ill shortly after Khadija's death.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=98}} Despite his protection for Muhammad, he had not converted to Islam, and at his deathbed Muhammad invited him to enter Islam by reciting the ''[[shahada]]''.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=99}} Abu Talib's brother [[Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Al-Abbas]], who was also at the deathbed, thought he heard Abu Talib recite the ''shahada'', but Muhammad did not.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=99}} Muhammad wanted to pray to God to beg forgiveness for his uncle, but then, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad received a Quranic revelation saying that a believer should not ask God's forgiveness for an unbeliever even if they were kin.&lt;ref name=mubarakfuri_abutalib&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mubarakpuri|2014|loc="Abu Talib's Death"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|113|style=nosup|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loss of protection ==
The death of Abu Talib meant that Muhammad no longer had the benefit of his clan's protection. Abu Talib was succeeded as chief by his brother [[Abu Lahab]] whose protection of Muhammad was nominal at best,{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} and Muhammad could not find any other chief who wanted to become his protector.{{sfn|Armstrong|2007|p=13}} Under the Meccan custom at the time, this meant that he was defenseless and could be killed with impunity.{{sfn|Armstrong|2007|p=13}}&lt;ref name=mubarakfuri_abutalib/&gt;

Muhammad's detractors in Mecca began to mistreat and physically attack him.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} One assailant passed by his house and threw spoiled [[offal]] into his cooking pot. Another threw a sheep's uterus mixed with blood and excrement when he was praying in his courtyard.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} Another assailant threw a handful of dirt on his face when he was coming from the [[Kaaba]].{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} When one of his daughters weepingly cleaned up the dirt at home, he consoled her that "God will protect your father", and remarked that the Quraish treated him much worse after Abu Talib's death.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}}&lt;ref name=mubarakfuri_grief&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Mubarakpuri|2014|loc="The Accumulation of Grief"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visit to Ta'if ==
{{main|Muhammad's visit to Ta'if}}
Because the situation in Mecca had become more difficult, Muhammad decided to leave for Ta'if,{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} a city about 100&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Mecca. In Ta'if, he visited the three brothers who were leaders of [[Banu Thaqif]], the tribe that inhabited the city.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} The three brothers granted him audience, and he invited them to Islam and to help him against his enemies.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} They rejected his request, and after Muhammad had left, sent their slaves and servants to harass him.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} As he fled he took refuge in a private orchard.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=100}} The orchard's owners, Meccan Quraishi brothers [[Utbah ibn Rabi'ah|Utbah]] and [[Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah|Shaybah]] sympathized with their imperilled tribesman, and sent [[Addas]], their Christian slave from [[Nineveh]], to treat him with grapes.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=101}} As Addas was offering the grapes to Muhammad, they talked and he was impressed by Muhammad's knowledge of the Ninevite prophet [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=101}}

== Search for a new protector ==
Rejected by the people of Ta'if, Muhammad wished to return to Mecca, but did not want to risk going there without tribal protection.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=102}} On the way to Mecca he sent word to several prominent Meccans to request protection. The first two, [[Akhnas ibn Shariq]] of [[Banu Zuhrah]] and [[Suhayl ibn Amr]] of [[Banu Amir]], rejected his request.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=102}} Both leaders' stated that the reason for this had nothing to do with their opposition to Islam, but was rather out of tribal principles. Akhnas, though well respected in Banu Zuhrah, was not technically its member and felt that he could not extend protection in the tribe's name,{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=102}} while Suhayl said that his clan came from a different branch of Quraish than the rest of Meccan Quraishis and would not be able to protect Muhammad against them.{{sfn|Lings|2006|pp=102–103}}

Subsequently, he sent word to [[Mut'im ibn 'Adi]], the chief of [[Banu Nawfal]].{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=103}} He was one of the five Meccan leaders who had initiated the end of the earlier Meccan boycott.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=103}} Mu'tim agreed, and the next day he met Muhammad with his sons and nephews, and then escorted him fully armed into Mecca.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=103}} They went to the Kaaba where Mu'tim announced the protection.{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=103}} Upon seeing this, leading opponent of Muhammad [[Abu Jahl]] told Mu'tim and his family "Whom you protect, to him we give protection".{{sfn|Lings|2006|p=103}}
