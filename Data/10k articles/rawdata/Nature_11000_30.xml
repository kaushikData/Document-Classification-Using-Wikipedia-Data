      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">[[image:955ACORN.jpg|thumb|right|The 955 is typical of the acorn designs, named for the glass cap holding the terminals with the main part of the tube extending from it.]]

An '''acorn tube''', or '''acorn valve''', refers to any member of a family of [[Very high frequency|VHF]]/[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[vacuum tube]]s starting just before [[World War II]]. They were named after their resemblance to the [[acorn]], specifically due to the glass cap at one end of the tube that looked similar to the cap on an acorn. The acorn tubes found widespread use in [[radio]]s and [[radar]] systems.

High-frequency performance is limited by (1) [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic lead inductance and capacitance]] and [[skin effect]], and (2) electron transit time (the time required to travel from cathode to anode). Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is the [[phase margin]]; another one is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extremely high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency "open circuit" characteristic. Acorn- as well as [[Triode#Lighthouse tubes|Lighthouse]] tubes and [[Nuvistor]]s attempt to minimize this effect by arranging cathode, grid(s) and anode as closely spaced together as possible.

The original range included about half a dozen tubes, designed to work in the VHF range. The 955 is a [[triode]]. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off [[pentode]]s, respectively, all with indirect 6.3&amp;nbsp;V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25&amp;nbsp;V [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd battery]] heaters. The 957 is a medium-μ signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50&amp;nbsp;mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specifications was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/9/957.pdf |title= 957&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;958&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;959 (Acorn Types) |publisher=[[RCA|R.C.A.

L. Samuel |format=PDF |access-date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 713A and 717A pentodes were referred to as ''Doorknob'' tubes.

The introduction of the [[EF50]] was the first serious competition for the acorn design, and replaced the acorns in many roles, especially post-war when millions of surplus EF50s were dumped on the market.

'''Aganippe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|g|ʌ|n|ɪ|p|iː}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀγανίππη}}) was the name of both a spring and the [[Naiad]] (a [[Crinaeae|Crinaea]]) associated with it. The spring is in [[Boeotia]], near [[Thespiae]], at the base of [[Mount Helicon]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (encyclopedia)|Natural History]]'', [http://topostext.org/work.php?work_id=148 4.12.1].&lt;/ref&gt; and was associated with the [[Muses]] who were sometimes called Aganippides.

The '''Ministry of Energy''' is a [[Executive Council of Alberta|Cabinet]]-level agency of the government of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]] responsible for coordinating policy relating to the development of [[mineral]] and [[energy]] resources. It is also responsible for assessing and collecting [[non-renewable resource]] (NRR) [[royalties]], freehold mineral taxes, rentals, and bonuses. The Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, which is fully integrated with the Department of Energy within the ministry, and fully funded by the Crown, accepts delivery of the Crown's royalty share of conventional [[crude oil]] and sells it at the current market value.

The '''Alberta Energy and Utilities Board''' regulated energy resource development, pipelines, transmission lines, and investor-owned electric, water, and natural gas utilities, as well as certain municipality-owned utilities. It reported to the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Executive Council]] through the Ministry of Energy, although it operated and made its formal decisions independently and autonomously. On January 1, 2008 the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) was realigned into two separate regulatory bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eub.ca/eub/index.html |title=Effective January 1 |publisher=Eub.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1984, the Alberta Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR), was a complex multi-divisional organization, with a permanent staff of 2, 605 and a budget of $499 million, that was responsible for the management of energy, mineral, forest and fish and wildlife resources as well as public (crown owned lands) which constituted 62% of Alberta's land base.&lt;ref name="Langhorn"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.trentu.ca/planning/documents/Langhorn%26HiningsPaper.pdf |format=PDF |first1=Ken |last1=Langhorn |first2=Bob |last2=Hinings |title=Integrated planning and organizational conflict |journal=Canadian Public Administration|volume= 30 |number=4 |year=1987 |pages=550–565  |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENR policy was based on the premise that with proper planning and management, land can support a variety of uses, such as, timber, recreation and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt; {{rp|553}} However few were ideally compatible creating a climate of competition and conflict.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;{{rp|553}}

In 1986 the Department of Energy and the Department of Forestry, Lands and Wildlife were created. The original resource agencies continued and interdepartmental planning took place under Resource Evaluation and Planning (REAP). The Resource Evaluation and Planning (REAP) division was created in 1976 to provide coordination and data gathering services.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;

In the 1980s REAP oversaw an integrative planning system using a team approach to decision-making.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt; {{rp|554}} It was a challenging time of transition. More established agencies like the Alberta Forest Service supported preservation of traditional attitudes and behaviour and felt threatened. By the 1980s Alberta Forest Service had a strong authority system with a military style chain of command and system of ranks.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;{{rp|561}}  Fish and Wildlife Division were more flexible and less formally structured.{{rp|561}} Public Lands were more bureaucratic and mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

The Fish and Wildlife division who emphasized long-term research and monitoring are under the auspices of the Fish and Wildlife Act. Fish and Wildlife division were with the Department of Recreation and Parks before joining Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) in 1979.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;{{rp|553}}

The Mineral Resources division had very high status and power because of their client groups, which included the oil and gas industry, who are "powerful actors on the Alberta scene."&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;

In 1982 the Alberta Forest Service had a staff of 765 and a budget of $123 million and the Fish and Wildlife division whose clients were often environmental groups, had 414 positions and $20 million.&lt;ref name="Langhorn" /&gt;{{rp|562}}

==Non-Renewable Resource Royalties==

Royalty rates in Alberta are based on the price of WTI.  That royalty rate is applied to a project's Net Revenue if the project has reached payout or Gross Revenue if the project has not yet reached payout.  A project's revenue is a direct function of the price it is able to sell its crude for.  Since WCS is a benchmark for [[oil sands]] crudes, revenues in the oil sands are discounted when the price of WCS is discounted.  Those price discounts flow through to the royalty payments.

The Province of Alberta receives a portion of benefits from the development of energy resources in the form of royalties that fund in part programs like health, education and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="ABE_2009"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/org/pdfs/energy_economic.pdf|format=PDF |page=17 |title=Energy Economics: Understanding Royalties |work=Government of Alberta |date=September 2009 |location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

In 2006-7 the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08 it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion.

In their response to the 2010 competitive review with input from the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) and the Small Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, Alberta Energy lowered non-renewable resource (NRR) royalty rates.&lt;ref name="AB_NRR_Royalties_2010" /&gt;

The rate cuts included, 

{{quote|The current five per cent front-end rate on natural gas and conventional oil will become a permanent feature of the royalty system. The maximum royalty rate for conventional oil will be reduced to 40 per cent, down from the current level of 50 per cent. The maximum royalty rate for conventional and unconventional natural gas will be reduced at higher price levels from 50 to 36 per cent.}}

In 2010 the oil and gas industry accounted for 30 percent of Alberta's GDP and 147,000 direct jobs. The decision to lower royalty rates to make the NRR industries more competitive was based on the economic argument that the decrease in royalties revenue would be offset by an increase in land sales and tax revenue.&lt;ref name="AB_NRR_Royalties_2010"&gt;{{citation |date=11 March 2010 |title=Alberta delivers on oil and gas competitiveness: Increased production, jobs and spin-off benefits expected as a result of regulatory and fiscal changes for oil and gas sector Calgary |url=https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=279744F2557FC-D367-C78D-91D76534898EDDC3 |work=Alberta Energy |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The net result will be a decrease in revenue in 2012-13 of $363 million. This includes a decrease of $785 million in forecast royalty revenues, directly attributable to the changes, partially offset by an increase of $131 million in royalty revenues generated by increased activity, $143 million in land sale revenue and $148 million in tax revenue from increased tax revenue.}}

Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion.&lt;ref name="ABE_2009" /&gt;{{rp|10}} In that year Alberta's total resource revenue "fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession."&lt;ref name="O'Donnell_Gerein_2013" /&gt;

In February 2012 the Province of Alberta "expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell_Gerein_2013" /&gt; By January 2013 the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. "30 per cent of Alberta’s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total."&lt;ref name="O'Donnell_Gerein_2013"&gt;{{citation|title=Bitumen bubble’ costing Alberta billions, Redford says |first=Sarah |last=O'Donnell |first2=Keith |last2=Gerein |date=24 January 2013 |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Bitumen+bubble+costing+Alberta+billions+Redford+says/7869429/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128023206/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Bitumen%2Bbubble%2Bcosting%2BAlberta%2Bbillions%2BRedford%2Bsays/7869429/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |publisher=Edmonton Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009/10 royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.&lt;ref name="ABE_2009" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

In order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in "charging one per cent of a project’s gross revenues until the project’s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue. These policy changes and higher oil prices after 2003 had the desired effect of accelerating the development of the oil sands industry.&lt;ref name="ABE_2009" /&gt;{{rp|1}} "A revised Alberta Royalty Regime was implemented in January 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="ABE_2009" /&gt;{{rp|7}} through which each oil sands project pays a gross revenue royalty rate of 1% (Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011:30).&lt;ref name="ABE_2011" /&gt; Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011 summarizes the [[petroleum fiscal regime]]s for the western provinces and territories. The Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes described how royalty payments were calculated:&lt;ref name="ABE_2011"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Tenure/pdfs/FISREG.pdf|format=PDF|title=Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes: Western Canadian Provinces and Territories|date=June 2011|work=Alberta Department of Energy|isbn=978-0-7785-9423-9|location=Edmonton, Alberta}} This summarizes the petroleum fiscal regimes for the western provinces and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

{{quote|After an oil sands royalty project reaches payout, the royalty payable to the Crown is equal to the greater of: (a) the gross revenue royalty (1% - 9%) for the period, and (b) the royalty percentage (25% - 40%) of net revenue for the period. Effective January 1, 2009 the royalty percentage of net revenue is also indexed to the Canadian dollar price of WTI. It is 25% when the WTI price is less than or equal to $55/bbl, rising linearly to a maximum of 40% when the price reaches $120/bbl.

Payout refers "the first time when the developer has recovered all the allowed costs of the project, including a return allowance on those costs equal to the Government of Canada long-term bond rate ["LTBR"].&lt;ref name="ABE_2011" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

In order to encourage growth and prosperity and due to the extremely high cost of exploration, research and development, oil sands and mining operations pay no corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes as companies often remain in a loss position for tax and royalty purposes for many years. Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) is unfairly claiming "$1.2-billion" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/suncors-15-billion-writedown-puts-oil-sands-project-in-jeopardy/article8287055/ |publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=6 February 2013 |first=Nathan|last=Vanderklippe |title=Suncor's $1.5-billion writedown puts oil sands project in jeopardy|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil Sands Royalty Rates ===

"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. [[Western Canadian Select]] (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as [[naphtha]] or [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM."&lt;ref name="ABE_2009" /&gt;

By 2014 NRR revenue dropped to 21% of total revenue from 30% in 2010. The 2014 Provincial Budget reported that future anticipated NRR revenue is "far less than in 2011-2012, less than the 30% recorded in 2010 and in the four year period from 2005-06 to 2008-09."&lt;ref name="budget2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/publications/Budget/budget2014/fiscal-plan-operational-plan.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Building Alberta Plan Budget 2014 |date=6 March 2014 |work=Alberta Finance |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Crosse''' (17 June 1784 – 6 July 1855) was a British amateur scientist who was born and died at [[Fyne Court]], [[Broomfield, Somerset]].&lt;ref  name="waite"&gt;{{cite book |title=Portrait of the Quantocks |last=Waite |first=Vincent |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-1158-4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; Crosse was an early pioneer and experimenter in the use of electricity. He became widely known after press reports of an [[electrocrystallization]] experiment he conducted in 1836, during which insects "appeared".

==Early life==
Crosse was the first son of Richard Crosse and Susannah Porter. In 1788 he accompanied them on a trip to France, where he went to school for a time in [[Orléans]]. From the age of six until he was eight he stayed with a tutor, the Reverend Mr White, in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], where he learned Greek. On 1 February 1792 he was sent to boarding school in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=memoirs&gt;{{cite book |title=Memorials scientific and literary of Andrew Cross, the electrician |last=Crosse |first=Cornelia A H |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1857 |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans and Robert |location=London |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the age of 12 Crosse persuaded one of his teachers to let him attend a series of lectures on the [[natural science]]s, the second of which was on the subject of electricity. This led to his lifelong interest in the subject.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; Crosse first started experimenting with electricity during his time in the [[sixth form]], when he built a [[Leyden jar]].&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; After leaving school he studied at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt;

==Scientific research==
Having lost his parents, his father in 1800 and his mother in 1805, Crosse took over the management of the family estates at the age of 21. After abandoning his studies for the [[barrister|Bar]], he increasingly devoted his spare time to studying electricity at Fyne Court, where he built his own laboratory. He also studied [[mineralogy]] and became interested in the formation of crystalline deposits in caves.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; Around 1807 he started to experiment with electrocrystallization, forming crystalline lime carbonate from water taken from Holwell Cavern. He returned to the subject again from around 1817 and in subsequent years produced a total of 24 electrocrystallized minerals.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt;

Among his experiments Crosse erected "an extensive apparatus for examining the electricity of the atmosphere," incorporating at one point an insulated wire some {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} long, later shortened to {{convert|1800|ft|m}}, suspended from poles and trees. Using this wire he was able to determine the polarity of the atmosphere under various weather conditions. His results were published by his friend [[George Singer]] in 1814, as part of Singer's ''Elements of Electricity and Electro-Chemistry''.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt;

Along with [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] (who visited Fyne Court in 1827), Crosse was one of the first to develop large [[voltaic pile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911 edition, Volume V09, Page 185&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not the largest he built, [[Henry Minchin Noad]]'s ''Manual of Electricity'' describes a battery consisting of 50 jars containing {{convert|73|sqft|m2}} of coated surface. Using his wires Crosse was able to charge and discharge it some 20 times a minute, "accompanied by reports almost as loud as those of a cannon".&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; He became known locally as "the thunder and lightning man". In 1836 Sir Richard Phillips described seeing a wide variety of voltaic piles at Fyne Court, totalling 2,500, of which 1,500 were in use when he visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Andrew Crosse : Early nineteenth-century amateur of electrical science |author=Pocock RF |journal=IEE Proceedings-A |volume=140 |number=3 |date=May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836 Crosse was persuaded to attend a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Bristol. After describing his discoveries over dinner at the house of a friend in Bristol, he was further persuaded to recount them to both the chemical and the geological sections of the meeting. They included his electrocrystallization and atmospheric experiments, and his improvements to the voltaic battery.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt;

Crosse went on to separate copper from its ores using [[electrolysis]], experimented with the electrolysis of sea water, wine and [[brandy]] to purify them, and examined the effects of electricity on vegetation.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; He was also interested in the practical uses of electricity and [[magnetism]], including the development of [[loudspeaker]]s and [[telegraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer | last=Hyman |first=Anthony |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1982 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=0-691-02377-8 |page=234 and 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he did not do research in these areas himself.

===Controversy===
A few months after the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Crosse was conducting another electrocrystallization experiment when, on the 26th day of the experiment, he saw what he described as "the perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its tail". More creatures appeared and two days later they began moving their legs. Over the next few weeks hundreds more appeared. They crawled around the table and hid themselves wherever they could find shelter. Crosse identified them as being members of the genus ''[[Acarus]]''.

Puzzled, Crosse mentioned the incident to a couple of friends.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; A local newspaper learned of the incident and published an article about the "extraordinary experiment," naming the insects ''Acarus crossii''. The article was subsequently picked up by other newspapers across the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some readers apparently gained the impression that Crosse had somehow "created" the insects, or at least claimed to have done so.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; He received angry letters in which he was accused of [[blasphemy]]&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; and trying to take God's place as a creator. Some of them included death threats.

Other scientists tried to repeat the experiment. W. H. Weeks took extensive measures to assure a sealed environment by placing his experiment inside a bell jar. He obtained the same results as Crosse, but due to the controversy that Crosse's experiment had sparked his work was never published. In February 1837 many newspapers reported that Michael Faraday had also replicated Crosse's results. However, this was not true. Faraday had not even attempted the experiment. Later researchers, such as fellow members of the [[London Electrical Society]] [[Henry Noad]] and [[Alfred Smee]], were unable to replicate Crosse's results.

Crosse did not claim that he had created the insects. He assumed that there were insect eggs embedded in his samples. Later commentators agreed that the insects were probably [[cheese mite]]s or [[dust mite]]s that had contaminated Crosse's instruments.

It has been suggested that this episode was a source of inspiration for [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/11/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.humanities |title=Real-life Frankenstein who inspired SF |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2001-06-11 |accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2004/09/23/andrew_crosse_person_profile.shtml |title=Frankenstein of Fyne Court? |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2008-03-13 |work=BBC Somerset}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this cannot have been the case, since Crosse's  experiments took place almost 20 years after the novel was first published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/news_150.php |title=Remembering the 'Thunder and Lightning Man' at Fyne Court |accessdate=2008-03-13 |format= |work=Somerset Wildlife Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea appears to have originated in the book ''The Man Who Was Frankenstein'' (1979) by [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1573812/Peter-Haining.html |title=Obituaries: Peter Haining |work=Daily Telegraph |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Man Who Was Frankenstein |author=Peter Haining |year=1979 |publisher=TBS The Book Service Ltd. |isbn=978-0-584-10356-4 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Shelley]] did, however, know Crosse through a mutual friend, the poet [[Robert Southey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Luis Carlos Molina Acevedo |title=Zombie Factor |date=2016 |publisher=XinXii |isbn=9783960285328 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LFsEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephen Adams |title=Letters of scientist who inspired Frankenstein go on public display |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3684107/Letters-of-scientist-who-inspired-Frankenstein-go-on-public-display.html |accessdate=23 August 2016 |work=Telegraph |date=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin reportedly attended a lecture by Crosse in London in December 1814, in which he allegedly explained his experiments with atmospheric electricity. However, Mary Shelley's diary speaks only of "Garnerin" as the lecturer. Similarly dubious is a claim that Edward W. Cox wrote a report of their visits to Fyne Court to see Crosse's work in the ''Taunton Courier'' in Autumn 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/andrew-crosse?cat=technology |title=Andrew Crosse |accessdate=2008-03-13 |format= |work=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percy had been dead for over a dozen years by then.

==Other interests==
Crosse also wrote a great many poems and enjoyed walking on the [[Quantock Hills]], in which Fyne Court is set, "at all hours of day and night, in all seasons".

Crosse advocated the benefits of education for the lower classes, argued against emigration, and supported a campaign by local farmers against falling food prices and high taxes during the 1820s. He was also active in party politics, speaking in support of friends at election meetings.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; Following the [[Battle of Waterloo]] Crosse boarded a ship at [[Exeter]] to see the captured [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] on the deck of ''[[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]]'' near [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt; Crosse also served as a [[magistrate]].&lt;ref name=crosseconnect1&gt;[http://www.crosseconnections.org.uk/johnporter/pages/indiI176.html crosseconnections.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107092633/http://www.crosseconnections.org.uk/johnporter/pages/indiI176.html |date=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Crosse married Mary Anne Hamilton in 1809. They had seven children, although three died in childhood. Mary died in 1846 following several years of ill health.&lt;ref name=crosseconnect2&gt;[http://www.crosseconnections.org.uk/crosse/bios/andrew.htm crosseconnections.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 1850 Crosse married again, aged 66. His second wife was the 23-year-old Cornelia Augusta Hewett Berkeley. They went on to have three children.&lt;ref name=crosseconnect2 /&gt;

Crosse suffered a stroke while dressing on the morning on 26 May 1855. He died on 6 July 1855, in the same room in which he had been born.&lt;ref name=memoirs /&gt;

==Memorial==
The laboratory table on which Crosse carried out experiments stands in the aisle of the [[Church of St Mary &amp; All Saints, Broomfield]], and an [[obelisk]] in his memory is in the churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=269264 |title=Church of St. Mary and All Saints |accessdate=2008-03-09 |format= |work=Images of England |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004063801/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=269264 |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosse's home, Fyne Court, was largely destroyed by fire in 1894.&lt;ref name="waite"/&gt; The garden and the {{convert|65|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate are now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and are open to visitors.

==Documents==
A number of documents related to Andrew Crosse and his work are held in the [[Somerset Record Office]]. In December 2008 [[Somerset County Council]] acquired a further two letters for the sum of 400 pounds to add to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/latestnews/pressreleases/details.cfm?releaseID=1626 |title=Letters acquired by Somerset County Council | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">'''Benjamin Dawson Porritt''' [[FRSE]] FIC FIP FIRI (26 January 1884 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1940) was an early 20th century British chemist and academic author, specialising in the use of [[rubber]]. In authorship he is known as '''B. D. Porritt'''. He was a keen yachtsman and rugby player.

==Life==

He was born on 26 January 1884 at [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in [[Canada]]. He was the son of Herbert Thomas Porritt, from [[Armley]], [[Yorkshire]] in Britain. His family returned to Britain soon after his birth and he was educated at [[Whitgift School|Whitgift Grammar School]] in [[Croydon]] in London. In 1903 he entered [[University College, London]] studying Chemistry. He graduated BSc in 1906.He then proceeded to gain an MSc and began research with Sir [[William Ramsay (chemist)|William Ramsay]] and Sir [[Norman Collie]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0370164600020484&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1909 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] as a chemist to the [[North British Rubber Company]] who had huge works in the [[Fountainbridge]] district (mainly making [[wellington boots]] and [[Hot water bottle|rubber hot water bottles]]). He was promoted to Senior Chemist in 1912. In 1916 he became Research Superintendent.

In 1919 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were Sir [[James Walker (chemist)|James Walker]], [[Alexander Lauder]], Sir [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he moved back to Croydon taking on the role of Director of the newly formed Research Association of the British Rubber and Tyre Manufacturers. He received the [[Colwyn Medal]] for services to Chemistry in 1938.

He remained in this post until his death, which occurred in [[Croydon]], London, on 28 January 1940, a few days after his 56th birthday.

==Family==

He was married with two daughters.

* the path leading from a cyclic accelerator to the experimental endstation (as in [[synchrotron light source]]s or [[cyclotron]]s).

Beamlines usually end in experimental stations that utilize [[particle beam]]s or [[synchrotron light]] obtained from a [[synchrotron]], or [[neutrons]] from a [[spallation source]] or [[research reactor]].  Beamlines are used in experiments in [[particle physics]], [[materials science]], [[chemistry]], and [[molecular biology]].

==Beamline in a particle accelerator==
[[Image:LINAC.jpg|thumb|right|220px|It is impossible to see the beam pipe on this beamline. However the section of the '''big beam pipe''' is used with a grid system for alignment with a [[laser]], known as the laser pipe. This particular ''beamline'' is approximately 3 kilometers long.]]

In [[particle accelerator]]s the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a concrete housing. The beamline is usually a cylindrical metal pipe, typically called a ''beam pipe'', and/or a ''drift tube'', evacuated to a high [[vacuum]] so there are few gas molecules in the path for the beam of accelerated particles to hit, which would scatter them before they reach their destination.

There are specialized devices and equipment on the beamline that are used for producing, maintaining, monitoring, and accelerating the particle beam. These devices may be in proximity or attached to the beamline. These devices include sophisticated [[transducer]]s, diagnostics (position monitors and [[wire scanner]]s), [[Electrostatic lens|lenses]], [[collimator]]s, [[thermocouple]]s, [[ion pump]]s, [[ion gauge]]s, [[Ionization chamber|ion chambers]] (sometimes called "beam loss monitors"), vacuum valves ("isolation valves"), and [[gate valve]]s, to mention a few. There are also water cooling devices to cool the [[dipole magnet|dipole]] and [[quadrupole magnet]]s. Positive pressure, such as that provided by [[compressed air]], regulates and controls the [[vacuum]] [[valve]]s and manipulators on the beamline.

It is imperative to have all beamline sections, magnets, etc., aligned by a [[Surveying|survey]] and alignment crew by using a [[laser tracker]]. All beamlines must be within [[micrometre]] tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates [[secondary emission]]s and/or [[radiation]].

==Synchrotron radiation beamline==

[[Image:Aust.-Synchrotron,-eVBL-Experimental-Station,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Inside the Optical Diagnostic Beamline (ODB) hutch at the [[Australian Synchrotron]]; the beamline terminates at the small aperture in the back wall]]
Regarding [[synchrotron]]s, ''beamline'' may also refer to the instrumentation that carries beams of [[synchrotron radiation]] to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the [[bending magnet]]s and [[insertion device]]s in the [[storage ring]] of a [[List of synchrotron radiation facilities|synchrotron radiation facility]]. A typical application for this kind of beamline is [[crystallography]], although many other [[:Category:Synchrotron-related techniques|techniques]] utilising [[synchrotron light]] exist.

At a large synchrotron facility there will be many beamlines, each optimised for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station.  A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron facility will be 25 to 100 m long from the [[storage ring]] to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines opening on day one of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.

The beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures, called [[Hutch (synchrotron)|hutch]]es, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant [[Interlock (engineering)|interlocking functions]], which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is [[beam dump|dumped]], meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy.

Elements that are used in beamlines by experimenters for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station include the following:

*Windows - thin sheets of metal, often [[beryllium]], which transmit almost all of the beam, but protect the vacuum within the storage ring from contamination
*Slits - which control the physical width of the beam and its angular spread
*Focusing mirrors - one or more mirrors, which may be flat, bent-flat, or [[toroid (geometry)|toroid]]al, which helps to [[collimator|collimate]] (focus) the beam
*Monochromators - devices based on [[diffraction]] by crystals which select particular [[wavelength]] bands and absorb other wavelengths, and which are sometimes tunable to varying wavelengths, and sometimes fixed to a particular wavelength
*Spacing tubes - vacuum maintaining tubes which provide the proper space between optical elements, and shield any scattered radiation
*Sample stages - for mounting and manipulating the sample under study and subjecting it to various external conditions, such a varying temperature, pressure etc.
*Radiation detectors - for measuring the radiation which has interacted with the sample

The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the [[thermal load]] (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or [[liquid nitrogen]]. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under [[ultra high vacuum]] conditions.

===Software for beamline modeling===
Although the design of a synchrotron radiation beamline may be seen as an application of X-ray optics, there are dedicated tools for modeling the x-ray propagation down the beamline and their interaction with various components.  There are ray-tracing codes such as [http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/raytracing/ Shadow] and [http://www.mcxtrace.org/ McXTrace] that treat the x-ray beam in the geometric optics limit, and then there are wave propagation software that takes into account diffraction, and the intrinsic wavelike properties of the radiation.  For the purposes of understanding full or partial coherence of the synchrotron radiation, the wave properties need to be taken into account.  The codes [https://github.com/ochubar/SRW SRW] and [http://radiant.harima.riken.go.jp/spectra/ Spectra] include this possibility.

==Neutron beamline==
An experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline. Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a [[research reactor]] or a [[spallation source]] instead of photons. The experiments usually measure [[neutron scattering]] from the sample under study.

[[File:Seir.png|thumb|Map of the Southeast Indian Ridge.  Broken Ridge is the green area in the upper left corner.]]
'''Broken Ridge''' or '''Broken Plateau''' is an [[oceanic plateau]] in the south-eastern [[Indian Ocean]].  Broken Ridge once formed a [[large igneous province]] (LIP) together with the [[Kerguelen Plateau]].  When Australia and Antarctica started to separate, Broken Ridge and the Kerguelen Plateau got separated by the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]].&lt;ref name="Schlich"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlich|2013|p=79-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alkalic]] [[basalt]] from Broken Ridge has been dated to 95 Ma.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-p15-17" /&gt;

Broken Ridge stretches {{Convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from the southern end of [[Ninety East Ridge]] towards the south-western corner of [[Australia]].  It is up to {{Convert|400|km|abbr=on}} wide and reaches {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} below sea level.  It is separated from the [[Diamantina Fracture Zone]] on its southern side by a {{Convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} escarpment, while on the northern side the ridge slopes gently towards the abyssal [[Wharton Basin]].  The sediment cover on the ridge reaches {{Convert|800|m|abbr=on}} and the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]] is found at about {{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Schlich" /&gt;  It is separated from the [[Naturaliste Plateau]] by the [[Dirck Hartog Ridge]].

The Kerguelen LIP  covered {{Convert|2.3|e6km2|abbr=on}} making it the second largest LIP on Earth (after the [[Ontong Java Plateau]] in the Pacific).&lt;ref name="Ingle-2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingle|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both these enormous LIPs reaches {{Convert|2|–|4|km|abbr=on}} above the surrounding ocean floor and have a crustal thickness of {{Convert|20|-|40|km|abbr=on}} (compared to oceanic crust typically around {{Convert|7|km|abbr=on}} thick.)&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2000-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2000|loc=Introduction, pp. 74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Broken Ridge and Kerguelen Plateau are now separated by {{Convert|1800|km|abbr=on}}.  When they broke-up, the southern flank of Broken Ridge was uplifted some {{Convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} and reached above sea level.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2000-intro" /&gt;

The Kerguelen LIP has a long and complicated history, however, and is probably the least "typical" of all LIPs.&lt;ref name="Ingle-2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingle|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rocks from both the Broken Ridge and the Kerguelen Plateau contain a continental component or "fingerprint".  In the Early Cretaceous, the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] was split into several [[diapir]]s of various sizes, composition, and ascent rates.  These separate diapirs created the [[Bunbury Basalt]], the Southern Kerguelen Plateau, the [[Rajmahal Traps]]/Indian [[lamprophyre]]s, Antarctic lamprophyres, and the Central Kerguelen Plateau/Broken Ridge.  In the late Cretaceous, activity in the mantle slowed and the Kerguelen hotspot was reduced to a single plume which created the Ninety East Ridge.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-p15-17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2003|loc=Mantle sources, plume-lithosphere interactions, and plume models, pp. 15-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
120-95 Ma when the Southern and Central Kerguelen Plateau formed together with the Broken Ridge, the Kerguelen hotspot produced {{Convert|1|km3|abbr=on}}/year, but 95-25 Ma the output decreased to {{Convert|0.1|km3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Canadian Shield forests''' are a [[taiga]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion consists of rolling hills, lakes, bogs and rocky outcrops covering a large curved swathe on the [[Canadian Shield]] from eastern [[Manitoba]] and [[Northern Ontario]] running southeastwards through [[Thunder Bay District]] to the north shore of [[Lake Superior]] and then northeastwards into western [[Quebec]]. The area has a cool climate with summer tempearatures averaging around 13°C dropping to a very cold -17°C in winter, with the hills around [[Lac Seul]] in northwestern [[Ontario]] being warmer and wetter than most of the area. Average rainfall in the eastern side of the ecoregion is 550mm per year, rising to 750mm in the centre (near [[Lake Nipigon]] for example), up to 900mm in the west. Specific areas include Lake Nipigon and [[Big Trout Lake (Ontario)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0602|name=Central Canadian Shield forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forest contrast with more severe boreal forest ecoregions such as the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] to the north, which covers most of [[Northern Quebec]] and [[Labrador]].

==Flora==
[[File:Pukaskwa National Park.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Pukaskwa National Park]] in [[Ontario]].]]
These hills support a large area of rich taiga forest dominated by black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]'') along with [[jack pine]] and some paper birch (''[[Betula papyrifera]]'') and in the warmer south-facing areas some trembling aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]''), Ontario balsam poplar (''[[Populus balsamifera]]'') and balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]''). Many of the rocks of the area are covered with colourful [[lichen]]s. The ecoregion contains large areas of wetland especially in the south east, and a greater variety of plant life on the north shore of Lake Superior.

==Fauna==
Mammals of the taiga include moose (''[[Alces alces]]''), the southernmost populations of migratory woodland caribou (''[[Rangifer tarandus caribou]]''), American black bear (''[[Ursus americanus]]''), Canada lynx (''[[Lynx canadensis]]''), snowshoe hare (''[[Lepus americanus]]'') and grey wolf (''[[Canis lupus]]''). Birds of the area include northern hawk owl (''[[Surnia ulula]]''), great horned owl (''[[Bubo virginianus]]''), sharp-tailed grouse (''[[Tympanuchus phasianellus]]''), ruffed grouse (''[[Bonasa umbellus]]''), American black duck (''[[Anas rubripes]]''), wood duck (''[[Aix sponsa]]''), Canada goose (''[[Branta canadensis]]'') in the north, and hooded merganser (''[[Lophodytes cucullatus]]'') and pileated woodpecker (''[[Dryocopus pileatus]]'') in the west.

==Threats and preservation==
This is fairly well-preserved ecoregion with 40% of original forest intact (less so in Manitoba) while most has been heavily changed by logging and in some areas by mining and hydroelectric power generation. Large blocks of undisturbed forest do remain, for example north of Lake Nipigon in Ontario and around [[Lake Mistassini]] in Quebec, and in the following protected areas: [[Wabakimi Provincial Park]] northwest of Lake Nipigon, [[Pukaskwa National Park]] near [[Marathon, Ontario]] on the Lake Superior shore, a number of rivers and lakes in Northern Ontario ([[Winisk River]], [[Missinaibi River]], [[Albany River]] north of Wabakimi Park, [[Severn River (northern Ontario)]], [[Attawapiskat Lake]]/[[Attawapiskat River]] and [[Brightsand River]]), [[Kesagami Provincial Park]], [[Michipicoten Island]] in Lake Superior, all in [[Ontario]];  and [[Aiguebelle National Park]] in Quebec.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''ChaNGa (Charm N-body GrAvity solver)''' is a computer program to perform [[n-body cosmological simulation|collisionless ''N''-body simulations]]. It can perform cosmological simulations with periodic boundary conditions in comoving coordinates or simulations of isolated stellar systems. It is based on the [[Barnes–Hut simulation|Barnes–Hut]] algorithm and uses [[Ewald summation]] for periodic forces.

ChaNGa makes use of the [[Charm++]] parallel programming system, including its dynamic load balancing schemes, in order to scale to large processor configurations. Simulation results have been reported on up to 20,000 [[Blue Gene|IBM Bluegene/L]] processors [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512011208/http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/papers/ChaNGaIPDPS08.shtml].

'''Cirrus castellanus''' is a species of [[cirrus cloud]]. Its name comes from the word ''[[castellanus]]'', which means ''of a fort'', ''of a castle'' in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of castellanus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=1002184 |accessdate=11 September 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all cirrus, this species occurs at high altitudes. It appears as separate [[turret]]s rising from a lower-level [[cloud base]]. Often these cloud turrets form in lines, and they can be taller than they are wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA56#v=snippet&amp;q=cirrus%20castellanus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cloud species is usually dense in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrus castellanus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrus/cirrus-castellanus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28982">'''Coastal flooding''' occurs when normally dry, low-lying land is [[flood]]ed by seawater.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt; The extent of coastal flooding is a function of the elevation inland flood waters penetrate which is controlled by the [[topography]] of the coastal land exposed to flooding.&lt;ref name=ramsay&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsay|Bell|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|mp|1998}} The [[seawater]] can inundate the land via several different paths:

*'''Direct inundation''' — where the sea height exceeds the elevation of the land, often where waves have not built up a natural barrier such as a dune system
*'''Overtopping of a barrier''' — the barrier may be natural or human engineered and overtopping occurs due to swell conditions during storm or high tides often on open stretches of the coast. The height of the waves exceeds the height of the barrier and water flows over the top of the barrier to flood the land behind it. Overtopping can result in high velocity flows that can erode significant amounts of the land surface which can undermine defense structures.&lt;ref name=gallien&gt;{{harvnb|Gallien|Schubert|Sanders|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Breaching of a barrier''' — again the barrier may be natural or human engineered, and breaching occurs on open coasts exposed to large waves. Breaching is where the barrier is broken down by waves allowing the seawater to extend inland.

Coastal flooding is largely a natural event, however human influence on the coastal environment can exacerbate coastal flooding.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref name=nicholls&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholls|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=griffis&gt;{{harvnb|Griffis|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dawson&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson| Dickson| Nicholls| Hall|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraction of water from groundwater reservoirs in the coastal zone can enhance [[subsidence]] of the land increasing the risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt; Engineered protection structures along the coast such as [[sea walls]] alter the natural processes of the beach, often leading to [[erosion]] on adjacent stretches of the coast which also increases the risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref name=dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=pope&gt;{{harvnb|Pope|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Coastal flooding can result from a variety of different causes including storm surges created by storms like hurricanes and tropical cyclones, rising sea levels due to climate change and by tsunamis.

=== Storms and storm surges ===
Storms can cause flooding through [[storm surges]] which are waves significantly larger than normal &lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref name=kurian&gt;{{harvnb|Kurian |Nirupama| Baba| Thomas|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if a storm event corresponds with the high astronomical tide extensive flooding can occur.&lt;ref name=benavente&gt;{{harvnb|Benavente |Del Río |Gracia |Martínez-del-Pozo|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storm surges]] occur during storm events, including [[hurricanes]] and [[tropical cyclones]] due to three processes:

# wind setup
# barometric setup
# [[wave setup]]

Winds blowing in an onshore direction (from the sea towards the land) can cause the water to 'pile up' against the coast. This is known as wind setup. Low [[atmospheric pressure]] is associated with storm systems and this tends to increase the surface sea level, this is barometric setup. Finally increased [[wave]] break height results in a higher water level in the [[surf zone]] which is wave setup. These three processes interact to create waves that can overtop natural and engineered coastal protection structures thus penetrating seawater further inland than normal.&lt;ref name=benavente /&gt;&lt;ref name=link&gt;{{harvnb|Link|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sea level rise ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimate global mean [[sea-level rise]] from 1990 to 2100 to be between nine and eighty eight centimetres.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt; It is also predicted that with climate change there will be an increase in the intensity and frequency of storm events such as [[hurricanes]].&lt;ref name=dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=nicholls2007&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholls| Wong| Burkett| Codignotto |2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suarez&gt;{{harvnb|Suarez| Anderson| Mahal| Lakshmanan|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that coastal flooding from storm surges will become more frequent with sea level rise.&lt;ref name=dawson /&gt; A rise in sea level alone threatens increased levels of flooding and permanent [[inundation]] of low-lying land as sea level simply may exceed the land elevation.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name="michael"&gt;{{harvnb|Michael|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This therefore indicates that coastal flooding associated with sea level rise will become a significant issue into the next 100 years especially as human populations continue to grow and occupy the coastal zone.&lt;ref name=nicholls2007 /&gt;

=== Tsunami ===
Coastal areas can be significantly flooded as the result of [[tsunami]] waves&lt;ref name=cochard&gt;{{harvnb|Cochard |Ranamukhaarachchi | Shivakoti| Shipin|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which propagate through the [[ocean]] as the result of the displacement of a significant body of water through [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]] and [[glacier]] calvings. There is also evidence to suggest that significant tsunami have been caused in the past by [[meteor]] impact into the ocean.&lt;ref name=goff&gt;{{harvnb|Goff| Dominey-Howes| Chagué-Goff| Courtney|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsunami waves are so destructive due to the velocity of the approaching waves, the height of the waves when they reach land and the [[debris]] the water entrains as it flows over land can cause further damage.&lt;ref name=cochard /&gt;&lt;ref name=alongi&gt;{{harvnb|Alongi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitigation ==
It has been said that one way to prevent significant flooding of coastal areas now and into the future is by reducing global sea level rise. This could be minimised by further reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, even if significant emission decreases are achieved, there is already a substantial commitment to sea level rise into the future.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt; International climate change policies like the [[Kyoto Protocol]] are seeking to mitigate the future effects of climate change, including sea level rise.

In addition, more immediate measures of engineered and natural defences are put in place to prevent coastal flooding.

=== Engineered defences ===
[[File:53sitges.jpg|thumb|right|(Figure 1) [[Groynes]] are engineered structures that aim to prevent [[erosion]] of the beach front]]

There are a variety of ways in which humans are trying to prevent the flooding of coastal environments, gypically through so called hard engineering structures such as [[seawalls]] and [[levees]].&lt;ref name=pope /&gt;&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{harvnb|Short| Masselink|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; That armouring of the coast is typically to protect towns and cities which have developed right up to the beachfront.&lt;ref name=pope /&gt; Enhancing depositional processes along the [[coast]] can also help prevent coastal flooding. Structures such as [[groynes]] (Figure 1), [[breakwaters]] and artificial headlands promote the deposition of sediment on the beach thus helping to buffer against storm waves and surges as the wave energy is spent on moving the sediments in the beach than on moving water inland.&lt;ref name=short /&gt;

=== Natural defences ===
[[Image:Mangroves.jpg|thumb|right|(Figure 2) [[Mangroves]] are one of the coasts natural defense systems against [[storm surges]] and flooding. Their high [[biomass]] both above and below the water can help dissipate wave energy.]]

The coast does provide natural protective structures to guard against coastal flooding. These include physical features like [[gravel bars]] and [[sand dune]] systems, but also [[ecosystems]] such as [[salt marshes]] and [[mangrove]] forests (Figure 2) have a buffering function. Mangroves and [[wetlands]] are often considered to provide significant protection against storm waves, tsunamis and shoreline [[erosion]] through their ability to attenuate wave energy.&lt;ref name=griffis /&gt;&lt;ref name=alongi /&gt; To protect the coastal zone from flooding, the natural defences should therefore be protected and maintained.

== Responses ==
As coastal flooding is typically a natural process, it is inherently difficult to prevent flood occurrence.  If human systems are affected by flooding, an adaption to how that system operates on the coast through behavioural and institutional changes is required, these changes are the so-called ''non-structural'' mechanisms of coastal flooding response.&lt;ref name=dawson2011&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson| Ball| Werritty| Werritty|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Building code|Building regulations]], coastal [[hazard]] zoning, urban development planning, spreading the risk through [[insurance]] and enhancing public awareness are some ways of achieving this.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name=dawson2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=snoussi&gt;{{harvnb|Snoussi| Ouchani| Niazi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting to the risk of flood occurrence, can be the best option if the cost of building defence structures outweighs any benefits or if the natural processes in that stretch of coastline add to its natural character and attractiveness.&lt;ref name=pope /&gt; A more extreme and often difficult to accept response to coastal flooding is abandoning the area (also known as managed retreat) prone to flooding.&lt;ref name=gallien /&gt; This however raises issues for where the people and [[infrastructure]] affected would go and what sort of [[Damages|compensation]] should/could be paid.

== Social and economic impacts ==
The [[coastal zone]] (the area both within 100 kilometres distance of the coast and 100 metres elevation of sea level) is home to a large and growing proportion of the global population.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name=dawson /&gt; Over 50 percent of the global population and 65 percent of cities with populations over five million people are in the coastal zone.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt| Watkiss|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the significant number of people at risk of coastal flooding, these coastal urban centres are producing a considerable amount of the global [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP).&lt;ref name=dawson /&gt; People's lives, homes, businesses and city infrastructure like roads, railways and industrial plants are all at risk of coastal flooding with massive potential social and economic costs.&lt;ref name=suarez /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomita"&gt;{{harvnb|Tomita| Imamura| Arikawa| Yasuda|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nadal"&gt;{{harvnb|Nadal | Zapata| Pagán| López|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunami]] in [[Indonesia]] in 2004 and in [[Japan]] in March 2011 clearly illustrate the devastation coastal flooding can produce. Indirect economic costs can be incurred if economically important sandy [[beaches]] are eroded away resulting in a loss of [[tourism]] in areas dependent on the attractiveness of those beaches.&lt;ref name=snoussi /&gt;

== Environmental impacts ==
Coastal flooding can result in a wide variety of environmental impacts on different spatial and temporal scales. Flooding can destroy coastal habitats such as coastal [[wetlands]] and [[estuaries]] and can erode dune systems.&lt;ref name=gallien /&gt;&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name=snoussi /&gt;&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt; These places are characterised by their high [[biological diversity]] therefore coastal flooding can cause significant biodiversity loss and potentially species [[extinctions]].&lt;ref name=cochard /&gt; In addition to this, these coastal features are the coasts natural buffering system against storm waves; consistent coastal flooding and sea level rise can cause this natural protection to be reduced allowing waves to penetrate greater distances inland exacerbating erosion and furthering coastal flooding.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt; Prolonged [[inundation]] of [[seawater]] after flooding can also cause [[salination]] of agriculturally productive soils thus resulting in a loss of productivity for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref name=snoussi /&gt; Food [[crops]] and [[forests]] can be completely killed off by salination of soils or wiped out by the movement of flood waters.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt; Coastal freshwater bodies including [[lake]]s, [[lagoons]] and coastal freshwater [[aquifers]] can also be affected by [[saltwater intrusion]].&lt;ref name=gallien /&gt;&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt; This can destroy these water bodies as habitats for freshwater organisms and sources of drinking water for towns and cities.&lt;ref name=nicholls /&gt;&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Image:thames.barrier.5.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|(Figure 3.) The [[Thames Barrier]] provides flood control for London, U.K.]]

Examples of existing coastal flooding issues include:

=== London and the Thames Barrier===
The Thames Barrier (Fig. 3) is one of the world's largest flood barriers and serves to protect [[London]] from flooding during exceptionally high tides and storm surges.&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt;&lt;ref name=horner&gt;{{harvnb|Horner|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barrier can be lifted at high tide to prevent sea waters flooding London and can be lowered to release storm water runoff from the Thames catchment (for more information see [[Thames Barrier]])

[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|right|(Figure 4.) Significant flooding in New Orleans as a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the failure of the city's flood protection systems]]

=== South Canterbury Plains in New Zealand ===
Flooding of this low-lying coastal zone can result in prolonged inundation, which can affect the productivity of the affected pastoral agriculture for several years.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

=== Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans ===
[[Hurricane Katrina]] made landfall as a category 3 [[cyclone]] on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]], indicating that it had become an only moderate level storm.&lt;ref name=link /&gt; However the catastrophic damage caused by the extensive flooding (Fig. 4) was the result of the highest recorded storm surges in [[North America]].&lt;ref name=link /&gt; For several days prior to landfall of Katrina, wave set up was generated by the persistent winds of the [[cyclonic rotation]] of the system. This prolonged wave set up coupled with the very low central pressure level meant massive storm surges were generated.&lt;ref name=ebersole&gt;{{harvnb|Ebersole| Westerink| Bunya| Dietrich|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm surges overtopped and breached the [[levees]] and flood walls intended to protect the city from inundation.&lt;ref name=griffis /&gt;&lt;ref name=link /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebersole /&gt; Unfortunately [[New Orleans]] is inherently prone to coastal flooding for a number of factors. Firstly, much of New Orleans is below sea level and is bordered by the [[Mississippi River]] therefore protection against flooding from both the sea and the river has become dependent on engineered structures. Land use change and modification to natural systems in the Mississippi River have rendered the natural defences for the city less effective. [[Wetland]] loss has been calculated to be around {{convert|1900|sqmi|abbr=off|-1}} since 1930. This is a significant amount as four miles of wetland are estimated to reduce the height of a [[storm surge]] by one foot (30 centimetres).&lt;ref name=griffis /&gt;

[[Image:US Navy 050102-N-9593M-040 A village near the coast of Sumatra lays in ruin after the Tsunami that struck South East Asia.jpg|thumb|right|(Figure 5.) A village near the coast of [[Sumatra]] lies in ruin on 2 January 2005 after the devastating [[tsunami]] that struck on Boxing Day 2004]]

=== Indonesia and Japan post earthquake and tsunamis ===
An [[earthquake]] of approximately magnitude 9.0 struck off the coast of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] causing the propagation of a massive [[tsunami]] throughout the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=alongi /&gt; This tsunami caused significant loss of human life, an estimate of 280,000 – 300,000 people has been reported &lt;ref name=cochard /&gt; and caused extensive damage to villages, towns and cities (Fig. 5) and to the physical environment. The natural structures and habitats destroyed or damaged included [[coral reefs]], mangroves, beaches and seagrass beds.&lt;ref name=alongi /&gt; The more recent earthquake and tsunami in [[Japan]] in March 2012 also clearly illustrates the destructive power of tsunamis and the turmoil of coastal flooding.

== Future research ==
There is a need for future research into:

*Management strategies for dealing with the forced abandonment of coastal settlements
*Quantifying the effectiveness of natural buffering systems, such as mangroves, against coastal flooding
*Better engineering design and practices or alternative mitigation strategies to engineering

[[File:Varing Osmussaar.JPG|thumb|Collapsed [[Ordovician]] [[limestone]] bank showing [[coastal erosion]]. NW [[Osmussaar]], [[Estonia]].]]
'''Coastal geography'''  is the study of the constantly changing region between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the [[physical geography]] (i.e. coastal [[geomorphology]], [[geology]] and [[oceanography]]) and the [[human geography]] ([[sociology]] and [[history]]) of the coast. It includes understanding coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, [[sediment]] movement and weather, and  the ways in which humans interact with the coast

==Wave action and longshore drift==
[[Image:Portcampbellcliffs.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Port Campbell in southern Australia is a high-energy shoreline.]]
The waves of different strengths that constantly hit against the shoreline are the primary movers and shapers of the coastline. Despite the simplicity of this process, the differences between waves and the rocks they hit result in hugely varying shapes.

The effect that waves have depends on their strength. Strong waves, also called destructive waves, occur on high-energy beaches and are typical of winter. They reduce the quantity of sediment present on the beach by carrying it out to bars under the sea. Constructive, weak waves are typical of low-energy beaches and occur most during summer. They do the opposite to destructive waves and increase the size of the beach by piling sediment up onto the berm.

One of the most important transport mechanisms results from [[wave refraction]]. Since waves rarely break onto a shore at right angles, the upward movement of water onto the [[beach]] (swash) occurs at an oblique angle. However, the return of water (backwash) is at right angles to the beach, resulting in the net movement of beach material laterally. This movement is known as beach drift (Figure 3). The endless cycle of swash and backwash and resulting beach drift can be observed on all beaches. This may differ between coasts.

[[Image:RhossiliBeach.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Rhossili in Wales is a low-energy shoreline.]]
Probably the most important effect is [[longshore drift]] (LSD)(Also known as Littoral Drift), the process by which sediment is continuously moved along beaches by wave action. LSD occurs because waves hit the shore at an angle, pick up sediment (sand) on the shore and carry it down the beach at an angle (this is called swash). Due to gravity, the water then falls back perpendicular to the beach, dropping its sediment as it loses energy (this is called backwash). The sediment is then picked up by the next wave and pushed slightly further down the beach, resulting in a continual movement of sediment in one direction. This is the reason why long strips of coast are covered in sediment, not just the areas around river mouths, which are the main sources of beach sediment. LSD is reliant on a constant supply of sediment from rivers and if sediment supply is stopped or sediment falls into a [[submarine canals]] at any point along a beach, this can lead to bare beaches further along the shore.

LSD helps create many landforms including [[barrier island]]s, bay beaches and [[Spit (landform)|spits]]. In general LSD action serves to straighten the coast because the creation of barriers cuts off [[Headlands and bays|bays]] from the sea while sediment usually builds up in bays because the waves there are weaker (due to wave refraction), while sediment is carried away from the exposed [[Headlands and bays|headlands]]. The lack of sediment on headlands removes the protection of waves from them and makes them more vulnerable to weathering while the gathering of sediment in bays (where longshore drift is unable to remove it) protects the bays from further erosion and makes them pleasant [[recreational beaches]].

==Atmospheric processes==

* Onshore winds blowing "up" the beach, pick up sand and move it up the beach to form [[sand dunes]].
* Rain hits the shore and erodes rocks, and carries weathered material to the shoreline to form beaches.
* Warm weather can encourage biological processes to occur more rapidly. In tropical areas some plants and animals protect stones from weathering, while other plants and animals actually eat away at the rocks.
* Temperatures that vary from below to above freezing point result in [[frost weathering]], whereas weather more than a few degrees below freezing point creates [[sea ice]].

==Biological processes==
In tropical regions in particular, plants and animals not only affect the weathering of rocks but are a source of sediment themselves. The shells and skeletons of many organisms are of calcium carbonate and when this is broken down it forms sediment, [[limestone]] and [[clay]].

==Physical processes==
The main physical Weathering process on beaches is [[Weathering#Salt-crystal growth|salt-crystal growth]]. Wind carries salt spray onto rocks, where it is absorbed into small pores and cracks within the rocks. There the water evaporates and the salt crystallises, creating pressure and often breaking down the rock. In some beaches calcium carbonate is able to bind together other sediments to form [[beachrock]] and in warmer areas [[dunerock]]. Wind erosion is also a form of erosion, dust and sand is carried around in the air and slowly erodes rock, this happens in a similar way in the sea were the salt and sand is washed up onto the rocks.

==Sea level changes (eustatic change)==
The sea level on earth regularly rises and falls due to climatic changes. During cold periods more of the Earth’s water is stored as ice in glaciers while during warm periods it is released and sea levels rise to cover more land. Sea levels are currently quite high, while just 18,000 years ago during the [[Pleistocene]] ice age they were quite low. [[Global warming]] may result in further rises in the future, which presents a risk to coastal cities as most would be flooded by only small rises. As sea levels rise, [[fjords]] and [[ria]]s form. Fjords are flooded [[glacial valleys]] and rias are flooded river valleys. Fjords typically have steep rocky sides, while rias have dendritic drainage patterns typical of drainage zones. As [[tectonic plates]] move about the Earth they can rise and fall due to changing pressures and the presence of glaciers. If a beach is moving upwards relative to other plates this is known as isostatic change and [[raised beaches]] can be formed.
{{See also|Beach evolution}}

==Land level changes (isostatic change)==
This is found in the U.K. as above the line from the Wash to the Severn estuary, the land was covered in ice sheets during the last ice age. The weight of the ice caused northeast Scotland to sink, displacing the southeast and forcing it to rise. As the ice sheets receded the reverse process happened, as the land was released from the weight. At current estimates the southeast is sinking at a rate of about 2&amp;nbsp;mm per year, with northeast Scotland rising by the same amount.

==Coastal landforms==

===Spits===
[[Image:Chesil and fortuneswell.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Chesil Beach]], a [[tombolo]] in [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]].]]
If the coast suddenly changes direction, especially around an estuary, spits are likely to form. [[Long shore drift]] pushes the sediment along the beach but when it reaches a turn as in the diagram, the long shore drift does not always easily turn with it, especially near an estuary where the outward flow from a river may push sediment away from the coast. The area may be also be shielded from wave action, preventing much long shore drift. On the side of the headland receiving weaker waves, shingle and other large sediments will build up under the water where waves are not strong enough to move them along. This provides a good place for smaller sediments to build up to sea level. The sediment, after passing the headland will accumulate on the other side and not continue down the beach, sheltered both by the headland and the shingle.

Slowly over time sediment simply builds on this area, extending the spit outwards, forming a barrier of sand. Once in a while, the wind direction will change and come from the other direction. During this period the sediment will be pushed along in the other direction. The spit will start to grow backwards, forming a 'hook'. After this time the spit will grow again in the original direction. Eventually the spit will not be able to grow any further because it is no longer sufficiently sheltered from erosion by waves, or because the estuary current prevents sediment resting.  Usually in the salty but calm waters behind the spit there will form a salt marshland. Spits often form around the breakwater of artificial harbours requiring dredging.

Occasionally, if there is no estuary then it is possible for the spit to grow across to the other side of the bay and form what is called a bar, or barrier. Barriers come in several varieties, but all form in a manner similar to spits. They usually enclose a bay to form a lagoon. They can join two headlands or join a headland to the mainland. When an island is joined to the mainland with a bar or barrier it is known as a tombolo. This usually occurs due to wave refraction, but can also be caused by isostatic change, a change in the level of the land (e.g. [[Chesil Beach]]). An example of this is along the [[Holderness]] coastline.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Dr. '''Colin Skinner''' (born 1965) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] author, adventurer and [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] who is attempting to walk around the world.  As of mid-2014, he has walked over {{convert|14500|mi|km}} and has crossed [[Great Britain]], [[Iceland]], [[United States|America]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Meet Doctor Colin Skinner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/zealand/meet.htm |title=Meet Doctor Colin Skinner |publisher=Teacher.scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has used the walks to raise money and awareness for various causes, including [[conservation biology]], people with [[disabilities]], cancer relief, [[AIDS]], and [[hospice]].

==Education==
Skinner earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.) combined honours degree in [[biochemistry]] and [[genetics]] from the [[University of Leeds]].  He earned his [[PhD]] in [[molecular biology]] from [[University College London]].  He earned his [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) in secondary science from [[Canterbury Christ Church University]].

==Walking around the world==

===Scotland to England in 1984===
He began at the age of 18 at [[John o' Groats]] (at the northern tip of [[Scotland]]) in 1984, and walked to [[Land's End]] in [[England]].  On this journey, which he carried out with three other people, he pushed a wheelchair {{convert|1000|mi|km}} and raised £3,500 for The Forelands School for handicapped children.  In 1983, he had already run {{convert|21|mi|km}} around a 400-metre track to raise further money for The Forelands School for handicapped children, at [[Broadstairs]] in [[Kent]].

===Iceland in 1986===
In 1986, at the age of 20, whilst at the University of Leeds, he crossed [[Iceland]], together with three other people, from [[Seyðisfjörður]] in the east, through the interior to the north of the [[Vatnajökull]] ice fields, and then west to [[Reykjavík]].  The team encountered an 'ash storm', where storm force winds had whipped up fine black [[volcanic ash]], and had to wear goggles and face masks to push on into the winds.  In the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Vatnajökull]], they ran out of water, then encountered a flash flood, as mud rushed down from the melting [[glaciers]]. They also had to survive on food contaminated with [[petrol]] that had leaked from their [[petrol]] stoves.  This journey of {{convert|400|mi|km}} raised £2,000 for the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation.  As part of the training for the walk across Iceland he ran the Leeds Marathon, in a time of 3 hours and 41 minutes.

On the Icelandic trek, he came up with the idea of walking {{convert|6000|mi|km}}, across Britain and America to raise money for [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] in Britain and [[Hospice care|hospice]] in America and [[Canada]].

===Scotland to England in 1988===
On 1 May 1988, he set off again from [[John o' Groats]], this time walking through the [[West Highlands]], down the [[Pennine Way]] and then south to [[Land's End]]: a distance of {{convert|1100|mi|km}} in seven weeks.  As part of the training for this walk he ran the gruelling [[Snowdonia Marathon]], in a time of 4 hours and 40 minutes.  The walk through Scotland and England raised £2,000 for [[Macmillan Cancer Support]].&lt;ref&gt;''Taking a walk across America,'' [[East Kent Mercury and Dover Mercury|East Kent Mercury]], 7 July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across the U.S.A. in 1988/1989===
[[Image:TETON7.JPG|thumb|left|Colin Skinner walking by the [[Teton Mountains]]]]

The journey across the [[United States]] began on 15 July 1988.  On the journey he slept in bushes beneath the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], camped outside [[Kennedy Airport]] in a tent, then headed west.  On [[Staten Island]] he collapsed from heat exhaustion at 105 degrees [[Fahrenheit]].  In [[Utah]] the temperatures went down to minus 30 [[Fahrenheit]].  Carrying a tent and a backpack, with no backup, he walked alone to [[Niagara Falls]], through [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]], to [[Detroit]], between the [[Great Lakes]], across the [[Great Plains]], through the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] in winter, to [[Yellowstone National Park]], then south to the [[Grand Canyon]], on to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], through [[Death Valley]] and then snowshoed over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] to reach [[San Francisco]].  In Death Valley, down to his last $13, Skinner found $200 in the desert, and he had $1 left when he crossed the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] to reach [[Yosemite]] Valley.  The total distance he walked from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]], was {{convert|4952|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Scotland to S.F. 6,000-Mile Hike for Hospices'' San Francisco Chronicle, 22 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On the journey he visited 70 hospices and appeared on television, radio and in newspapers to encourage support for hospices across the U.S. and [[Canada]].  The mayor of [[San Francisco]], [[Art Agnos]], proclaimed 21 March 1989, "Colin Skinner Day," in recognition of the attention he brought to the work of hospices with [[AIDS]] patients in the city.

Returning to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] after this walk, he obtained a job as a research assistant in Chemical [[Pathology]] at the [[Middlesex Hospital]] and went on to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[Molecular Biology]] at [[University College London]].  In 1992, whilst studying for his PhD, he also ran the [[London Marathon]], in a time of 4 hours and 41 minutes, to raise money to buy a computer for a young boy with physical disabilities.  Skinner's PhD involved developing genetic tests to detect [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in children.&lt;ref&gt;Rumsby, G., Skinner, C., Lee, H.A. &amp; Honour, J.W. (1992).  Combined 17α-hydroxylase/ 17,20 lyase deficiency caused by heterozygous stop codons in the cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase gene.  ''Clin. Endocrinol.'' '''39''':483-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had work published in a number of scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;Rumsby, G., Skinner, C. and Honour, J.W. (1992). Genetic analysis of the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene following ''in vitro'' amplification of genomic DNA.  ''J. Steroid. Biochem.'' '''41''':827-829.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he had his work published in ''Human Molecular Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, C.A. &amp; Rumsby, G. (1994). Steroid 11β-hydroxylase deficiency caused by a five base pair duplication in the ''CYP11B1'' gene.  ''Hum. Mol. Genet.'' '''3''':377-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Skinner married Dr. Monica Schneider (also a molecular biologist), and in 1996 their son James was born.  From 1994 to 1996 Skinner worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Keeney D.S., Skinner C., Travers J.B., Capdevila J.H., Nanney L.B., King L.E. Jr., Waterman M.R.(1998).  Differentiating keratinocytes express a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP2B19, having arachidonate monooxygenase activity.  ''J. Biol. Chem.'' 273 '''48''':32071-32079.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work he carried out there involved [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] and [[protein purification]] of [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes.  His work was published in the ''Journal of Biological Chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;Keeney D.S., Skinner C., Wei S., Friedberg T., Waterman M.R. (1998). A keratinocyte-specific epoxygenase, CYP2B12, metabolizes [[arachidonic acid]] with unusual selectivity producing a single major epoxyeicosatrienoic acid.  ''J. Biol. Chem.'' 273 '''15''':9279-9284&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1996 to 1997 Skinner took care of his infant son, James, whilst his wife continued to work at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]].

===New Zealand in 1998===
In 1998 he walked from [[Cape Reinga]] in the North Island, to [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]], at the southern tip of [[New Zealand]]; a distance of {{convert|1500|mi|km}}.  On the journey he walked through the active [[volcano]] at [[Whakaari/White Island|White Island]], experienced earthquakes up to 4.9 on the [[Richter Scale]], clambered over [[glaciers]], swam with [[pinniped|seals]] and reported on [[conservation biology]] projects involving [[endangered species]].  Information from the journey was posted on the [[Internet]] for schoolchildren in the U.S. via the [[Scholastic Corporation]] Scholastic Network.&lt;ref name="Meet Doctor Colin Skinner"/&gt; In December 2010 Skinner completed a book about the journey and [[conservation biology]], ''New Zealand - 1500 miles on foot through - The Land Of The Long White Cloud'' on an [[Internet]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/story/2098040-new-zealand |title=New Zealand 1500 miles on foot through The Land Of The Long White Cloud |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he obtained a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] (Postgraduate Certificate in Education) from [[Canterbury Christ Church University]] in [[Canterbury]], England.  In 2000 he worked as a secondary school science teacher at St. Edmund's School in [[Dover]], teaching 11 to 16-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;''What is it about teaching that's enticing so many of us Back to School?''  The Sunday Express Magazine, 7 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he worked as a volunteer at a wildlife park, working on enrichment activities for animals.  From 2001 until 2003 he worked part-time at a [[post office]]. During this time, he also taught science to primary school children, in a 'Link-Scientist' scheme run by the pharmaceutical company [[Pfizer]], and took care of his son.

In 2003 his mother died from [[pancreatic cancer]], at the age of 59.  This prompted him to write the story of the {{convert|6000|mi|km}} journey across [[Great Britain|Britain]] and America.  In 2006 he finished the book ''Beyond the Setting Sun'', with an introduction by [[Ranulph Fiennes]], the renowned polar explorer and adventurer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/drskinnersite/ranulphfiennesview.htm Dr. Colin Skinner's Site | Walking 6000 miles for hospice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written to raise money for hospices in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Canada]] and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wattpad.com/story/2094649-beyond-the-setting-sun |title=Beyond the Setting Sun |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland to England in 2007===
On 29 April 2007, he began walking again at [[John o' Groats]] and arrived at [[Land's End]] on 8 June, having covered {{convert|900|mi|km}} in 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/ |title=news, entertainment, jobs, homes and cars |publisher=this is cornwall |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the walk in Britain he visited 20 hospices and raised £10,000 for hospice through sales of his ''Beyond the Setting Sun'' book.

===U.S.A. in 2009===
[[Image:Colin Skinner in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Colin Skinner wearing a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] during snow storm in [[North Dakota]]]]

Starting on 22 August 2009, he walked from [[Kennedy Airport]] in [[New York City]] to within 15 miles of [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devil's Lake]], [[North Dakota]].  This was a distance of {{convert|2053|mi|km}} and Skinner stopped his journey on 3 December 2009, after 3 days with windchills down to -30 [[Fahrenheit]].  During the trip Skinner had to make incisions in his feet to relieve the [[pressure]] from [[blisters]], suffered [[food poisoning]], met up with a [[wolf]] in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Michigan]], had to face down two wild dogs, and had [[ski masks]] frozen to his beard in [[North Dakota]].  On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2009/10dr_colin_skinner_stops_at_bria.html |title=MLive.com |publisher=MLive.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808063001/http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2009/10dr_colin_skinner_stops_at_bria.html |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a daily blog for the National Hospice Foundation.&lt;ref name="nationalhospicefoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhospicefoundation.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=368 |title=Colin Skinner Is Walking—and Blogging—from NYC to Minot, ND to Raise Awareness of Hospice |publisher=National Hospice Foundation |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He met [[hospice]] patients, including one woman with a terminal illness, who said that at times she could forget she was ill, thanks to the care she received in a [[hospice]] house in [[Buffalo, New York]].  He also met a man with [[lung cancer]] who could not sleep in hospitals, where there was always someone coming to check on him. In the [[hospice]] house in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], the man had a peaceful room to himself, where he could finally get some rest.&lt;ref name="nationalhospicefoundation.org"/&gt;

===U.S.A. in 2011===
On 10 September 2011, Skinner set off from mile marker 283 on [[U.S. Route 2]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} before [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devil's Lake]], [[North Dakota]] and walked {{convert|2576|mi|km}} to [[Tuolumne Meadows]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], [[California]].  The walk took him through [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]] and into [[California]].  Skinner snow-shoed over [[Tioga Pass]] and camped in a tent in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Mountains]] for several nights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesheetnews.com/archives/12352 |title=Archives &amp;#124; The Sheet - Part 12352 |publisher=Thesheetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to stop walking after suffering from [[frostbite]] in both feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mammothtimes.com/content/walking-dying-hiker-stares-death-eye |title=Walking for the dying, hiker stares death in the eye |publisher=Mammoth Times |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspapers and encouraged support for [[hospices]] taking care of people with serious illnesses.&lt;ref name="nationalhospicefoundation.org2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhospicefoundation.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=604 |title=Walking Across North America for Hospice |publisher=National Hospice Foundation |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner is now writing a book about this journey, entitled ''America- 12000 miles on foot, a wing and a prayer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clipsyndicate.com/video/play/3151738/helping_hospice_brown_mon_01_02_2012 |title=Clip Syndicate Video: HELPING HOSPICE &amp;#124; Brown &amp;#124; MON 01/02/2012 |publisher=Clipsyndicate.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Skinner completed a short story, entitled ''Chenga'', and published this on an [[Internet]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/story/2109001-chenga |title=Chenga |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Skinner completed the second part of a [[science-fiction]] [[fantasy]] [[trilogy]], entitled ''Djara'', and published this on an [[Internet]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/story/2174701-djara |title=Djara |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner has now begun writing the third part of the [[science-fiction]] [[fantasy]] [[trilogy]], entitled ''Tau''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/story/2175992-tau |title=Tau |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chenga'', ''Djara'', ''Tau'' [[trilogy]] includes the themes of [[time travel]], [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], [[vampires]], shapeshifters, [[angels]], [[demons]] and descendants of the fabled [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] known as the [[Nephilim]].

In 2012 Skinner published four short poems: ''Gaia'', ''The Dreaming'', ''New Zealand Water Torture'' and ''Life Jim But Not As We Know It'' on an [[Internet]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/7554587-gaia |title=Gaia |publisher=Wattpad |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Debate between Winter and Summer''' or '''Myth of Emesh and Enten''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[creation myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s in the mid to late 3rd millennium [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref name="Walton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Walton|title=The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qZLAz3TckgC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=30 July 2009|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-3704-5|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputations==

Seven "debate" topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of '[[disputation]]s'; some examples are: the [[debate between sheep and grain]]; the [[debate between bird and fish]]; the [[debate between tree and the reed|tree and the reed]]; and the [[dispute between silver and copper]], etc.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian [[Mesopotamia]]. The debates are [[philosophy|philosophical]] and address humanity's place in the world.

==Compilation==

The first lines of the [[myth]] were discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section (CBS), tablet number 8310 from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. This was translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as ''"Sumerian religious texts"'' in ''"[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]"'', number seven, entitled '''"A Hymn to [[Ibbi-Sin]]"'''.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|5.5|in|cm}} by {{convert|4.75|in|cm}} by {{convert|1.6|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton describes Ibbi-Sin as an ''"inglorious King"'' suggesting the text to have been composed during his lifetime, he commented ''"The hymn provides a powerful statement for emperor worship in Ur at the time of composition."'' Ibbi-Sin is still mentioned in the modern translation ''"For my king named by Nanna, the son of Enlil, Ibbi-Sin, when he is arrayed in the 'cutur' garment and the '[[hursag]]' garment."''&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;

Another tablet from the same collection, number 8886 was documented by [[Edward Chiera]] in ''"Sumerian Epics and Myths"'', number 46.&lt;ref name="Chiera1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Chiera|title=Sumerian epics and myths, 46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFCPgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] included CBS  tablets 3167, 10431, 13857, 29.13.464, 29.16.142 (which forms a join with 8310), 29.16.232, 29.16.417, 29.16.427, 29.16.446 and 29.16.448. He also included translations from tablets in the Nippur collection of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of the Ancient Orient]] in [[Istanbul]], catalogue numbers 2705, 3167 and 4004.&lt;ref name="Kramer1944"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian literary texts from Nippur: in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqdIGQAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1944|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CigKizilyay1969"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muazzez Cig|author2=Hatice Kizilyay|title=Sumerian literary tablets and fragments in the archeological museum of Istanbul-I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrEnGwAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1969|publisher=Tarih Kurumu Basimevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further tablets from Nippur were added by Jane Heimerdinger.&lt;ref name="Heimerdinger1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane W.

==Story==

The story takes the form of a contest poem between two cultural entities first identified by Kramer as [[vegetation]] gods, [[Emesh]] and [[Enten]]. These were later identified with the natural phenomena of [[Winter]] and [[Summer]].&lt;ref name="Løkkegaard1990"/&gt; The location and occasion of the story is described in the introduction with the usual creation sequence of day and night, food and fertility, weather and seasons and [[sluice gate]]s for [[irrigation]].&lt;ref name="Walton2009"/&gt;

Enlil, the [[king]] of all lands, set his mind to increasing the good day of abundance, to making the ... night resplendent in celebration, to making [[flax]] grow, to making [[barley]] proliferate, to guaranteeing the spring floods at the quay, to making ... lengthen (?) their days in abundance, to making Summer close the sluices of heaven, and to making Winter guarantee plentiful water at the [[quay]]."''&lt;ref name="Walton2009"/&gt;}}

The two seasons are personified as brothers, born after Enlil [[copulate]]s with a "[[hursag]]" (hill). The destinies of Summer and Winter are then described, Summer founding towns and villages with plentiful harvests, Winter to bring the Spring floods.

{{cquote|''"He copulated with the great hills, he gave the mountain its share. He filled its womb with Summer and Winter, the plenitude and life of the Land. As Enlil copulated with the earth, there was a roar like a bull's. The hill spent the day at that place and at night she opened her loins. She bore Summer and Winter as smoothly as fine oil. He fed them pure plants on the terraces of the hills like great bulls. He nourished them in the pastures of the hills. Enlil set about determining the destinies of Summer and Winter. For Summer founding towns and villages, bringing in harvests of plenitude for the Great Mountain Enlil, sending labourers out to the large arable tracts, and working the fields with oxen; for Winter plenitude, the spring floods, the abundance and life of the Land, placing grain in the fields and fruitful acres, and gathering in everything – Enlil determined these as the destinies of Summer and Winter."''&lt;ref name="ETCSL"&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr533.htm The debate between Winter and Summer., Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Robson, E., and Zólyomi, G., The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998–.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The two brothers soon decide to take their gifts to [[Enlil]]'s "house of life", the [[E-namtila]], where they begin a debate about their relative merits. Summer argues:

{{cquote|''"Your straw bundles are for the oven-side, hearth and kiln. Like a herdsman or shepherd encumbered by sheep and lambs, helpless people run like sheep from oven-side to kiln, and from kiln to oven-side, in the face of you. In sunshine ...... you reach decisions, but now in the city people's teeth chatter because of you.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

To which Winter replies:

{{cquote|''"Father Enlil, you gave me control of [[irrigation]]; you brought plentiful [[water]]. I made one [[meadow]] adjacent to another and I heaped high the [[granaries]]. The grain became thick in the furrows ... Summer, a bragging field-administrator who does not know the extent of the field, ... my thighs grown tired from toil. ... tribute has been produced for the king's [[palace]]. Winter admires the heart of your ... in words."''&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

Enlil eventually intervenes and declares Winter the winner of the debate and there is a scene of [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]]. Bendt Alster explains ''"Winter prevails over Summer, because Winter provides the water that was so essential to agriculture in the hot climate of ancient [[Mesopotamia]]."''&lt;ref name="Løkkegaard1990"/&gt;

{{cquote|''"Enlil answered Summer and Winter: "Winter is controller of the life-giving waters of all the lands – the farmer of the gods produces everything. Summer, my son, how can you compare yourself to your brother Winter?" The import of the exalted word Enlil speaks is artfully wrought, the verdict he pronounces is one which cannot be altered – who can change it? Summer bowed to Winter and offered him a prayer. In his house he prepared [[emmer]]-[[beer]] and [[wine]]. At its side they spend the day at a succulent [[banquet]]. Summer presents Winter with [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[lapis lazuli]]. They pour out brotherhood and friendship like best [[oil]]. By bringing sweet words to the quarrel (?) they have achieved harmony with each other. In the dispute between Summer and Winter, Winter, the faithful farmer of Enlil, was superior to Summer – praise be to the Great [[Mountain]], father Enlil!"''&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

==Discussion==

John Walton wrote that ''"people in the Ancient Near East did not think of creation in terms of making material things – instead, everything is function oriented. Creation thus constituted bringing order to the cosmos from an originally nonfunctional condition. Consequently, to create something (cause it to exist) in the ancient world means to give it a function, not material properties."''&lt;ref name="Walton2009"/&gt; [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] has noted this myth ''"is the closest extant Sumerian parallel to the Biblical [[Cain and Abel]] story"'' in the [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|4:1–16|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Kramer1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian mythology: a study of spiritual and literary achievement in the third millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t16tDOHZLLEC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=9 June 2011|year=1961|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-60506-049-1|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection has been made by other scholars.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The disputation form  has also been suggested to have similar elements to the discussions between [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and his friends in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref name="Perdue1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo G.

J.J.A. van Dijk analysed the myth and determined the following common elements with other Sumerian debates ''"(1) Introduction, presenting the disputants and the occasion of the dispute; (2) the dispute itself, in which each party praises himself and attacks the other; (3) judgement uttered by a god, followed by reconciliation; (4) a formula of praise."''&lt;ref name="Dijk1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Eliade and Adams note that in the story, the water flows through the "hursag" (foothills), Enlil is identified as a "[[kurgal]]" (mountain) and his main temple being the "[[eKur]]" (mountain house), they link this mountain aspect with Enlil being the "Lord of the winds" by suggesting the ancients believed the winds originated in the mountains.&lt;ref name="EliadeAdams1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mircea Eliade|author2=Charles J.

It was established in 2009 when the former [[Department of Minerals and Energy (South Africa)|Department of Minerals and Energy]] was divided into the Department of Energy and the [[Department of Mineral Resources]].

From 2012 to 2014, the [[Minister of Energy (South Africa)|Minister of Energy]] was Ben Martins and his deputy was [[Barbara Thompson (South African politician)|Barbara Thompson]]. [[Tina Joemat-Pettersson]] MP has been the Minister of Energy since 25 May 2014 .

'''Direct energy conversion''' (DEC) or simply '''direct conversion''' converts a charged particle's [[kinetic energy]] into a [[voltage]]. It is a scheme for power extraction from [[nuclear fusion]].

[[File:Direct Converter.jpeg|thumbnail|A basic direct converter]]

== History and theoretical underpinnings ==

=== Electrostatic direct collectors ===

In the middle of the 1960s direct energy conversion was proposed as a method for capturing the energy from the exhaust gas in a [[fusion reactor]]. This would generate a [[direct current]] of electricity. [[Richard F. Post]] at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was an early proponent of the idea.&lt;ref name="Post 1969 (a)"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Post |first=Richard F. |title=Direct Conversion of Thermal Energy of High Temperature Plasma |date=November 1969 |journal=Bulletin of the American Physical Society |volume=14 |issue=11 |page=1052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post reasoned that capturing the energy would require five steps:&lt;ref name="Post 1969 (b)"&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Post |first=Richard F.  |title=Mirror Systems: Fuel Cycles, Loss Reduction and Energy Recovery |conference=BNES Nuclear Fusion Reactor Conference
 |date=September 1969 |location=Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Oxfordshire, U.K. |publisher=British Nuclear Energy Society |pages=87–111 |url=http://www.askmar.com/Fusion_files/Mirror%20Systems.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) Ordering the charged particles into linear beam. (2) Separation of positives and negatives. (3) Separating the ions into groups, by their energy.  (4) Gathering these ions as they touch collectors. (5) Using these collectors as the positive side in a circuit. Post argued that the efficiency was theoretically determined by the number of collectors.

====The Venetian blind====
Designs in the early 1970s by William Barr and Ralph Moir used metal ribbons at an angle to collect these ions. This was called the Venetian Blind design, because the ribbons look like [[window blinds]]. Those metal ribbon-like surfaces are more transparent to ions going forward than to ions going backward. Ions pass through surfaces of successively increasing potential until they turn and start back, along a [[parabolic trajectory]]. They then see opaque surfaces and are caught. Thus ions are sorted by energy with high-energy ions being caught on high-potential electrodes.&lt;ref name="Moir 1973"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0029-5515/13/1/005| title = "Venetian-blind" direct energy converter for fusion reactors| journal = Nuclear Fusion| volume = 13| pages = 35| year = 1973| last1 = Moir | first1 = R.

As each ion is decelerated along the channel toward zero energy, the particle becomes "over-focused" and is deflected sideways from the beam, then collected. The Periodic Electrostatic Focusing converter typically operates with a 600 keV D-T plasma (as low as 400 keV and up to 800 keV) with efficiency of about 60% under conditions compatible with economics, and an upper technical conversion efficiency up to 90% ignoring economic limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

=== Induction systems ===

==== Conduction systems ====
{{main|Magnetohydrodynamic generator}}
From the 1960s through the 1970s, methods have been developed to extract [[electrical energy]] directly from a hot gas (a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) in motion within a channel fitted with [[electromagnet]]s (producing a transverse [[magnetic field]]), and [[electrode]]s (connected to load [[resistor]]s). [[Charge carrier]]s (free [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s) incoming with the flow are then separated by the [[Lorentz force]] and an [[Voltage|electric potential difference]] can be retrieved from pairs of connected electrodes. [[Shock tube]]s used as pulsed MHD generators were for example able to produce several [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]]s of [[electricity]] in channels the size of a [[beverage can]].&lt;ref name="Sutton-Sherman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sutton |first1=George W. |last2=Sherman |first2=Arthur |title=Engineering Magnetohydrodynamics |publisher=Dover Publications |series=Dover Civil and Mechanical Engineering |date=July 2006 |isbn=978-0486450322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetic compression-expansion direct energy converter is analogous to the [[internal combustion engine]]. As the hot plasma expands against a [[magnetic field]], in a manner similar to hot gases expanding against a piston, part of the energy of the internal plasma is [[Electromagnetic induction|inductively]] converted to an [[electromagnetic coil]], as an [[Electromotive force|EMF]] ([[voltage]]) in the conductor.

This scheme is best used with pulsed devices, because the converter then works like a "magnetic [[four-stroke engine]]":
# '''Compression''': A column of plasma is compressed by a magnetic field that acts like a piston.
# '''Thermonuclear burn''': The compression heats the plasma to the thermonuclear ignition temperature.
# '''Expansion/Power''': The expansion of fusion reaction products (charged particles) increases the plasma pressure and pushes the magnetic field outward. A voltage is induced and collected in the electromagnetic coil.
# '''Exhaust/Refuel''': After expansion, the partially burned fuel is flushed out, and new fuel in the form of gas is introduced and ionized; and the cycle starts again.

In 1973, a team from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] laboratories stated that the thermodynamic efficiency of the magnetic direct conversion cycle from [[alpha-particle]] energy to work is 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0029-5515/13/4/006| title = Direct conversion of thermonuclear plasma energy by high magnetic compression and expansion| journal = Nuclear Fusion| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 529| year = 1973| last1 = Oliphant | first1 = T.

=== Traveling-wave direct energy converter ===

In 1992, a Japan–U.S. joint-team proposed a novel direct energy conversion system for 14.7 MeV [[proton]]s produced by D-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He fusion reactions, whose energy is too high for electrostatic converters.&lt;ref name="Momota 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal

The conversion is based on a Traveling-Wave Direct Energy Converter (TWDEC). A [[gyrotron]] converter first guides fusion product ions as a beam into a 10-meter long microwave cavity filled with a 10-tesla magnetic field, where 155&amp;nbsp;MHz microwaves are generated and converted to a high voltage DC output through [[rectenna]]s.

The [[Field-Reversed Configuration]] reactor ARTEMIS in this study was designed with an efficiency of 75%. The traveling-wave direct converter has a maximum projected efficiency of 90%.&lt;ref name="Rostoker 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.278.5342.1419 |pmid=9367946 |title=Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5342 |pages=1419–22 |year=1997 |last1=Rostoker |first1=N. |last2=Binderbauer |first2=M.

===Inverse cyclotron converter (ICC)===

Original direct converters were designed to extract the energy carried by 100 to 800 keV ions produced by D-T fusion reactions. Those electrostatic converters are not suitable for higher energy product ions above 1 MeV generated by other fusion fuels like the D-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He or the ''p''-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B [[aneutronic fusion]] reactions.

A much shorter device than the Traveling-Wave Direct Energy Converter has been proposed in 1997 and patented by [[Tri Alpha Energy, Inc.]] as an Inverse [[Cyclotron]] Converter (ICC).&lt;ref name="grant_2005"&gt;{{Cite patent

===X-ray photoelectric converter===

A significant amount of the energy released by fusion reactions is composed of [[electromagnetic radiation]]s, essentially [[X-ray]]s due to [[Bremsstrahlung]]. Those X-rays can not be converted into electric power with the various electrostatic and magnetic direct energy converters listed above, and their energy is lost.

Whereas more classical thermal conversion has been considered with the use of a radiation/boiler/energy exchanger where the X-ray energy is absorbed by a working fluid at temperatures of several thousand degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An '''ecological crisis''' occurs when changes to the [[natural environment|environment]] of a [[species]] or [[population]] destabilizes its continued survival.  A few possible causes include:

*Degradation of an abiotic [[ecological factor]] (for example, increase of temperature, less significant rainfalls)
*Increased pressures from [[predation]]
*Rise in the number of individuals ([[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aus.ac.in/ICGCEG_2013%20Concept%20Note%20and%20RegForm%20date%2020-4-2013.pdf|title= International Conference On Glo-Cal Crisis And Environmental Governance In North- Eastern Region Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of evolution|evolutionary theory]] of [[punctuated equilibrium]] sees infrequent ecological crises as a potential driver of rapid evolution.

== Abiotic factors ==

Climate change is starting to have major impacts on ecosystems. With [[Global warming|global temperature rising]], there is a decrease in snow-fall, and sea levels are rising. Ecosystems will change or evolve to cope with the increase in temperature.  Consequently, many species are being driven out of their habitats.

Polar bears are being threatened. They need ice for hunting seals, their primary prey. However, the ice caps are melting, making their hunting periods shorter each year. As a result, the polar bears are not developing enough fat for the winter; therefore, they are not able to reproduce at a healthy rate.

Fresh water and wetland [[ecosystem]]s are dealing with extreme effects of the increase of temperature. The climate change could be devastating to salmon and trout and to other aquatic life. The increase in temperature will disrupt the current life patterns of the salmon and trout. The cold-water fish will eventually leave their natural geographical range to live in cooler waters by migrating to higher elevations.

While many species have been able to adapt to the new conditions by moving their range further towards the poles, other species are not as fortunate. The option to move is not available for polar bears and for some aquatic life.

== Biodiversity extinction ==

Due to increase in ecological crisis,vast numbers of species are being annihilated. Every year between 17,000 and 100,000 species vanish from the planet. The speed in which species are becoming extinct is much faster than in the past.  The last [[mass extinction]] was caused by [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|a meteor collision 66 million years ago]].

The loss of new species in an ecosystem will eventually affect all living creatures. In the U.S. and Canada, there was a dramatic reduction of shark population along the U.S. east coast. Since then, there has been an increase in population of rays and skates, which in turn has decimated the population of shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overfishing Large Sharks Impacts Entire Marine Ecosystem, Shrinks Shellfish Supply|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070329145922.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of shellfish has reduced the water quality and the size of sea grass beds. [[Biodiversity]] is being lost at a fast rate. The more species there are in an ecosystem, the more [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] it is to evolution.

Seven million square kilometers of [[tropical forest]] have [[deforestation|vanished]] in the last 50 years. About two million square kilometers were used for crops, while the remaining five million square kilometers is poor quality land. Turning these unproductive lands back into native forest could [[Carbon capture and storage|capture]] an estimated five billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year for 10 to 20 or more years. [[Reforestation]] will have enormous benefits on biodiversity.

== Overpopulation (species) ==

In the wilderness, the problem of [[animal overpopulation]] is solved by predators. Predators tend to look for signs of weakness in their prey, and therefore usually first eat the old or sick animals. This has the side effects of ensuring a strong stock among the survivors and controlling the population.

In the absence of predators, animal species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation. In fact, an abundant supply of resources can produce a ''population boom'' that ends up with more individuals than the environment can support. In this case, starvation, thirst, and sometimes violent competition for scarce resources may effect a sharp reduction in population, and in a very short lapse, a population crash. [[Lemming]]s, as well as other less popular species of rodents, are known to have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease.

In an ideal setting, when animal populations grow, so do the number of predators that feed on that particular animal. Animals that have [[birth defect]]s or weak genes (such as the [[runt]] of the litter) also die off, unable to compete over food with stronger, healthier animals.

In reality, an animal that is not native to an environment may have advantages over the native ones, such being unsuitable for the local predators. If left uncontrolled, such an animal can quickly overpopulate and ultimately [[environmental destruction|destroy its environment]].

Examples of animal overpopulation caused by [[invasive species|introduction of a foreign species]] abound.

*In the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]], for example, European species such as the [[trout]] and the [[deer]] were introduced into the local streams and forests, respectively, and quickly became a plague, competing with and sometimes driving away the local species of fish and [[ruminant]]s.
*In [[Rabbits in australia|Australia]], when rabbits were introduced (unwillingly) by European immigrants, they bred out of control and ate the plants that other native animals needed to survive. Farmers hunted the rabbits to reduce their population and prevent the damage the rabbits did to the crops. They also brought cats to guard against rabbits and rats. These cats created another problem, since they became predators of local species.

more examples=
Some common examples of ecological crises are:

* The [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] off the coast of [[Alaska]] in 1989
* [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] 250 million years ago
* [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago
* [[Global warming]] related to the [[Greenhouse effect]]. Warming could involve flooding of the Asian deltas (see also [[eco refugee]]s), multiplication of [[extreme weather]] phenomena and changes in the  nature and quantity of the food resources (see [[Global warming and agriculture]]). See also international [[Kyoto Protocol]].
* [[Ozone layer]] depletion.
* [[Deforestation]] and [[desertification]], with disappearance of many species.
* Volcanic eruptions such as [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|Mount St. Helens]] and the [[Tunguska event|Tunguska]] and other [[impact events]]
* The [[nuclear meltdown]] at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986 caused the death of many people and animals from [[cancer]], and caused mutations in a large number of animals and people. The area around the plant is now abandoned by humans because of the large amount of radiation generated by the meltdown. Twenty years after the accident, the animals have returned.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4923342.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emulsion''' is a [[mixture]] of two or more [[liquid]]s that are normally [[immiscible]] (unmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [[matter]] called [[colloid]]s. Although the terms ''colloid'' and ''emulsion'' are sometimes used interchangeably, ''emulsion'' should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed [[phase (matter)|phase]]) is [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed]] in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include [[vinaigrette]]s, homogenized [[milk]], and some [[cutting fluid]]s for [[metal working]]. [[Graphene]] and its modified forms are also a good example of recent unconventional [[surfactant]]s helping in stabilizing emulsion systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Harish V.|last2=Woltornist|first2=Steven J.|last3=Adamson|first3=Douglas H.|date=2016-03-01|title=Fractionation and characterization of graphene oxide by oxidation extent through emulsion stabilization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622315303936|journal=Carbon|volume=98|pages=491–495|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "emulsion" comes from the Latin mulgeo, mulgere "to milk",{{Specify|reason=What is the Latin word?|date=August 2017}} as milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.

Two liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the dispersion medium. ([[Lipoproteins]], used by all complex living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a "water-in-oil-in-water" emulsion and an "oil-in-water-in-oil" emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17076645 |year=2006 |author1=Khan |first1=A.

J. |last5=Khar |first5=R. K. |doi=10.2174/156720106778559056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The droplets dispersed in the liquid matrix (called the “dispersion medium”) are usually assumed to be [[Probability distribution|statistically distributed]].

The term "emulsion" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of [[photographic film]]. Such a [[photographic emulsion]] consists of [[silver halide]] colloidal particles dispersed in a [[gelatin]] matrix. [[Nuclear emulsion]]s are similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle physics to detect high-energy [[elementary particle]]s.

{{Quote box
 |title =[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition
 |quote = Fluid system in which liquid droplets are dispersed in a liquid.

''Note 1'': The definition is based on the definition in ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology (The "Gold Book")|year=1997|publisher=[[Blackwell Scientific Publications]]|location=Oxford|author=IUPAC|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02065.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310221658/http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02065.html|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note 2'': The droplets may be amorphous, liquid-crystalline, or any&lt;br/&gt;mixture thereof.

''Note 3'': The diameters of the droplets constituting the ''[[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed phase]]''&lt;br/&gt;usually range from approximately 10 nm to 100 μm; i.e., the droplets&lt;br/&gt;may exceed the usual size limits for [[colloid]]al particles.

''Note 4'': An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the&lt;br/&gt;dispersed phase is an organic material and the ''continuous phase'' is&lt;br/&gt;water or an aqueous solution and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed&lt;br/&gt;phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an&lt;br/&gt;organic liquid (an "oil").

''Note 5'': A w/o emulsion is sometimes called an inverse emulsion.&lt;br/&gt;The term "inverse emulsion" is misleading, suggesting incorrectly that&lt;br/&gt;the emulsion has properties that are the opposite of those of an emulsion.&lt;br/&gt;Its use is, therefore, not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terminology of polymers and polymerization processes in dispersed systems (IUPAC Recommendations 2011)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2011|volume=83|issue=12|pages=2229–2259|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-06-03|last1=Slomkowski|first1=Stanislaw|last2=Alemán|first2=José V.|last3=Gilbert|first3=Robert G.|last4=Hess|first4=Michael|last5=Horie|first5=Kazuyuki|last6=Jones|first6=Richard G.|last7=Kubisa|first7=Przemyslaw|last8=Meisel|first8=Ingrid|last9=Mormann|first9=Werner|last10=Penczek|first10=Stanisław|last11=Stepto|first11=Robert F.

Emulsions contain both a dispersed and a continuous phase, with the boundary between the phases called the "interface"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Loi|first=Chia Chun|title=Protein-Stabilised Emulsions|date=2018|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780081005965224906|work=Reference Module in Food Science|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-100596-5.22490-6|isbn=9780081005965|access-date=2018-11-23|last2=Eyres|first2=Graham T.|last3=Birch|first3=E. John}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Emulsions tend to have a cloudy appearance because the many [[phase boundary|phase interfaces]] [[scattering|scatter]] light as it passes through the emulsion. Emulsions appear [[white]] when all light is scattered equally. If the emulsion is dilute enough, higher-frequency (low-wavelength) light will be scattered more, and the emulsion will appear [[blue]]r&amp;nbsp;– this is called the "[[Tyndall effect]]". {{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}If the emulsion is concentrated enough, the color will be distorted toward comparatively longer wavelengths, and will appear more [[yellow]]. This phenomenon is easily observable when comparing [[skimmed milk]], which contains little fat, to [[cream]], which contains a much higher concentration of milk fat. One example would be a mixture of water and oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Two special classes of emulsions&amp;nbsp;– [[microemulsion]]s and nanoemulsions, with droplet sizes below 100&amp;nbsp;nm&amp;nbsp;– appear translucent.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mason TG, Wilking JN, Meleson K, Chang CB, Graves SM |title=Nanoemulsions: Formation, structure, and physical properties|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=18|issue=41|pages=R635–R666|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/41/R01|url=http://www.firp.ula.ve/archivos/pdf/06_JPCM_Mason.pdf|year=2006|bibcode=2006JPCM...18R.635M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is due to the fact that light waves are scattered by the droplets only if their sizes exceed about one-quarter of the wavelength of the incident light. Since the [[visible spectrum]] of light is composed of wavelengths between 390 and 750 [[nanometer]]s (nm), if the droplet sizes in the emulsion are below about 100&amp;nbsp;nm, the light can penetrate through the emulsion without being scattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Leong TS, Wooster TJ, Kentish SE, Ashokkumar M |title=Minimising oil droplet size using ultrasonic emulsification|journal=Ultrasonics Sonochemistry|volume=16|issue=6|pages=721–7|pmid=19321375|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.ultsonch.2009.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their similarity in appearance, translucent nanoemulsions and [[microemulsions]] are frequently confused. Unlike translucent nanoemulsions, which require specialized equipment to be produced, microemulsions are spontaneously formed by “solubilizing” oil molecules with a mixture of [[surfactant]]s, co-surfactants, and co-[[solvent]]s.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; The required surfactant concentration in a [[microemulsion]] is, however, several times higher than that in a translucent nanoemulsion, and significantly exceeds the concentration of the dispersed phase. Because of many undesirable side-effects caused by surfactants, their presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications. In addition, the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution, by heating, or by changing pH levels.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Common emulsions are inherently unstable and, thus, do not tend to form spontaneously. Energy input&amp;nbsp;– through shaking, stirring, [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenizing]], or exposure to power [[ultrasound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1466856407001294 | doi=10.1016/j.ifset.2007.07.005 | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=The use of ultrasonics for nanoemulsion preparation | year=2008 | journal=Innovative Food Science &amp; Emerging Technologies | pages=170–175 | last1 = Kentish | first1 = S. | last2 = Wooster | first2 = T.J. | last3 = Ashokkumar | first3 = M. | last4 = Balachandran | first4 = S. | last5 = Mawson | first5 = R. | last6 = Simons | first6 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– is needed to form an emulsion. Over time, emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the emulsion. An example of this is seen in the separation of the oil and vinegar components of [[vinaigrette (food)|vinaigrette]], an unstable emulsion that will quickly separate unless shaken almost continuously. There are important exceptions to this rule&amp;nbsp;– [[microemulsions]] are [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable, while translucent nanoemulsions are [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetically]] stable.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

Whether an emulsion of oil and water turns into a "water-in-oil" emulsion or an "oil-in-water" emulsion depends on the volume fraction of both phases and the type of emulsifier (surfactant) (see ''Emulsifier'', below) present.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} In general, the [[Bancroft rule]] applies. Emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well. For example, proteins dissolve better in water than in oil, and so tend to form oil-in-water emulsions (that is, they promote the dispersion of oil droplets throughout a continuous phase of water).{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

The geometric structure of an emulsion mixture of two lyophobic liquids with a large concentration of the secondary component is fractal: Emulsion particles unavoidably form dynamic inhomogeneous structures on small length scale. The geometry of these structures is fractal. The size of elementary irregularities is governed by a universal function which depends on the volume content of the components. The fractal dimension of these irregularities is 2.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ozhovan M.I. |title=Dynamic uniform fractals in emulsions|journal= J. Exp. Theor. Phys.|volume= 77|issue=6|pages= 939–943 |year=1993|bibcode=1993JETP...77..939O|url=http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/dn/e_077_06_0939.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instability===
Emulsion stability refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist change in its properties over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=McClements, David Julian |title=Food Emulsions: Principles, Practices, and Techniques, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTrzBPbf_WQC&amp;pg=PA269|date=16 December 2004|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-8493-2023-1|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0268-005X(99)00027-2|title=Influence of copper on the stability of whey protein stabilized emulsions|journal=Food Hydrocolloids|volume=13|issue=5|pages=419|year=1999|last1=Silvestre|first1=M.P.C.|last2=Decker|first2=E.A.|last3=McClements|first3=D.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four types of instability in emulsions: [[flocculation]], [[creaming (chemistry)|creaming]]/[[sedimentation]], [[Coalescence (physics)|coalescence]], and [[Ostwald ripening]]. Flocculation occurs when there is an attractive force between the droplets, so they form flocs, like bunches of grapes. Coalescence occurs when droplets bump into each other and combine to form a larger droplet, so the average droplet size increases over time. Emulsions can also undergo [[creaming (chemistry)|creaming]], where the droplets rise to the top of the emulsion under the influence of [[buoyancy]], or under the influence of the [[centripetal force]] induced when a [[centrifuge]] is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creaming is a common phenomenon in dairy and non-dairy beverages (i.e. milk, coffee milk, almond milk, soy milk) and usually does not change the droplet size.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loi|first=Chia Chun|last2=Eyres|first2=Graham T.|last3=Birch|first3=E. John|date=2019|title=Effect of mono- and diglycerides on physical properties and stability of a protein-stabilised oil-in-water emulsion|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|volume=240|pages=56–64|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.07.016|issn=0260-8774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentation is the opposite phenomenon of creaming and normally observed in water-in-oil emulsions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Sedimentation happens when the dispersed phase is denser than the continuous phase and the gravitational forces pull the denser globules towards the bottom of the emulsion. Similar to creaming, sedimentation follows Stoke’s law.

An appropriate "surface active agent" (or "[[surfactant]]") can increase the kinetic stability of an emulsion so that the size of the droplets does not change significantly with time. It is then said to be stable.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} For example, oil-in-water emulsions containing [[Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids|mono- and diglycerides]] and milk protein as [[surfactant]] showed that stable oil droplet size over 28 days storage at 25°C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

===Monitoring physical stability===
The stability of emulsions can be characterized using techniques such as light scattering, focused beam reflectance measurement, centrifugation, and rheology. Each method has advantages and disadvantages.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

===Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction===
The kinetic process of destabilization can be rather long&amp;nbsp;– up to several months, or even years for some products.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Often the formulator must accelerate this process in order to test products in a reasonable time during product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used – these consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization (if below critical temperatures for phase inversion or chemical degradation).{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the inter-facial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or, on a broader scope, interactions of forces inside the system. Storing an emulsion at high temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product (e.g., a tube of sunscreen emulsion in a car in the summer heat), but also to accelerate destabilization processes up to 200 times.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Mechanical methods of acceleration, including vibration, centrifugation, and agitation, can also be used.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

These methods are almost always empirical, without a sound scientific basis.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

==Emulsifiers==
An '''emulsifier''' (also known as an "emulgent") is a substance that stabilizes an emulsion by increasing its [[chemical kinetics|kinetic stability]]. One class of emulsifiers is known as "surface active agents", or [[surfactant]]s.  Emulsifiers are compounds that typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) part and a non-polar (i.e. hydrophobic or lipophilic) part.  Because of this, emulsifiers tend to have more or less solubility either in water or in oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}  Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water (and conversely, less soluble in oil) will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Examples of food emulsifiers are:
* [[Egg yolk]]&amp;nbsp;– in which the main emulsifying agent is [[lecithin]]. In fact, ''lecithos'' is the Greek word for egg yolk.
* [[Mustard seed|Mustard]]&amp;nbsp;– where a variety of chemicals in the [[mucilage]] surrounding the seed hull act as emulsifiers
* [[Soy lecithin]] is another emulsifier and thickener
* [[Pickering emulsion|Pickering stabilization]]&amp;nbsp;– uses particles under certain circumstances
* [[Sodium phosphates]]
*[[Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids|Mono- and diglycerides]] - a common emulsifier found in many food products (coffee creamers, ice-creams, spreads, breads, cakes)
* [[Sodium stearoyl lactylate]]
* [[DATEM]] (Diacetyl Tartaric (Acid) Ester of Monoglyceride)&amp;nbsp;– an emulsifier used primarily in baking

[[Detergent]]s are another class of surfactant, and will interact physically with both [[cooking oil|oil]] and [[water]], thus stabilizing the interface between the oil and water droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in [[soap]], to remove [[yellow grease|grease]] for the purpose of [[cleaning agent|cleaning]]. Many different emulsifiers are used in [[pharmacy]] to prepare emulsions such as [[cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]] and [[lotion]]s. Common examples include [[emulsifying wax]], [[polysorbate 20]], and [[ceteareth|ceteareth 20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachsoap.com/emulsifywax.html|title=Using Emulsifying Wax|accessdate=2008-07-22|author=Anne-Marie Faiola|date=2008-05-21|website=TeachSoap.com|publisher=TeachSoap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a '''nanoemulsion''', where the inner state disperses into "[[nano-]]size" droplets within the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the "[[Ouzo effect]]", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic [[anise]]-based beverage, such as [[ouzo]], [[pastis]], [[absinthe]], [[Arak (distilled beverage)|arak]], or [[Rakı|raki]]. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in [[ethanol]], then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.

''See also: '''[[:simple:Emulsifier|food emulsifiers]]''' explained, in the Simple English Wikipedia''

==Mechanisms of emulsification==
A number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification:{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

* Surface tension theory – according to this theory, emulsification takes place by reduction of interfacial tension between two phases
* Repulsion theory – the emulsifying agent creates a film over one phase that forms globules, which repel each other. This repulsive force causes them to remain suspended in the dispersion medium
* Viscosity modification – emulgents like [[Gum arabic|acacia]] and [[tragacanth]], which are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG (or [[polyethylene glycol]]), glycerine, and other polymers like CMC ([[carboxymethyl cellulose]]), all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase

==Uses==

===In food===
Oil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:
* Crema (foam) in [[espresso]] – coffee oil in water (brewed coffee), unstable emulsion
* [[Mayonnaise]] and [[Hollandaise sauce]]s – these are oil-in-water emulsions  stabilized with egg yolk [[lecithin]], or with other types of food additives, such as [[sodium stearoyl lactylate]]
* [[Homogenized milk]] – an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins as the emulsifier
* [[Vinaigrette]] – an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is prepared using only oil and vinegar (i.e., without an emulsifier), an unstable emulsion results

Water-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:
* [[Butter]] – an emulsion of water in butterfat
* [[Margarine]]

Other foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example [[meat emulsion]] is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.

===Health care===
In [[pharmaceutics]], [[Hairstyling product|hairstyling]], [[personal hygiene]], and [[cosmetics]], emulsions are frequently used. These are usually oil and water emulsions but dispersed, and which is continuous depends in many cases on the [[pharmaceutical formulation]]. These emulsions may be called [[cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]]s, [[ointment]]s, [[liniment]]s (balms), [[paste (rheology)|paste]]s, [[Thin film|film]]s, or [[liquid]]s, depending mostly on their oil-to-water ratios, other additives, and their intended [[route of administration]].&lt;ref name="Aulton"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Aulton, Michael E.|edition=3rd|title=Aulton's Pharmaceutics: The Design and Manufacture of Medicines|publisher=[[Churchill Livingstone]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-443-10108-3|pages=92–97, 384, 390–405, 566–69, 573–74, 589–96, 609–10, 611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Remington"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Troy|first1=David A.|last2=Remington|first2=Joseph P.|last3=Beringer|first3=Paul|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|edition=21st|year=2006|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1|pages=325–336, 886–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 5 are [[topical]] [[dosage form]]s, and may be used on the surface of the [[human skin|skin]], [[transdermal]]ly, [[Eye drop|ophthalmically]], [[rectal]]ly, or [[vagina]]lly. A highly liquid emulsion may also be used [[oral administration|oral]]ly, or may be [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] in some cases.&lt;ref name="Aulton"/&gt; Popular medications occurring in emulsion form include&lt;ref&gt;Aymal et al. (2001). Senior Science HSC 2. Australia: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cod liver oil]], [[Polysporin]], [[cortisol]] cream, [[Canesten]], and [[Fleet (laxative)|Fleet]].

Microemulsions are used to deliver [[vaccine]]s and kill [[microbe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nano.med.umich.edu/Platforms/Adjuvant-Vaccine-Development.html|title=Adjuvant Vaccine Development|accessdate=2008-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705134014/http://nano.med.umich.edu/Platforms/Adjuvant-Vaccine-Development.html|archivedate=2008-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical emulsions used in these techniques are nanoemulsions of [[soybean oil]], with particles that are 400–600&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/uomh-nvs022608.php|title=Nanoemulsion vaccines show increasing promise|accessdate=2008-07-22|website=Eurekalert! Public News List|publisher=University of Michigan Health System|date=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is not chemical, as with other types of [[antimicrobial]] treatments, but mechanical. The smaller the droplet the greater the [[surface tension]] and thus the greater the force required to merge with other [[lipids]]. The oil is emulsified with detergents using a [[high-shear mixer]] to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the lipids in the [[cell membrane]] or envelope of [[Cell envelope|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es, they force the lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells, or the cells of most other [[higher organisms]], with the exceptions of [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] and [[blood cells]], which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures. For this reason, these nanoemulsions are not currently used [[intravenous]]ly (IV). The most effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the [[disinfection]] of surfaces. Some types of nanoemulsions have been shown to effectively destroy [[HIV-1]] and [[tuberculosis]] pathogens on non-[[porous]] surfaces.

===In firefighting===
Emulsifying agents are effective at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids ([[Fire classes|class B fire]]s). Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as [[Fire-fighting foam|aqueous film-forming foam]] &lt;!-- (AFFF) --&gt; need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Fire Protection Chemistry and Physics |author=Friedman, Raymond |isbn= 978-0-87765-440-7|year=1998|publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions – polymer production in an  emulsion 'phase' has a number of process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product. Products produced by such polymerisations may be used as the emulsions – products including primary components for glues and paints. Synthetic [[latex]]es (rubbers) are also produced by this process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''Gustavo Orcés V. Natural History Museum''' ({{lang-es|Museo de Historia Natural Gustavo Orcés V.}}) is a natural history museum in [[Quito]], Ecuador. It was established in 2005.

==Background==
From the eighteenth century European naturalists came to Ecuador for scientific expeditions, during which they collected specimens of flora, fauna, rocks and fossils. In the early twentieth century, [[Franz Spillmann]] brought together a collection of fossils, which formed the "Cabinet of Natural Sciences" of the Central University. Later, in 1946, [[Robert Hoffstetter]] and [[Gustavo Orcés]] founded the Department of Biology at the National Polytechnic School, and made numerous paleontological expeditions, particularly in the [[Santa Elena, Ecuador|Santa Elena]] peninsula. Hoffstetter's extensive work and organization formed the basis of the modern museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?pid=S1405-33222011000300001&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=Redescubrimiento de material tipo depositado en la colección del Museo de Historia Natural "Gustavo Orcés V." del Instituto de Ciencias Biológicas, Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador|publisher=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|accessdate=11 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J.

A voluminous and careful traveling collector, Loring was recognized early in his career for 900 specimens collected, prepared and sent to the [[United States National Museum]] over a three-month period during an 1898 expedition through [[Scandinavia]] and northwestern Europe.&lt;ref name="SI 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Science1908&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=December 18, 1908|volume=28|issue=729|pages=876–877|title=President Roosevelt's African Trip|jstor=1635075|doi=10.1126/science.28.729.876|pmid=17743798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loring's work and professional relationships spanned several continents focusing on collecting and documenting species of mammals. He served on the [[Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition]] (1909–1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Roosevelt in Africa|newspaper=New York Tribune|date=Aug 25, 1910|agency=Proquest Historical Newspapers|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Smithsonian specialist designated to preserve small mammals collected during the year-long expedition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9817">'''Limiting similarity''' (informally "limsim") is a concept in [[theoretical ecology]] and [[community ecology]] that proposes the existence of a maximum level of [[ecological niche|niche]] overlap between two given [[species]] that will allow continued coexistence.

This concept is a corollary of the [[competitive exclusion principle]], which states that, controlling for all else, two species competing for exactly the same resources cannot stably coexist. It assumes normally-distributed resource utilization curves ordered linearly along a resource axis, and as such, it is often considered to be an oversimplified model of species interactions. Moreover, it has theoretical weakness, and it is poor at generating real-world predictions or falsifiable hypotheses. Thus, the concept has fallen somewhat out of favor except in didactic settings (where it is commonly referenced), and has largely been replaced by more complex and inclusive theories.

==History==

In 1932, [[Georgii Gause]] created the competitive exclusion principle based on experiments with cultures of [[yeast]] and [[paramecium]].&lt;ref&gt;Gause, GF. 1932. Experimental studies on the struggle for existence. Journal of Experimental Biology 9: 389–402.&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle maintains that two species with the same [[ecological niche]]s cannot stably coexist. That is to say, when two species compete for identical resource access, one will be competitively superior and it will ultimately supplant the other. Over the next half century, limiting similarity slowly emerged as a natural outgrowth of this principle, aiming (but not necessarily succeeding) to be more quantitative and specific.

Noted ecologist and evolutionary biologist [[David Lack]] said retrospectively that he had already begun to mull around with the ideas of limiting similarity as early as the 1940s, but it wasn't until the end of the 1950s that the theory began to be built up and articulated.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D. 1973. My life as an amateur ornithologist. Ibis 115: 421–434.&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]'s famous "Homage to Santa Rosalia" was the next foundational paper in the history of the theory. Its subtitle famously asks, "Why are there so many kinds of animals?", and the address attempts to answer this question by suggesting theoretical bounds to speciation and niche overlap. For the purposes of understanding limiting similarity, the key portion of Hutchinson's address is the end where he presents the observation that a seemingly ubiquitous ratio (1.3:1) defines the upper bound of morphological character similarity between closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, GE. 1959. Homage to Santa Rosalia, or Why are there so many kinds of animals?. The American Naturalist 93(870): 145–159.&lt;/ref&gt; While this so-called ''Hutchinson ratio'' and the idea of a universal limit have been overturned by later research, the address was still foundational to the theory of limiting similarity.

[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[Richard Levins|Levins]] were the first to introduce the term 'limiting similarity' in their 1967 paper. They attempted to lay out a rigorous quantitative basis for the theory using [[probability theory]] and the [[Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra competition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, R and R Levins. 1967. The Limiting Similarity, Convergence, and Divergence of Coexisting Species. The American Naturalist 101(921): 377–385.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they provided the ultimate theoretical framework on which many subsequent studies were based.

==Theory==

As proposed by MacArthur and Levins in 1967, the theory of limiting similarity is rooted in the Lotka–Volterra competition model. This model describes two or more populations with logistic dynamics, adding in an additional term to account for their biological interactions. Thus for two populations, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{dx_1 \over dt} &amp; = r_1x_1\left({K_1-x_1-\alpha_{12}x_2 \over K_1}\right), \\[6pt]
{dx_2 \over dt} &amp; = r_2x_2\left({K_2-x_2-\alpha_{21}x_1 \over K_2}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

*''α''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 2 has on the population of species 1
*''α''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 1 has on the population of species 2
*''dy/dt'' and ''dx/dt'' represent the growth of the two populations with time;
*''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent these species’ respective carrying capacities
*''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent these species’ respective growth rates

MacArthur and Levins examine this system applied to three populations, also visualized as resource utilization curves, depicted below. In this model, at some upper limit of competition ''α'', between two species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the survival of a third species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between the other two is not possible. This phenomenon is termed limiting similarity.  Evolutionary, if two species are more similar than some limit ''L'', a third species will converge towards the nearer of the two competitors. If the two species are less similar than some limit ''L'', a third species will evolve an intermediate phenotype.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[embedded graph: U v R. x1, x2, x3 curves.]

For each resource R, U represents the probability of utilization per unit time by an individual. At some level of overlap between species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the survival of a third species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

May&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M. 1973. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; extended this theory when considering species with different carrying capacities, concluding that coexistence was unlikely if the distance between the modes of competing resource utilization curves ''d'' was less than the standard deviation of the curves ''w''.

==Applied examples==

It is of note that the theory of limiting similarity does not easily generate falsifiable predictions about natural phenomenon. However, many studies have tried to test the theory by making the highly suspect assumption that [[character displacement]] can be used as a close proxy for niche incongruence.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams P. 1983. The Theory of Limiting Similarity. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 14: 359–376.&lt;/ref&gt; One recent [[paleoecology|paleoecological]] study, for example, used [[fossil]] proxies of [[gastropod]] body size to determine levels of character displacement over 42,500 years during the [[Quaternary]]. They found little evidence of character displacement, and they concluded that "limiting similarity, as seen in both ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement, is a transient ecological phenomenon rather than a long-term evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Huntley JW, Yanes Y, Kowalewski M, Castillo C, Delgado-Huertas A, Ibanez M, Alonso MR, Ortiz JE and T de Torres. 2008. Testing limiting similarity in Quaternary terrestrial gastropods. Paleobiology 34(3): 378–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical and empirical studies tend to find results that similarly play down the strength and role of limiting similarity in ecology and evolution. For example, Abrams (who is prolific on the subject of limiting similarity) and Rueffler find in 2009 that "there is no absolute limit to similarity; there is always some range of mortality rates of one species allowing coexistence, given a fixed mortality of the other species".&lt;ref&gt;Abrams PA and C Rueffler. 2009. Coexistence and limiting similarity of consumer species competing for a linear array of resources. Ecology 90(3): 812–822.&lt;/ref&gt;

What a lot of studies examining limiting similarity find are the weaknesses in the original theory that are addressed below.

==Criticism==

The key weakness of the theory of limiting similarity is that it is highly system specific and thus difficult to test in practice. In actual environments, one resource axis is inadequate and a specific analysis must be done for each given pair of species. In practice it is necessary to take into account:
*individual variations in resource utilization curves within a species and how these should be weighted in calculating a common curve
*whether the resource in question is a present in a deterministic or stochastic distribution and if this changes over time
*effects of intraspecific competition vs interspecific competition
While these complications don't invalidate the concept, they render limiting similarity exceedingly difficult to test in practice and useful for little more than didacticism.  

Furthermore, Hubbell and Foster point out that extinction via competition can take an extremely long time and the importance of limiting similarity in extinction may even be superseded by speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbell, S. P. and Foster, R.B. (1986). Biology, chance, and history and the structure of tropical rain forest tree communities. In: Diamond, J. and Case, T.J. eds. Community ecology. Harper and Row, New York, pp. 314–329.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, from a theoretical standpoint, small changes in carrying capacities can allow for nearly completely overlapping resource utilization curves and in practice carrying capacity can be difficult to determine. Many studies that attempt to explore limiting similarity (including Huntley et al. 2007) resort to examining character displacement as a proxy for niche overlap, which is suspect at best. While a useful-if simple-model, limiting similarity is nearly untestable in reality.

[[File:Water drop 001.jpg|thumb|300px|The formation of a spherical [[Drop (liquid)|droplet]] of liquid water minimizes the [[surface area]], which is the natural result of [[surface tension]] in liquids.]]
{{Continuum mechanics|fluid}}

A '''liquid''' is a nearly [[Compressibility|incompressible]] [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|the four fundamental states of matter]] (the others being [[solid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by [[intermolecular bonds]]. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is [[fluid|able to flow]] and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is [[surface tension]], leading to [[wetting]] phenomena.

The [[density]] of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed [[Condensed matter physics|condensed matter]]. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called [[fluid]]s. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as [[interstellar cloud]]s or in plasma form within stars.

==Introduction==
[[File:Hot and cold water immiscibility thermal image.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of a sink full of hot water with cold water being added, showing how the hot and the cold water flow into each other.]]
Liquid is one of the [[State of matter|four primary states of matter]], with the others being solid, gas and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A liquid is a [[fluid]]. Unlike a solid, the [[molecule]]s in a liquid have a much greater freedom to move. The forces that bind the molecules together in a solid are only temporary in a liquid, allowing a liquid to flow while a solid remains rigid.

A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If liquid is placed in a bag, it can be squeezed into any shape. Unlike a gas, a liquid is nearly incompressible, meaning that it occupies nearly a constant volume over a wide range of pressures; it does not generally expand to fill available space in a container but forms its own surface, and it may not always mix readily with another liquid. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as [[hydraulics]].

Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its [[boiling point]], the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless [[superheating]] occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its [[Melting point|freezing point]] the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless [[supercooling]] occurs).

==Examples==

Only two [[Chemical element|elements]] are liquid at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]: [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[bromine]]. Four more elements have melting points slightly above [[room temperature]]: [[francium]], [[caesium]], [[gallium]] and [[rubidium]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Gray, The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe New York: Workman Publishing, 2009 p. 127 {{ISBN|1-57912-814-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include [[NaK]], a sodium-potassium metal alloy, [[galinstan]], a fusible alloy liquid, and some [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]] (alloys involving mercury).

Pure substances that are liquid under normal conditions include water, [[ethanol]] and many other organic solvents. Liquid water is of vital importance in chemistry and biology; it is believed to be a necessity for the existence of life.

Inorganic liquids include water, magma, [[inorganic nonaqueous solvent]]s and many [[acid]]s.

Important everyday liquids include aqueous [[solution]]s like household [[bleach]], other [[mixture]]s of different substances such as [[mineral oil]] and gasoline, [[emulsion]]s like [[vinaigrette]] or [[mayonnaise]], [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] like blood, and [[colloid]]s like [[paint]] and milk.

Many gases can be [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] by cooling, producing liquids such as [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid helium]]. Not all gases can be liquified at atmospheric pressure, for example [[carbon dioxide]] can only be liquified at pressures above 5.1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].

Some materials cannot be classified within the classical three states of matter; they possess solid-like and liquid-like properties. Examples include [[liquid crystal]]s, used in LCD displays, and [[biological membrane]]s.

==Applications==

Liquids have a variety of uses, as lubricants, solvents, and coolants. In hydraulic systems, liquid is used to transmit power.

In [[tribology]], liquids are studied for their properties as [[lubricants]]. Lubricants such as oil are chosen for [[viscosity]] and flow characteristics that are suitable throughout the [[operating temperature]] range of the component. Oils are often used in engines, [[gear box]]es, [[metalworking]], and hydraulic systems for their good lubrication properties.&lt;ref&gt;Theo Mang, Wilfried Dressel [https://books.google.com/books?id=UTdfxf2rkNcC&amp; ’’Lubricants and lubrication’’], Wiley-VCH 2007 {{ISBN|3-527-31497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many liquids are used as [[solvents]], to dissolve other liquids or solids. [[Solution]]s are found in a wide variety of applications, including [[paint]]s, [[sealant]]s, and [[adhesive]]s. [[Naphtha]] and [[acetone]] are used frequently in industry to clean oil, grease, and tar from parts and machinery. [[Body fluid]]s are water based solutions.

[[Surfactant]]s are commonly found in soaps and [[detergent]]s. Solvents like alcohol are often used as [[antimicrobial]]s. They are found in cosmetics, [[ink]]s, and liquid [[dye laser]]s. They are used in the food industry, in processes such as the extraction of [[vegetable oil]].&lt;ref&gt;George Wypych [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzhUTvUkpDQC&amp;pg=PA847 ’’Handbook of solvents’’] William Andrew Publishing 2001 pp. 847–881 {{ISBN|1-895198-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Liquids tend to have better [[thermal conductivity]] than gases, and the ability to flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a [[heat exchanger]], such as a [[radiator]], or the heat can be removed with the liquid during [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;N. B. Vargaftik ’’Handbook of thermal conductivity of liquids and gases’’ CRC Press 1994 {{ISBN|0-8493-9345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water or [[glycol]] coolants are used to keep engines from overheating.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Erjavec [https://books.google.com/books?id=U4TBoJB2zgsC&amp;pg=PA309 ’’Automotive technology: a systems approach’’] Delmar Learning 2000 p. 309 {{ISBN|1-4018-4831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coolants used in [[nuclear reactor]]s include water or liquid metals, such as [[sodium]] or [[bismuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Wendt ’’The prospects of nuclear power and technology’’ D. Van Nostrand Company 1957 p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liquid propellant]] films are used to cool the thrust chambers of [[rocket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;’’Modern engineering for design of liquid-propellant rocket engines’’ by Dieter K. Huzel, David H. Huang – American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 1992 p. 99 {{ISBN|1-56347-013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[machining]], water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the work piece and the tooling. During [[perspiration]], sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the [[heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning]] industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E Mull ’’HVAC principles and applications manual’’ McGraw-Hill 1997 {{ISBN|0-07-044451-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid is the primary component of [[hydraulic]] systems, which take advantage of [[Pascal's law]] to provide [[fluid power]]. Devices such as [[pump]]s and [[waterwheel]]s have been used to change liquid motion into [[mechanical work]] since ancient times. Oils are forced through [[hydraulic pump]]s, which transmit this force to [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as [[automotive brakes]] and [[automotive transmission|transmissions]], [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]], and airplane control systems. Various [[hydraulic press]]es are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.&lt;ref&gt;R. Keith Mobley [https://books.google.com/books?id=8DyLdlfJzoMC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Fluid power dynamics''] Butterworth-Heinemann 2000 p. vii {{ISBN|0-7506-7174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquids are sometimes used in measuring devices. A [[thermometer]] often uses the [[thermal expansion]] of liquids, such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], combined with their ability to flow to indicate temperature. A [[manometer]] uses the weight of the liquid to indicate [[air pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Bela G. Liptak [https://books.google.com/books?id=pPMursVsxlMC&amp;pg=PA807 ’’Instrument engineers’ handbook: process control’’] CRC Press 1999 p. 807 {{ISBN|0-8493-1081-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume===

Quantities of liquids are measured in units of [[volume]]. These include the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit cubic metre (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and its divisions, in particular the cubic decimeter, more commonly called the litre (1 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 L = 0.001 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and the cubic centimetre, also called millilitre (1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 mL = 0.001 L = 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The volume of a quantity of liquid is fixed by its temperature and [[pressure]]. Liquids generally expand when heated, and contract when cooled. Water between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 4&amp;nbsp;°C is a notable exception.
Liquids have little [[compressibility]]. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 parts per million for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/compress.html|title=Compressibility of Liquids|author=|date=|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207161845/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/compress.html|archivedate=7 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Intelligent Energy Field Manufacturing: Interdisciplinary Process Innovations'' By Wenwu Zhang -- CRC Press 2011 Page 144&lt;/ref&gt; In the study of [[fluid dynamics]], liquids are often treated as [[incompressible]], especially when studying [[incompressible flow]]. This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because very little of the energy is lost in the form of compression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called [[water hammer]], occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is [[cavitation]]. Because liquids have little [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines'' by S. C. Gupta -- Dorling-Kindersley 2006 Page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure and buoyancy===

{{main|fluid statics}}

In a [[gravitational field]], liquids exert [[pressure]] on the sides of a container as well as on anything within the liquid itself. This pressure is transmitted in all directions and increases with depth. If a liquid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure, ''p'', at any depth, ''z'', is given by
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho g z\,&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the liquid (assumed constant)
:&lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravity|gravitational acceleration]].
Note that this formula assumes that the pressure ''at'' the free surface is zero, and that [[surface tension]] effects may be neglected.

Objects immersed in liquids are subject to the phenomenon of [[buoyancy]]. (Buoyancy is also observed in other fluids, but is especially strong in liquids due to their high density.)

===Surfaces===

{{main|surface science}}

[[File:2006-01-14 Surface waves.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Surface wave]]s in water]]

Unless the volume of a liquid exactly matches the volume of its container, one or more surfaces are observed. The surface of a liquid behaves like an elastic membrane in which [[surface tension]] appears, allowing the formation of [[Drop (liquid)|drops]] and [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s. [[Surface wave]]s, [[capillary action]], [[wetting]], and [[Ripple (fluid dynamics)|ripples]] are other consequences of [[surface tension]]. In a [[confined liquid]], defined by geometric constraints on a nanoscopic scale, most molecules sense some surface effects, which can result in physical properties grossly deviating from those of the bulk liquid.

====Free surface====
{{main|Free surface}}
A '''free surface''' is the surface of a fluid that is subject to both zero perpendicular normal stress and parallel shear stress, such as the boundary between, e.g., liquid water and the air in the Earth's atmosphere.

====Level====
The '''liquid level''' (as in, e.g., [[water level]]) is the height associated with the liquid free surface, especially when it's the top-most surface. It may be measured with a [[level sensor]].

===Flow===
[[File:Viscosities.gif|thumb|A simulation of [[viscosity]]. The fluid on the left has a lower viscosity than the one on the right]]
{{main|fluid mechanics|fluid dynamics}}
[[Viscosity]] measures the resistance of a liquid which is being deformed by either shear stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lZGcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;dq=Viscosity+measures+the+resistance+of+a+liquid+which+is+being+deformed#v=onepage&amp;q=Viscosity%20measures%20the%20resistance%20of%20a%20liquid%20which%20is%20being%20deformed&amp;f=false |title=Pharmaceutics: The Science of Medicine Design |last=Denton |first=Philip |last2=Rostron |first2=Chris |date=2013-07-25 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=9780199655311 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extensional stress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In other words, viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=btDUBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Viscosity+measures+the+resistance+of+a+liquid+which+is+being+deformed#v=onepage&amp;q=Viscosity%20measures%20the%20resistance%20of%20a%20liquid%20which%20is%20being%20deformed&amp;f=false |title=Essential Chemistry for Formulators of Semisolid and Liquid Dosages |last=Kulkarni |first=Vitthal S. |last2=Shaw |first2=Charles |date=2015-10-15 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780128010723 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a liquid is [[supercooling|supercooled]] towards the [[glass transition]], the viscosity increases dramatically. The liquid then becomes a [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] medium that shows both the [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of a solid and the fluidity of a liquid, depending on the time scale of observation or on the frequency of perturbation.

===Sound propagation===

{{main|speed of sound#Speed of sound in liquids}}

The speed of sound in a fluid is given by
&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt {K/\rho}&lt;/math&gt; where ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the fluid, and ''ρ'' the density. To give a typical value, in fresh water ''c''=1497&amp;nbsp;m/s at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Thermodynamics==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

===Phase transitions===
{{main|boiling|boiling point|melting|melting point}}
[[File:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|300px|A typical [[phase diagram]]. The dotted line gives the anomalous behaviour of water. The green lines show how the [[freezing point]] can vary with pressure, and the blue line shows how the [[boiling point]] can vary with pressure. The red line shows the boundary where [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] or [[Deposition (physics)|deposition]] can occur.]]

At a temperature below the [[boiling point]], any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At this point the gas will condense at the same rate as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually removed. A liquid at its [[boiling point]] will evaporate more quickly than the gas can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling point will normally boil, though [[superheating]] can prevent this in certain circumstances.

At a temperature below the freezing point, a liquid will tend to [[crystallization|crystallize]], changing to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium at this transition under constant pressure, so unless [[supercooling]] occurs, the liquid will eventually completely crystallize. Note that this is only true under constant pressure, so e.g. water and ice in a closed, strong container might reach an equilibrium where both phases coexist. For the opposite transition from solid to liquid, see [[melting]].

===Liquids in space===
The phase diagram explains why liquids do not exist in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vapourize (sublime) as soon as it is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock doesn't heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapour. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.

===Solutions===

{{main|solution}}

Liquids can display [[immiscibility]]. The most familiar mixture of two immiscible liquids in everyday life is the [[vegetable oil]] and water&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GPaPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%C2%A0Liquids+can+display+immiscibility#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Liquids%20can%20display%20immiscibility&amp;f=false |title=Quantum Psychics - Scientifically Understand, Control and Enhance Your Psychic Ability |last=Kelly |first=Theresa M. |date=2013-03-18 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=9780557034031 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Italian dressing|Italian salad dressing]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} A familiar set of miscible liquids is water and alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Liquid components in a mixture can often be separated from one another via [[fractional distillation]].

==Microscopic properties==

===Static structure factor===

{{main|structure of liquids and glasses}}

[[File:Teilchenmodell Flüssigkeit.svg|thumb|right|200px|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]

In a liquid, atoms do not form a crystalline lattice, nor do they show any other form of [[long-range order]]. This is evidenced by the absence of [[Bragg peak]]s in [[X-ray diffraction|X-ray]] and [[neutron diffraction]]. Under normal conditions, the diffraction pattern has circular symmetry, expressing the [[isotropy]] of the liquid. In radial direction, the diffraction intensity smoothly oscillates. This is usually described by the [[static structure factor]] ''S(q)'', with wavenumber ''q''=(4π/λ)sinθ given by the wavelength λ of the probe (photon or neutron) and the [[Bragg angle]] θ. The oscillations of ''S(q)'' express the ''near order'' of the liquid, i.e. the correlations between an atom and a few shells of nearest, second nearest, ... neighbors.

A more intuitive description of these correlations is given by the [[radial distribution function]] ''g(r)'', which is basically the [[Fourier transform]] of ''S(q)''. It represents a spatial average of a temporal snapshot of [[pair correlations]] in the liquid.

[[File:Lennard-Jones Radial Distribution Function.svg|thumb|300px|Radial distribution function of the [[Lennard–Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model fluid]].]]

===Sound dispersion and structural relaxation===

The above expression for the sound velocity &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt {K/\rho}&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[bulk modulus]] ''K''. If ''K'' is frequency independent then the liquid behaves as a [[linear medium]], so that sound propagates without [[dissipation]] and without [[mode coupling]]. In reality, any liquid shows some [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersion]]: with increasing frequency, ''K'' crosses over from the low-frequency, liquid-like limit &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; to the high-frequency, solid-like limit &lt;math&gt;K_\infty&lt;/math&gt;. In normal liquids, most of this cross over takes place at frequencies between GHz and THz, sometimes called [[hypersound]].

At sub-GHz frequencies, a normal liquid cannot sustain [[shear wave]]s: the zero-frequency limit of the [[shear modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;G_0=0&lt;/math&gt;. This is sometimes seen as the defining property of a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Born |first1=Max |year=1940 |title=On the stability of crystal lattices |journal=Mathematical Proceedings |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=160–172 |publisher=Cambridge Philosophical Society |doi=10.1017/S0305004100017138 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2032432 |format= |accessdate= |bibcode=1940PCPS...36..160B |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119192921/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2032432 |archivedate=2015-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Born |first1=Max |year=1939 |title=Thermodynamics of Crystals and Melting |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=591–604 |publisher= |jstor= |doi=10.1063/1.1750497 |url=http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v7/i8/p591_s1?isAuthorized=no |format= |accessdate= |bibcode=1939JChPh...7..591B |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515021512/http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v7/i8/p591_s1?isAuthorized=no |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, just as the bulk modulus ''K'', the shear modulus ''G'' is frequency dependent,
and at hypersound frequencies it shows a similar cross over from the liquid-like limit &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; to a solid-like, non-zero limit &lt;math&gt;G_\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the [[Kramers-Kronig relation]], the dispersion in the sound velocity (given by the real part of ''K'' or ''G'') goes along with a maximum in the sound attenuation (dissipation, given by the imaginary part of ''K'' or ''G''). According to [[linear response theory]], the Fourier transform of ''K'' or ''G'' describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called [[structural relaxation]]. According to the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], relaxation ''towards'' equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations ''in'' equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by [[Brillouin scattering]].

On supercooling a liquid towards the glass transition, the crossover from liquid-like to solid-like response moves from GHz to MHz, kHz, Hz, ...; equivalently, the characteristic time of structural relaxation increases from ns to μs, ms, s, ... This is the microscopic explanation for the above-mentioned viscoelastic behaviour of glass-forming liquids.

===Effects of association===

The mechanisms of atomic/molecular [[diffusion]] (or [[particle displacement]]) in solids are closely related to the mechanisms of viscous flow and solidification in liquid materials. Descriptions of [[viscosity]] in terms of molecular "free space" within the liquid&lt;ref name="Macleod1923"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=D.B. Macleod |title=On a relation between the viscosity of a liquid and its coefficient of expansion |journal=Trans. Faraday Soc. |volume=19 |page=6 |date=1923 |doi=10.1039/tf9231900006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
were modified as needed in order to account for liquids whose molecules are known to be "associated" in the liquid state at ordinary temperatures. When various molecules combine together to form an associated molecule, they enclose within a semi-rigid system a certain amount of space which before was available as free space for mobile molecules. Thus, increase in viscosity upon cooling due to the tendency of most substances to become ''associated'' on cooling.&lt;ref name="Stewart1930"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=G.W. Stewart |title=The Cybotactic (Molecular Group) Condition in Liquids; the Association of Molecules |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=35 |page=726 |date=1930 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.35.726 |bibcode=1930PhRv...35..726S |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar arguments could be used to describe the effects of [[pressure]] on viscosity, where it may be assumed that the viscosity is chiefly a function of the volume for liquids with a finite [[compressibility]]. An increasing viscosity with rise of pressure is therefore expected. In addition, if the volume is expanded by heat but reduced again by pressure, the viscosity remains the same.

The local tendency to orientation of molecules in small groups lends the liquid (as referred to previously) a certain degree of association. This association results in a considerable "internal pressure" within a liquid, which is due almost entirely to those molecules which, on account of their temporary low velocities (following the Maxwell distribution) have coalesced with other molecules. The internal pressure between several such molecules might correspond to that between a group of molecules in the solid form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26610">{{Main|List of invasive species}}

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in [[North America]]'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, directly threatening human industry, such as agriculture, or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term ''invasive species'' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced, but remains local, and is not problematic for human industry or the local biodiversity, then it is not considered invasive, and does not belong on this list.

This is a '''list of the major rivers''' that flow through '''[[Ukraine]]'''.

Ukraine has around 23,000 rivers. Most of rivers of Ukraine drain into [[Black Sea]] and [[Azov Sea]] belonging to the bigger Mediterranean basin. Those rivers mostly flow in southern direction, except for some [[Pripyat]] tributaries in [[Volhynia]] and [[Dniester]] tributaries in [[Prykarpattia]]. A small portion of rivers is part of [[Western Bug]] drainage basin located in [[Western Ukraine]] near the border with [[Poland]]. Those rivers usually have northern direction and are part of bigger Baltic basin. The most notable rivers of Ukraine include: [[Dnieper]], [[Dniester]], [[Southern Buh]], and [[Siversky Donets]]. The longest river is Dnieper, the longest tributary is the Dnieper's tributary [[Desna River|Desna]]. Two of the [[Danube]]'s tributaries in Ukraine [[Prut]] and [[Tysa]] are longer than the main river within Ukraine.

The biggest river basin by area is Dnieper which is subdivided into Prypiat basin, Desna basin, basin of Middle Dnieper, basin of Lower Dnieper. Beside Dnieper, basin of the Danube zoning is also subdivided into basin of Tysa, basin of Prut and Siret, and basin of the Lower Danube.

==Trivia==
The most water in Ukraine is carried by [[Dnieper]]. Its annual drainage volume is {{convert|52.42|km3|abbr=on}}. The only other river that has higher drainage volume is the [[Danube]] which running through the [[Central Europe]] within Ukraine stretches only for {{convert|174|km|abbr=on}}. The average annual drainage of the Danube is around {{convert|123|km3|abbr=on}}.

The deepest river of Ukraine is [[Dniester]]. In its mid stream between Pyzhniv village and [[Mohyliv-Podilsky]] through the [[Dniester canyon]] ([[Podillia Upland]]) the river narrows to {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} in width and deepens up to {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}}.

The biggest water amount among [[Distributary|distributaries]] is carried by the [[Chilia branch]].

The biggest river delta in Ukraine belongs to Dnieper and has area of {{convert|350|km2|abbr=on}}, while the [[Danube Delta]] within Ukraine is only {{convert|120|km2|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29343">The '''National Parks of Argentina''' make up a network of 36 [[national park]]s in [[Argentina]]. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and [[biotope]]s, from [[Baritú National Park]] on the northern border with [[Bolivia]] to [[Tierra del Fuego National Park]] in the far south of the continent. The [[Administración de Parques Nacionales]] (National Parks Administration) is the agency that preserves and manages these national parks along with [[Natural monument]]s and [[National Reserve]]s within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.parquesnacionales.gob.ar/institucional/objetivos-de-la-administracion/
|language=Spanish |title= Objetivos de la Administración  |publisher=Administración de Parques Nacionales |accessdate= August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the National {{Not a typo|Parks}} Service are in downtown [[Buenos Aires]], on Santa Fe Avenue. A library and information centre are open to the public. The administration also covers the national monuments, such as the [[Bosques Petrificados de Jaramillo National Park|Jaramillo Petrified Forest]], and natural and educational reserves.

==History==
The creation of the National Parks dates back to the 1903 donation of {{convert|75|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land in the Lake District in the [[Andes]] foothills by [[Francisco Moreno]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.parquesnacionales.gob.ar/institucional/historia-institucional/
|language=Spanish |title= Historia Institucional |publisher=Administración de Parques Nacionales |accessdate= August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formed the nucleus of a larger protected area in [[Patagonia]] around [[San Carlos de Bariloche]]. In 1934, a law was passed creating the National Parks system, formalising the protected area as the [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]] and creating the [[Iguazú National Park]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Thus, Argentina was the third country in the [[Americas]], after [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to establish a national parks system.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The National Park Police Force was born, enforcing the new laws preventing tree-felling and hunting. Their early task was largely to establish national sovereignty over these disputed areas and to protect borders. Five further national parks were declared in 1937 in Patagonia and the service planned new towns and facilities to promote tourism and education. Six more were declared by 1970.

In 1970 a new law established new categories of protection: National Parks, National Monuments, Educational Reserves, and Natural Reserves. Three national parks were designated  in the 1970s. In 1980, another new law affirmed the status of national parks - this law is still in place. The 1980s saw the service reaching out to local communities and local government to help in the running and development of the national parks. Ten more national parks were created with local co-operation, sometimes at local instigation. In 2000, [[Mburucuyá National Park|Mburucuyá]] and [[Copo National Park]]s were declared, and [[El Leoncito National Park|El Leoncito]] natural reserve was upgraded to a national park. Currently, there are 41 [[protected areas]] in Argentina,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; which cover an area of {{convert|37000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} or about 1.5% of the total land area in Argentina.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

This is a '''list of rice varieties''', also known as '''rice [[Cultivar|cultivars]]'''. There are several grains called rice, which have been cultivated for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ricepedia.org/culture/history-of-rice-cultivation|title=History of rice cultivation - Ricepedia|work=Ricepedia|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oryza sativa|Asian rice]] (''Oryza sativa)'' is most widely known and most widely grown, with two major subspecies and over 90,000 varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html|title=Varieties - Rice Association|website=www.riceassociation.org.uk|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in this list are varieties of [[Oryza glaberrima|African rice]] (''Oryza glaberrima'') and [[wild rice]] (genus ''Zizania''). Rice may vary in genetics, grain length, color, thickness, stickiness, aroma, growing method, and other characteristics, leading to a vast preponderance of varieties. For instance, over nine major varieties of rice exist for the purpose of making [[sake]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esake.com/Knowledge/Ingredients/Rice/rice.html|title=Sake - types of rice used in brewing japanese rice wine|website=www.esake.com|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice can be divided into different categories on the basis of each of its major characteristics. The two subspecies of Asian rice, [[Indica rice|indica]] and [[Japonica rice|japonica]], can generally be distinguished by length and stickiness. Indica rice is long-grained and unsticky, while japonica is short-grained and [[Glutinous rice|glutinous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legroupindustries.com/the-two-main-types-of-rice-indica-rice-and-japonica-rice/|title=The two main types of rice: INDICA RICE and JAPONICA RICE|date=2017-10-09|work=LEGroup Industries - RICE - TUNA - CHEESE - JAMS|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of processing type, rice can be divided into the two broad categories of [[Brown rice|brown]] and [[White rice|white]]. Brown rice is [[whole grain]], with only the inedible [[Hull (botany)|hull]] of the seed removed, while [[White rice|white]] (milled) [[White rice|rice]] additionally has the [[bran]] and [[Cereal germ|germ]] removed through the process of [[milling (grinding)|milling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/15/the-difference-between-white-brown-and-red-rice_a_23277524/|title=The Difference Between White, Brown And Red Rice|last=Steen|first=Juliette|date=2017-11-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milled rice may not necessarily actually be white in color; there are also [[Black rice|purple]], [[Black rice|black]], and [[Red rice|red]] variants of rice, which can be eaten whole grain or milled.

The varieties listed in this article may vary in any number of these characteristics, and most can be eaten whole grain or milled (brown or white), although there are often strong cultural preferences for one or the other, depending on variety and region.

=== West Bengal rice varieties ===
There are possibly up to 82,700 varieties of rice extant in India, and of those more than 5000 were found in West Bengal. However, only 150 of them are commonly grown. Many are grown organically to compete with more modern cultivars. The Agricultural Training Centre of West Bengal exists to conserve and promote the use of folk rice varieties, including many listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/west-bengal-government-encourages-cultivation-of-extinct-rice-varieties/articleshow/60460634.cms|title=West Bengal government encourages cultivation of extinct rice varieties|last=Ghosal|first=Sutanuka|date=2017-09-11|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Gordillo''' is a world record aviator, and the first person to circumpolar navigate the world in an experimental aircraft with a mass of less than 1750 kilograms. He was commander of Iberia Airlines piloting Airbus A319, A320, and A321. In total he has more than 15,000 hours of flight. Gordillo is also a glider pilot, hold the title C silver, and is a member of the Spanish national glider team. He is fluent in Spanish, French and English.

==Life and times==
Michel Gordillo, born on 2 May 1955 as Miguel Ángel Gordillo Urquia in [[French Cameroun]] at [[Douala]] near the volcano [[Mount Cameroon]], and lived there until the age of seven. The family moved to the capital, [[Yaoundé]], during the [[Cameroon#Independence .281960.29|independence movement]] of [[Cameroon]]. In 1967, the family moved to [[Cannes]], [[France]] and then to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. After he completed the [[Spanish Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]], he entered the [[Spanish Air Force]] Academy selection group after passing a public examination. At present, Gordillo is retired and lives with his family in Spain.

==Career==

===Spanish Air Force===
He gained admission to the [[Spanish Air Force]] to train to be a future pilot. At [[San Javier, Murcia#Aerodrome|San Javier]] in [[Murcia]], Spain, he went through military training and after two years started [[flight training]]. The first aircraft was a [[Beechcraft T-34 Mentor]], and he flew [[First solo flight|solo]] and also received [[aerobatics]] training. He flew [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] planes and received navigation training (both visual and radio navigation). During his last year at the Academia General del Aire (AGA), he received advanced flight training with [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]] aircraft. Gordillo completed flight training that included formation flying, aerobatics, combat flying and [[Instrument Flight Rules]] (IFR) flying.  He received the fighter pilot aptitude, but took slot 20 of 24 and the fighter school only took the first 18 slots. Next came IFR multiengine training for one year at [[Salamanca]] where he flew the Spanish designed [[CASA C-212 Aviocar]] airplane. Gordillo was then assigned to the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P3 Orion]] [[anti-submarine warfare]] aircraft. (Note: in Spain the P-3 Orion is assigned to the [[Spanish Air Force#Aircraft inventory|Air Force]], not the Navy.) He became a fighter pilot, but was assigned as a ship and submarine fighter pilot. He flew the P-3 for seven years and became a crew leader. This is where he learned the challenges of locating someone in the water, as he also served in [[search and rescue]] aircraft and [[maritime patrol aircraft]] capacities. This experience would later serve him for his long distance oceanic flights. While assigned to the P-3 squadron, Gordillo received orders for one year to attend undergraduate and advanced navigator training with the [[U.S. Air Force]] at [[Mather Air Force Base]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. After his P-3 Orion assignment, he was transferred to the 45th Air Force Group. The Group is responsible for transporting VIP people, like the [[King of Spain]] and his family, government ministers and dignitaries, and other government officials. Gordillo flew the [[Falcon 20]] aircraft. Gordillo made the decision to retire rather than advance to major in the Air Force and receive an assignment as a [[desk jockey]] rather than a flight jockey.

===Iberia Airlines===
In 1987, Gordillo went to work for [[Iberia Airlines]] and flew the [[DC-9]], as [[copilot]]. Then he moved up to the [[MD-87]] aircraft for Iberia and was trained at [[Los Angeles]]. Next came long range aircraft, the four engine [[Airbus A340]] for flights from [[Miami]]. In 1998, he was promoted to captain, and assigned to fly the twin engine [[Airbus A320]], and later, [[Airbus A319]] and [[Airbus A321]]. Gordillo retired at the age of 58.

====Iberia incident====
On 5 January 2006, acting as captain of Flight 161 of [[Iberia Airlines]], Gordillo refused to take off for safety and security reasons due to faulty fire detector that had not been repaired. This resulted in his termination. During the judicial proceedings that ensued, a hearing was held on 22 June 2006 and his dismissal was declared inadmissible. However, by 15 November 2006, Gordillo was not reinstated to Iberia Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;Nénin, François. (August 2008). Iberia Airlines. Centre for Aviation Safety and Tourism. Observatory of Air Safety, OBSSAT. securvol.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft==

===Model aircraft===
As a boy, Gordillo was given a [[control line]] Air Cobra airplane, with a [[Cox model engine#The engines|.049 engine]]. Unfortunately, he was never able to start the engine. Gordillo bought his first magazine: ''Le modèle reduit d´avion'', a model aircraft magazine. The magazine changed his life and set the course for his calling in life. The magazine remains in his possession. 
Gordillo developed an interest in [[model airplanes]], first with [[Control line|U-Line models]], with .15 engines (combat and aerobatics). He entered the [[San Luis Aerodrome|Aeromodelling School]]. He moved on to [[Free flight (model aircraft)|free flight models]]. First [[Model aircraft#Gliders|gliders]] and then [[Model aircraft#Power sources|powered models]] called FAI F1C (International Aeronautics Federation: F1 stands for free flight and C fuel powered engines) He also flies F1B, rubber powered models.
After he completed the [[Spanish Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]], he entered the Spanish Air Force Academy selection group after passing a public examination. Gordillo spent one year at [[Granada]] waiting for a chance to become an Air Force pilot.

===Gliders===
While in the [[Spanish Air Force]], Gordillo was able to attend [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] school at [[Jerez]].
Gordillo received his initial glider instruction at [[Monflorite-Lascasas|Monflorite]] in [[Huesca]], Spain. He flew the [[LET L-13 Blaník|Blaník]] type glider for three or four flights and then upgraded to the Pirate type glider. For flight number 8 he flew for 5.5 hours and qualified for Silver C. On flight 9 he achieved Silver C distance and altitude and finally flew for flight number 10, to actually receive the C glider rating together with the [[FAI Gliding Commission#Badges|Silver C]] glider rating, something that no one had ever achieved in Spain.

===Kit planes===
Ever since Gordillo was in the Air Force Academy, he wanted to build his own airplane. Not until he became a commercial airline pilot was Gordillo able to build his first real aircraft, the [[Denny Kitfox|Denny Kitfox IV]]. The Kitfox was powered by an 80-horsepower (60&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Rotax 912]]. A good aircraft to fly slow and low. The next plane he built was a [[Dyn'Aéro MCR01]] aircraft with a [[Rotax 912|Rotax 912S]] engine. The most recent aircraft built was a [[Van's Aircraft RV-8]].

==Circumnavigational flights==

===Madosh===
The idea of "Madosh" (a [[portmanteau]] of the Madrid to Oshkosh flight) came about in 1996, since Gordillo wanted to fly into Oshkosh, Wisconsin for [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]]. Oshkosh is known as the Mecca of experimental aircraft builders. His plan was to take a different approach and fly eastward, into the sun, instead of flying west, from Spain. The Spanish Air Force and Iberia Airlines provided him support and sponsorship, and the dream became reality in 1998.

===Into the Sunrise===
His next project was to build a [[Dyn'Aéro MCR01]] aircraft with a [[Rotax 912|Rotax 912S]] engine. The flight plan this time called for another around the world flight and was called "Into the Sunrise." Iberia Airlines and the Spanish Air Force provided support and sponsorship for the flight in 2001. Gordillo flew east from Madrid and arrived in Oshkosh safely.

===Sky Polaris===
After taking some time off from building experimental aircraft, in 2003 Gordillo began making plans to build and fly the plane of his dreams, a [[Van's Aircraft RV-8]]. The project had three main goals. One goal was to collect [[atmospheric pollution]] data over remote area such as the desert areas, oceans, and the Arctic and Antarctic poles where no other small aircraft have previously flown. Another goal was to establish a new record maintained by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI), the C-1b record category for flight distance by light aircraft. The final goal was for Gordillo to complete a third circumnavigation in an experimental aircraft, the [[Van's Aircraft RV-8|RV-8]]. Previous flights were completed in 1998 in a [[Denney Kitfox|Denney Kitfox Model IV]], and then in 2001 in an [[Dyn'Aéro MCR01]].
Gordillo utilized an [[aethalometer]] to collect samples. The data collected during the flight will be analyzed in a project promoted by the Interuniversity Research Institute of the Earth System in [[Andalusia]] and the [[University of Granada]]. The object of the study will be to increase the body of evidence and knowledge regarding the role of the solid pollutants in [[global climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (11 February 2016).

====The aircraft====
For the circumpolar navigational trek, Gordillo flew a [[Van's Aircraft RV-8]], an experimental aircraft. The RV-8 is a high performance craft with a maximum airspeed of 356&amp;nbsp;km/h (221&amp;nbsp;mph). The aircraft is powered by a Superior XP IO-360 engine with 180-horsepower.

'''Mount Rogers''' is the highest natural point in the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]], [[United States]], with a summit elevation of {{convert|5729|ft}} above mean sea level. The summit straddles the border of [[Grayson County, Virginia|Grayson]] and [[Smyth County, Virginia|Smyth]] Counties, Virginia, about {{convert|6.45|mi|km}} WSW of [[Troutdale, Virginia]]. Most of the mountain is contained within the [[Lewis Fork Wilderness]], while the entire area is part of the [[Mount Rogers National Recreation Area]], which itself is a part of the [[Jefferson National Forest]].

The mountain is named for [[William Barton Rogers]], a Virginian educated at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], who taught at William &amp; Mary and the [[University of Virginia]], became Virginia's first State Geologist,&lt;ref&gt;http://web.wm.edu/geology/virginia/provinces/Blueridge/mtrogers.html&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to found the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

The summit is most easily accessed from [[Grayson Highlands State Park]] by following the [[Appalachian Trail]] southbound for {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to a blue-blazed trail leading to the summit, which is covered by trees and marked with four [[National Geodetic Survey]] [[Benchmark (surveying)|triangulation station disks]]; a standard station disk marked with an equilateral triangle and three standard reference disks marked with arrows pointing towards the station disk.  One reference disk has been obscured by dense overgrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ngs |pid=FZ2155 |name=Rogers Reset |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the Appalachian Trail passes within a half mile of the summit, the area is especially popular with hikers.
[[File:Mount Rogers summit.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The summit of Mount Rogers, Virginia.]]

==Geology==
The Mount Rogers area contains a unique record of the geohistory of Virginia. There is evidence from the rocks that [[volcano]]es were part of the landscape. Roughly 750 million years ago, [[rift]]-related (divergent) volcanoes erupted along the axis of what later became the Appalachians, and one remnant of that volcanic zone, with its [[volcanic rock]]s, still can be seen at Mount Rogers. Massive [[rhyolite]] [[lava]] flows erupted at the mountain during the [[Precambrian]] rifting event. Mount Rogers is also the only place in Virginia that preserves evidence of ancient [[Proterozoic]] [[glaciation]].

==Spruce-fir forests==
[[Image:Mount Rogers - Spruce-Fir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Forest of red spruce and Fraser fir on the slopes of Mount Rogers]] Mount Rogers is the northernmost habitat of the high-altitude [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]]s, which are found in only five other locations in the United States: the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], the [[Black Mountains (North Carolina)|Black Mountains]], the [[Great Balsam Mountains]], [[Grandfather Mountain]], and [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]].&lt;ref name="potter"&gt;Potter, Kevin M., Frampton, John, and Sidebottom, Jill. [https://www.academia.edu/3819203/IMPACTS_OF_BALSAM_WOOLLY_ADELGID_ON_THE_SOUTHERN_APPALACHIAN_SPRUCE-FIR_ECOSYSTEM_AND_THE_NORTH_CAROLINA_CHRISTMAS_TREE_INDUSTRY "Impacts of balsam woolly adelgid on the southern Appalachian spruce-fir ecosystem and the North Carolina Christmas tree industry"]. Third Symposium on Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in the Eastern United States, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This forest type is one of the few remaining habitats of the [[Abies fraseri|Fraser fir]], which is only found at high elevations, typically above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}, in the southern Appalachian Mountains.

These forests have suffered recent declines due to infestations by the [[Adelges piceae|balsam woolly adelgid (''Adelges piceae'')]], a non-native insect that originated in Europe. It first infested Mount Rogers in 1962 and the entire U.S. population of Fraser firs suffered a 67% mortality rate since,&lt;ref name="potter" /&gt; although Mount Rogers was not affected as severely as other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Leslie P., and Hain, Fred P. [http://na.fs.fed.us/fhp/hwa/pubs/proceedings/2005_proceedings/newton.pdf "Host interactions of the balsam woolly adelgid"]. Third Symposium on Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in the United States, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have proposed that air pollution in the form of nitrogen and sulfur compounds originating from power plants has been a source of stress to the Fraser firs, resulting in an increased susceptibility to the balsam woolly adelgid, but this relationship has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name="potter" /&gt;

'''Nanoionic supercapacitors''' belong to new class of [[nanoionic devices]], i.e. devices operating due to fast ion transport at nano-scale. An example of such a device is a nanoionic switch with quantum conductance.  All solid state micrometre sized supercapacitors; based on advanced superionic conductors i.e. nanoionic [[supercapacitor]]s, have of late gained recognition as critical electron components of future sub-voltage and deep sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies.

Supercapacitors based on advanced superionic conductors were developed several decades ago, however
the capacity density of their functional heterojunctions (disordered crystal structure) is 100 -10 microF/cm2
at frequencies ~0,01–1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Low operation frequencies of such heterojunctions are the result of violations of
fast ion transport conditions in molecular-thin double electric layer on the heterojunctions. The major approach to [[nanoionics of advanced superionic conductors]] is to retain the concentration and potential barrier heights to mobile
ion jumps on functional heterojunctions at the level of those in the volume. Nanoionic supercapacitors should be devices with fast ion transport in double electric layer and record high capacity-frequency characteristics.

'''''Nuclear War Survival Skills''''' or '''NWSS''', by [[Cresson Kearny]], is a [[civil defense]] manual.  It contains information gleaned from research performed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] during the [[Cold War]], as well as from Kearny's extensive jungle living and international travels.

''Nuclear War Survival Skills'' aims to provide a general audience with advice on how to [[Survivalist|survive]] conditions likely to be encountered in the event of a [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear catastrophe]], as well as encouraging optimism in the face of such a catastrophe by asserting the [[Nuclear warfare#Survival|survivability]] of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

==Overview==
The main chapters are preceded by [[foreword]]s from [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]. Following this is an introduction which explains that even the fruition of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] program would not make "self-help civil defense" obsolete. A comparison is made of the civil defense preparations of Switzerland, Russia, and the United States, where it is concluded that: "Switzerland has the best civil defense system"; "The rulers of the Soviet Union... continue to prepare the Russians to fight, survive, and win all types of wars"; and that "the United States has advocated... a strategy that purposely leaves its citizens unprotected hostages to its enemies."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=2–10}} Thus, "The emphasis in this book is on survival preparations that can be made in the last few days of a worsening crisis."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=2–10}}

===The Dangers from Nuclear Weapons: Myths and Facts===
The first chapter aims to give background information to dispel various demoralizing myths and reaffirm the potential survivability and reality of nuclear weapons. "An all-out nuclear war between Russia and the United States would... be far from the end of human life on earth."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=11–20}} Myths listed include: "[[Fallout]] radiation from a nuclear war would poison the air and all parts of the environment. It would kill everyone."; "Fallout radiation [[Radiation#Gamma|penetrates]] everything; there is [[Radiation protection|no escaping]] its deadly effects."; and "Unsurvivable "[[nuclear winter]]" surely will follow a nuclear war."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=11–20}}

===Psychological Preparations===
This chapter provides information on the immediate effects of thermonuclear explosions, and peoples' likely reactions to them, in an attempt to lessen the terror and confusion that would be prevalent after an unexpected nuclear attack. "Some people would think the end of the world was upon them if they happened to be in an area downwind from surface bursts of nuclear weapons that sucked millions of tons of pulverized earth into the air."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|p=21}}

===Warnings and Communications===
Illustrates the limitations of the National Warning System ([[NAWAS]]) and the Attack Warning Signal sirens, concluding that "In an all-out attack, the early explosions would give sufficient warning for most people to reach nearby shelter in time."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=23–25}}

===Evacuation===
Due to the replacement of large warheads on inaccurate missiles with smaller warheads on more accurate missiles, "you may logically conclude that unless your home is closer than 10 miles from the nearest probable target, you need not evacuate to avoid blast and fire dangers."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=28–30}} Evacuation relevant to fallout radiation risk is thoroughly discussed, where it is noted that most available fallout risk-area maps are inaccurate, outdated, and misleading.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=28–30}}

===Shelter, the Greatest Need===
Provides information on fallout protection and basic structures; complete designs for "6 types of earth-covered expedient [[Fallout shelter|shelters]]" are provided in Appendix A.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|p=37}}

===Ventilation and Cooling of Shelters===
[[File:Kearny Air Pump ( KAP ).png|thumb|right|[[Kearny air pump]]]] 
"Some shelters will become dangerously hot in a few hours."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=51–56}} The [[Kearny air pump]] (for which a design is included in the appendix) is recommended, with natural ventilation considered typically inadequate, and electric pumps considered unreliable and prone to heating the air.&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Instructions for Building a Homemade Large-Volume Shelter-Ventilating Punka-Pump.|year=1967|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4455031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filters are considered unnecessary, "the hazards from fallout particles carried into shelters by unfiltered ventilating air are minor compared to the dangers from inadequate ventilation."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=51–56}}

===Protection Against Fires and Carbon Monoxide===
Fire is considered the third-most-dangerous hazard, after direct blast effects and fallout radiation. It is noted that during the [[Bombing of Dresden]], "Most casualties were caused by the inhalation of hot gases and carbon monoxide"{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=62–66}}

===Water===
[[File:Page9.png|thumb|right|[[Kearny Fallout Meter]]]]
The importance of [[Potable water|water]] to basic survival is discussed, with the recommendation that "four or five quarts of drinking water per day are essential."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=67–71}} Methods of storing, transporting, and purifying water are also explained, with plastic-lined earthen storage pits recommended for storing large quantities.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=67–71}}

===Food===
A basic diet, vegetarian and consisting only of bulk [[Staple food|staples]], is presented, along with basic nutrition facts and special advice for the very young, very old, and sick. "And because of the remarkable productivity of American agriculture, there usually would be enough grain and beans in storage to supply surviving Americans with sufficient food for at least a year following a heavy nuclear attack.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=76–78}}

===Fallout Radiation Meters===
[[File:KFMPage11.png|thumb|right|Kearny Fallout Meter]]
Reviews the best dose-rate meters and dosimeters available in 1987 and details the [[Kearny fallout meter]], a "Homemakeable dose-rate meter", which can be built from a correctly scaled copy of the plans, such as those provided in hardcopies of the book; photocopies and printouts of digital copies may not be to scale.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=95–100}}&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter|year=1978|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325094514/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light===
"Under wartime conditions, even a faint light that shows only the shapes of nearby people and things can make the difference between an endurable situation, and a black ordeal."{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=101–103}} Plans for an expedient cooking-oil powered lamp are included.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=101–103}}

===Shelter Sanitation and Preventive Medicine===
Topics covered include: Clean Water and Food; Control of Insects; Prevention of Skin Diseases; Disposal of Human Wastes; Disposal of Dead Bodies; and Respiratory Diseases.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=106–108}}

===Surviving Without Doctors===
''[[Where There Is No Doctor]]'' is recommended to supplement to this chapter. Excerpts are provided, along with additional information specific to the [[Acute radiation syndrome|health effects of radiation]] and the use of [[potassium iodide]].{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=109–117}}

===Expedient Shelter Furnishings===
Improvised furniture is discussed, including a hammock made from bedsheets, and a hanging chair made from the hammock.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=118–125}}

===Improvised Clothing and Protective Items===
The basic principles of [[thermal insulation]] are explained; ideas for expedient cold- and wet-weather clothing are provided.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=126–132}}

===Minimum Pre-Crisis Preparations===
A list of recommended preparations are given for: shelter, shelter ventilation, water, food, fallout meters, sanitation, medicines, light, communications, etc.{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=133–134}}

==Reception==
In an article sharply critical of the whole genre, the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' (Vol 39, 1983) characterizes the volume  as being one of the two more "substantial" books on surviving nuclear war out of the four reviewed.  The other "substantial" book, ''Life After Doomsday: A Survivalist Guide to Nuclear War and Other Major Disasters'' by [[Bruce D. Clayton]], itself is stated to praise and borrow from ''Nuclear War Survival Skills''. The BAS article backhandedly compliments NWSS on its inclusion of features such as "elaborate diagrams for building shelter; testing for radiation with homemade meters; providing for ventilation; filtration of water and sanitation," but goes on to say that the basic flaw with NWSS and the other books reviewed is that they deal only with short-term survival, and sidestep putting heavy thought into the long-term ramifications of nuclear conflict for the continued survival of both their assiduous readers and the balance of the human race.&lt;ref name=B1AS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|title=Programs for Surviving Nuclear War: A Critique|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=June–July 1983|volume=39|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42-IA9&amp;lpg=PA42-IA9&amp;dq=Bulletin+of+the+Atomic+Scientists+June+1983&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rRpho3qLLS&amp;sig=a0THJrUDBb_i3jufins_rx-okRc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8T57UL7MCcqp0AH994DwAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article suggests that "the best and certainly most honest publication [in the post-apocalyptic survival guide genre] is ''The Official Government Nuclear Survivors' Manual: Everything that is Known about Effective Procedures in Case of Nuclear Attack''" (published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), which "has 192 pages, all blank."&lt;ref name=B1AS /&gt;

===Publication history===
''Nuclear War Survival Skills'' was released into the [[public domain]] by [[Cresson Kearny|the author]], and is available in digital format for free from several sources online. In the printed form, a modest charge will generally be incurred.

Originally released September 1979, it was updated and republished in May 1987 with a significant addition on [[nuclear winter]], consisting largely of detailing the [[Nuclear winter#Criticism and debate|shaky assumptions used by nuclear winter models]].{{sfn|Kearny|1988|pp=11–20}} In 2001 a one-page addendum on [[radiation hormesis]] was added.

These are, in descending order by area, the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] (Antarctic), and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] Oceans.&lt;ref name="oed.130201"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/130201?redirectedFrom=ocean#eid |title=ocean, n |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw.ocean"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ocean |title=ocean |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ocean" is often used interchangeably with "sea" in [[American English]]. Strictly speaking, a ''[[sea]]'' is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land,&lt;ref name="pri.sea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=sea |title=WordNet Search — sea |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though "the sea" refers also to the oceans.

Saline water covers approximately {{convert|361,000,000|km2|abbr=on}} and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=NOAA – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Ocean |url=http://www.noaa.gov/ocean.html |publisher=Noaa.gov |accessdate=2012-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and [[Oceanography|oceanographers]] have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov" /&gt; The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly {{convert|3700|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="hypertextbook2003"&gt;{{cite web |last=Qadri |first=Syed |title=Volume of Earth's Oceans |work=The Physics Factbook |date=2003 |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/SyedQadri.shtml |accessdate=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charette_Smith_Ocean-depth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charette |first=Matthew |last2=Smith |first2=Walter H.

As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to [[life]], forms part of the [[carbon cycle]], and influences [[climate]] and [[weather]] patterns. The World Ocean is the [[habitat]] of 230,000 known [[species]], but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million.&lt;ref name="la.2009"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mapping an ocean of species |last=Drogin |first=Bob |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/nation/na-fish2 |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Origin of water on Earth|origin of Earth's oceans]] is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the [[Hadean]] eon and may have been the impetus for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].

[[Extraterrestrial oceans]] may be composed of water or other [[Chemical element|elements]] and [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface [[liquids]] are the [[lakes of Titan]], although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. Early in their geologic histories, [[Mars]] and [[Venus]] are theorized to have had large water oceans. The [[Mars ocean hypothesis]] suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a [[runaway greenhouse effect]] may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ammonia]] dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting [[ice]]. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many [[dwarf planets]] and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's [[giant planet]]s are also thought to have liquid [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on [[exoplanet]]s and [[exomoon]]s, including surface oceans of liquid water within a [[circumstellar habitable zone]]. [[Ocean planet]]s are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.&lt;ref name="mindblowingscience"&gt;{{cite web |title=Titan Likely To Have Huge Underground Ocean {{!}} Mind Blowing Science |url=http://mindblowingscience.com/latest-news/titan-likely-to-have-huge-underground-ocean/ |publisher=Mindblowingscience.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ocean-bearing Planets: Looking For Extraterrestrial Life In All The Right Places |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081215091011.htm |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word « ocean » comes from the figure in [[classical antiquity]], [[Oceanus]] ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|n|ə|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|Ὠκεανός}}}} ''Ōkeanós'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29wkeano%2Fs Ὠκεανός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-el|ɔːkeanós|pron}}), the elder of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] in classical [[Greek mythology]], believed by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to be the divine personification of the [[sea]], an enormous [[river]] encircling the world.

The concept of Ōkeanós has an [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the [[Vedic]] epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ranko Matasović|Matasović, Ranko]], [http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/PIE%20Religion.pdf A Reader in Comparative Indo-European Religion] Zagreb: Univ of Zagreb, 2016. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally described as several separate oceans, the global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the [[World Ocean|World Ocean or global ocean]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ocean |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/o/ocean.htm |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"{{cite web|url=http://www.oceansatlas.org/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html|title=Distribution of land and water on the planet|work=[http://www.oceansatlas.org/index.jsp UN Atlas of the Oceans]|publisher=|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234925/http://www.oceansatlas.org/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref name="spil.42"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spilhaus |first=Athelstan F. |date=July 1942 |title=Maps of the whole world ocean |volume=32 | issue = 3  |pages=431–5 |doi=10.2307/210385 |journal=Geographical Review|jstor=210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Three main types of [[Plate tectonics|plate]] boundaries.]]

=== Physical properties ===
{{further|Seawater}}

The total mass of the [[hydrosphere]] is about 1.4 quintillion metric tons ({{val|1.4|e=18}} long tons or {{val|1.5|e=18}} short tons), which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. Less than 3% is [[freshwater]]; the rest is [[seawater|saltwater]], almost all of which is in the ocean. The area of the World Ocean is about 361.9 million square kilometers (139.7 million square miles),&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt; which covers about 70.9% of Earth's surface, and its volume is approximately 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (320.3 million cubic miles).&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt; This can be thought of as a cube of water with an edge length of {{convert|1101|km|mi|sp=us}}.

=== Oceanic zones ===
[[File:Oceanic divisions.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|The major oceanic zones, based on depth and biophysical conditions |alt=Drawing showing divisions according to depth and distance from shore]]

Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical [[Oceanic zone|zones]] defined by physical and biological conditions. The [[pelagic zone]] includes all open ocean regions, and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The [[photic zone]] includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200&amp;nbsp;m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most [[biodiverse]]. Because plants require [[photosynthesis]], life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see [[marine snow]]) or find another energy source. [[Hydrothermal vents]] are the primary source of energy in what is known as the [[aphotic zone]] (depths exceeding 200&amp;nbsp;m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the [[epipelagic]].

The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature.
The [[mesopelagic]] is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a [[thermocline]] of {{convert|12|C|F}}, which, in the [[tropics]] generally lies at {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}}. Next is the [[bathypelagic]] lying between {{convert|10|and|4|C|F}}, typically between {{convert|700|-|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} and {{convert|2000|-|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}, lying along the top of the [[abyssal plain]] is the [[abyssal zone|abyssopelagic]], whose lower boundary lies at about {{convert|6000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The last zone includes the deep [[oceanic trench]], and is known as the [[hadal zone|hadalpelagic]]. This lies between {{convert|6000|-|11000|m|ft|sp=us}} and is the deepest oceanic zone.

The [[benthic]] zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the [[deep-sea]]. The [[bathyal zone]] covers the continental slope down to about {{convert|4000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000&amp;nbsp;m. Lastly, the [[hadal]] zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.

The pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the [[neritic zone]] and the [[oceanic zone]]. The neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the [[continental shelves]] whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.

In contrast, the [[littoral zone]] covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the [[intertidal]] zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.

If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a [[thermocline]]. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1&amp;nbsp;°C to 3&amp;nbsp;°C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9&amp;nbsp;°C. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a [[halocline]]. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a [[chemocline]].

The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of large underwater features (1995, [[NOAA]])|alt=False color photo]]

The deepest point in the ocean is the [[Mariana Trench]], located in the Pacific Ocean near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be {{convert|10971|m|ft|sp=us}} (plus or minus 11 meters; see the [[Mariana Trench]] article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel ''Challenger II'' surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the "[[Challenger Deep]]". In 1960, the [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]] successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.

=== Oceanic maritime currents ===
[[File:Ocean currents 1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Oceanic surface currents (U.S. Army, 1943).]]
[[File:M2 tidal constituent.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Amphidromic points showing the direction of [[tides]] per incrementation periods along with resonating directions of wavelength movements.]]

Oceanic maritime currents have different origins. Tidal currents are in phase with the [[tide]], hence are [[Quasiperiodicity|quasiperiodic]], they may form various knots in certain places,{{clarify|date=September 2017}} most notably around [[Cape (geography)|headlands]]. Non periodic currents have for origin the waves, wind and different densities.

The [[wind]] and [[wave]]s create surface currents (designated as « drift currents »). These currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of [[Stokes drift]] under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds).).&lt;ref&gt;Étude de la dérive à la surface sous l’effet du vent, ''Observation and estimation of Lagrangian, Stokes and Eulerian currents induced by wind and waves at the sea surface'', F. Ardhuin, L. Marié, N. Rascle, P. Forget, and A. Roland, 2009: J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 39, n° 11, pp. 2820–2838.&lt;/ref&gt; The quasi permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Mesure de l’effet de frottement à la surface de la mer, "Tangential stress beneath wind-driven air-water interfaces", M. L. Banner and W. L. Peirson, ''J. Fluid Mech.'', vol. 364, pp. 115–145, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the [[earth]] changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the [[Ekman spiral]]. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the [[Thermocline]].&lt;ref&gt;Courants mesurés près de la surface, ''The drift current from observations made on the bouee laboratoire'', Joseph Gonella, 1971: Cahiers Océanographiques, vol. 23, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Deep sea|deep]] however, maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the [[salinity]] between water density masses.

In [[littoral zone]]s, [[breaking wave]] is so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|A map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represent deep-water currents, whereas red represent surface currents|thumb|upright=0.9|left |alt=World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic.]]

[[Ocean current]]s greatly affect Earth's [[climate]] by transferring heat from the tropics to the [[polar regions]]. Transferring warm or cold air and [[precipitation]] to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater [[flux]]es create global [[density gradient]]s that drive the [[thermohaline circulation]] part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on [[Earth's energy budget]]. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations.

For a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under [[global warming]], see [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]].

It is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of Western Europe is so temperate. An alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies [[downwind]] of an ocean basin, and because [[atmospheric waves]] bring warm air north from the [[subtropics]].&lt;ref name="sea.2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1511/2006.60.999| title = The Source of Europe's Mild Climate| journal = American Scientist| volume = 94| issue = 4| pages = 334| year = 2006| last1 = Seager | first1 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rc.2003"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2003 |url=http://www.realclimate.org/Rhines_hakkinen_2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Is the Oceanic Heat Transport in the North Atlantic Irrelevant to the Climate in Europe? |journal=ASOF Newsletter |last=Rhines |last2=Hakkinen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.

One of the most dramatic forms of [[weather]] occurs over the oceans: [[tropical cyclone]]s (also called "typhoons" and "hurricanes" depending upon where the system forms).

=== Biology ===
{{further|Marine biology}}

The ocean has a significant effect on the [[biosphere]]. Oceanic [[evaporation]], as a phase of the [[water cycle]], is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine [[climate]] and [[wind]] patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean [[evolution|evolved]] 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the [[biodiversity]] of the plants and animals present in each region.&lt;ref name="bcc.34"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: Concepts &amp; Connections |chapter=Chapter 34: The Biosphere: An Introduction to Earth's Diverse Environment |at=section 34.7 |publisher= |date= |url=http://wps.aw.com/bc_campbell_concepts_7_oa/215/55135/14114612.cw/-/t/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is thought that life evolved in the ocean, the diversity of life is immense, including:
* [[Bacteria]] : ubiquitous single-celled [[prokaryotes]] found throughout the world
* [[Archaea]] : [[prokaryotes]] distinct from bacteria, that inhabit many environments of the ocean, as well as many [[extremophile|extreme environments]]
* [[Algae]] : algae is a "catch-all" term to include many [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], [[protist|single-celled]] [[eukaryote]]s, such as [[green algae]], [[diatom]]s, and [[dinoflagellates]], but also multicellular algae, such as some [[red algae]] (including organisms like [[Pyropia]], which is the source of the edible [[nori]] seaweed), and [[brown algae]] (including organisms like [[kelp]]).
* [[Plants]] : including [[seagrass|sea grasses]], or [[mangroves]]
* [[Fungi]] : many [[marine fungi]] with diverse roles are found in oceanic environments
* [[Animals]] : most animal [[phylum|phyla]] have species that inhabit the ocean, including many that are only found in marine environments such as [[Porifera|sponges]], [[Cnidaria]] (such as [[coral]]s and [[jellyfish]]), [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]], [[Brachiopod]]s, and [[Echinoderm]]s (such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[sea star]]s). Many other familiar animal groups primarily live in the ocean, including [[cephalopod]]s (includes [[octopus]] and [[squid]]), [[crustacean]]s (includes [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, and [[shrimp]]), [[fish]], [[sharks]], [[cetacean]]s (includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s).

In addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, [[seabirds]] are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are [[penguin]]s, [[Gull|seagulls]] and [[Pelecaniformes|pelicans]]. Seven species of turtles, the [[sea turtle]]s, also spend most of their time in the oceans.

=== Salinity ===
A zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a [[halocline]]. The temperature of maximum density of [[Salinity#Seawater|seawater]] decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with [[salinity]]. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9&amp;nbsp;°C at [[atmospheric pressure]]. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, as is the case in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, as is the case in tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chester, Roy |author2=Jickells, Tim  |title=Marine Geochemistry |date=2012 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-1-118-34907-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcuoAr_wUaQC  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity, which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions (includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in seawater. By international agreement, the following formula is used to determine salinity:

'''Salinity (in ‰) = 1.80655 × Chlorinity (in ‰)'''

The average chlorinity is about 19.2‰, and, thus, the average salinity is around 34.7‰ &lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

Although Earth is the only known [[planet]] with large stable bodies of liquid water on its surface and the only one in the [[Solar System]], other celestial bodies are thought to have large oceans.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150407"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Chou |first2=Felcia |title=The Solar System and Beyond is Awash in Water |url=http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/the-solar-system-and-beyond-is-awash-in-water/ |date=7 April 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planets ===

The [[gas giant]]s, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], are thought to lack surfaces and instead have a stratum of [[liquid hydrogen]]; however their [[planetary geology]] is not well understood. The possibility of the [[ice giant]]s [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] having hot, highly compressed, [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] water&lt;!-- {{efn |name=pressures}} --&gt; under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised. Although their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz and Ingersall ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune,&lt;ref name="WiktorowiczIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiktorowicz |first1=Sloane J. |last2=Ingersoll |first2=Andrew P. |title=Liquid water oceans in ice giants |journal=Icarus |volume=186 |issue=2 |date=2007 |pages=436–447 |issn=0019-1035 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.09.003 |arxiv=astro-ph/0609723 |bibcode=2007Icar..186..436W }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid [[diamond]] are possible.&lt;ref name="Silvera2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silvera |first1=Isaac |title=Diamond: Molten under pressure |journal=Nature Physics |volume=6 |issue=1 |date=2010 |pages=9–10 |issn=1745-2473 |doi=10.1038/nphys1491 |bibcode=2010NatPh...6....9S |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9121282/melting_diamond.pdf?sequence=2 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mars ocean hypothesis]] suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic (much of it residing in the [[Martian polar ice caps|ice caps]]). The possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance. Astronomers think that [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]] had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} If they existed, all later vanished via [[Geology of Venus|resurfacing]].

=== Natural satellites ===

A global layer of liquid water thick enough to decouple the crust from the mantle is thought to be present on the [[natural satellite]]s [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] and, with less certainty, [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]&lt;ref name="clubsandwich 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-138 |title=Ganymede May Harbor 'Club Sandwich' of Oceans and Ice |work=NASA |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ganymede's internal structure including thermodynamics of magnesium sulfate oceans in contact with ice |journal=Planetary and Space Science |date=12 April 2014 |last=Vance |first=Steve |last2=Bouffard |first2=Mathieu |last3=Choukroun |first3=Mathieu |last4=Sotina |first4=Christophe |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063314000695 |accessdate=2014-05-02 |doi=10.1016/j.pss.2014.03.011 |bibcode=2014P&amp;SS...96...62V |volume=96 |pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]].&lt;ref name="EncycSolSys-Triton"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |chapter=Triton |last1=McKinnon |first1=William B. |last2=Kirk |first2=Randolph L. |publisher=Academic Press |date=2007 |editor=Lucy Ann Adams McFadden  |editor2=Lucy-Ann Adams |editor3=Paul Robert Weissman|editor4=Torrence V.

Large bodies of liquid hydrocarbons are thought to be present on the surface of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], although they are not large enough to be considered oceans and are sometimes referred to as ''lakes'' or seas. The [[Cassini–Huygens]] space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. Cassini's more recent fly-by of Titan offers radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes exist near the colder polar regions. Titan is thought to have a subsurface liquid-water ocean under the ice and hydrocarbon mix that forms its outer crust.

=== Dwarf planets and trans-Neptunian objects ===
[[File:Ceres Cutaway-en.svg|left|thumb|Diagram showing a possible internal structure of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]]]

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] appears to be [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] into a [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] [[core (geology)|core]] and icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and may harbour a liquid-water ocean under its surface.&lt;ref name="mccord.2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCord |first=Thomas B. |title=Ceres: Evolution and current state |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |issue=E5 |page=E05009 |date=2005 |doi=10.1029/2004JE002244 |bibcode=2005JGRE..11005009M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cr.ceres"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castillo-Rogez |first=J.

Not enough is known of the larger [[trans-Neptunian object]]s to determine whether they are differentiated bodies capable of supporting oceans, although models of radioactive decay suggest that [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]],&lt;ref name="pluto"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Inside Story |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |work=pluto.jhuapl.edu&amp;nbsp;— NASA New Horizons mission site |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/everything_pluto/9_insideStory.php |date=2013 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113225441/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/everything_pluto/9_insideStory.php |archivedate=13 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] have oceans beneath solid icy crusts approximately {{nowrap|100 to 180 km}} thick.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006" /&gt;

=== Extrasolar ===
[[File:UpsilonAndromedae D moons.jpg|thumb|right|Rendering of a hypothetical large [[extrasolar moon]] with surface liquid-water oceans]]

Some planets and natural satellites outside the Solar System are likely to have oceans, including possible water ocean planets similar to Earth in the [[habitable zone]] or "liquid-water belt". The detection of oceans, even through the [[spectroscopy]] method, however is likely extremely difficult and inconclusive.

Theoretical models have been used to predict with high probability that [[GJ 1214 b]], detected by transit, is composed of exotic form of [[ice VII]], making up 75% of its mass,&lt;ref name="cfa.pr200924"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |title=Astronomers Find Super-Earth Using Amateur, Off-the-Shelf Technology |first=David A. |last=Aguilar |date=2009-12-16 |work= |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=January 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
making it an [[ocean planet]].

Other possible candidates are merely speculated based on their mass and position in the habitable zone include planet though little is actually known of their composition. Some scientists speculate [[Kepler-22b]] may be an "ocean-like" planet.&lt;ref name="upr.exo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/updatesonexoplanetsduringthefirstkeplerscienceconference |title=Updates on Exoplanets during the First Kepler Science Conference |date=2011-12-08 |first=Abel |last=Mendez Torres |publisher=Planetary Habitability Laboratory at [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo|UPR Arecibo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Models have been proposed for [[Gliese 581 d]] that could include surface oceans. [[Gliese 436 b]] is speculated to have an ocean of "hot ice".&lt;ref name="r.20070516"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/16/us-space-planet-idUSN1621607620070516 |title=Hot "ice" may cover recently discovered planet |first=Maggie |last=Fox |work=[[Reuters]] |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exomoon]]s orbiting planets, particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceans.

Terrestrial planets will acquire water during their accretion, some of which will be buried in the magma ocean but most of it will go into a steam atmosphere, and when the atmosphere cools it will collapse on to the surface forming an ocean. There will also be outgassing of water from the mantle as the magma solidifies—this will happen even for planets with a low percentage of their mass composed of water, so "super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact."&lt;ref name="ass.332"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elkins-Tanton |doi=10.1007/s10509-010-0535-3 |title=Formation of Early Water Oceans on Rocky Planets |date=2010 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=332 |issue=2 |pages=359–364 |arxiv=1011.2710 |bibcode=2011Ap&amp;SS.332..359E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-water surface liquids ===

Oceans, seas, lakes and other bodies of liquids can be composed of liquids other than water, for example the [[hydrocarbon]] lakes on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The possibility of seas of [[nitrogen]] on [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] was also considered but ruled out.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |chapter=Triton |last1=McKinnon |first1=William B. |last2=Kirk |first2=Randolph L. |publisher=Academic Press |date=2007 |editor=Lucy Ann Adams McFadden  |editor2=Lucy-Ann Adams |editor3=Paul Robert Weissman|editor4=Torrence V.

To help compare different '''[[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]''', the following lists describe various [[mass]] levels between 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;40&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;[[kilogram|kg]] and 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

==Units of mass==
&lt;div style="float:right; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;
{{SI multiples
| unit = gram
| symbol = g
| note = Common prefixes are in bold face.&lt;ref&gt;Criterion: A combined total of at least 250,000 Google hits on both the modern spelling ({{nbhyph}}gram) and the traditional British spelling ({{nbhyph}}gramme).&lt;sub&gt;{{nbsp}}&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
| p= | n= | μ= | m= | k= | mc=
| xM = megagram ('''[[tonne]]''')
| xmc = microgram (mcg)
}}
&lt;/div&gt;
The table below is based on the [[kilogram]] (kg), the base unit of mass in the [[International System of Units]] ([[SI]]). The kilogram is the only standard unit to include an [[SI prefix]] (''kilo-'') as part of its name.  The ''[[gram]]'' (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kg) is an SI derived unit of mass. However, the ''names'' of all SI mass units are based on ''gram'', rather than on ''kilogram''; thus 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg is a ''megagram'' (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; g), not a "kilokilogram".

The ''[[tonne]]'' (t) is a SI-compatible unit of mass equal to a megagram, or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg. The unit is in common use for masses above about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg and is often used with SI prefixes. For example, a gigagram or 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;tonne, commonly called a ''kilotonne''.
 
===Other units===
Other units of mass are also in use.  Historical units include the [[Stone (imperial mass)|stone]], the  [[Pound (mass)|pound]], the [[Carat (mass)|carat]], and the [[Grain (unit)|grain]].

For subatomic particles, physicists use the mass equivalent to the energy represented by an [[electronvolt]] (eV).  At the atomic level, chemists use the mass of one-twelfth of a carbon-12 atom (the [[Atomic mass unit|dalton]]).  Astronomers use the [[Solar mass|mass of the sun]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}).

=== Below 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg ===

Unlike other physical quantities, mass-energy does not have an ''a priori'' expected minimal quantity, as is the case with [[Planck time|time]] or [[Planck length|length]], or an observed basic quantum as in the case of [[Elementary charge|electric charge]]. [[Planck's law]] allows for the existence of photons with arbitrarily low energies. Consequently, there can only ever be an experimental lower bound on the mass of a supposedly massless particle; in the case of the photon, this confirmed lower bound is of the order of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; eV = 10&lt;sup&gt;−62&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Pollen count''' is the measurement of the number of grains of [[pollen]] in a [[cubic meter]] of [[air]]. High pollen counts can sometimes lead to increased rates of an allergic reaction for those with allergic disorders. Usually, the counts are announced for specific plants such as grass, ash, or olive. These are tailored to common plants in the measured areas. Mild winters with warmer days lead to an increase in pollen counts&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/268-743.pdf|title=What is Pollen?|last=Skinner|first=Anne|date=Aug 6, 2016|work=Master Gardener Newspaper|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while colder winters lead to delayed pollen release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the UK, the public announcement of the pollen count was popularised by Dr. [[William Frankland (Immunologist)|William Frankland]], an immunologist.

According to a study by Leonard Bielory, M.D. that was presented to the [[American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology]], [[climate change]]s are expected to cause pollen counts to more than double by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newswise.com/articles/the-year-2040-double-the-pollen-double-the-allergy-suffering&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring Pollen Count ==
One method of taking the sample uses a [[silicone grease]]-covered rod, rotated in the air to collect the pollen.  The rod is rotated periodically during the collection period to gather samples through an entire 24-hour day.  The rod is then removed and taken to a lab where the collected material is analyzed for the type of pollen and its concentration.

Another method for measuring the pollen count is by using a Burkard Trap, also known as the seven-day volumetric spore trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latałowa|first=Małgorzata|last2=Miętus|first2=Mirosław|last3=Uruska|first3=Agnieszka|date=2002-03-01|title=Seasonal variations in the atmospheric Betula pollen count in Gdańsk (southern Baltic coast) in relation to meteorological parameters|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014905611834|journal=Aerobiologia|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=33–43|doi=10.1023/A:1014905611834|issn=0393-5965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Air Spora - Springer|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/615/bok%253A978-0-387-30253-9.pdf?originUrl=http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-30253-9 |language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30253-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This device works by facing towards the wind and drawing in air by using a pump. The pollen particles drawn in by the pump are then trapped by a sticky wax film that is attached to a rotating drum. The drum slowly rotates one turn over the course of seven days while collecting particles. The tape is removed after one week and cut into day-length sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">The '''SafeMed Project on maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships''' is a European Union (EU) funded regional project run by the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea ([[REMPEC]]) on behalf of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO). 

Currently in its second phase of operation, the '''SafeMed II Project''' (2009–2011) builds on the achievements of '''SafeMed I''' (2006–2009).

== Goals ==

The aim of the SafeMed II Project is to develop cooperation in the fields of maritime safety and security and in the protection of the marine environment between the EU and the Mediterranean partners. Its main objectives are:

* To procure a sustainable improvement in the protection of Mediterranean waters against the risks of accidents at sea and marine pollution;
* To further reduce the capacity gap between the application of international regulatory framework and the EU legislative framework in order to ensure a coherent, effective and uniform implementation of the international conventions and rules for maritime safety and security.

== Activities ==

The SafeMed II Project assists the Mediterranean partner Beneficiaries with the further implementation of the 2007 adopted Regional Transport Action Plan (RTAP) for the Mediterranean 2007-2013. The Project offers training programmes and assistance, promotes a common platform for best practices to regulate maritime traffic in the Mediterranean, and seeks to achieve improved access to information for all.

The Project funds scholarships to internationally recognized maritime universities (such as the [[World Maritime University]]), organises seminars and workshops and publishes its own quarterly newsletter, the SafeMed Beacon.

The '''''Sonnets to Orpheus''''' ({{lang-de|'''Die Sonette an Orpheus'''}})&lt;ref&gt;The full title is listed as ''Die Sonette an Orpheus: Geschrieben als ein Grab-Mal für Wera Ouckama Knoop'' (translated as ''Sonnets to Orpheus: Written as a Monument for Wera Ouckama Knoop'')&lt;/ref&gt; are a cycle of 55 [[sonnet]]s written in 1922 by the [[Bohemia]]n-[[Austrian people|Austrian]] poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926). It was first published the following year. Rilke, who is "widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense [[German language|German-language]] poets,"&lt;ref name="PoetryFdnRilkeBio"&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/rainer-maria-rilke Biography: Rainer Maria Rilke 1875–1926] on the Poetry Foundation website. Retrieved 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the cycle in a period of three weeks experiencing what he described a "savage creative storm."&lt;ref name="PolikoffImageOrpheus"&gt;Polikoff, Daniel Joseph. ''In the Image of Orpheus Rilke: a Soul History''. (Wilmette, Illinois: Chiron Publications, 2011), 585-588.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the news of the death of Wera Ouckama Knoop (1900–1919), a playmate of Rilke's daughter Ruth, he dedicated them as a memorial, or ''{{lang|de|Grab-Mal}}'' (literally "grave-marker"), to her memory.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR"&gt;Freedman, Ralph. ''Life of a Poet: Rainer Maria Rilke''. (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|481}}

At the same time in February 1922, Rilke had completed work on his deeply philosophical and mystical ten-poem collection entitled ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' which had taken ten years to complete. The ''Sonnets to Orpheus'' and the ''Duino Elegies'' are considered Rilke's masterpieces and the highest expressions of his talent.&lt;ref name="PoetryFdnRilkeBio" /&gt;

==Writing and publication history==

===Château de Muzot and the "savage creative storm"===
Through most of the 1910s, Rilke had suffered from a severe depression that had kept him from writing. He had begun his ''Duino Elegies'' in 1912, and completed parts of it in 1913 and 1915 before being rendered silent by a [[Psychological trauma|psychological crisis]] caused by the events of [[World War I]] and his brief [[Conscription|conscription into the Austro-Hungarian army]].&lt;ref&gt;Gass, William H. ''Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation''. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999), throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only in 1920 was he motivated to focus toward completing the ''Elegies.''  However, for the next two years, his mode of life was unstable and did not permit him the time or mental state he needed for his writing.

[[File:Maison rilke.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Château de Muzot in Veyras, Switzerland, was where Rilke wrote ''Sonnets to Orpheus'' and completed the ''Duino Elegies'' in "a savage creative storm" during three weeks in February 1922.]]
In 1921, Rilke journeyed to Switzerland, hoping to immerse himself among French culture near [[Geneva]] and to find a place to live permanently.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.471}}  At the time, he was romantically involved with [[Baladine Klossowska]]. At the invitation of [[Werner Reinhart]], Rilke moved into the [[Château de Muzot]], a thirteenth-century manor that lacked gas and electricity, located near [[Veyras, Switzerland|Veyras]], [[Rhone Valley]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.474}}  Reinhart, a Swiss merchant and amateur clarinetist, used his wealth to act as a patron to many 20th Century writers and composers. He purchased Muzot to allow Rilke to live there rent-free and focus on his work.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.474}}  Rilke and Klossowska moved in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in July 1921 and during the fall Rilke translated writings by [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Michelangelo]] into German.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.478}}

With news of the death of his daughter's friend, Wera Knoop, Rilke was inspired to create and set to work on ''Sonnets to Orpheus''.&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.481}} Within a few days, between 2 February and 5 February 1922, he had completed the first section of 26 sonnets. For the next few days, he focused on the ''Duino Elegies'', completing them on the evening of 11 February. Immediately after, he returned to work on the ''Sonnets'' and completed the following section of 29 sonnets in less than two weeks. In letters to friends, Rilke referred to this three-week period as a "savage creative storm."&lt;ref name="PolikoffImageOrpheus" /&gt; Rilke considered both collections to be "of the same birth."&lt;ref name="PolikoffImageOrpheus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RMRLtrtoWitoldHulewicz1925a"&gt;Rilke to Witold Hulewicz (13 November 1925) in Rilke, Rainer Maria. ''Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926'' (Leipzig: Inser-Verlag, 1937), 335-338. "The Elegies and The Sonnets support each other reciprocally, and I see it as an endless blessing that I, with the same breath, was able to fill both sails: the small, rust-colored sail of the sonnets and the great white canvas of the Elegies."&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing to his former lover, [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], on 11 February, he described this period as "...a boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit, and whatever inside me is like thread and webbing, framework, it all cracked and bent. No thought of food."&lt;ref name="FreedmanLifeofPoetRMR" /&gt;{{rp|p.492}}&lt;ref&gt;Rilke to Lou Andreas-Salomé (11 February 1922) in Rilke, Rainer Maria and Andreas-Salomé, Lou. ''Briefwechsel'' (Insel, 1952), 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the ''Sonnets'', Wera appears in frequent references to her, both direct where he addresses her by name and indirect as allusions to a "dancer" or the mythical [[Eurydice]]. Later, Rilke wrote to the young girl's mother stating that Wera's ghost was "commanding and impelling" him to write.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, Helen. ''Engendering Inspiration: Visionary Strategies in Rilke, Lawrence, and H.D.'' (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 1995), 68-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rilke to Gertrud Ouckama Knoop (20 April 1923) in Rilke, Rainer Maria. ''Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926'' (Leipzig: Insel-Verlag, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and style==

===The sonnets===
There are 55 sonnets in the sequence, divided into two sections: the first of 26 and the second of 29. The sonnets follow certain trends, but they include many different forms.

All of the sonnets are composed of two quatrains followed by two tercets.

The sonnet tradition is not as pronounced in German literature as it is, for example, in English and Italian literature. A possible model for Rilke might have been [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du Mal]]''. To fashion poems in entire cycles was quite common in contemporary practice, the works of [[Stefan George]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] being examples of this. Rilke does not at all stick to the formal standards of the German sonnet fashioned by August Wilhelm Schlegel. The rhyme schemes vary, and are generally ABAB CDCD or ABBA CDDC in the quartets, and EEF GGF, EFG EFG or EFG GFE in the triplets. The sonnets are also all metered, but their meters vary more greatly between poems; [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]ic and [[trochaic]] are the most common feet, with line length varying greatly, sometimes even within a particular sonnet. Due to the frequent use of [[enjambment]] Rilke even breaks through the verse structure. Difficulties in understanding the text arise from pronouns lacking clear reference. So begins, for example, the third sonnet of the first part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ein Gott vermags. Wie aber, sag mir, soll
ein Mann ihm folgen durch die schmale Leier?
Sein Sinn ist Zwiespalt. An der Kreuzung zweier
Herzwege steht kein Tempel für Apoll.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{col-break|width=50%}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''A God is able. But tell me, how shall''
''a man follow him through the narrow lyre?''
''His mind is divided. At the crossing of two''
''heart roads there is no temple for Apollo.'' &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{col-end}}

It is left to interpretation whether "his mind" refers to the God or the man.

===Symbolism and themes===
[[File:Rilke and Klossowska at Chateau Muzot 1923.jpg|thumb|Rilke and Klossowska at Chateau Muzot 1923]]
The content of the sonnets is, as is typical of Rilke, highly metaphorical. The work is based on the myth of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]]. The character of Orpheus (whom Rilke refers to as the "god with the [[lyre]]"&lt;ref&gt;''Sonette an Orpheus'', Erste Teil, XIX, v.8: "Gott mit der Leier"&lt;/ref&gt;) appears several times in the cycle, as do other mythical characters such as [[Daphne]]. Sources for this are primarily [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and to a lesser extent [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]''. The principle of Ovidian transformations can also be found in and especially between the sonnets. During the first sonnet of Orphic singing, the speech of the forest and the animals is "transformed" into a girl in the second sonnet: ''And almost a girl it was who emerged / from this joyful unity of song and lyre...'' During the second sonnet, the focus shifts from the girl to the world: ''She slept the world...'' The cycle also contains biblical allusions, including a reference to [[Esau]]. Other themes involve animals, peoples of different cultures, and time and death.

While Rilke invokes the original poet Orpheus, a poetic self-reflection takes place at the same time. It frequently addresses the conditions of poetry, the nature of art: ''Song is being. For the god, a simple matter. / But when are we?'' (I,3) A solution to these problems can be found in the fifth sonnet of the first part, where Rilke exclaims: ''Once and forever it's Orpheus, whenever there's song'' (I,5). This means that the poem always possesses a divine quality, as the poet stands in direct succession to the son of the [[Muses]].

Although Rilke claimed that the entire cycle was inspired by Wera, she appears as a character in only one of the poems. He insisted, however, that "Wera's own figure [...] nevertheless governs and moves the course of the whole".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Gertrud Ouckama Knoop, dated 20 April 1923; quoted in Snow, Edward, trans. and ed., ''Sonnets to Orpheus'' by Rainer Maria Rilke, bilingual edition, North Point Press, New York, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1922, after deciding he could afford the cost of considerable necessary renovation, the Swiss philanthropist [[Werner Reinhart]] bought Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free, and became Rilke's patron.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Life of a Poet: Rainer Maria Rilke|author=Freedman, R.|date=1998|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=9780810115439|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRmu9Xy9aqkC|page=505|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the ''Duino Elegies'' while Reinhart's tenant.&lt;ref name="sphericaleditions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sphericaleditions.co.uk/notes/elegy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321084930/http://www.sphericaleditions.co.uk/notes/elegy.html |archive-date=21 March 2007 |dead-url=yes |title=Spherical Editions - Catalogue - Robert Hugill - Elegy for Baritone and Orchestra |accessdate=15 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Reinhart introduced Rilke to his protégée, the Australian violinist [[Alma Moodie]].&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.cornell.edu/pages/hd11/RilkeMusicMetaph.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030429235222/http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/hd11/RilkeMusicMetaph.html |archive-date=29 April 2003 |dead-url=yes |title=R. M. Rilke – Music as Metaphor |accessdate=15 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rilke was so impressed with her playing that he wrote in a letter: "''What a sound, what richness, what determination. That and the ''Sonnets to Orpheus'', those were two strings of the same voice. And she plays mostly Bach! Muzot has received its musical christening...''"&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="picture-poems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picture-poems.com/rilke/rilke-moodie-reinhardt.html |title=Rilke at Muzot (1923) &amp;#124; Photo and description |publisher=picture-poems.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="picture-poems2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picture-poems.com/rilke/rilkebio.html |title=Rainer Maria Rilke: a brief biographical overview |publisher=picture-poems.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
From early on, there was criticism of Rilke's Sonnets. Thus, already in 1927 [[Robert Musil]] described Rilke as the poet who "did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time", but he limited this judgement to the Duino Elegies as the pinnacle of artistic creation, and described Rilke's ''Sonnets to Orpheus'' as an "exceptional falling off that Rilke's work suffers".&lt;ref&gt;Musil, Robert ed. Pike, Burton and Luft, David S. ''Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses''. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; What [[Wolfram Groddeck]] referred to in his afterword to the Reclam edition as a "dilemma of critical reading", was a result of the uncompromising text, which resists simple interpretation. At the same time the quality of lyrical expression undoubtedly constitutes a highlight of German poetic history. Thus, the criticism of the sonnets often fluctuates between the assumption of a sonic primacy over the semantic level and an unconditional affirmation of the cycle.{{according to whom|date=June 2017}}

Da stieg ein Baum. O reine Übersteigung!
O Orpheus singt! O hoher Baum im Ohr.
Und alles schwieg. Doch selbst in der verschweigung
ging neuer Anfang, Wink und Wandlung vor.

Tiere aus Stille drangen aus dem klaren
gelösten wald von Lager und Genist;
und da ergab sich, daß sie nicht aus List
und nicht aus Angst in sich so leise waren,

sondern aus Hören. Brüllen, Schrei, Geröhr
schien klein in ihren Herzen. Und wo eben
kaum eine Hütte war, dies zu empfangen,

ein Unterschlupf aus dunkelstem Verlangen
mit einem Zugang, dessen Pfosten beben, -
da schufst du ihnen Tempel im Gehör.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''O Orpheus sings! O tall tree in the ear!''

[[File:Afrotemperate indigenous woodland at Newlands Cape Town 3.jpg|thumb|Southern Afrotemperate Forest growing on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain]]
'''Southern Afrotemperate Forest''' (the Southern Cape Forests) is a kind of tall, shady, multilayered indigenous South African forest.
This is the main forest-type in the south-western part of [[South Africa]], naturally extending from the [[Cape Peninsula]] in the west, as far as [[Port Elizabeth]] in the east. In this range (apart from the massive [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Knysna-tsitsikamma forest complex]]), it usually occurs in small forest pockets, surrounded by [[Fynbos|fynbos vegetation]].

==Ecology==
This forest ecosystem is a subtype of the general [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]], which can be found across Africa as far north as Ethiopia. However, it is distinguished from other types of forests in southern Africa by its relatively distinct range of species and its being confined to the far south-western corner of Africa – separated from the other forested areas to the east and north. Southern Afrotemperate Forest tends to grow on soils derived from [[sandstone]] and [[granite]] which are the dominant rock formations in the south-western Cape.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Low &amp; A.G. Rebelo (eds). Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho &amp; Swaziland, a companion to the vegetation map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Dept Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Pretoria. 85pp. {{ISBN|0-621-17316-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Cape]] is prone to seasonal fires and the various types of fynbos vegetation that dominate here are all governed by the fire cycles. However, Southern Afrotemperate Forest is not adapted to fire, so is always restricted to "fire refugia" such as gorges, wet riverine areas, or rocky scree slopes where fires cannot reach. In the absence of veld fires, the taller forests tend to expand at the expense of the fynbos.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Rebelo, C. Boucher, N. Helme, L. Mucina, M.C. Rutherford et al. 2006. Fynbos Biome, in: L. Mucina &amp; M.C. Rutherford (eds). The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Strelitzia 19, pp 52‐219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
It is conventionally divided into three closely related subtypes:

[[File:Afrotemperate forest river valley western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|Western Cape Talus growing near [[Betty's Bay]]]]

===Western Cape Talus===
This is a type of medium-height scree forest usually only found in small patches, growing on steep, rocky slopes and by mountain streams. It is endemic to the Western Cape. &lt;br&gt;
Based on location and the species composition of the forests, this type is often informally divided into riverine forests (''oewerbos'' in [[Afrikaans]]) and scree forests (''dasbos'' in Afrikaans). The species composition of these two subtypes differs slightly, but they are still similar enough to be classed together as an ecosystem. The dominant, largest, and most obvious tree species are ''[[Metrosideros angustifolia]]'', ''[[Brabejum stellatifolium]]'', ''[[Cassine schinoides]]'', ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'', ''[[Cunonia capensis]]'', ''[[Ilex mitis]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', ''[[Olinia ventosa]]'', and ''[[Podocarpus elongatus]]''.&lt;br&gt;
Western Cape Talus forests naturally undergo periodic disturbance, flooding in the case of riverine forests, and rock-slides in the case of scree forests. Swift regeneration immediately follows. The natural cycle of disturbance of the surrounding fynbos vegetation is fire-driven, but this has little effect on the sheltered talus forests.&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P. &amp; Manning, J. 2000. ''Cape Plants: A conspectus of the Cape flora of South Africa.'' National
Botanical Institute, Pretoria &amp; Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main threats to this ecosystem are from invasive alien plants, especially [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle]] trees. The natural habitat of Western Cape Talus is usually within [[Drainage basin|catchment area]]s, and they thus perform an important function in regulating the water-systems and preventing erosion. They are also host to many scenic hiking trails and have value as a source of medicinal plants. In addition, several species (such as ''[[Clivia mirabilis]]'' and ''[[Cryptocarya angustifolia]]'') are endemic to these forests and occur nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rourke, J.P. 2002. ''Clivia mirabilis (Amaryllidaceae: Haemanthae) a new species from Northern Cape, South
Africa.'' Bothalia 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afrotemperate forest western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|Western Cape Afrotemperate forest growing at Newlands Forest in Cape Town]]

===Western Cape Afrotemperate===
The thicker, deeper, denser "South-western Cape forests" are dominated by larger afromontane trees. These tall woodlands are typically found in sheltered gorges and mountainous areas in the Western Cape. 

They also include the Cape Peninsula Forests such as those at [[Newlands Forest]], [[Kirstenbosch]], and [[Orangekloof]], which are all located around [[Table Mountain]], within the city of [[Cape Town]].

Typical species include massive trees such as [[Podocarpus latifolius|yellowwoods]], ''[[Ilex mitis]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', [[Curtisia|Assegai trees]], [[Olea capensis|ironwoods]], ''[[Cunonia capensis]]'', ''[[Cassine peragua|Cassine]]'' species, ''[[Olinia ventosa]]'', and ''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', which form the highest canopy; smaller trees such as ''[[Halleria lucida]]'', ''[[Diospyros whyteana]]'', and ''[[Maytenus acuminata]]'', which form a medium layer; as well as a variety of [[fern]]s, herbs, bushes, [[Rhoicissus|vines]], and [[liana]]s (e.g. ''[[Asparagus scandens]]'', ''[[Rhoicissus tomentosa]]''). Though not as rich in biodiversity as the Southern Cape Afrotemperate forests, these woodlands still contain a variety of endemic plants and animals which occur nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Masson, P.H. 1990. ''The dynamics of the afromontane forest remnants in the southwestern Cape.'' MSc Thesis, University of Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major threats come from invasive alien plants such as [[Pittosporum undulatum|Australian cheesewood]], [[Solanum mauritianum|bugweed]], black wattle, [[Lantana camara|lantana]], [[Ligustrum|privet]], and [[Pinus pinaster|pine]] trees. 
Western Cape Afrotemperate forests have a high socioeconomic value, due to their use for [[recreation]] such as hiking, their role in preserving the Western Cape's water supply, and their natural production of an enormous range of [[medicinal plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, B.M. &amp; Moll, E.J. 1976.

===Southern Cape Afrotemperate===
By far, the largest portion of Southern Afrotemperate Forest includes the enormous [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Knysna-Tsitsikamma forests]]. It extends from [[Mossel Bay]] in the [[Western Cape]], eastwards into the [[Eastern Cape]], nearly as far as Port Elizabeth.

This is a tall, dense, species-rich forest in a moist and warm temperate climate. The highest canopy is formed from the intermeshed crowns of the most massive trees. Understories are formed from medium-sized, multitrunked trees and the forest floor is home to a range of indigenous shrubs, bushes, ferns, and flowers. Enormous [[liana]]s and vines reach up to the canopy and between the branches and a variety of animals inhabit these woods. 
This forest is very similar to Western Cape Afrotemperate Forest with a very high species overlap; however, it also has some lesser similarities with the Amatole mistbelt forests that lie further to the east in the Drakensberg mountain range.
Previously, large game was abundant, but today it is largely exterminated. A small population of [[African Bush Elephant|elephant]]s survives at [[Knysna]].

It is often subdivided into three smaller vegetation types: the Southern Cape Mountain forest, Coastal-Platform, and Scarp forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/webapp/ResourceCentre/Documents/Scientific_And_Technical_Information/IndigenousForestsAug07.pdf|title=Indigenous Forests in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tobias Furneaux.jpg|framed|right|Tobias Furneaux]]
Captain '''Tobias Furneaux''' (21 August 1735 – 18 September 1781) was an [[England|English]] [[navigator]] and [[Royal Navy]] officer, who accompanied [[James Cook]] on his second voyage of exploration. He was  one of the first men to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the world in both directions, and later commanded a British vessel during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

== Early life ==
Furneaux was born at Swilly House near Stoke Damerel, Plymouth Dock, son of William Furneaux (1696-1748) of Swilly, and Susanna Wilcocks (1698-1775).&lt;ref name ="Hough228-229"&gt;Hough (1995), pages 228-229&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[Royal Navy]] and was employed on the [[France|French]] and [[Africa]]n coasts and in the [[West Indies]] during the latter part of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1760–1763). He served as second lieutenant of {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} under [[Samuel Wallis|Captain Samuel Wallis]] on the latter's voyage round the globe (August 1766 – May 1768) and due to Wallis being ill and confined to his cabin, Furneaux was the first to set foot on [[Tahiti]], hoisting a pennant, turning a turf, and taking possession of the land in the name of His Majesty (25 June 1767).

== Service with Cook ==
In November 1771, Furneaux was given command of {{HMS|Adventure|1771|2}}, which accompanied [[James Cook]] (in {{HMS|Resolution|1771|2}}) on his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]]. On this expedition Furneaux was twice separated from his leader (8 February 1773 to 19 May 1773; and 22 October 1773 to 14 July 1774, the date of his return to England). On the former occasion he explored a great part of the south and east coasts of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]), and made the earliest British chart of the same. Most of his names here survive; Cook, visiting the shore-line on his third voyage, confirmed Furneaux's account and delineation of it, with certain minor criticisms and emendations, and named after him the [[Furneaux Group]] at the eastern entrance to [[Bass Strait]], and the group now known as the [[Tuamotus|Low Archipelago]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography
|last= Sprod  |first= Dan |authorlink= |year=2005 |id=AS10174b |title= Furneaux, Tobias (1735 - 1781)  |accessdate=5 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Adventure'' was finally separated from ''Resolution'' off [[New Zealand]] in October 1773, Furneaux returned home alone, bringing with him [[Omai]] of Ulaietea (Raiatea).  This first South Sea Islander to travel to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] returned to Tahiti with Cook on 12 August 1777.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=385, 419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later commands ==
Furneaux was made a navigator in 1775.  During the American Revolutionary War, he commanded HMS ''Syren'' in the British attack of 28 June 1776 upon [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. ''Syren'', with Furneaux in command, was wrecked near [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]] on 6 November 1777.&lt;ref name=RW&gt;Winfield (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some sources have 10 November,&lt;ref name="Marx1987"&gt;Marx (1987), page 152&lt;/ref&gt; but the court martial records and other official documents show 6 November.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;|group="Note"}}  The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) has published a detailed history of the ''Syren'''s activities in the [[American Revolution]], as well as some of the original documents related to her loss, confirming 6 November as the correct date.  By 10 November Furneaux and his crew were prisoners in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], awaiting later exchange.  RIMAP has also noted that the ''Syren'' is one of at least five ships associated with Captain Cook and his circumnavigating men with an historical connection to the State of Rhode Island.

Furneaux died unmarried in 1781 and was buried in [[Stoke Damerel]] church where he had been christened.

The '''Utilities Intermediaries Association (UIA)''' is a trade body for UK Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs) in the business energy sector. Although it is a limited company, it runs as a not-for-profit organisation. TPIs are also known as energy brokers or consultants ([[Energy switching services in the UK]]), which facilitate the purchasing of electricity and gas between their clients and energy suppliers. They work on behalf of businesses, providing  procurement services in exchange for commissions from the energy suppliers. This had led some TPIs to compromise their neutrality so they can earn the most commission through bias toward the suppliers that pay the most.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1055570/Fuel-giants-rig-market-business-paying-secret-commission-independent-brokers.html Fuel giants rig market for business by paying secret commission to independent brokers] Daily Mail, 30 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The UIA exists to work with the various organisations involved in the uk energy industry, with the aim of improving consumer confidence when undergoing a purchasing program for their energy.&lt;ref name="uia"&gt;[http://uia.org.uk/ The Utilities Intermediaries Association homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all TPIs and takes a minimum of 3 months to complete, providing they meet the standards of operation set by the association itself.

==Caveat==
Whilst the assessment process is rigorous, the UIA mark is not necessarily a 100% guarantee that a member's charges will remain totally transparent and unbiased. To do this would require a rigorous and  ongoing assessment process in which members' websites are continually monitored and customers contacted on a random basis to ensure their energy broker is complying with the UIA Code of Practice. In the absence of any complaint by the public, the degree in which members' websites are actively monitoring for compliance to UIA Code of Practice is uncertain. Prior to engaging an energy broker it is important to request that the energy broker confirm they are independent, unbiased and exactly what their charges are.

==Membership Costs==
Membership fees for the UIA are currently not transparent and currently unpublished on the UIA website. Some smaller brokers find the cost of joining the UIA onerous and although smaller brokers may have transparent client fees and operate fairly independently, some choose not to join the UIA due to prohibitively expensive membership fees.

==Mission statement==
From the UIA website:
:"The Utilities Intermediaries Association (UIA) will enhance the reputation of this sector of the industry and give confidence to those who seek to use their service. It will do this by producing and maintaining a register of Consultants and Brokers who meet and continue to meet the Associations requirements and agree and operate to the [http://uia.org.uk/code_of_practice.htm Code of Practice]. It will maintain the processes whereby users of their services who become dissatisfied, can seek redress."

==The Boatmark and Code of Practice==
All members of the UIA agree to adhere to a strict code of practice regarding the way in which they operate. Being a member allows the TPI to display the UIA 'boatmark' on their website or other communications, to give confidence to their clients and customers that they will follow the Code of Practice.

==Full Members==
There are currently 30 full members as listed on the UIA's website.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;[http://uia.org.uk/accreditation.php UIA Fully Accredited Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Activity==
The UIA along with the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) and the Forum of Private Business condemned the decision of [[Ofgem]] not to outlaw rollover energy contracts, which would tie business users into another contract if they did not terminate their current contract within a specified period.&lt;ref name="term"&gt;[http://www.utilityweek.co.uk/news/uk/electricity/small-businesses-call-on-ofgem.php Small businesses call on Ofgem to outlaw rollover contracts] Utility Week, 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 2010, Ofgem introduced new rules to protect smaller businesses, known as micro-businesses. The rule, known as [[Condition 7A]], protects these businesses in 3 ways:
* A statement of renewal terms must be issued approximately 60 calendar days before the end of any contract.
* A notification window of 30 days must be given to contact the supplier when companies wish to switch supplier or negotiate a new contract.
* Contracts can only be rolled over for a maximum period of 12 months.&lt;ref name="3ways"&gt;[http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/Compet/Documents1/Guidance%20on%20application%20and%20interpretation%20of%20certain%20aspects%20of%20SLC%207A.pdf Ofgem Condition 7A]&lt;/ref&gt;

|access-date=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''valve''' (British usage) or, colloquially, a '''tube''' (North America),&lt;ref&gt;John Algeo, "Types of English heteronyms", p. 23 in, Edgar Werner Schneider (ed), ''Englishes Around the World: General studies, British Isles, North America'', John Benjamins Publishing, 1997 {{ISBN|9027248761}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a device that controls [[electric current]] flow in a high [[vacuum]] between [[electrode]]s to which an electric [[voltage|potential difference]] has been applied.

The type known as a '''thermionic tube''' or '''thermionic valve''' uses the phenomenon of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons from a heated [[hot cathode|cathode]] and is used for a number of fundamental electronic functions such as signal [[amplifier|amplification]] and current [[rectifier|rectification]].
 
Non-thermionic types, such as a vacuum [[phototube]] however, achieve electron emission through the [[photoelectric effect]], and are used for such as the detection of light levels. In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the [[anode]] by the [[electric field]] in the tube.

The simplest vacuum tube, the [[diode]] invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Current can only flow in one direction through the device from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more [[control grid]]s within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoddeson|first=L|title=The Vacuum Tube|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415063342/http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century. They were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, [[sound recording and reproduction]], long distance [[telephone]] networks, and analogue and early digital [[computers]]. Although some applications had used earlier technologies such as the [[spark gap transmitter]] for radio or [[mechanical computer]]s for computing, it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical, and created the discipline of [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macksey |first1=Kenneth |last2=Woodhouse |first2=William |year=1991 |chapter=Electronics |title=The Penguin encyclopedia of modern warfare: 1850 to the present day |publisher=Viking |page=110 |isbn=978-0-670-82698-8 |quote=The electronics age may be said to have been ushered in with the invention of the vacuum diode valve in 1902 by the Briton John Fleming (himself coining the word 'electronics'), the immediate application being in the field of radio.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the invention of [[semiconductor]] devices made it possible to produce [[Solid state electronics|solid-state]] devices, which are smaller, more efficient, reliable and durable, and cheaper than thermionic tubes. From the mid-1960s, thermionic tubes were then being replaced by the [[transistor]]. However, the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) remained the basis for [[television]] monitors and [[oscilloscopes]] until the early 21st century. Thermionic tubes still have some applications, such as the [[magnetron]] used in microwave ovens, and certain high-frequency amplifiers.

Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes. [[Gas-filled tube]]s are similar devices, but containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to [[electric discharge in gases]], usually without a heater.

==Classifications==
One classification of thermionic vacuum tubes is by the number of active electrodes. A device with two active elements  is a [[diode]], usually used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Devices with three elements are [[triode]]s used for amplification and switching. Additional electrodes create [[tetrode]]s, [[pentode]]s, and so forth, which have multiple additional functions made possible by the additional controllable electrodes.

Other classifications are:
* by frequency range ([[audio frequency|audio]], radio, [[VHF]], [[UHF]], [[microwave]])
* by power rating (small-signal, audio power, high-power radio transmitting)
* by [[Hot cathode|cathode]]/[[electrical filament|filament]] type (indirectly heated, directly heated) and [[Antique radio#Warm-up time|Warm-up time]] (including "bright-emitter" or "dull-emitter")
* by characteristic curves design (e.g., sharp- versus remote-[[Cut-off (electronics)#Valves|cutoff]] in some pentodes)
* by application (receiving tubes, transmitting tubes, amplifying or switching, rectification, mixing)
* specialized parameters (long life, very low [[Microphonics|microphonic sensitivity]] and low-noise audio amplification, rugged/military versions)
* specialized functions (light or radiation detectors, video imaging tubes)
* tubes used to display [[information]] ([[Nixie tube]]s, [[Magic eye tube|"magic eye" tubes]], [[Vacuum fluorescent displays]], [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]])

Tubes have different functions, such as [[cathode ray tube]]s which create a beam of electrons for display purposes (such as the television picture tube) in addition to more specialized functions such as [[electron microscopy]] and [[electron beam lithography]]. [[X-ray tube]]s are also vacuum tubes. [[Phototube]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from [[photon]]s rather than [[thermionic emission]]. Since these sorts of "vacuum tubes" have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described in their own articles.

A vacuum tube consists of two or more [[electrode]]s in a vacuum inside an airtight envelope. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a [[glass-to-metal seal]] based on [[kovar]] sealable [[borosilicate glass]]es, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a [[tube socket]]. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a [[top cap]]. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morgan |last=Jones |title=Valve Amplifiers |page=580 |publisher=Elsevier |date=2012 |isbn=0080966403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George Henry |last=Olsen |title=Electronics: A General Introduction for the Non-Specialist |page=391 |publisher=Springer |date=2013 |isbn=1489965351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bases were commonly made with [[phenolic insulation]] which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=D.

There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.

The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from [[incandescent light bulb]]s, containing a [[electrical filament|filament]] [[glass-to-metal seal|sealed]] in an evacuated  glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]], originally known as the "Edison Effect". A second electrode, the [[anode]] or ''plate'', will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (''[[cathode]]'') has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a [[diode]], and is used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or ''[[rectifier]]'') will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore be used in a DC [[power supply]], as a [[demodulator]] of [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.

Early tubes used the filament as the cathode; this is called a "directly heated" tube. Most modern tubes are "indirectly heated" by a "heater" element inside a metal tube that is the cathode. The heater is electrically isolated from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit (which can be AC without inducing hum) while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages.  [[H. J. Round]] invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Bray |title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet |publisher=IET |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203055405/https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;hl=en |archivedate=3 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |isbn=9780852962183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filaments require constant and often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur even in an idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by [[black-body radiation|radiation]] through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.

[[Klystron]]s and [[cavity magnetron|magnetrons]] often operate their anodes (called '''collectors''' in klystrons) at ground potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.

Except for diodes, additional electrodes are positioned between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes are referred to as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass on their way to the plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a [[triode]], [[tetrode]], [[pentode]], etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a ''voltage-controlled device'': the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the [[junction field-effect transistor]] (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.

==History and development==
[[Image:Edison effect bulb 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|One of Edison's experimental bulbs]]
The 19th century saw increasing research with evacuated tubes, such as the [[Geissler tube|Geissler]] and [[Crookes tube]]s. The many scientists and inventors who experimented with such tubes include [[Thomas Edison]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]]. With the exception of early [[light bulb]]s, such tubes were only used in scientific research or as novelties. The groundwork laid by these scientists and inventors, however, was critical to the development of subsequent vacuum tube technology.

Although [[thermionic emission]] was originally reported in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick |last=Guthrie |authorlink=Frederick Guthrie |title=Magnetism and Electricity |date=1876 |location=London and Glasgow |publisher=William Collins, Sons, &amp; Company |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UuoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517001705/https://books.google.com/books?id=UuoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Thomas Edison's apparently independent discovery of the phenomenon in 1883 that became well known. Although Edison was aware of the unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest (and patent&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Edison {{US patent|307031}} "Electrical Indicator", Issue date: 1884&lt;/ref&gt;) concentrated on the sensitivity of the anode current to the current through the filament (and thus filament temperature). Little practical use was ever made of this property (however early radios often implemented volume controls through varying the filament current of amplifying tubes). It was only years later that [[John Ambrose Fleming]] utilized the rectifying property of the diode tube to detect ([[demodulate]]) radio signals, a substantial improvement on the early [[cat's-whisker detector]] already used for rectification.

However actual amplification by a vacuum tube only became practical with [[Lee De Forest]]'s 1907 invention of the three-terminal "[[audion]]" tube, a crude form of what was to become the [[triode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

The electronics revolution of the 20th century arguably began with the invention of the triode vacuum tube.

===Diodes===
[[Image:Fleming valves.jpg|thumb|Fleming's first diodes]]
{{main|Diode}}
The English physicist [[John Ambrose Fleming]] worked as an engineering consultant for firms including [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Edison Swan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazda Valves|url=http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628205923/http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archivedate=2013-06-28|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edison Telephone and the [[Marconi Company]]. In 1904, as a result of experiments conducted on Edison effect bulbs imported from the United States, he developed a device he called an "oscillation valve" (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, was capable of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons that would flow to the ''[[Plate electrode|plate]]'' (or ''[[anode]]'') when it was at a positive voltage with respect to the heated cathode. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons.

Later known as the [[Fleming valve]], it could be used as a [[rectifier]] of alternating current and as a radio wave [[Detector (radio)|detector]]. This greatly improved the [[crystal set]] which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called [[cat's whisker]], an adjustable point contact. Unlike modern semiconductors, such a diode required painstaking adjustment of the contact to the crystal in order for it to rectify.

The tube was relatively immune to vibration, and thus vastly superior on shipboard duty, particularly for navy ships with the shock of weapon fire commonly knocking the sensitive but delicate galena off its sensitive point (the tube was in general no more sensitive as a radio detector, but was adjustment free). The diode tube was a reliable alternative for detecting radio signals.

As electronic engineering advanced, notably during World War II, this function of a diode came to be considered as one type of demodulation. While firmly established by history, the term "detector" is not of itself descriptive, and should be considered outdated.

Higher power diode tubes or ''power rectifiers'' found their way into power supply applications until they were eventually replaced first by selenium, and later, by silicon rectifiers in the 1960s.

===Triodes===
{{main|Triode}}
[[Image:Triode tube 1906.jpg|thumb|The first triode, the De Forest [[Audion]], invented in 1906]]

[[File:Triode.PNG|thumb|upright|Triode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
Originally, the only use for tubes in radio circuits was for [[Rectifier|rectification]], not amplification. In 1906, [[Robert von Lieben]] filed for a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robert von Lieben&amp;nbsp;— Patent Nr&amp;nbsp;179807 Dated November 19, 1906 | publisher = Kaiserliches Patentamt | date = 19 November 1906 | url = http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/DRP179807.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528125703/http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/DRP179807.pdf | archivedate = 28 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[cathode ray tube]] which included magnetic deflection. This could be used for amplifying audio signals and was intended for use in telephony equipment. He would later help refine the [[triode]] vacuum tube.

However, [[Lee De Forest]] is credited with inventing the triode tube in 1907 while experimenting to improve his original (diode) [[Audion]]. By placing an additional electrode between the filament ([[cathode]]) and [[plate electrode|plate]] (anode), he discovered the ability of the resulting device to amplify signals. As the voltage applied to the [[control grid]] (or simply "grid") was lowered from the cathode's voltage to somewhat more negative voltages, the amount of current from the filament to the plate would be reduced.

The negative electrostatic field created by the grid in the vicinity of the cathode would inhibit passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volt difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and power [[amplifier|amplification]]. In 1908, De Forest was granted a patent ({{US patent|879532}}) for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode.

[[Image:General electric pliotron pp schenectady 3.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric Company Pliotron, [[Science History Institute]]]]
De Forest's original device was made with conventional vacuum technology. The vacuum was not a "hard vacuum" but rather left a very small amount of residual gas. The physics behind the device's operation was also not settled. The residual gas would cause a blue glow (visible ionization) when the plate voltage was high (above about 60 volts). In 1912, De Forest brought the Audion to Harold Arnold in AT&amp;T's engineering department. Arnold recommended that AT&amp;T purchase the patent, and AT&amp;T followed his recommendation. Arnold developed high-vacuum tubes which were tested in the summer of 1913 on AT&amp;T's long distance network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/15tel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005081147/http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/15tel.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-vacuum tubes could operate at high plate voltages without a blue glow.

Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] significantly improved on the original triode design in 1914, while working on his [[sound-on-film]] process in Berlin, Germany. Tigerstedt's innovation was to make the electrodes concentric cylinders with the cathode at the centre, thus greatly increasing the collection of emitted electrons at the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antti V. |last=Räisänen |first2=Arto |last2=Lehto |title=Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications |page=7 |publisher=Artech House |date=2003 |isbn=1580536697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irving Langmuir]] at the [[General Electric]] research laboratory ([[Schenectady, New York]]) had improved [[Wolfgang Gaede]]'s [[diffusion pump|high-vacuum diffusion pump]] and used it to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/GEresearchLab.html|title=General Electric Research Lab History|last=Center|first=Copyright 2015 Edison Tech|website=edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT&amp;T successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.

Pliotrons were closely followed by the French type '[[La Compagnie des Lampes#La Compagnie des Lampes (1888)|TM]]' and later the English type 'R' which were in widespread use by the allied military by 1916. Historically, vacuum levels in production vacuum tubes typically ranged from 10 [[Pascal (pressure)|µPa]] down to 10&amp;nbsp;nPa.&lt;ref&gt;J.Jenkins and W.H.Jarvis, "Basic Principles of Electronics, Volume 1 Thermionics", Pergamon Press (1966), Ch.1.10 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The triode and its derivatives (tetrodes and pentodes) are [[transconductance]] devices, in which the controlling signal applied to the grid is a ''voltage'', and the resulting amplified signal appearing at the anode is a ''current''. Compare this to the behavior of the [[bipolar junction transistor]], in which the controlling signal is a current and the output is also a current.

For vacuum tubes, transconductance or mutual conductance ({{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is defined as the change in the plate(anode)/cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid to cathode voltage, with a constant plate(anode) to cathode voltage. Typical values of {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} for a small-signal vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens. It is one of the three 'constants' of a vacuum tube, the other two being its gain μ and plate resistance {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The Van der Bijl equation defines their relationship as follows: &lt;math&gt;gm = {\mu \over R_p}&lt;/math&gt;

The non-linear operating characteristic of the triode caused early tube audio amplifiers to exhibit harmonic distortion at low volumes. Plotting plate current as a function of applied grid voltage, it was seen that there was a range of grid voltages for which the transfer characteristics were approximately linear.

To use this range, a negative bias voltage had to be applied to the grid to position the [[direct current|DC]] operating point in the linear region. This was called the idle condition, and the plate current at this point the "idle current". The controlling voltage was superimposed onto the bias voltage, resulting in a linear variation of plate current in response to both positive and negative variation of the input voltage around that point.

This concept is called ''[[grid bias]]''. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the "C battery" (unrelated to the present-day [[C battery|C cell]], for which the letter denotes its size and shape). The C battery's positive terminal was connected to the cathode of the tubes (or "ground" in most circuits) and whose negative terminal supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes.

Later circuits, after tubes were made with heaters isolated from their cathodes, used [[cathode bias]]ing, avoiding the need for a separate negative power supply. For cathode biasing, a relatively low-value resistor is connected between the cathode and ground. This makes the cathode positive with respect to the grid, which is at ground potential for DC.

However C batteries continued to be included in some equipment even when the "A" and "B" batteries had been replaced by power from the AC mains. That was possible because there was essentially no current draw on these batteries; they could thus last for many years (often longer than all the tubes) without requiring replacement.

When triodes were first used in radio transmitters and receivers, it was found that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited. This was due to the parasitic capacitance between the plate (the amplifier's output) and the control grid (the amplifier's input), known as the  [[Miller effect|Miller capacitance]].

Eventually the technique of ''neutralization'' was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate (anode) would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed and led to the success of the [[Neutrodyne]] radio during the 1920s.
However, neutralization required careful adjustment and proved unsatisfactory when used over a wide range of frequencies.

===Tetrodes and pentodes===
{{main|Tetrode|Pentode}}
[[File:Tetrode.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Tetrode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), screen grid, control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
To combat the stability problems and limited voltage gain due to the [[Miller effect]], the physicist [[Walter H. Schottky]] invented the tetrode tube in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: the conquest of analog communications|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M.|volume=6|issue=2|pages=52–54|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2193274|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the addition of a second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the ''[[screen grid]]'', could solve these problems. ("Screen" in this case refers to electrical "screening" or shielding, not physical construction: all "grid" electrodes in between the cathode and plate are "screens" of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the [[control grid]], essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a ''[[tetrode]]'', meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.

[[File:Tetrode.png|thumb|right| At certain values of plate voltage and current, the tetrode characteristic curves are kinked due to secondary emission.]]
However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, electrons strike the anode with sufficient energy to cause the emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called [[secondary emission]] of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called "tetrode kink" and is an example of [[negative resistance]] which can itself cause instability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjseymour.plus.com/elec/valves/valves.htm Introduction to Thermionic Valves (Vacuum Tubes)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528141924/http://www.cjseymour.plus.com/elec/valves/valves.htm |date=28 May 2007 }}, Colin J. Seymour&lt;/ref&gt; The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce a simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant [[LC circuit]] to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called [[dynatron oscillator]] thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the [[tunnel diode]] oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.

The solution was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the [[suppressor grid]] (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid was held at the cathode (or "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a [[pentode]], meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by [[Bernard D. H. Tellegen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/tube-uk.html |title=Philips Historical Products: Philips Vacuum Tubes |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106031350/http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/tube-uk.html |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the [[beam tetrode]] or "beam power tube", discussed below.

===Multifunction and multisection tubes===
[[File:Heptode.svg|thumb|right|160px|The pentagrid converter contained five grids between the cathode and the plate (anode).]]
[[Superheterodyne receiver]]s require a [[local oscillator]] and [[Frequency mixer|mixer]], combined in the function of a single [[pentagrid converter]] tube. Various alternatives such as using a combination of a [[triode]] with a [[Pentagrid converter#Hexode|hexode]] and even an [[Pentagrid converter#Octode|octode]] have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both [[control grid]]s (at a low potential) and [[Tetrode|screen grids]] (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers, including the miniature tube version of the "[[All American Five]]". Octodes, such as the 7A8, were rarely used in the United States, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.

To further reduce the cost and complexity of radio equipment, two separate structures (triode and pentode for instance) could be combined in the bulb of a single ''multisection tube''. An early example was the [[Loewe 3NF]]. This 1920s device had three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, it was able to substantially undercut the competition, since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the United States, Cleartron briefly produced the "Multivalve" triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also had a single tube socket, but because it used a four-pin base, the additional element connections were made on a "mezzanine" platform at the top of the tube base.

By 1940 multisection tubes had become commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other licensing considerations (see [[British Valve Association]]). Constraints due to the number of external pins (leads) often forced the functions to share some of those external connections such as their cathode connections (in addition to the heater connection). The RCA Type 55 was a [[double diode triode]] used as a detector, [[automatic gain control]] rectifier and audio [[preamplifier]] in early AC powered radios. These sets often included the 53 Dual Triode Audio Output. Another early type of multi-section tube, the [[6SN7]], is a "dual triode" which performs the functions of two triode tubes, while taking up half as much space and costing less.
The [[12AX7]] is a dual "high mu" (high voltage gain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Bonnie |title=Analog circuits |date=2008 |page=391 |publisher=Newnes |isbn=0-7506-8627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://välljud.se/index.php/tilbehoer/ram-labs/mu-gm-and-rp-and-how-tubes-are-matched |title=Mu, Gm and Rp and how Tubes are matched |last=Modjeski |first=Roger A. |publisher=Välljud AB |accessdate=22 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321012946/http://xn--vlljud-bua.se/index.php/tilbehoer/ram-labs/mu-gm-and-rp-and-how-tubes-are-matched |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |authorlink=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers: The New Audio Cyclopedia |publisher=Howard W.

The introduction of the miniature tube base (see below) which could have 9 pins, more than previously available, allowed other multi-section tubes to be introduced, such as the [[6GH8]]/ECF82 triode-pentode, quite popular in television receivers. The desire to include even more functions in one envelope resulted in the General Electric [[Compactron]] which had 12 pins. A typical example, the 6AG11, contained two triodes and two diodes.

Some otherwise conventional tubes do not fall into standard categories; the 6AR8, 6JH8 and 6ME8 had several common grids, followed by a pair of [[Beam deflection tube|beam deflection]] electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes. It was sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tube, and was used in some color TV sets for [[Chrominance|color]] [[Analog television#Color video signal extraction|demodulation]]. The similar 7360 was popular as a balanced [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] [[Product detector|(de)modulator]].

===Beam power tubes===
[[File:6L6tubespair.jpg|thumb|150px|6L6 tubes in glass envelopes]]{{main|Beam tetrode}}
The [[beam tetrode|beam]] power tube is usually a tetrode with the addition of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not to be confused with the ''[[anode]]'') focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates "sheets" of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.

Aligning the grid wires also helps to reduce screen current, which represents wasted energy. This design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high-power, high-efficiency power tubes. EMI engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda developed the design which became the [[6L6]], the first popular beam power tube, introduced by [[RCA]] in 1936 and later corresponding tubes in Europe the [[KT66]], [[KT77]] and [[KT88]] made by the [[Marconi-Osram Valve]] subsidiary of [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] (the KT standing for "Kinkless Tetrode").

"Pentode operation" of beam power tubes is often described in  manufacturers' handbooks and data sheets, resulting in some confusion in terminology.
They are not pentodes, of course.

Variations of the 6L6 design are still widely used in tube guitar amplifiers, making it one of the longest-lived electronic device families in history. Similar design strategies are used in the construction of large ceramic power tetrodes used in radio transmitters.

Beam power tubes can be connected as triodes for improved audio tonal quality but in triode mode deliver significantly reduced power output.

===Gas-filled tubes===
[[Gas-filled tube]]s such as [[discharge tube]]s and [[cold cathode]] tubes are not ''hard'' vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas at less than sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the [[voltage-regulator tube]] and [[thyratron]] resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still be referred to as "electron tubes" as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high-vacuum tubes.[[File:CV4501.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Subminiature CV4501 tube (SQ version of EF72), {{nowrap|35 mm long}} x {{nowrap|10 mm diameter}} (excluding leads)]]

=== Miniature tubes ===
Early tubes used a metal or glass envelope atop an insulating [[bakelite]] base. In 1938 a technique was developed to use an all-glass construction&lt;ref&gt;C H Gardner (1965) [http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-001.htm The Story of the Valve] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223164546/http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-001.htm |date=23 December 2015 }}, Radio Constructor (See particularly the section "Glass Base Construction")&lt;/ref&gt; with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This was used in the design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power [[rectifier]]s, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.[[File:6DS4NuvistorVacuumTube.jpg|thumb|right|150px|RCA 6DS4 "Nuvistor" triode, circa {{nowrap|20 mm high}} by {{nowrap|11 mm diameter}}]]Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The "[[acorn tube]]" (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA [[nuvistor]] from 1959, about the size of a [[thimble]]. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in aircraft radio transceivers, [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners, and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.

===Improvements in construction and performance===
[[File:Vacuum Tube Commercial Packages.png|thumb|Commercial packaging for vacuum tubes used in the latter half of the 20th century including boxes for individual tubes (bottom right), sleeves for rows of the boxes (left), and bags that smaller tubes would be put in by a store upon purchase (top right)]]
The earliest vacuum tubes strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and were made by lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the [[vacuum pump]]s required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used [[Heinrich Geissler]]'s mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial [[vacuum]]. The development of the [[diffusion pump]] in 1915 and improvement by [[Irving Langmuir]] led to the development of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200&amp;nbsp;°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament [[operating temperature]] to a dull red heat (around 700&amp;nbsp;°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.

===Indirectly heated cathodes===
The desire to power electronic equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty with respect to the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a [[power transformer]] introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) hum into audio stages. The invention of the "equipotential cathode" reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded center tap.

A superior solution, and one which allowed each cathode to "float" at a different voltage, was that of the indirectly heated cathode: a  cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner (ed.) ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 {{ISBN|0-408-00168-2}} pages 7–2 through 7-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.

Tubes designed for high gain audio applications may have twisted heater wires to cancel out stray electric fields, fields that could induce objectionable hum into the program material.

Heaters may be energized with either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). DC is often used where low hum is required.

Flowers was also a pioneer of using tubes as very fast (compared to electromechanical devices) [[Switch#Electronic switches|electronic switches]]. Later work confirmed that tube unreliability was not as serious an issue as generally believed; the 1946 [[ENIAC]], with over 17,000 tubes, had a tube failure (which took 15 minutes to locate) on average every two days. The quality of the tubes was a factor, and the diversion of skilled people during the Second World War lowered the general quality of tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,108568,00.html|title=A lost interview with ENIAC co-inventor J.

After the war, development continued with tube-based computers including, military computers [[ENIAC]] and [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] (the first commercially available electronic computer), and [[UNIVAC I]], also available commercially.

====Colossus====
{{Main|Colossus computer}}
Flowers's Colossus and its successor Colossus Mk2 were built by the British during World War II to substantially speed up the task of breaking the German high level [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz encryption]]. Using about 1,500 vacuum tubes (2,400 for Mk2), Colossus replaced an earlier machine based on relay and switch logic (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]). Colossus was able to break in a matter of hours messages that had previously taken several weeks; it was also much more reliable.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt; Colossus was the first use of vacuum tubes ''working in concert'' on such a large scale for a single machine.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt;

Once Colossus was built and installed, it ran continuously, powered by dual redundant diesel generators, the wartime mains supply being considered too unreliable. The only time it was switched off was for conversion to Mk2, which added more tubes. Another nine Colossus Mk2s were built. Each Mk2 consumed 15 kilowatts; most of the power was for the tube heaters.

A Colossus reconstruction was switched on in 1996; it was upgraded to Mk2 configuration in 2004; it found the key for a wartime German [[ciphertext]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|[http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/colossus-rebuild/rebuilding-colossus The National Museum of Computing – Rebuilding Colossus]|[http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/colossus-gallery The National Museum of Computing – The Colossus Gallery]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whirlwind and "special-quality" tubes====
{{Main|Whirlwind (computer)}}
To meet the reliability requirements of the 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, "special-quality" tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of [[silicon]], used in the [[tungsten]] alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the [[wire]] drawing [[Die (manufacturing)#Wire pulling|dies]]) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, and the other in standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service. These computers continued in service years after other tube computers had been superseded.

High-purity nickel tubing and cathode coatings free of materials that can poison emission (such as [[silicate]]s and aluminum) also contribute to long cathode life. The first such "computer tube" was Sylvania's 7AK7 of 1948. Computers were the first tube devices to run tubes at cutoff (enough negative grid voltage to make them cease conduction) for quite-extended periods of time. When their grids became less negative, they failed to conduct. While hot but non-conductive, an insulating layer ("cathode interface") developed between the nickel sleeve and the oxide coating. What was described above cured this problem.

By the late 1950s it was routine for special-quality small-signal tubes to last for hundreds of thousands of hours, if operated conservatively. This increased reliability also made mid-cable amplifiers in [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable]]s possible.

==Heat generation and cooling ==
[[File:HiPowerTube3-500 C.jpg|thumb|right| The anode (plate) of this transmitting triode has been designed to dissipate up to {{nowrap|500 W}} of heat]]
A considerable amount of heat is  produced when tubes operate, both from the filament (heater) but also from the stream of electrons bombarding the plate. In power amplifiers this source of heat will exceed the power due to cathode heating.
A few types of tube permit operation with the anodes at a dull red heat; in other types, red heat indicates severe overload.

The requirements for heat removal can significantly change the appearance of high-power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still.

Heat escapes the device by [[black body radiation]] from the anode (plate) as infrared radiation, and by convection of air over the tube envelope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;RCA "Transmitting Tubes  Manual" TT-5 1962, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Convection]] is not possible inside most tubes since the anode is surrounded by vacuum.

{{anchor|Battery valve}}Tubes which generate relatively little heat, such as the 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery-powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. Gas-filled tubes such as [[thyratron]]s may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.

The anode is often treated to make its surface emit more infrared energy. High-power amplifier tubes are designed with external anodes which can be cooled by convection, forced air or circulating water. The water-cooled 80&amp;nbsp;kg, 1.25&amp;nbsp;MW [[8974]] is among the largest commercial tubes available today.

In a water-cooled tube, the anode voltage appears directly on the cooling water surface, thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator to prevent  high voltage leakage through the cooling water to the radiator system. Water as usually supplied has ions which conduct electricity; [[deionized water]], a good insulator, is required. Such systems usually have a built-in water-conductance monitor which will shut down the high-tension supply if the conductance  becomes too high.

The screen grid may also generate considerable heat. Limits to screen grid dissipation, in addition to plate dissipation, are listed for power devices. If these are exceeded then tube failure is likely.

==Tube packages==
[[File:6Z4 var.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Metal-cased tubes with octal bases]]
[[File:GS-9B.JPG|thumb|right|300px|High power GS-9B triode transmitting tube with heat sink at bottom.]]
Most modern tubes have glass envelopes, but metal, fused quartz ([[silica]]) and [[ceramic]] have also been used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. The [[nuvistor]] was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.

The internal elements of tubes have always been connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections at the base of the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray [[capacitance]] between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.

High-power tubes such as transmitting tubes have packages designed more to enhance heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope is also the anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the [[Eimac]] {{as written|4CM2500KG}}, a forced water-cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpii.com/docs/datasheets/78/4CM2500KG%20June%202011.pdf|title=MULTI-PHASE COOLED POWER TETRODE 4CM2500KG|quote=The maximum anode dissipation rating is 2500 kilowatts.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011144807/http://www.cpii.com/docs/datasheets/78/4CM2500KG%20June%202011.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.

==Names==
The generic name "[thermionic] valve" used in the UK derives from the unidirectional current flow allowed by the earliest device, the thermionic diode emitting electrons from a heated filament, by analogy with a non-return [[valve]] in a water pipe.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science, J. L. Heilbron , Oxford University Press 2003, 9780195112290, "valve, thermionic"&lt;/ref&gt; The US names "vacuum tube", "electron tube", and "thermionic tube" all simply describe a tubular envelope which has been evacuated ("vacuum"), has a heater, and controls electron flow.

In many cases manufacturers and the military gave tubes designations which said nothing about their purpose (e.g., 1614). In the early days some manufacturers used proprietary names which might convey some information, but only about their products; the KT66 and KT88 were "'''K'''inkless '''T'''etrodes". Later, consumer tubes were given names which conveyed some information, with the same name often used generically by several manufacturers. In the US, [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] (RETMA) [[RETMA tube designation|designations]] comprise a number, followed by one or two letters, and a number. The first number is the (rounded) heater voltage; the letters designate a particular tube but say nothing about its structure; and the final number is the total number of electrodes (without distinguishing between, say, a tube with many electrodes, or two sets of electrodes in a single envelope—a double triode, for example). For example, the [[12AX7]] is a double triode (two sets of three electrodes plus heater) with a 12.6V heater (which, as it happens, can also be connected to run from 6.3V). The "AX" has no meaning other than to designate this particular tube according to its characteristics. Similar, but not identical, tubes are the 12AD7, 12AE7...12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AW7 (rare!), 12AY7, and the 12AZ7.

A system widely used in Europe known as the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]], also extended to transistors, uses a letter, followed by one or more further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.

==Special-purpose tubes==
[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Voltage-regulator tube in operation. Low pressure gas within tube glows due to current flow.]]
Some special-purpose tubes are constructed with particular gases in the envelope. For instance, [[voltage-regulator tube]]s contain various [[inert gas]]es such as [[argon]], [[helium]] or [[neon]], which will [[Ionization|ionize]] at predictable voltages. The [[thyratron]] is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube "latches" into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state.

Some thyratrons can carry large currents for their physical size. One example is the miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s [[jukebox]]es as control switches for [[relay]]s. A cold-cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an [[ignitron]]; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn-on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s, also called [[thyristor]]s due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.

A specialized tube is the [[krytron]], which is used for rapid high-voltage switching. Krytrons are used to initiate the detonations used to set off a [[nuclear weapon]]; krytrons are heavily controlled at an international level.

[[X-ray tube]]s are used in medical imaging among other uses. X-ray tubes used for continuous-duty operation in fluoroscopy and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil-filled aluminium housing to provide cooling.

The [[photomultiplier]] tube is an extremely sensitive detector of light, which uses the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[secondary emission]], rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and [[liquid scintillation counting|liquid scintillation counters]] use photomultiplier tube arrays to detect low-intensity [[Scintillation counter|scintillation]] due to [[ionizing radiation]].

==Powering the tube==

===Batteries===

{{main|Battery (vacuum tube)}}

[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] provided the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets. Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries designated as the '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''' battery. The [[A battery|"A" battery]] or LT (low-tension) battery provided the filament voltage. Tube heaters were designed for single, double or triple-cell [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid]] batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In portable radios, dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V heaters. Reducing filament consumption improved the life span of batteries. By 1955 towards the end of the tube era, tubes using only 50 mA down to as little as 10 mA for the heaters had been developed.&lt;ref name=Okamura94&gt;{{cite book|first=Sōgo|last=Okamura|title=History of electron tubes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-145-1|pages=133–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622234430/http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PA133|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high voltage applied to the anode (plate) was provided by the [[B battery|"B" battery]] or the HT (high-tension) supply or battery. These were generally of [[dry cell]] construction and typically came in 22.5-, 45-, 67.5-, 90-, 120- or 135-volt versions.

[[File:C Battery circuit of a Triode vacuum tube.png|thumb|right| Batteries for a vacuum tube circuit. The C battery is highlighted.]]
Early sets used a grid bias battery or [[GB Battery|"C" battery]] which was connected to provide a ''negative'' voltage. Since virtually no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using [[cathode bias]]ing, eliminating the need for a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.

The "C battery" for bias is a designation having no relation to the "[[C battery|C cell]]" [[List of battery sizes|battery size]].

===AC power===
{{Redirect|Cheater cord|the three-prong to two-prong mains plug adapter|Cheater plug}}
Battery replacement was a major operating cost for early radio receiver users. The development of the [[battery eliminator]], and, in 1925, [[Batteryless radio|batteryless receivers]] operated by [[Mains electricity|household power]], reduced operating costs and contributed to the growing popularity of radio. A [[power supply]] using a [[transformer]] with several windings, one or more [[rectifier]]s (which may themselves be vacuum tubes), and large filter [[electrolytic capacitor|capacitor]]s  provided the required [[direct current]] voltages from the alternating current source.

As a cost reduction measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current and with a similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called [[AC/DC receiver design]]. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname [[All American Five]].

Where the mains voltage was in the 100-120V range, this limited voltage proved suitable only for low-power receivers. Television receivers either required a transformer or could use a [[voltage doubler|voltage doubling]] circuit. Where 230 V nominal mains voltage was used, television receivers as well could dispense with a power transformer.

Transformer-less power supplies required safety precautions in their design to limit the shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A ''cheater cord'' was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.

To avoid the warm-up delay, "instant on" television receivers passed a small heating current through their tubes even when the set was nominally off. At switch on, full heating current was provided and the set would play almost immediately.

==Reliability==
[[File:Acremeter tube tester.jpg|thumb|upright|Tube tester manufactured in 1930]]
One reliability problem of tubes with oxide cathodes is the possibility that the cathode may slowly become "[[cathode poisoning|poisoned]]" by gas molecules from other elements in the tube, which reduce its ability to emit electrons. Trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate (anode) current runaway due to [[ionization]] of free gas molecules. [[Vacuum]] hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime. Depending on the material, temperature and construction, the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements. The resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break in a manner similar to [[incandescent lamp]] filaments, but rarely do, since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps.

The heater's failure mode is typically a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or at a weld point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a [[thermistor]], may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage equal to that of the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.

Following World War II, tubes intended to be used in series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.

Another important reliability problem is caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually [[oxygen]] in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as [[Cunife]] and [[Fernico]]) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These made it easy to construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.

When a vacuum tube is overloaded or operated past its design dissipation, its anode (plate) may glow red. In consumer equipment, a [[glowing plate]] is universally a sign of an overloaded tube. However, some large transmitting tubes are designed to operate with their anodes at red, orange, or in rare cases, white heat.

"Special quality" versions of standard tubes were often made, designed for improved performance in some respect, such as a longer life cathode, low noise construction, mechanical ruggedness via ruggedized filaments, low microphony, for applications where the tube will spend much of its time cut off, etc. The only way to know the particular features of a special quality part is by reading the data sheet. Names may reflect the standard name (12AU7==&gt;12AU7A, its equivalent ECC82==&gt;E82CC, etc.), or be absolutely anything (standard and special-quality equivalents of the same tube include 12AU7, ECC82, B329, CV491, E2163, E812CC, M8136, CV4003, 6067, VX7058, 5814A and 12AU7A).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/addtext/add070.htm National Valve Museum: audio double triodes ECC81, 2, and 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107063504/http://r-type.org/addtext/add070.htm |date=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest recorded valve life was earned by a Mazda AC/P pentode valve (serial No. 4418) in operation at the [[BBC]]'s main Northern Ireland transmitter at Lisnagarvey. The valve was in service from 1935 until 1961 and had a recorded life of 232,592 hours. The BBC maintained meticulous records of their valves' lives with periodic returns to their central valve stores.&lt;ref&gt;Certified by BBC central valve stores, Motspur Park&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazda Data Booklet 1968 Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacuum===
[[File:Getter diagram.png|thumb|right|350px|Getter in opened tube; silvery deposit from getter]]
[[File:Opachki dead vacuum luminescent display bednyaga da.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Dead vacuum fluorescent display (air has leaked in and the getter spot has become white)]]
A vacuum tube needs an extremely good ("hard") vacuum to avoid the consequences of generating positive ions within the tube. With a small amount of residual gas, some of those atoms may [[Ionization|ionize]] when struck by an electron and create fields that adversely affect the tube characteristics. Larger amounts of residual gas can create a self-sustaining visible [[glow discharge]] between the tube elements.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} To avoid these effects, the residual pressure within the tube must be low enough that the [[mean free path]] of an electron is much longer than the size of the tube (so an electron is unlikely to strike a residual atom and very few ionized atoms will be present). Commercial vacuum tubes are evacuated at manufacture to about {{convert|0.000001|mmHg|Torr uPa mbar atm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Meissner (ed.), ''Vacuum Technology Transactions: Proceedings of the Sixth National Symposium'', Elsevier, 2016,{{ISBN|1483223558}} page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent gases from compromising the tube's vacuum, modern tubes are constructed with "[[getter]]s", which are usually small, circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly, [[barium]] being the most common. While the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[induction heating]] to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited on the inside of the glass envelope, leaving a silver-colored metallic patch which continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak in the envelope, this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric [[oxygen]]. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as [[zirconium]]. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus-based getters, and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short-lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters. Unlike the barium getters, the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired.

Getters act by chemically combining with residual or infiltrating gases, but are unable to counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as [[cathode ray tube]]s and camera tubes such as [[iconoscope]]s, [[orthicon]]s, and [[image orthicons]], comes from helium infiltration.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, so there is no long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.

===Transmitting tubes===

Large transmitting tubes have carbonized [[tungsten]] filaments containing a small trace (1% to 2%)  of [[thorium]]. An extremely thin (molecular) layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms [[diffusion|diffuse]] to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of [[tungsten carbide]] and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.
[[WAAY-TV]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] achieved 163,000 hours (18.6 years) of service from an [[Eimac]] external cavity klystron in the visual circuit of its transmitter; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=31 Alumni|title=The Klystron &amp; Cactus|url=http://31alumni.com/klystron-cactus.htm|accessdate=29 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820054802/http://31alumni.com/klystron-cactus.htm|archivedate=20 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been said{{who|date=November 2010}} that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid-state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid-state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid-state power amplifiers up to approximately 15&amp;nbsp;kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.

===Receiving tubes===
Cathodes in small "receiving" tubes are coated with a mixture of [[barium oxide]] and [[strontium oxide]], sometimes with addition of [[calcium oxide]] or [[aluminium oxide]]. An electric heater is inserted into the cathode sleeve, and insulated from it electrically by a coating of aluminium oxide. This complex construction causes barium and strontium atoms to diffuse to the surface of the cathode and emit electrons when heated to about 780 degrees Celsius.

===Failure modes===

====Catastrophic failures====
A catastrophic failure is one which suddenly makes the vacuum tube unusable. A crack in the glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.

Tube heaters may also fail without warning, especially if exposed to over voltage or as a result of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like [[incandescent light bulb|lamp]] filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of [[inrush current]] when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC [[thermistor]] included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] between tube elements can destroy the tube. An arc can be caused by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Robert B. |last=Tomer |title=Getting the most out of vacuum tubes |publisher=Howard W. Sams |location=Indianapolis, IN, USA |date=1960 |lccn=60-13843}}. available on the Internet Archive. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Tube rectifiers have limited current capability and exceeding ratings will eventually destroy a tube.

====Degenerative failures====
Degenerative failures are those caused by the slow deterioration of performance over time.

Overheating of internal parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, can result in trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A [[getter]] is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level of internal gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly reactive metal) is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.

Gas and ions within the tube contribute to grid current which can disturb operation of a vacuum tube circuit. Another effect of overheating is the slow deposit of metallic vapors on internal spacers, resulting in inter-element leakage.

Tubes on standby for long periods, with heater voltage applied, may develop high cathode interface resistance and display poor emission characteristics. This effect occurred especially in pulse and [[digital circuit]]s, where tubes had no plate current flowing for extended times. Tubes designed specifically for this mode of operation were made.

Cathode depletion is the loss of emission after thousands of hours of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television [[cathode-ray tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 2}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.

====Other failures====
Vacuum tubes may develop defects in operation that make an individual tube unsuitable in a given device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. ''[[Microphonics]]'' refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from the ends of the heater may also inject [[Mains hum|hum]] into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 3}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for other purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.

Tube pins can develop non-conducting or high resistance surface films due to heat or dirt. Pins can be cleaned to restore conductance.

==Testing==
[[File:VacuumTubeTester TV-7D 4.jpg|thumb|Universal vacuum tube tester]]
{{main|Tube tester}}
Vacuum tubes can be tested outside of their circuitry using a vacuum tube tester.

==Other vacuum tube devices==
Most small signal vacuum tube devices have been superseded by semiconductors, but some vacuum tube electronic devices are still in common use. The magnetron is the type of tube used in all [[microwave oven]]s. In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the vacuum tube still has reliability and cost advantages for high-frequency RF power generation.

Some tubes, such as [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling-wave tube]]s, [[carcinotron]]s, and [[klystron]]s, combine magnetic and electrostatic effects. These are efficient (usually narrow-band) RF generators and still find use in [[radar]], [[microwave oven]]s and industrial heating. Traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) are very good amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites. High-powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the UHF range.

===Cathode ray tubes===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Cathode ray tube}}
The [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) is a vacuum tube used particularly for display purposes. Although there are still many televisions and computer monitors using cathode ray tubes, they are rapidly being replaced by [[flat panel display]]s whose quality has greatly improved even as their prices drop. This is also true of digital [[oscilloscope]]s (based on internal computers and [[analog to digital converter]]s), although  traditional analog scopes (dependent upon CRTs) continue to be produced, are economical, and preferred by many technicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} At one time many radios used "[[magic eye tube]]s", a specialized sort of CRT used in place of a [[Galvanometer|meter movement]] to indicate signal strength, or input level in a tape recorder. A modern indicator device, the [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) is also a sort of cathode ray tube.

The [[X-ray tube]] is a type of cathode ray tube that generates X-rays when high voltage electrons hit the anode.

[[Gyrotron]]s or vacuum masers, used to generate high-power millimeter band waves, are magnetic vacuum tubes in which a small [[relativity (physics)|relativistic]] effect, due to the high voltage, is used for bunching the electrons. Gyrotrons can generate very high powers (hundreds of kilowatts).
[[Free-electron laser]]s, used to generate high-power coherent light and even [[X-ray]]s, are highly relativistic vacuum tubes driven by high-energy particle accelerators. Thus, these are sorts of cathode ray tubes.

===Electron multipliers===
A [[photomultiplier]] is a [[phototube]] whose sensitivity is greatly increased through the use of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of [[secondary emission]], whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a [[dynode]] causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of [[ionizing radiation]] as an alternative to the [[Geiger–Müller tube]] (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.

For decades, electron-tube designers tried to augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers in order to increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes "poisoned" the tube's hot cathode. (For instance, the interesting RCA 1630 secondary-emission tube was marketed, but did not last.) However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime, and was used in at least one product, a laboratory pulse generator. By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous.

One variant called a "channel electron multiplier" does not use individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The [[microchannel plate]] consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an [[image intensifier]] in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.

Tektronix made a high-performance wideband oscilloscope CRT with a channel electron multiplier plate behind the phosphor layer. This plate was a bundled array of a huge number of short individual c.e.m. tubes that accepted a low-current beam and intensified it to provide a display of practical brightness. (The electron optics of the wideband electron gun could not provide enough current to directly excite the phosphor.)

==Vacuum tubes in the 21st century==

===Niche applications===
Although vacuum tubes have been largely replaced by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices in most amplifying, switching, and rectifying applications, there are certain exceptions. In addition to the special functions noted above, tubes {{As of|2011|alt=still}} have some niche applications.

In general, vacuum tubes are much less susceptible than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the [[electromagnetic pulse]] effect of [[nuclear explosion]]s,&lt;ref name=chaos&gt;Broad, William J. "Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor", Science. 29 May 1981 212: 1009–1012&lt;/ref&gt; or [[geomagnetic storm]]s produced by giant solar flares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1549/2 Y Butt, The Space Review, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422222217/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1549/2 |date=22 April 2012 }} "... geomagnetic storms, on occasion, can induce more powerful pulses than the E3 pulse from even megaton type nuclear weapons."&lt;/ref&gt; This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the [[MiG-25]].&lt;ref name=chaos/&gt; In that aircraft, output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can burn through a channel under interference.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Vacuum tubes are still{{when|date=May 2018}} practical alternatives to solid-state devices in generating high power at [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] in applications such as [[Dielectric heating|industrial radio frequency heating]], [[particle accelerator]]s, and [[Valve transmitters|broadcast transmitters]]. This is particularly true at microwave frequencies where such devices as the [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] provide amplification at power levels unattainable using {{As of|2011|alt=current}} semiconductor devices. The household [[microwave oven]] uses a [[magnetron]] tube to efficiently generate hundreds of watts of microwave power.

In military applications, a high-power vacuum tube can generate a 10–100&amp;nbsp;megawatt signal that can burn out an unprotected receiver's frontend. Such devices are considered non-nuclear electromagnetic weapons; they were introduced in the late 1990s by both the U.S. and Russia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Enough people prefer [[tube sound]] to make tube amplifiers commercially viable in three areas: musical instrument (e.g., guitar) amplifiers, devices used in recording studios, and [[audiophile]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The cool sound of tubes – vacuum tube musical applications|last=Barbour|first=E.|journal=Spectrum, IEEE|volume=35|number=8|pages=24–35|date=1998|publisher=IEEE|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/the-cool-sound-of-tubes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104040533/http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/the-cool-sound-of-tubes|archivedate=4 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many guitarists prefer using [[valve amplifier]]s to solid-state models, often due to the way they tend to distort when overdriven. Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to distort the signal. Different circuits will distort the signal in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes. Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.

===Vacuum fluorescent display===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
{{Main|Vacuum fluorescent display}}
[[File:Vacuum fluorescent 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical VFD used in a [[videocassette recorder]]]]
A modern display technology using a variation of cathode ray tube is often used in [[videocassette recorder]]s, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels,  and automotive dashboards. Rather than [[raster scanning]], these [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses [[phosphor]]-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit a broad spectrum of greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from [[fluorescent light]]ing, which uses a [[discharge tube]].)
