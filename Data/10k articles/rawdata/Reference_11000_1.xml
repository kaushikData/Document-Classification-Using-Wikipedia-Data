The '''''AFA catalog'''''  is a specialised [[Danish language|Danish]] postage [[stamp catalog]] for the country of [[Denmark]] and historically related areas such as the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Danish West Indies]]. It was first published in 1935 by Harry Poulsen, a stamptrader from the town of [[Aarhus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afa.dk/info.html |title=Kontakt |publisher=''[[Nordfrim]]'' |language=Danish |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the publisher was Lars Boes, until the year 2000 when Erling Daugaard, the owner of the philatelic company [[Nordfrim]], took over the publishing of the catalog.

It allows the hosting of multiple applications of different [[Design Assurance Level|software levels]] on the same hardware in the context of an [[Integrated Modular Avionics]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is part of [[ARINC#600 Series|ARINC 600-Series]] Standards for Digital Aircraft &amp; Flight Simulators.

==Overview==
In order to decouple the real-time operating system [[Computing platform|platform]] from the application software, ARINC 653 defines an [[Application programming interface|API]] called APplication EXecutive (APEX).

Each application software is called a '''partition''' and has its own memory space. It also has a dedicated time slot allocated by the APEX API. Within each [[Memory management (operating systems)#Partitioned allocation|partition]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] is allowed. The APEX API provides services to manage partitions, processes and timing, as well as partition/process communication and error handling. The partitioning environment can be implemented by using a hypervisor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VanderLeest|first=S. H.|date=2010-10-01|title=ARINC 653 hypervisor|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5655298/|journal=29th Digital Avionics Systems Conference|pages=5.E.2–1–5.E.2–20|doi=10.1109/DASC.2010.5655298}}&lt;/ref&gt; to map partitions to virtual machines, but this is not required.

The current work of the AEEC APEX Subcommittee includes the enhancement of ARINC 653 for [[multicore]] processor architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Basic principles of partitioning ==

=== ARINC 653 Platform ===
An ARINC 653 [[Computing platform|platform]] contains:
* A hardware platform allowing [[real-time computing]] deterministic services.
* An [[abstraction layer]] managing the timer and space partitioning constraints of the platform ([[Random-access memory|memory]], [[Central processing unit|CPU]], [[Input/output]]).
* An implementation for the ARINC 653 services (the APEX API).
* An interface to be able to configure the platform and its domain of use.
* Various instrumentation tools.

=== Initialization ===
Initialization of an ARINC 653 partition creates resources used by the partition. Resources creation (PROCESS, EVENT, SEMAPHORE...) is performed by calling API services named '''CREATE_xxxx'''.

=== Error handling ===
The process error handler is a [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] [[Process (computing)|process]] of the highest priority dedicated to handle partition exceptions. It is created by the service '''CREATE_ERROR_HANDLER''' during partition initialization.

The API allows the error handler to stop a faulty process ('''STOP_SELF'''). In that case, the RTOS [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] will elicit the next process with the highest priority.

ARINC 653 does not specify how the scheduler should behave if the error handler does not stop a faulty process. In some (theoretical) cases, this could lead to an infinite loop between the faulty process and the error handler.

The error handler can obtain information about the source and the context of the exception.

=== Mode management ===
Each partition can be in several activation modes:
* COLD_START and WARM_START: Only the initialization process is executed,
* NORMAL: The initialization process is stopped, and the other partition processes are called by the RTOS [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] depending on their priority,
* IDLE: No process is executed. However an implementation could still in theory execute a hidden process of the lowest priority, for example to start an infinite loop.

The '''SET_PARTITION_MODE''' service allows to manage these states. It can be called by any process in the partition. Entering the IDLE state is irreversible for the partition. Only an external event (such as a platform restart) can change the state to another mode when the partition is in this state.

=== The processes of a partition ===
Each partition has at least one [[Process (computing)|process]].

Process scheduling is [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]]. The scheduler is called either by a timer or by API services.

==API services==
The ARINC 653 APEX services are [[Application programming interface|API]] [[Subroutine|calls]] belonging in six categories:
* Partition management
* Process management
* Time management
* Inter-partition communication
* Intra-partition communication
* Error handling

No ARINC 653 services are provided for the [[memory management]] of partitions. Each partition has to handle its own memory (still under the constraints of memory partitioning enforced by ARINC 653).

Each service returns a RETURN_CODE value which indicates if the call has been successful:
* NO_ERROR: the service performed nominally after a valid request
* NO_ACTION: the state of the system has not changed after executing the service
* NOT_AVAILABLE: the service is temporarily unavailable
* INVALID_PARAM: at least one of the service's parameters is invalid
* INVALID_CONFIG: at least one of the service's parameters is incompatible with the current configuration of the system
* INVALID_MODE: the service is incompatible with the current mode of the system
* TIMED_OUT: the [[Timeout (telecommunication)|delay]] for the execution of the service has expired

==Links to POSIX and ASAAC==
The field covered by ARINC 653 is similar to [[Allied Standards Avionics Architecture Council|ASAAC]] ''Def Stan 00-74''. However, there are differences between the two standards.&lt;ref name="york"&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~mark/papers/ISSC2006.pdf
| title=Flexibility and Manageability of IMS Projects
| publisher=[[University of York]]
| accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ARINC 653 (APEX) calls have a [[POSIX]] equivalent, but are different from how they are defined in POSIX.&lt;ref name="york" /&gt;

For example, the following call defined in ASAAC: 
  receiveBuffer
would be translated in ARINC 653 by:
  RECEIVE_BUFFER()
and also in POSIX by:
  recv()

'''Alberto Mena Caamaño Museum''' ({{lang-es|Museo Alberto Mena Caamaño}}) is a museum in [[Quito]], Ecuador. A cultural institution of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, it is located in the historic center of the city, next to the [[Palacio de Carondelet]]. ''The Rough Guide to Ecuador'' considers it to be the "old town's most rewarding museum".&lt;ref name="AdesGraham2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ades|first1=Harry|last2=Graham|first2=Melissa|title=The Rough Guide to Ecuador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnrziSXEqCQC&amp;pg=PT184|date=4 January 2010|publisher=Rough Guides Limited|isbn=978-1-4053-8006-5|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created by ordinance on May 28, 1957, following a donation from the aristocratic philanthropist [[Alberto Mena Caamaño]]. The donation included more than 600 objects including paintings, sculptures, archaeological pieces, weapons and miscellaneous items. After a restoration of the former Royal Barracks building,  the museum opened to the public on November 3, 1959. In 1970 a permanent exhibition hall was added on a theme of the slaughter which occurred on August 2, 1810, when 200 citizens were killed in the barracks and the surrounding streets of Quito by royalist troops.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrocultural-quito.com/portal/index.php/museo-alberto-mena-caamano |title=Museo Alberto Mena Caamaño |publisher=Centrocultural-quito.com |accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is depicted by wax figures of the artist [[Francisco Barbieri]]. In 1987 the museum had to close its doors due to minor damage to the building structure, as a result of the [[1987 Ecuador earthquakes|earthquakes]] that rocked Quito that year. Finally, on November 27, 2002 it reopened following extensive restoration.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The '''Alicanto''' or '''Allicanto''' is a mythological [[bird]] of the desert of [[Atacama]], pertaining to [[Chilean mythology]]. 

==Legend==
[[Legend]] says that the alicanto's wings shine at night with beautiful, metallic colors, and their eyes emit strange lights. 

Alicantos bring luck to any [[miner]] who sees them because they live in small caves containing [[mineral]]s and feed on [[gold]] and [[silver]].

If the lucky miner follows an alicanto without being caught, they can find silver or gold. But, if the alicanto discovers them, the bird will guide the greedy miner off a cliff and cause them to fall to their death.

Alicanto should not be confused with the [[Alicante (mythology)|Alicante]], a fictional Mexican snake that drinks mother's milk, impregnates women, and lives in human stomachs.

==Background==
Rutherford was purchasing a bulldozer, and was interested in purchasing the 20-year-old International truck that the seller used to haul it. Eventually, he agreed to purchase the truck for $1,700 provided it first passed a new COF, and he subsequently arranged for the [[Ministry of Transport (New Zealand)|Ministry of Transport]] Te Awamutu branch to inspect the vehicle.

On the first inspection, the MOT only found several minor faults, and when the vehicle was brought back for a second inspection, it was duly issued with a certificate of fitness and a certificate of inspection.

Within 2 weeks after purchasing the vehicle, Rutherford discovered the truck had a serious fault, which the two inspections had failed to notice, and after removing the current COF certificate, took it to the Hamilton branch for inspection, where not only did they refused to issue a new COF, but were so concerned with the state of the vehicle, Rutherford had great difficulty in getting the vehicle back to drive home for the repairs.

Rutherford sued the MOT, as well as the vendor in the District Court for the $1,083.83 in repairs the truck needed, but was unsuccessful in both claims, as the judge said Rutherford could have inspected the truck himself and discovered the fault.

He appealed to the High Court.

==Held==
The High Court ruled in favour of Rutherford, as even though the MOT were unlikely to know that the purpose of the inspection was for the purchase of the truck, it was at least a possibility. In overruling the District Court judge's rationale that Rutherford could have mitigated the loss by inspecting the vehicle himself, Cooke J said that Rutherford could have relied on the inspection certificate here due to it having been recently issued at the time of purchase.

The '''''Azerbaijani Soviet Encyclopedia''''' (in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Azərbaycan Sovet Ensiklopediyası, [[Cyrillic]]: Азәрбајҹан Совет Енсиклопедијасы) is a 10 volume universal [[encyclopedia]] published in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] from 1976 to 1987 by the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[editor-in-chief]]s were [[Rasul Rza]] and [[:az:Cəmil Quliyev (akademik)|Jemil Kuliyev]]. The special volume dedicated to Azerbaijan was scheduled to be published after the main 10 volumes, but due to rising political problems and difficult economic situation it has not been published.

'''''Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide''''' by [[Pamela C. Rasmussen]] and John C. Anderton is a two-volume [[ornithological handbook]], covering the birds of [[South Asia]], published in 2005 (second edition in 2012) by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[Lynx Edicions]]. The geographical scope of the book covers [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Maldives]], the [[Chagos archipelago]] and [[Afghanistan]] (the latter country had been excluded from previous works covering this region). In total, 1508 species are covered (this figure includes 85 [[hypothetical list of biota|hypothetical]] and 67 'possible' species, which are given only shorter accounts). Two notable aspects of ''Birds of South Asia'' are its distribution evidence-base &amp;mdash; the book's authors based their distributional information almost completely on [[Zoological specimen|museum specimen]]s &amp;mdash; and its taxonomic approach, involving a large number of species-level splits.

==The books==

[[File:PcRasmussen.jpg|thumb|left|Pamela Rasmussen]]
Volume 1 is a [[field guide]]. A nine-page introduction is followed by 180 colour plates, each with an accompanying text page giving brief identification notes, and, for most species, range maps. In addition to the 69 plates by Anderton, eleven other artists contributed, including [[Ian Lewington]] and [[Bill Zetterström]]. Volume 2: Attributes and Status contains more detailed supporting texts for every species. Twelve other authors are listed as having contributed to this volume, including [[Per Alström]], [[Nigel Collar]] and [[Craig Robson]]. This volume opens with an appreciation, written by [[Bruce Beehler]], of [[S. Dillon Ripley]], who initiated the work which led to the book, and after whom it is named. This is followed by a 24-page introduction. The bulk of the book, from pages 41 to 601, consists of individual species accounts; each of these includes sections on identification, occurrence, habits and voice (this latter section accompanied by [[spectrogram|sonogram]]s for many species). There are ten appendices, including a [[hypothetical list of biota|hypothetical list]], a list of rejected species, a summary of taxonomic changes, a glossary, a gazetteer, and a list of institutions holding major collections of South Asian bird specimens.

The book's covers are illustrated by montages of South Asian birds, painted by Anderton. Volume 1 features [[crimson-backed flameback]], [[stork-billed kingfisher]], [[Indian eagle-owl]], [[black-and-orange flycatcher]] and [[Himalayan quail]] on its front cover. Volume 2 features six [[laughingthrush]] species: [[Variegated laughingthrush|variegated]], [[Bhutan laughingthrush|Bhutan]], [[Grey-sided laughingthrush|grey-sided]], [[Blue-winged laughingthrush|blue-winged]], [[Black-chinned laughingthrush|black-chinned]] and [[Assam laughingthrush|Assam]]. The back covers of both volumes feature a painting of [[Serendib scops-owl|Serendib]] and [[Nicobar scops-owl]]s.

==Taxonomic changes==
In preparing the book, the authors undertook a major revision of the taxonomic status of bird forms found in the region; many [[allopatry|allopatric]] forms previously regarded as [[conspecific]] are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Many of these had previously been proposed elsewhere, but the book introduced a number of innovations of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Collar &amp; Pilgrim (2008) includes an analysis of Rasmussen &amp; Anderton's proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which are novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these changes, and the overwhelming majority of the novel ones, are among the [[passerine]]s. The following is a list of the groups of taxa which are considered conspecific in the sixth edition of the ''[[Clements Checklist]]'' (Clements 2007),&lt;ref&gt;At the time of Birds of South Asia's publication, ''[[Clements Checklist|Clements]]'' was the most widely used world bird checklist; the sixth edition was published shortly after Birds of South Asia, and hence is used here as the best work to view the effect of Rasmussen &amp; Anderton's proposals; when compared with earlier regional lists, such as the ''[[Oriental Bird Club checklist]]'' (Inskipp ''et''. ''al''. 1996), the effects are greater still.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen &amp; Anderton do not split two pairs of taxa which are treated as separate species in ''[[Clements Checklist|Clements']]'' sixth edition, [[MacQueen's bustard|MacQueen's]] and [[houbara bustard]]s  (vol 2, pp. 148-9), and [[Carrion crow|carrion]] and [[hooded crow]]s (vol 2, p. 599).&lt;/ref&gt;  but split into two or more species in Rasmussen and Anderton's work (volume 2 page references in brackets).

===Non-passerines===

[[File:Changeable Hawk Eagle 3.jpg|thumb|right|Crested hawk-eagle]]
* (p.&amp;nbsp;53) [[Oriental darter]] (''Anhinga melanogaster'') is treated as a [[monotypic]] Asian species, separate from [[African darter|African]] (''A. rufa'') and [[Australasian darter|Australasian]] (''A. novaehollandiae'') darters.&lt;ref&gt;This treatment had been followed in the first edition of ''[[Peters' checklist]]'' (Peters 1931) but not by most other 20th-century authors.&lt;/ref&gt;
* (p.&amp;nbsp;58) [[Cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis'') is split into two species: [[western cattle egret]] (''B. ibis sensu stricto'') and [[eastern cattle egret]] (''B. coromandus'')&lt;ref&gt;McAllan &amp; Bruce (1988) had previously adopted this treatment, but the two taxa had been regarded as conspecific by almost all other recent authors.&lt;/ref&gt;
* (p.&amp;nbsp;60) [[Black-backed bittern]] (''Ixobrychus dubius'') is split from [[little bittern]] (''I. minutus'')&lt;ref&gt;The fifth edition of ''[[Clements' checklist]]'' (Clements 2000) treated these two taxa as distinct species, but they were lumped in the sixth edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, they suggested that within the ''simillimus'' group, the [[Sri Lanka]]n race ''kinnisii'' is also probably better treated as a separate species. The ''simillimus'' group had previously been treated as a full species in Henry (1971). However this treatment had not gained widespread acceptance: both ''[[Birds of the Western Palearctic]]'' (Cramp 1988) and the ''[[Oriental Bird Club checklist]]'' (Inskipp ''et''. ''al''. 1996) had retained these forms within common blackbird. Clement &amp; Hathway (2000) had suggested that ''mandarinus'' and ''maximus'' probably deserved to be treated together as a separate species; again the OBC checklist had treated these as conspecific with common blackbird.&lt;/ref&gt; common blackbird (''T. merula'') ''sensu stricto'', [[Tibetan blackbird]] (''T. maximus''), [[Indian blackbird]] (''T. simillimus'') and [[Chinese blackbird]] (''T.

The '''Boat Carved from an Olive Stone''' ({{zh|c=雕橄欖核舟}}) is a [[fruit pit carving]] of a boat made out of an olive pit. It is part of the collection of the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt;

==Description==
The boat is a [[fruit pit carving|miniature carving]] of an olive pit, measuring only {{convert|1.4|by|3.4|cm|in}} and is only {{convert|1.6|cm|in}} tall.&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt; Inside the boat, there are a total of eight figures, with the [[Song Dynasty]] poet [[Su Shi|Su Tung-po]] sitting beside the window at the table. The sculpture features incredibly detailed carvings of windows on the side, with the center two panels movable. On top of the boat is a rolled up sail in rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.teldap.tw/culture/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=165|title=Boat Carved from an Olive Stone|website=Digital Taiwan - Culture &amp; Nature|archive-url=http://culture.teldap.tw/culture/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=165|archive-date=1 July 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of [[Su Shi|Su Tung-po]]'s ''Latter Ode on the Red Cliff'' of more than 300 [[Chinese characters|characters]] is engraved in details on the bottom of the boat, demonstrating the expert craftsmanship of the artist.&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt; The poem depicts the poet enjoying a boat ride with his friends on a full moon night at the site of [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]. The artist, Chen, recreated a miniature moment, with the boat being a symbol of seclusion holding men safely on top of life and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs/~pajin/text/chinart/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623052213/http://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs/~pajin/text/chinart/index.htm|archive-date=23 June 2016|dead-url=no|title=Introduction to the Chinese Art and Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The boat was carved in the second year of [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s reign ({{start date|1737}}) by the sculptor Chen Zuzhang. Chen, originally from [[Guangdong|Canton]], had entered the Imperial Bureau of Manufacture during the reign of [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. In {{start date|1737}}, The artist carved the boat out of a pit of an olive, taking advantage of its shape. Following the fall of the Qing Empire in the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution of 1911]], the sculpture became part of the collection of the [[Palace Museum]] in the Forbidden City.  Along with a core of that collection, the piece survived the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] ([[World War II]]) and the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was eventually relocated to Taiwan's National Palace Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3680">The '''Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition of 1882''' was one of the most important scientific events of the 19th-century [[Brazil]], conducted by the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum of Rio de Janeiro]] and heavily influenced by [[Darwinism]].

==History==

In the second half of the 19th century - particularly since the 1870s - the popularization of evolutionary theories on the rise in [[Europe]], led to large increase of scientific institutions in [[Latin America]], and made the museum the preferential sites of exposure of these theories .
Such theories have been adapted and took specific format in Brazil in order to legitimize some speculation about the position as they would be blacks and mestizos in the evolutionary chain suggested by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].

It was in this context that, in 1882, the National Museum, directed by [[Ladislau Netto]], as a generator of research and academic issues, promoted the Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition. To bring the collection to be shown in the exhibition, Netto sent requests to all provinces molds [[Botocudo]] arrived from [[Goias]] and [[Espírito Santo]] came ethnological objects of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Mato Grosso]], lithic and ceramic pieces were sent by the Museum of Paraná, and private collections. The books were borrowed from the National Library.

According to the Show Guide, the collections were organized in eight halls, especially redecorated for the occasion, receiving the names of naturalists and missionaries of the past, such as [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]], [[Jean de Lery]], [[Gabriel Soares de Sousa]], [[José de Anchieta]], [[Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira]], and contemporary scientists, such as [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|Martius]], [[Charles Frederick Hartt|Hartt]] and [[Peter Wilhelm Lund|Lund]]. In each of these sections were displayed various archaeological objects to a greater or lesser number. The room Lund was the one that got fossilized human remains, while the Hartt contained most of the ceramic fragments and Lery the remains of middens.

For reporting on the event to the general public, the exhibition was attended by journalists of the leading journals of the city, including the famous (and feared) cartoonist, [[Angelo Agostini]], and photographer [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]]. As special attraction, were brought a small group of Indians Botocudos, from Espírito Santo, and three other Indians [[Xerente]] of [[Minas Gerais]].

Prestigious by the presence of the emperor himself, [[Pedro II of Brazil|D. Pedro II]] and his daughter, [[Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], the Exhibition was inaugurated on July 29, 1882, extending over three months. He had an audience of over a thousand visitors, a real success in the country, with international repercussions.

The '''Combined Online Information System''' ('''COINS''') is a database containing [[HM Treasury]]'s detailed analysis of departmental spending under thousands of category headings.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2009/09/how_big_is_the_coins_database.html How big is the COINS database?], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The database contains around 24 million lines of data.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;  The database has codes for more than 1,700 public bodies in the United Kingdom including central government departments, local authorities, NHS trusts and public corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/list_of_public_bodies_in_the_coi#incoming-69457 Response to Freedom of Information request] made through [[mySociety|WhatDoTheyKnow.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;  COINS is used by the Office for National Statistics for statistical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;It is also used by the ONS for statistical purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Treasury describes the database as "a web based multi-dimensional database used by HM Treasury to collect financial information".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_reporting_centralgovernment.htm# |title=HM-treasury.gov.uk |access-date=2010-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423205822/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_reporting_centralgovernment.htm# |archive-date=2010-04-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data from the COINS database is used to prepare the National Accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080619/text/80619w0001.htm# |title=The-stationery-office.co.uk |access-date=2010-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094903/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080619/text/80619w0001.htm# |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and technical details==
The Combined Online Information System or COINS database is one of the biggest datasets in government.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;  COINS uses a database called Camelot.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/03/coins-treasury-government-data Guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is supplied by [[Descisys]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

==History==

COINS replaced three separate systems previously used by the British Government, Public Expenditure System (PES), Government Online Data System (GOLD) and General Expenditure Monitoring System (GEMS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/28590/response/78133/attach/html/3/COINS%20TRAINING%20Booklet%2009%2001%2020091redacted.pdf.html COINS Training and basic report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosure==

The Treasury turned down requests under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for data contained in COINS prior to the 2010 General Election.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; However, after promises during the election campaign to publish the database if elected,&lt;ref&gt;"We will publish Coins straight away if we get into government." [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/11/data-election-conservatives-coins 2010: the first data election], Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; the coalition government has made available all 120GB of COINS data in a raw format as of 4 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/03/coins-government-spending-database "Government to publish entire spending database"], [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_coins_data.htm HM-treasury.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The hope in doing so is that this will spur third party organisations to find innovative ways to present this information to the public.

The following is a general comparison of [[Glossary of BitTorrent terms#Client|BitTorrent clients]], which are [[computer program]]s designed for [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] using the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]].&lt;ref name="btclient"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt; |title=BitTorrent User Manual |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://www.bittorrent.com/help/manual/glossary#client |accessdate=2 July 2013 |publisher=[[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent, Inc.]] |location=[[San Francisco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BitTorrent protocol coordinates [[segmented file transfer]] among [[Glossary of BitTorrent terms#Peer|peers]] connected in a [[Glossary of BitTorrent terms#Swarm|swarm]]. A BitTorrent client enables a user to exchange data as a peer in one or more swarms. Because BitTorrent is a [[peer-to-peer]] [[communications protocol]] that does not need a [[server (computing)|server]], the BitTorrent definition of ''client'' differs from [[Client (computing)|the conventional meaning]] expressed in the [[client–server model]].&lt;ref name="btclient"/&gt;

[[Bram Cohen]], author of the BitTorrent protocol, made the first BitTorrent client, which he also called [[BitTorrent (software)|BitTorrent]], and published it in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Bram |url=http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/3160|title=BitTorrent – a new P2P app |website=Decentralization · Implications of the end-to-end principle |publisher=[[Yahoo! Groups]] |date=2 July 2001|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many BitTorrent programs are [[open-source software]]; others are [[freeware]], [[adware]] or [[shareware]]. Some [[download manager]]s, such as [[FlashGet]] and [[GetRight]], are BitTorrent-ready. [[Opera (web browser)|Opera 12]], a [[web browser]], can also transfer files via BitTorrent.

In 2013 Thunder Networking Technologies publicly revealed that some of their employees surreptitiously distributed a Trojan horse with certain releases of [[Xunlei]], the company's BitTorrent-ready download manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/google-backed-file-sharing-spreads-malware-131014/ |title=Google-backed BitTorrent client spread malware to Windows PCs and Android devices |last=Van Der Sar |first=Ernesto |date=14 October 2013 |website=[[TorrentFreak]] |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/google-bittorrent-malware-windows-android-xunlei-china |title=Google-Backed File-Sharing Service Spreads Malware |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=15 October 2013 |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xunlei is included in the comparison tables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15094">This is a list of assemblers: [[computer program]]s that translate [[assembly language]] [[source code]] into binary programs. Some assemblers are components of a compiler system for a high level language and may have limited or no usable functionality outside of the compiler system.  Some assemblers are hosted on the target processor and operating system, while other assemblers (cross-assemblers) may run under  an unrelated operating system or processor.  For example, assemblers for [[embedded system]]s are not usually hosted on the target system since it would not have the storage and terminal I/O to permit entry of a program from a keyboard. An assembler may have a single target processor or may have options to support multiple processor types. Very simple assemblers may lack features, such as [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s, present in more powerful versions.

== As part of a compiler suite ==

*[[GNU Assembler]] (gas): GPL: many target instruction sets including [[ARM architecture]], [[Atmel AVR]], [[x86]], [[x86-64]], [[Freescale 68HC11]], [[Freescale ColdFire|Freescale v4e]], [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 680x0]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], IBM [[System z]], [[TI MSP430]], [[Zilog Z80]].
*ASxxxx Cross Assembler (part of the [[Small Device C Compiler]] project): GPL: several target instruction sets including [[Intel 8051]], [[Zilog Z80]], [[Freescale 68HC08]], [[PIC microcontroller]].
*The [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] (ACK) targets many architectures of the 1980s, including [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[Motorola 68000 series|680x0]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[x86]], [[Zilog Z80]] and [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]].
*[[LLVM]] targets many platforms, however emits no per-target assembly language, instead more high-level [[Typed assembly language|typed]] [[LLVM Intermediate Representation|intermediate representation]] assembly-like language used.
* Some others [[self-hosted]] native-targeted language implementations (like [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Free Pascal]], [[SBCL]]) have their own assemblers with multiple targets. They may be used for inline assembly inside language, or even included as a library, but not always suitable for standalone application - no command-line tool exists, or only intermediate representation used as a source, or support for targets very limited.

# {{Note|ACK}} Part of the [[MINIX 3]] source tree, but without obvious development activity. 
# {{Note|ATT}} Developed by [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] in 1986 when they ported [[UNIX System V]] to Intel iAPX286 and 80386 architectures. Archetypical of [[X86 assembly language#Syntax|ATT syntax]] because it was used as reference for GAS. Still used for The [[SCO Group]]'s products, [[UnixWare]] and [[OpenServer]].
# {{Note|Dev86}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20101109000742/http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/ Home site] appears inactive. Also offered as part of [[FreeBSD Ports]], in [http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/devel/bcc.html bcc-1995.03.12].

# {{Note|Mical}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075040/http://ftp.gcu-squad.org/tuhs/Applications/Portable_CC/8086.zip Developed in 1982] at [[MIT]] as a cross-assembler, it was picked up by [[Interactive Systems Corporation]] in 1983 when they developed PC/IX under IBM contract. The syntax was [http://minix1.woodhull.com/pub/info/pc-ix-assem.txt later used] as base for ACK assembler, to be used in [[MINIX]] 1.x toolchain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2633">The Vampire of '''Croglin Grange''' is a [[vampire]] legend that took place in [[Cumberland]], [[England]].  The story first appeared in ''Story of My Life'' by [[Augustus Hare]], written in the 1890s.  In 1929, [[Montague Summers]] republished the story along with the first chapter of [[Varney the Vampire]].  He pointed out that the two stories were very similar and should be dismissed as [[folklore]].

[[Charles G. Harper]] challenged the Hare book in 1924 after visiting the area.  He found no evidence that Croglin Grange ever even existed, but did however find two similar buildings called Croglin High Hall and Croglin Low Hall.  Neither fit the description of the place in the book.  Eventually, after much research, he came to the conclusion that Croglin Low Hall was the place Hare had referred to in the book, even though a [[chapel]] had not existed nearby in many years.&lt;ref name="Charles G. Harper"&gt;Harper, Charles G. ''Haunted Houses''. Detroit: Tower Books, 1971. 288 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

In the particularly dark tale written by Augustine Hare, several episodes took place between 1875 and 1876. An old house had been rented out to a woman and two brothers, Amelia, Edward and Michael Cranswell. During one summer, Amelia was trying to sleep when a strange creature appeared at her window and began picking out the lead surrounding one of the window panes with a long fingernail, then removing it and putting its hand through the resulting gap to undo the window latch and let itself in. It was described as having a brown face and flaming eyes. The vampire bit her in the throat. When her brothers came into the room, the monster was gone.  While one brother tried to help his sister, the other went after the creature.

After a trip to [[Switzerland]], the three returned to Croglin Grange and the creature returned again. The brother shot it in the leg and was able to track it down to a vault in the local cemetery. They waited until the next day to enter the vault, where they found the body of the vampire, with a fresh wound to the leg, resting inside a coffin. They then burned it.&lt;ref name="Augustine Hare"&gt;Hare, Augustine. ''Story of My Life''. 6 vols. London: George Allen, 1896-1900.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J._Gordon_Melton"&gt;Melton, J.

'''Desegregation''' is the process of ending the separation of two groups usually referring to races. This is most commonly used in reference to the United States. Desegregation was long a focus of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], both before and after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', particularly desegregation of the school systems and the military (''see [[Military history of African Americans]]''). [[Racial integration]] of society was a closely related goal.

==In the U.S. military==
===Early history===
Starting with [[King Philip's War]] in the 17th century, blacks served alongside whites in an integrated environment in the North American colonies. They continued to fight in every American war integrated with whites up until the [[War of 1812]]. They would not fight in integrated units again until the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Blacks in the Korean  War | url = http://korea50.army.mil/history/factsheets/afroamer.shtml | publisher =[[U.S. Army]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of black men fought on the side of rebellious colonists in the American Revolutionary War, many in the new Continental Navy. Their names, accomplishments or total numbers are unknown because of poor record keeping.

During the [[American Civil War]], Blacks enlisted in large numbers.  They were mostly enslaved blacks who escaped in the South, although there were many northern black Unionists as well. More than 180,000 blacks served with the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War, in segregated units known as the [[United States Colored Troops]], under the command of white officers. They were recorded and are part of the [[National Park Service]]'s Civil War Soldiers &amp; Sailors System (CWSS).&lt;ref name=cwss/&gt;

Around 18,000 black people also joined the Union Navy as sailors. They were recorded and are part of the [[National Park Service]]'s War Soldiers &amp; Sailors System (CWSS).&lt;ref name=cwss&gt;{{cite web|title= Soldiers and Sailors Database|url= http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/soldiers-and-sailors-database.htm| website =[[U.S. National Park Service|National Park Service]], Department of the Interior| accessdate= 27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wars I and II===
While a handful of Blacks were commissioned as officers in World War I, blacks were severely underrepresented throughout the conflict, though the [[NAACP]] lobbied for the commission of greater numbers of black officers. Upon entering office, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] segregated the United States Navy; previously the U.S. Navy had never been officially segregated.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

During World War II, most officers were white and most black troops still served only as truck drivers and as [[stevedore]]s.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;Martin Blumenson, ''Eisenhower'' (Ballantine Books Inc.: New York, 1972) p. 127; Jonathan Jordan, ''American Warlords: How Roosevelt's High Command Led America to Victory in World War II'', (Penguin 2015), 54-58, 143-45''.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Ball Express]], which was instrumental in facilitating the rapid advance of Allied forces across France after [[D-Day]], was operated almost exclusively by African-American truck drivers.  In the midst of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in late 1944, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was severely short of replacement troops for existing military units—all of which were totally white in composition, so he made the decision to allow African-American soldiers to join the white military units to fight in combat for the first time—the first step toward a desegregated United States military. Eisenhower's decision in this case was strongly opposed by his own army chief of staff, Lieutenant General [[Walter Bedell Smith]], who was outraged by the decision and said that the American public would take offense with the integration of the military units.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

For the U.S. Army see the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)]].

In World War II, the U.S. Navy first experimented with integration aboard [[Sea Cloud|USCGC ''Sea Cloud'']], then later on {{USS|Mason|DE-529|6}}, (both commanded by [[Carlton Skinner]]) a ship with black crew members and commanded by white officers. Some called it "Eleanor's folly", after President Franklin Roosevelt's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=afGr4jkobHgC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Some+called+it+%22Eleanor's+folly%22,+after+President+Franklin+Roosevelt's+wife&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b0SWARwd7t&amp;sig=Zv5oWY7-NGZazgnBAIF2AG95Y00&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidkP_k-eXZAhXCvI8KHfzwAJUQ6AEINjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20called%20it%20%22Eleanor's%20folly%22,%20after%20President%20Franklin%20Roosevelt's%20wife&amp;f=false|title=Greg Freeman: A Gentleman, a Gentle Man : Selected Columns, St. Louis Post-dispatch|last=Freeman|first=Greg|date=2003|publisher=Virginia Publishing|isbn=9781891442230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} ''Mason''{{'}}s purpose had been to allow black sailors to serve in the full range of [[billets]] (positions) rather than being restricted to stewards and messmen, as they were on most ships. The Navy was pressured to train black sailors for billets by Eleanor Roosevelt, who insisted that they be given the jobs they had trained for.
[[File:"Group of CBs acting as stretcher bearers for the 7th Marines. Peleliu.", 09-1944 - NARA - 532537.jpg|thumb|"17th Special" Seabees with the 7th Marines on Peleliu made national news in an official U.S.Navy press release.&lt;ref&gt;Antill, Peter (2003), Peleliu, battle for (Operation Stalemate II) - The Pacific War's Forgotten Battle, September–November 1944, "HITTING THE BEACH 3rd paragraph" [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_peleliu]&lt;/ref&gt; NARA-532537]] 
The U.S. Navy's newest component, the Seabees, had the same ingrained attitudes and approaches but ended up at the forefront of change.  In February 1942 [[Chief of Naval Operations|CNO]] Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark]] recommended African Americans for ratings in the construction trades. In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, those men were put into segregated units, the 34th&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M. Marx, Schwabacher Frey Company, San Francisco, CA, 1946 [https://books.google.com/books?id=znA2e9qPmaUC&amp;pg=PT5]&lt;/ref&gt; and 80th&lt;ref&gt;80th Naval Construction Battalion, Bickford Engraving And Electrotype Co. 20 Matheewson Street, Providence, RI, 1946 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVsdVqGsE5kC&amp;pg=PA112]&lt;/ref&gt; Naval Construction Battalions (NCBs). Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers. In addition, many of the stevedore battalions(called Special Construction Battalions) were segregated. However, by wars end many of those Special Construction Battalions were the first fully integrated units in the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/03/06/building-for-a-nation-and-equality-african-american-seabees-in-world-war-ii/ Seabeemagazine online 2014/03/06]&lt;/ref&gt;  The wars end also brought the decommissioning of every one of those units.

===Modern history===
In 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]] ordered the integration of the armed forces following World War II, a major advance in civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Freedom to serve : Truman, civil rights, and Executive Order 9981 | publisher=Routledge | author=Taylor, Jon E. | year=2012 | location=New York | isbn=9780415895583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Executive Order meant that Truman could bypass Congress. Representatives of the [[Solid South]], all white Democrats, would likely have stonewalled related legislation.

For instance, in May 1948, [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard B. Russell]], Democratic Senator from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], attached an amendment granting draftees and new inductees the opportunity to choose whether or not they wanted to serve in segregated military units to the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]] that was being debated in Congress, but it was defeated in committee. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948.  In June 1950 when the Selective Services Law came up for renewal, Russell unsuccessfully tried again to attach his segregation amendment.

At the end of June 1950, the [[Korean War]] broke out.  The U.S. Army had accomplished little desegregation in peacetime and sent the segregated Eighth Army to defend South Korea. Most black soldiers served in segregated support units in the rear.  The remainder served in segregated combat units, most notably the 24th Infantry Regiment. The first months of the Korean War were some of the most disastrous in U.S. military history. The [[North Korean People's Army]] nearly drove the American-led United Nations forces off the Korean peninsula. Faced with staggering losses in white units, commanders on the ground began accepting black replacements, thus integrating their units. The practice occurred all over the Korean battle lines and proved that integrated combat units could perform under fire. The Army high command took notice.  On July 26, 1951, the U.S. Army formally announced its plans to desegregate, exactly three years after Truman issued Executive Order 9981.

Soon Army officials required Morning Reports (the daily report of strength accounting and unit activity required of every unit in the Army on active duty) of units in Korea to include the line "NEM XX OTHER EM XX TOTAL EM XX", where NEM was the number of Negro Enlisted Men, in the section on enlisted strength.  The Form 20s for enlisted personnel recorded race.  For example, the percentage of Black Enlisted Personnel in the 4th Signal Battalion was maintained at about 14% from September 1951 to November 1952, mostly by clerks' selectively assigning replacements by race.  Morning Report clerks of this battalion assumed that all units in Korea were doing the same. The Morning Reports were classified "RESTRICTED" in those years.{{Citation needed|reason=Citations needed from Korean War Records in Kansas|date=April 2008}}

On October 12, 1972, a racially fraught riot occurred on the [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman ''Troubled Water: Race, Mutiny, and Bravery on the USS Kitty Hawk'' Palgrave Macmillan, New York, NY (2009) {{ISBN|9780230613614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Despite the presence of a black executive officer, the ship's second-in-command, many black sailors felt they were dealt harsher punishments and menial assignments because of their race".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkermilitarylibrary.org/Home/gregory-freeman.aspx Webcast Interview] by Gregory A. Freeman on ''Troubled Waters'' at the [[Pritzker Military Library]] on February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==In U.S. housing law==

The practice of segregating and discriminating in housing opportunity based on race has a long history in the United States. Up until the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, segregated neighborhoods were enforceable by law. The [[Fair Housing Act]], which was the first national law to outlaw housing discrimination, ended discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. The passage of the Act was contentious. The Fair Housing Act was meant to be a direct follow up to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], however from 1966 to 1967 [[United States Congress]] failed to garner enough political support for its passage. At that time several states had passed their own fair housing laws and Congress was not convinced that a federal law was necessary.

It was only after the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], on April 4, 1968, and the [[King assassination riots|ensuing riots]] that Legislation finally passed the bill and was signed into law on April 11, 1968, by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who was one of the law's strongest proponents. He called the new law one of the "promises of a century…it proclaims that fair housing for all—all human beings who live in this country—is now a part of the American way of life". Since the act's passage in 1968, it has been amended to include sex, familial status, and disability. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] within the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is charged with administering and enforcing this law.

==In the U.S. education system==
{{Main|School Integration in the United States}}
{{See also|Black school|White flight}}
[[File:The Legacy Project It Happened in Little Rock.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Hate mail]] written in the late 1950s regarding desegregation of [[Little Rock Central High School]] is projected over actresses [[Mary-Pat Green]] and Gia McGlone in [[Arkansas Repertory Theatre]]'s 2007 production of ''[[The Legacy Project: It Happened in Little Rock]]''.]]
In ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' (1971), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that [[forced busing]] of students may be ordered to achieve racial desegregation. However, court-enforced school desegregation efforts have decreased over time.

A major decline in manufacturing in northern cities, with a shift of jobs to suburbs, [[U.S. South|the South]] and overseas, has led shifts in numbers of residents of all races increasing in suburbs, plus major shifts in population from the North to the Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and South. Left behind in many northern and midwestern [[inner cities]] have been the poorest blacks and other minorities. According to [[Jonathan Kozol]], in the early 21st century, U.S. schools have become as segregated as they were in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kozol]], [http://www.annenberginstitute.org/VUE/winter06/Kozol.html "Segregation and Its Calamitous Effects: America's 'Apartheid' Schools"], ''VUE (Voices in Urban Education)'', Number 10, Winter 2006, Annenberg Institute for School Reform, Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in 1988. As of 2005, the proportion of black students at majority-white schools was at "a level lower than in any year since 1968".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kozol]], [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051219/kozol "Overcoming Apartheid"], ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', December 19, 2005. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of school desegregation have argued that court-enforced desegregation efforts were either unnecessary or self-defeating. Numerous middle-class and wealthy white people continued moving from cities to suburbs during the 1970s and later, in part to escape certain integrated school systems, but also as part of the [[suburbanization]] caused by movement of jobs to suburbs, continuing state and federal support for expansion of highways, and changes in the economy.

Some white parents in Louisiana said that they were afraid to drop their children off because of all the mobs surrounding the desegregated schools.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news| title= 1960 Year In Review: Schools Desegregate| url =http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1960/Schools-Desegregate/?spt=nil&amp;d=n| accessdate=27 February 2015|work=United Press International|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist David Armor states in his 1995 book ''Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law'' that efforts to change the racial compositions of schools had not contributed substantially to academic achievement by minorities. Carl L. Bankston and Stephen J. Caldas, in their books ''A Troubled Dream: The Promise and Failure of School Desegregation in Louisiana'' (2002) and ''Forced to Fail: The Paradox of School Desegregation'' (2005), argued that continuing racial inequality in the larger American society had undermined efforts to force schools to desegregate.&lt;ref name=schafer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schafer|first1=Mark|title=A Troubled Dream: The Promise and Failure of School Desegregation in Louisiana (review)|journal=[[Social Forces]]|date=March 2004|volume=82|issue=3|pages=1242–1244|doi=10.1353/sof.2004.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained that racial inequality had resulted in popular associations between school achievement and race. Therefore, the achievement levels of American schools were generally associated with their class and racial compositions. This meant that even parents without racial prejudice tended to seek middle class or better residential neighborhoods in seeking the best schools for their children. As a result, efforts to impose court-ordered desegregation often led to school districts in which there were too few white students for effective desegregation, as white students increasingly left for majority white suburban districts or for private schools.

===Asian Americans===

The increasing diversity of American society has led to more complex issues related to school and ethnic proportion. In the 1994 federal court case ''[[Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District]]'', parents of [[Chinese American]] schoolchildren alleged that [[racial quotas]] under a 1983 consent decree constituted racial discrimination in violation of the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The desegregation plan did not allow any school to enroll more than 50% of any ethnic group. Originally intended to aid integration of blacks, the ruling had a negative effect on the admissions of Chinese students, who had become the district's largest ethnic group.

The newspaper ''[[AsianWeek]]'' documented the Chinese American parents' challenge. Since Chinese Americans were already nearly half the student population, the consent decree had the effect of requiring the competitive [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], to apply much higher academic admission standards for Chinese American students. However, the civil rights group [[Chinese for Affirmative Action]] sided with the school district, arguing that such standards were not harmful to Chinese Americans, and were necessary to avoid the resegregation of schools. In 2006, Chinese parents continued to protest race-based school assignments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=62b76e43cf6febedc8965ef39c5cdee2 "Back to School for Integration: The Catch-22 of Excellence and Diversity Without Race"], ''[[AsianWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ELOG''' is a [[Web application]] written by Stefan Ritt in [[C (programming language)|C]] which can be used to create personal and common [[Electronic_logbook|logbooks]]. It has been developed at the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] originally for shift logbooks in the particle physics experiment [[Mu to E Gamma|MEG]], but is now widely used in other fields. Besides the [[CERN]] experiments [[LHCb]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], it is used on the US coastguard icebreaker [[USCGC Healy]] and part of the [[Debian]] distribution.

ELOG is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] as [[free software]]. It is currently available in 13 languages.

== Description ==

ELOG combines a small internal database with a web front-end in a single program. It can be configured through a single configuration file for different applications such as:

* '''Personal logbooks'''. People can write down notes in a chronological order ('entries') and retrieve them with a web browser.
* '''Shared logbooks'''. Logbooks can be shared among several people with read and optional write access. The most common use of this are shift logbooks replacing the traditional paper logbook.
* '''Small databases'''. ELOG can be configured with arbitrary attributes and thus serve a simple database with search facilities for typically a few thousand entries.
* '''Discussion forums'''. The possibility to use threads and automatic email notifications make this software useful for (simple) news group servers.
* '''Bug tracker'''. ELOG can be configured to work as a simple [[Bug tracking system]] with email notifications and a database for open/fixed bugs.
* Any combination of the above hosted on a single site.

The main difference between ELOG and other systems is the fact that ELOG does not depend on any other package such as a database server or [[PHP]]. A single executable together with a configuration file make it very simple to install and use. 

== Platforms ==

ELOG consists of a single C program and can be compiled on most systems. Most commonly it is used under [[Linux]], [[MS Windows]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. ELOG is part of the [[Debian]] distribution [http://packages.qa.debian.org/e/elog.html].

The '''''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''''' ({{lang-la|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum}}), written by the [[Venerable Bede]] in about AD 731, is a history of the Christian Churches in [[England]], and of England generally; its main focus is on the conflict between the [[East-West Schism|pre-Schism]] [[Roman Rite]] and [[Celtic Christianity]]. It was originally composed in [[Latin]], and is considered one of the most important original references on [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] history and has played a key role in the development of an [[English national identity]]. It is believed to have been completed in 731 when Bede was approximately 59 years old.

==Overview==
The ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum'', or ''An Ecclesiastical History of the English People''&lt;ref name=Farmer_21&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Bede's best-known work, completed in about 731. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background and then sketches the history of England, beginning with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] invasion in 55 BC.&lt;ref name=Farmer_22&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief account of [[Christianity in Roman Britain]], including the martyrdom of [[Saint Alban|St Alban]], is followed by the story of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]]'s mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Campbell "Bede" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; The second book begins with the death of [[Gregory the Great]] in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria.&lt;ref name=Farmer_31&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These encountered a setback when [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]], the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian [[Edwin of Northumbria]] at the [[Battle of Hatfield Chase]] in about 632.&lt;ref name="Farmer_31"/&gt; The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] and [[Oswy of Northumbria|Oswy]].&lt;ref name=Farmer_31-2&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of the third book is the account of the [[Council of Whitby]], traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history.&lt;ref name=Whitby1&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1983|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth book begins with the consecration of [[Theodore of Canterbury|Theodore]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and recounts [[Wilfrid]]'s efforts to bring Christianity to the [[kingdom of Sussex]].&lt;ref name=Farmer_32&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth book brings the story up to Bede's day, and includes an account of missionary work in [[Frisia]], and of the conflict with the [[Celtic Christianity|British church]] over the correct dating of Easter.&lt;ref name=Farmer_32 /&gt; Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to [[Ceolwulf of Northumbria|Ceolwulf]], king of Northumbria.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, "Preface", ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably, Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it.&lt;ref name="Farmer_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf's approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Scope==
Divided into five books (about 400 pages), the ''Historia'' covers the history of England, ecclesiastical and political, from the time of [[Julius Caesar]] to the date of its completion in 731. The first twenty-one chapters, covering the period before the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], are compiled from earlier writers such as [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Gildas]], [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], the letters of [[Pope Gregory I]], and others, with the insertion of legends and traditions.

After 596, documentary sources that Bede took pains to obtain throughout England and from [[Rome]] are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed along with critical consideration of its authenticity. This is impressive; nevertheless, the ''Historia'', like other [[English historians in the Middle Ages|historical writing from this period]] has a lower degree of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]] than modern historical writings. It seems to be a mixture of fact, legend, and literature. For example, Bede quotes at length some speeches by people who were not his contemporaries and whose speeches do not appear in any other surviving source; it is doubtful whether oral traditional history supported these ostensible quotations.

==Sources==
The [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|monastery at Jarrow]] had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning.&lt;ref name=BEASE_MJ&gt;Cramp, "Monkwearmouth (or Wearmouth) and Jarrow", pp.&amp;nbsp;325–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the period prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and [[Solinus]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Constantius of Lyon|Constantius]]'s ''Life of Germanus'' as a source for [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s visits to Britain.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt; Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from [[Gildas]]'s ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=BEASE_Gildas&gt;Lapidge, "Gildas", p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as [[Eddius Stephanus]]'s ''[[Life of Wilfrid]]'', and anonymous ''Lives'' of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert.&lt;ref name=Farmer_25 /&gt; He also drew on [[Josephus]]'s ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'', and the works of [[Cassiodorus]],&lt;ref name=Mey831&gt;Meyvaert "Bede" ''Speculum'' p. 831&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a copy of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' in Bede's monastery.&lt;ref name=Mey843&gt;Meyvaert "Bede" ''Speculum'' p. 843&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede also had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of [[Nothelm|Nothhelm]], at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of [[Gregory the Great]]'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm&gt;Keynes, "Nothhelm", pp.&amp;nbsp;335&amp;nbsp;336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; which includes the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]'', as chapter 27 of book 1 is often known.&lt;ref name=WallHad37&gt;Wallace-Hadrill ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'';&lt;ref name=HE_pref&gt;Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Preface, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; he was in contact with [[Daniel of Winchester|Daniel]], the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at [[Lastingham]] for information about [[Cedd]] and [[Chad of Mercia|Chad]].&lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;  Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop [[Kinebertus|Cynibert]] for information about Lindsey.&lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;

The historian [[Walter Goffart]] argues that Bede based the structure of the ''Historia'' on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart asserts that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''. The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart asserts were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''.&lt;ref name=Goffart296&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 296-307&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.&lt;ref name=Deconstruct7/&gt;&lt;ref name=Deconstruct12&gt;Brooks "From British to English Christianity" ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''The History of the English Church and People'' has a clear polemical and didactic purpose. Bede sets out not just to tell the story of the English, but to advance his views on politics and religion.
In political terms he is a partisan of his native [[Northumbria]], amplifying its role in English history over and above that of [[Mercia]], its great southern rival. He takes greater pains in describing events of the seventh century, when Northumbria was the dominant Anglo-Saxon power than the eighth, when it was not. The only criticism he ventures of his native Northumbria comes in writing about the death of [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|King Ecgfrith]] in fighting the Picts at [[Battle of Dun Nechtain|Nechtansmere]] in 685.

Bede attributes this defeat to God's vengeance for the Northumbrian attack on the Irish in the previous year. For while Bede is loyal to Northumbria he shows an even greater attachment to the Irish and their missionaries, whom he considers to be far more effective and dedicated than their rather complacent English counterparts.

His final preoccupation is over the precise [[Easter#Date|date of Easter]], which he writes about at length. It is here, and only here, that he ventures some criticism of [[St Cuthbert]] and the Irish missionaries, who celebrated the event, according to Bede, at the wrong time. In the end he is pleased to note that the Irish Church was saved from error by accepting the correct date for Easter.

==Models==
Bede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.&lt;ref name=ASEEncBede&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2001|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.&lt;ref name=Farmer_26&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms "Australes" and "Occidentales" for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses "Meridiani" and "Occidui" instead, as perhaps his informant had done.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''.&lt;ref name=Farmer_27&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede's work as [[Hagiography|hagiographer]], and his detailed attention to dating were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.&lt;ref name="Farmer_21"/&gt;

==Themes==
One of the important themes of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is that the conversion of the British Isles to Christianity had all been the work of Irish and Italian missionaries, with no efforts made by the native Britons. This theme was developed from Gildas' work, which denounced the sins of the native rulers during the invasions, with the elaboration by Bede that the invasion and settlement of the British Isles by the Angles and Saxons was God's punishment for the lack of missionary effort and the refusal to accept the Roman date for celebrating Easter. Although Bede discusses the history of Christianity in Roman Britain, it is significant that he utterly ignores the missionary work of [[Saint Patrick]].&lt;ref name=Deconstruct4&gt;Brooks "From British to English Christianity" ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; He writes approvingly of [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] and [[Columba]], who came from Ireland as missionaries to the Picts and Northumbrians, but disapproved of the failure of the Welsh to evangelize the invading Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=Farmer_30&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede was a partisan of Rome, regarding Gregory the Great, rather than Augustine, as the true apostle of the English.&lt;ref name=Farmer_30-31&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, in his treatment of the conversion of the invaders, any native involvement is minimized, such as when discussing [[Chad of Mercia]]'s first consecration, when Bede mentions that two British bishops took part in the consecration, thus invalidating it. No information is presented on who these two bishops were or where they came from. Also important is Bede's view of the conversion process as an upper-class phenomenon, with little discussion of any missionary efforts among the non-noble or royal population.&lt;ref name=Deconstruct7&gt;Brooks "From British to English Christianity" ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view, taken by historian D. H. Farmer, is that the theme of the work is "the progression from diversity to unity". According to Farmer, Bede took this idea from Gregory the Great and illustrates it in his work by showing how Christianity brought together the native and invading races into one church. Farmer cites Bede's intense interest in the schism over the correct date for Easter as support for this argument, and also cites the lengthy description of the Synod of Whitby, which Farmer regards as "the dramatic centre-piece of the whole work."&lt;ref name=Farmer_27/&gt; The historian Alan Thacker wrote in 1983 that Bede's works should be seen as advocating a monastic rather than secular ministry, and Thacker argues that Bede's treatment of St Cuthbert is meant to make Cuthbert a role-model for the role of the clergy advocated by Gregory the Great.&lt;ref name=Reread54&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Walter Goffart says of the ''Historia'' that many modern historians find it a "tale of origins framed dynamically as the Providence-guided advance of a people from heathendom to Christianity; a cast of saints rather than rude warriors; a mastery of historical technique incomparable for its time; beauty of form and diction; and, not least, an author whose qualities of life and spirit set a model of dedicated scholarship."&lt;ref name=Nar235&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Goffart also feels that a major theme of the ''Historia'' is local, Northumbrian concerns, and that Bede treated matters outside Northumbria as secondary to his main concern with northern history.&lt;ref name=Nar240&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Goffart sees the writing of the ''Historia'' as motivated by a political struggle in Northumbria between a party devoted to Wilfrid, and those opposed to Wilfrid's policies.&lt;ref name=Goffart326&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the "current" history in the ''Historia'' is concerned with [[Wilfrid]], who was a bishop in Northumbria and whose stormy career is documented not only in Bede's works but in a ''Life of Wilfrid''. A theme in Bede's treatment of Wilfrid is the need to minimize the conflict between Wilfrid and [[Theodore of Tarsus]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who was involved in many of Wilfrid's difficulties.&lt;ref name=Chadwick92&gt;Chadwick "Theodore" ''Archbishop Theodore'' pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' includes many accounts of miracles and visions. These were ''de rigueur'' in medieval religious narrative,&lt;ref name=Farmer_26-27&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Bede appears to have avoided relating the more extraordinary tales; and, remarkably, he makes almost no claims for miraculous events at his own monastery.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  There is no doubt that Bede did believe in miracles, but the ones he does include are often stories of healing, or of events that could plausibly be explained naturally.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  The miracles served the purpose of setting an example to the reader, and Bede explicitly states that his goal is to teach morality through history, saying "If history records good things of good men, the thoughtful reader is encouraged to imitate what is good; if it records evil of wicked men, the devout reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse."&lt;ref name=Farmer_25-26&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omissions and bias==
Bede apparently had no informant at any of the main Mercian religious houses.&lt;ref name=Yorke_100&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;  His information about Mercia came from [[Lastingham]], in Northumbria, and from Lindsey, a province on the borders of Northumbria and Mercia.&lt;ref name=Yorke_100/&gt;  As a result, there are noticeable gaps in his coverage of Mercian church history, such as his omission of the division of the huge Mercian diocese by Theodore in the late 7th century.&lt;ref name=Yorke_100/&gt; Bede's regional bias is apparent.&lt;ref name=Farmer_29-30&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were clearly gaps in Bede's knowledge,&lt;ref name=Farmer_23&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Bede also says little on some topics that he must have been familiar with.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  For example, although Bede recounts Wilfrid's missionary activities, he does not give a full account of his conflict with Archbishop [[Theodore of Canterbury]], or his ambition and aristocratic lifestyle.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_Wilfrid&gt;{{harvnb|Thacker|1998|pp=474–476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the existence of other sources such as the ''Life of Wilfrid'' make it clear what Bede discreetly avoids saying.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  The omissions are not restricted to Wilfrid; Bede makes no mention at all of [[Boniface]], though it is unlikely he knew little of him; the final book contains less information about the church in his own day than could be expected.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  A possible explanation for Bede's discretion may be found in his comment that one should not make public accusations against church figures, no matter what their sins; Bede may have found little good to say about the church in his day and hence preferred to keep silent.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  It is clear that he did have fault to find; his letter to Ecgberht contains several criticisms of the church.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has more to say about episcopal events than it does about the monasteries of England. Bede does shed some light on monastic affairs; in particular, he comments in book V that many Northumbrians are laying aside their arms and entering monasteries "rather than study the arts of war. What the result of this will be the future will show."&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bede, HE, V.23&lt;/ref&gt;  This veiled comment, another example of Bede's discretion in commenting on current affairs, could be interpreted as ominous given Bede's more specific criticism of quasi-monasteries in his letter to Ecgberht, written three years later.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Bede's account of life at the court of the Anglo-Saxon kings includes little of the violence that Gregory of Tours mentions as a frequent occurrence at the Frankish court. It is possible that the courts were as different as their descriptions make them appear but it is more likely that Bede omitted some of the violent reality.&lt;ref name=Farmer_23 /&gt; Bede states that he wrote the work as an instruction for rulers, in order that "the thoughtful listener is spurred on to imitate the good".&lt;ref name=Rivalries20&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Brown|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was no part of Bede's purpose to describe the kings who did not convert to Christianity in the ''Historia''.&lt;ref name=Tyler148&gt;{{harvnb|Tyler|2007|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anno Domini==
In 725 Bede wrote ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' (De Temporum Ratione), using something similar to the ''[[anno Domini]]'' era (BC/AD dating system) created by the monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525, continuing to use it throughout ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', becoming very influential in causing that era to be adopted thereafter in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=World269&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he used ''anno ab incarnatione Domini'' (in the year from the incarnation of the Lord) or ''anno incarnationis dominicae'' (in the year of the incarnation of the Lord). He never abbreviated the term like the modern AD. Bede counted ''anno Domini'' from Christ's birth, not from Christ's [[Conception (biology)|conception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Blackburn | first = Bonnie |author2=Holford-Strevens, Leofranc | title = The Oxford companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1999 | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-214231-3 | quote=...if Dionysius, whose calendrical rules or ''argumenta'' make September, not January, the beginning of the year, treated incarnation as synonymous with birth (as his early followers, including Bede, do)}} (first published 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|778}} Within this work, he was also the first writer to use a term similar to the English ''before Christ''. In book I chapter 2 he used ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' (before the time of the incarnation of the Lord). However, the latter was not very influential—only this isolated use was repeated by other writers during the rest of the [[Middle Ages]]. The first extensive use of "BC" (hundreds of times) occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').

==Continuation of Bede==
Some early manuscripts contain additional annalistic entries that extend past the date of completion of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', with the latest entry dated 766.&lt;ref name=EHD_259&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p.&amp;nbsp;259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;  No manuscripts earlier than the twelfth century contain these entries, except for the entries for 731 through 734, which do occur in earlier manuscripts.&lt;ref name=EHD_259/&gt;  Much of the material replicates what is found in [[Simeon of Durham]]'s chronicle; the remaining material is thought to derive from northern chronicles from the eighth century.&lt;ref name=EHD_259/&gt;

The ''Historia'' was translated into [[Old English]] sometime between the end of the ninth century and about 930;&lt;ref&gt;''The Old English Version of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', ed. by Thomas Miller, Early English Text Society, o. s. 95, 96, 110, 111 (London: Trübner, 1890-98).&lt;/ref&gt; although the surviving manuscripts are predominantly in the [[West Saxon dialect]], it is clear that the original contained [[Mercian dialect|Anglian features]] and so was presumably by a scholar from or trained in [[Mercia]].&lt;ref name="Sharon M. Rowley 2011 pp. 36-46"&gt;Sharon M. Rowley, ''The Old English Version of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica'', Anglo-Saxon Studies, 16 (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2011), pp. 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was once held to have been done by King [[Alfred of England]], but this attribution is no longer accepted, and debate centres on how far it owes its origins to the patronage of Alfred and/or his associates.&lt;ref name="Sharon M. Rowley 2011 pp. 36-46"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reread24&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the earliest tranche of which was composed/compiled around the same time as the translation was may, drew heavily on the ''Historia'', which formed the chronological framework of the early parts of the Chronicle.&lt;ref name=Reread25&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and influence==
The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than on the British Isles.&lt;ref name=Companion4/&gt; Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire.&lt;ref name=Reread21&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]].&lt;ref name=Companion4&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced.&lt;ref name=Nar236&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.&lt;ref name=Nar238&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 238-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  His focus on the history of the organization of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In the early Middle Ages, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', and [[Alcuin|Alcuin's]] ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae'' all drew heavily on the text.&lt;ref&gt;''De pontificibus et sanctis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, The Bishops, Kings, and Saints of York'', ed. and trans. by Peter Godman (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the later medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations.&lt;ref name=Reread27&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilized the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.&lt;ref name=Reread33&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, asserts that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should be considered as current myth, not history.&lt;ref name=Behr&gt;Behr "Origins of Kingship" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 25-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript tradition==
Manuscripts of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' fall generally into two groups, known to historians as the "c-type" and the "m-type".&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xl–xli.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Plummer]], in his 1896 edition of Bede, identified six characteristic differences between the two manuscript types.&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli/&gt;  For example, the c-type manuscripts omit one of the miracles attributed to St Oswald in book IV, chapter 14, and the c-type also includes the years 733 and 734 in the chronological summary at the end of the work, whereas the m-type manuscripts stop with the year 731.&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli/&gt;  Plummer thought that this meant the m-type was definitely earlier than the c-type, but this has been disputed by [[Bertram Colgrave]] in his 1969 edition of the text.&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli/&gt;  Colgrave points out that the addition of a couple of annals is a simple alteration for a copyist to make at any point in the manuscript history; he also notes that the omission of one of Oswald's miracles is not the mistake of a copyist, and strongly implies that the m-type is a later revision.&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli/&gt;

Some genealogical relationships can be discerned among the numerous manuscripts that have survived. The earliest manuscripts used to establish the c-text and m-text are as follows.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xli–xlv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters under the "Version" column are identifying letters used by historians to refer to these manuscripts.

===Relationships between the manuscripts===
[[Image:Bede manuscript tree.svg|thumb|right|275px|The relationships between some of the early manuscripts of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'']]
With few exceptions, Continental copies of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' are of the m-type, while English copies are of the c-type.&lt;ref name=CM_xl-xli/&gt;  Among the c-texts, manuscript K includes only books IV and V, but C and O are complete. O is a later text than C but is independent of it and so the two are a valuable check on correctness. They are thought to have both derived from an earlier manuscript, marked "c2" in the diagram, which does not survive. A comparison of K and c2 yields an accurate understanding of the original c-text, but for the first three books, which are not in K, it is sometimes impossible to know if a variant reading in C and O represents the original state of the c-text, or is a variation only found in c2. One long chapter, book I chapter 27, is also found in another manuscript, Rh. 95 at the Zürich Zentralbibliothek; this is another witness to the c-text and appears to be independent of c2, and so is useful as a further cross-check on the c-text.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;

The m-text depends largely on manuscripts M and L, which are very early copies, made not long after Bede's death. Both seem likely to have been taken from the original, though this is not certain. Three further manuscripts, U, E, and N, are all apparently the descendants of a Northumbrian manuscript that does not survive but which went to the continent in the late-8th century. These three are all early manuscripts, but are less useful than might be thought, since L and M are themselves so close to the original.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;

The text of both the m-type and c-type seems to have been extremely accurately copied. Taking a consensus text from the earliest manuscripts, Bertram Colgrave counted 32&amp;nbsp;places where there was an apparent error of some kind. However, 26 of these are to be found within a transcription from an earlier source, and it is apparent by checking independent copies of those sources that in such cases Bede copied the mistake faithfully into his own text.&lt;ref name=CM_xxxix-xl&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxxix–xl.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the manuscripts===
*'''K''' appears to have been written in Northumbria in the late 8th century. Only books IV and V survive; the others were probably lost during the Middle Ages. The manuscript bears a 15th-century pressmark of the Abbey of Fulda.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''C''', also known as the [[Tiberius Bede]], was written in the south of England in the second half of the 8th century. Plummer argued that it was from Durham, but this is dismissed by Colgrave. The manuscript contains glosses in Old English that were added in the south during the 9th century.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''O''' dates to the early 11th century, and has subsequent corrections many of which are from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''L''', also known as the [[St Petersburg Bede]], was copied by four scribes no later than 747. The scribes were probably at either Wearmouth or Jarrow Abbey.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''M''', also known as the [[Moore Bede]], was written in Northumbria in 737 or shortly thereafter. The manuscript was owned at one time by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], the Bishop of Ely, and as a result it is known as the Moore MS. Moore's collection was purchased by King [[George I of England|George I]] and given to [[Cambridge University]] in 1715, where it still resides.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''U''' dates to the late 8th century, and is thought to be a copy, made on the continent, of an earlier Northumbrian manuscript ("c2" in the diagram above). It has been at Weissenburg since the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''E''' dates from the middle third of the 9th century. In 800, a list was made of books at Würzburg cathedral; the list includes one ''Historia Anglorum'' and E may be a copy of that manuscript. Subsequently, E is known to have been in the possession of [[Ebrach Abbey]].&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;
*'''N''' was copied in the 9th century by several scribes; at one point it was owned by [[Hubertus|St Hubert]] in the [[Ardennes]].&lt;ref name=CM_xli-xlv/&gt;

Manuscripts written before 900 include:

* Corbie MS, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris
* St. Gall Monastery Library

Copies are sparse throughout the 10th century and for much of the 11th century. The greatest number of copies of Bede's work was made in the 12th century, but there was a significant revival of interest in the 14th and 15th centuries. Many of the copies are of English provenance, but also surprisingly many are Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Laistner, M. L. W. (with H. H. King), ''A Hand-List of Bede Manuscripts'', Ithaca NY: Cornell U. P. (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing history==
The first printed copy of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' appeared from the press of [[Heinrich Eggestein]] in [[Strasbourg]], probably between 1475 and 1480. A defect in the text allows the identification of the manuscript Eggestein used; it subsequently appeared in a catalogue of the Vienna Dominicans of 1513. Eggestein had also printed an edition of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s translation of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', and the two works were reprinted, bound as a single volume, on 14 March 1500 by [[Georg Husner]], also of Strasbourg. Another reprint appeared on 7 December 1506, from [[Heinrich Gran]] and S. Ryman at [[Haguenau]].&lt;ref name=CM_lxx-lxxiii&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;lxx–lxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Paris edition appeared in 1544,&lt;ref&gt;Colgrave gives the sources for this as Pierre Chifflet, who produced an edition of Bede in 1681; Colgrave comments that he himself has not seen this edition. See Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxxi, n.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1550 [[John de Grave]] produced an edition at [[Antwerp]]. Two reprints of this edition appeared, in 1566 and 1601. In 1563, [[Johann Herwagen]] included it in volume III of his eight-volume ''Opera Omnia'', and this was in turn reprinted in 1612 and 1688.  [[Michael Sonnius]] produced an edition in Paris in 1587, including the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' in a collection of other historical works; and in 1587 [[Johann Commelin]] included it in a similar compilation, printed at [[Heidelberg]]. In 1643, [[Abraham Whelock]] produced at Cambridge an edition with the Old English text and the Latin text in parallel columns, the first in England.&lt;ref name=CM_lxx-lxxiii/&gt;

All of the above editions were based on the C-text. The first edition to use the m-type manuscripts was printed by Pierre Chifflet in 1681, using a descendant of the Moore MS. For the 1722 edition, [[John Smith (priest, born 1659)|John Smith]] obtained the Moore MS., and also having access to two copies in the [[Cotton Library]] was able to print a very high-quality edition. Smith undertook his edition under the influence of [[Thomas Gale]], encouraged by [[Ralph Thoresby]], and with assistance of [[Humfrey Wanley]] on [[Old English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.J. Higham|title=(Re-)Reading Bede: The Ecclesiastical History in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcJ-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|date=22 November 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-26065-2|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W.Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett J.

His son George brought out in 1722 the ''Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Gentis Anglorum Libri Quinque, auctore Venerabili Bæda ... cura et studio Johannis Smith, S. T. P.'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; It contains also the preface to ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'', and a world-chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Bede (the Venerable)|title=Bede, The Reckoning of Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&amp;pg=PR98|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-693-1|page=xcvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had the [[Old English]] version of the ''Historia ecclesiastica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon M.

Smith's edition is described by [[David C. Douglas]] as "an enormous advance" on previous ones, adding that textual criticism of Bede hardly then changed until 1896, when the   Plummer edition appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[David C. Douglas]] |title=English Scholars|year=1943 |publisher= Jonathan Cape|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the most notable edition was that of [[Charles Plummer]], whose 1896 ''Venerabilis Bedae Opera Historica'', with a full commentary, has been a foundation-stone for all subsequent scholarship.&lt;ref name=CM_lxx-lxxiii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colgrave comments that his omission of manuscript L "does not impair the value of his text, which can fairly be described as final. The width of his interests and the accuracy of his learning must be the envy of any successor". D. H. Farmer, in the Penguin Bede, says that "like all previous editions of Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'' this one depends on the pioneering work of Charles Plummer". See Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxxiii, and {{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem''''' ('''''Letters to brother Quintus''''') is a collection of letters from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] politician and orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] to his younger brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]]. The letters in this collection, when combined with Cicero's other letters, are considered the most reliable sources of information for the period leading up to the fall of the [[Roman Republic]]. His letters to Quintus share a similar quality to those sent to his close friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], written with a freedom and frankness not to be found in his correspondence with others. Traditionally spanning 3 books, and featuring letters from 60 or 59 to 54&amp;nbsp;BCE, this collection may have been first published by Cicero's [[freedman]] and personal secretary [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]] sometime after the deaths of both brothers in 43&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Shackleton Bailey |editor-first=D.

'''Fictitious Internet resources''' are [[website]]s, [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses, or other facilities that are purported to be associated with the [[Internet]] and are used in works of fiction or popular culture, such as movies and television shows. This is also known as 'logging on to the fourth wall'.

==Domain names==
{{main|Domain name#Fictitious domain name}}

==IP addresses==
When [[IP address]]es are called for in a script, some TV shows, like ''[[24 (television)|24]]'', will use addresses containing components in the [[quad-dotted notation]] that are larger than 255, which is not possible since the components are only 8 bits large. The movie ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'' uses an IP address in 293.0.0.0 in a scene, and the comic strip ''[[Narbonic]]'' referenced the fictitious IP address 132.513.151.319. However, in ''[[Antitrust (film)|Antitrust]]'', several addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8 range are shown; these are valid {{IETF RFC|1918}} [[private network]] addresses, but their use is not possible on the public Internet. The ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' series uses addresses in the 5.0.0.0/8 block, which until November 2010 was reserved by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], and since December 2010 has been assigned to [[RIPE]].

Two RFCs (Request For Comments) describe the use of Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735 IPv4] and
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849 IPv6].

Three IPv4 blocks are provided for use in documentation:
* 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1)
* 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2)
* 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3)

The IPv6 address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.

The '''''Good Building Design and Construction in the Philippines''''' is a [[handbook]] developed in cooperation with the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|German Technical Cooperation]] (GTZ), [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] Regional Center in [[Bangkok]], and the Secretariat of the [[United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|url=http://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/publications/10329|website=United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handbook aims to provide a comprehensive information to house owners, designers, builders, and building monitors to teach principles of good design and construction in natural hazard prone areas such as the [[Philippines]].

==Main authors==
'''Robin Willison''', is a Civil Engineer and a consultant for Disaster Risk reduction has written the handbook and provided photographs through experience in tragedy recovery during impacts of hazards in the Philippines and Indonesia.

'''Olaf Neusser''', is a disaster risk consultant for GTZ and has provided support for the assessment of building culture in [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] through the effects of local catastrophe in the area.

==Analogy of good building structure==
[[File:Side view of Gabrielle unit construction at Lancaster New City.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of how houses in the Philippines must not be built: No structural columns, no extruding column steel reinforcements to secure the roof, cracked walls even during construction phase which is indicative of improper construction materials]]
As the Philippines lies within the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] where earthquakes and eruptions are more likely to occur as well as being at the edge of the Pacific Ocean where violent storms are likely to develop, proper construction philosophies and strategic location must be assessed so it can resist external forces.

===Foundation===
The book has given a detailed identification of proper house foundation and ground classification to ensure it is not [[liquefaction]] prone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=UNISDR|isbn=9789719414605|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
Principle of coherent structure and the importance of the presence of structural columns to support the walls and roof structure in the event of environmental hazards such as ravaging flood, strong winds and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=UNISDR|isbn=9789719414605|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roof truss tying===
Roof trusses must be welded to purlins and tied using extruding column steel reinforcements. to ensure it is fixed properly to the columns and will not fly-off during strong winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=UNISDR|isbn=9789719414605|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proper location===
Proper location has been discussed in the handbook to ensure that the ground below is sturdy to support the weight of the structure. It must be composed of bedrock and must not be [[landfill]]ed and is away from slopes and [[river bed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=UNISDR|isbn=9789719414605|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction materials===
Broken rough rocks and fine sand must be used and must be free from external sediments as it may affect the strength of the concrete mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on good building design and construction in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=UNISDR|isbn=9789719414605|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gradhiva''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[museology|museological]] journal, founded in 1986 by the poet and social scientist [[Michel Leiris]] and by the anthropologist [[Jean Jamin]]. It is since 2005 published by the [[Musée du Quai Branly]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/enseignement/scientific-publications/gradhiva.html The 'Gradhiva' Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212230826/http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/enseignement/scientific-publications/gradhiva.html |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its title derives from a novel by W. Jensen (''[[Gradiva (novel)|Gradiva]]'') which was the basis for a famous investigation by [[Sigmund Freud]], and that strongly inspired the [[Surrealists]]. Leiris ans Jamin inserted an "H" in the word to highlight that the journal focused on the '''H'''istory of anthropology, and that the editing was done at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in [[Paris]]. The title thus became the [[acronym]] "{{lang|fr|'''G'''roupe de '''R'''echerches et d&amp;#39;'''A'''nalyses '''D'''ocumentaires sur l&amp;#39;'''HI'''stoire et les '''V'''ariations de l&amp;#39;'''A'''nthropologie}}}" ("Research and Documentary Analysis Group, History and Variations of Anthropology). It was edited by Jean Jamin between 1986 and 1996, by Françoise Zonabend from 1996 to 2006, and by Erwan Dianteill from 2006 until 2008.

Initially dedicated to the history and the archives of anthropology, it maintained its original mission, yet latterly opened up to a greater extent to contemporary developments of anthropology and museology. Based on original examinations and the publication of archives, '''Gradhiva'' was open to a variety of disciplines: [[ethnology]],  [[aesthetics]], [[history]], [[art history]], [[sociology]], literature and even music. Finally, it sought to develop an interaction between the text and images through high-quality and original [[iconography]].

In 2007, the anthropologist Sally Price ended her review article on ''Gradhiva'' in ''The Museum Anthropology Review'' by saying:
{{cquote|For anyone who's interested in anthropology, history, and museums, this journal remains an essential resource, rich in its articles and beautiful in its presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://museumanthropology.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/mar-2007-2-28/
|title=Gradhiva: revue d’anthropologie et de muséologie
|last=Price |first=Sally
|date=30 October 2007
|newspaper=Museum Anthropology Review
|accessdate=8 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gradhiva'' was published by the French publisher [http://www.jmplace.com/fr/revues/fiche.cfm?ProduitCode=2 Jean Michel Place] until 2004.

In 2009, the journal was retitled as ''Anthropology of Art'', with a new direction.

'''James Monroe Ingalls''' (January 25, 1837 &amp;ndash; May 1, 1927) was an [[United States|American]] soldier and an authority on [[ballistics]]. His tabulations on ballistics was the authoritative source for over 100 years.

==Early life==
Ingalls was born January 25, 1837, in Sutton Township, [[Caledonia County, Vermont]]. He was the youngest of 9 children of James Ingalls (circa 1792-1866) and Mary Cass (circa 1797-1883). His parents are buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Madison, Dane County, [[Wisconsin]].  He had a sister, Jane Margaret Ingalls (1821–1920), who married Estes Wilson. Jane Ingalls Wilson was one of the first female physicians in Wisconsin. 

Ingalls spent his childhood in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]. He worked as an errand boy at Lancaster Mills and graduated from Clinton High School in 1856.

==Civil War==
James Monroe Ingalls moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], with his parents in about 1856. He was a professor of mathematics in the Evansville Seminary, Wisconsin, 1860-1863. He enlisted in the regular army on January 2, 1864, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and was assigned to the 16th Infantry. He was promoted corporal and served as commissary and quartermaster-sergeant until May 21, 1865. He was promoted 2d and 1st lieutenant on May 3, 1865, accepting the promotions on May 21, 1865. On April 17, 1869, he was transferred to the 2d Infantry; on January 1, 1871, to the 1st artillery. He was Commandant of Cadets and Professor of Military Science and Tactics and Mathematics at West Virginia University 1877-78. He was a very popular professor. He was promoted captain of artillery on July 1, 1880; major on June 1, 1897, and lieutenant-colonel on October 5, 1900. He served in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and other points in the south between 1864 and 1871, and was then sent to the artillery school at Fort Monroe, graduating in the class of 1872. He was then stationed successively at [[Old Stone Barracks|Plattsburgh Barracks]], and Forts Jefferson and Barrancas, and, in July 1880, was assigned to the command of Battery A, Governor's Island, New York Harbor, and thence transferred to San Francisco Harbor, where he served until ordered to Battery G at Fort Munroe 1882. He suggested and organized the department of ballistics at the artillery school, Fort Monroe, and was made the first instructor on December 19, 1882, which position he held until the school suspended operations in spring 1898 because of the [[Spanish–American War]]. He was also senior instructor in practical artillery exercises, class of 1884; in engineering, class of 1888; in electricity and defensive torpedoes, classes of 1884, 1886, 1888 and 1890; and in signaling, 1884-88. Lieutenant Colonel Ingalls retired from the Army in 1901. In 1904, he was made colonel retired. Ingalls died on May 1, 1927 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, [[New London, Connecticut]].

Author A. J. Bastarache has called Colonel Ingalls the "Father of Ballistics" for his pioneering research that contributed to America's military successes through the 20th century.

==Family life==
Ingalls married Elizabeth Niles, daughter of John S. Niles and Elizabeth Lilly, in July 1860, in [[Dane County, Wisconsin]]. She was born in 1841 in Leon, Cattaraugus County, New York, and died on July 28, 1875 of typhoid fever at [[Fort Barrancas]], [[Escambia County, Florida]], and is buried in the national cemetery there. They had two children. Their son, Arthur Niles Ingalls (1861–1875), also died of typhoid fever and is buried with his mother. Their daughter, Hilda Eliza Ingalls (born September 1868 in McPhersonburg, Virginia) married Joel Randall Burrow in 1889. He later became the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas. Hilda died on November 4, 1908, and is buried at Fairview Cemetery, Smith Center, Kansas.  

Ingalls married a second time on July 17, 1877, in New London, Connecticut, to Harriet Elizabeth Thurston, daughter of Benjamin Babcock Thurston, who had been Lieutenant Governor of [[Rhode Island]]. They had one child, Fanny Thurston Ingalls, who never married.

[[File:List of the 214 Kangxi Radicals - old style.svg|right|thumb|400px|List of Kangxi radicals in a font imitating the original character shapes of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]].]]
The 214 '''Kangxi radicals''' ({{zh|c=康熙部首|p=Kāngxī bùshǒu}}) form a system of [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|部首}}}}) of [[Chinese characters]]. 
The radicals are numbered in [[stroke (CJKV character)|stroke]] count order. They are the de facto standard used as the basis for most modern [[Chinese dictionaries]], such that reference to "[[radical 61]]", for example, without additional context, refers to the 61st radical of the ''Kangxi Dictionary'',  [[:wikt:心|心]]; [[pinyin|''xīn'']] "heart".

Originally introduced in the 1615 ''[[Zihui]]'', they are named in relation to the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' of 1716 (''[[Kangxi Emperor|Kāngxī]]'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|康|熙}}}} being the [[Chinese era name|era name]] for 1662–1723). The system of 214 Kangxi radicals is based on the older system of [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|540 radicals]] used in the Han-era ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.

==Statistics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Radicals frequency table.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of the number of entries per radical in the ''Kangxi Dictionary'']]
The Kangxi dictionary lists a total of 47,035 characters divided among the 214 radicals, for an average of 220 characters per radical, but distribution is unequal, the [[median]] number of characters per radical being 64, with a maximum number of 1,902 characters (for [[radical 140]]  {{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:艸|艸]]}}) and a minimum number of five ([[radical 138]]  {{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:艮|艮]]}}). The radicals have between one and seventeen strokes, the median number of strokes being 5 while the average number of strokes is slightly below 5.7.&lt;!--average 1219/214=5.696--&gt;

The ten radicals with the largest number of characters account for 10,665 characters (or 23% of the dictionary). The same ten radicals account for 7,141 out of 20,992 characters (34%) in the Unicode [[CJK Unified Ideographs]] block as introduced in 1992, as follows:

==Modern dictionaries==
Modern Chinese dictionaries continue to use the Kangxi radical-stroke order, both in  traditional ''zìdiǎn'' ({{linktext|字典}}, lit. "character/logograph dictionary") for written [[Chinese character]]s and modern ''cídiǎn'' ({{linktext|詞典}} "word/phrase dictionary") for spoken expressions. The  214 Kangxi radicals act as a de facto standard, which may not be duplicated exactly in every Chinese dictionary, but which few dictionary compilers can afford to completely ignore.  They also serve as the basis for many computer encoding systems, including [[Unihan]]. The number of radicals may be reduced in modern practical dictionaries, as some of the more obscure Kangxi radicals do not form any characters that remain in frequent use. Thus, the  ''Oxford Concise English–Chinese Dictionary'' ({{ISBN|0-19-596457-8}}), for example, has 188 radicals. The ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]'',  a pocket-sized character dictionary  containing about 13,000 characters, uses 189 radicals. A few dictionaries also introduce new radicals, treating groups of radicals that are used together in many different characters as a kind of radical. For example, ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', the most inclusive available [[Chinese dictionary]] (published in 1993) has 23,000 head character entries organised by a novel system of 200 radicals.

==Unicode==
{{further|Han unification}}
The [[Unicode]] standard encoded 20,992 characters in version 1.0.1 (1992) in the [[CJK Unified Ideographs]] block (U+4E00&amp;ndash;9FFF). This standard followed the Kangxi order of radicals ([[radical 1]] at U+4E00, [[radical 214]] at U+9FA0) but did not encode all characters found in the Kangxi dictionary. Individual characters were listed based on their Kangxi radical and number of additional strokes, e.g.  U+5382 厂, the unaugmented [[radical 27]] meaning "cliff" is listed under "27.0", while [[:wikt:&amp;#x5383;|U+5383]] to [[:wikt:&amp;#x5386;|U+5386]] are listed under "27.2" as they all consist of radical 27 plus two additional strokes. More characters were added in later versions, adding "CJK Unified Ideographs Extensions" [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A|A]], [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B|B]], [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C|C]] and [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D|D]] as of Unicode 7.0 (2014) with further additions planned for Unicode 8.0. Within each "Extension", characters are also ordered by Kangxi radical and additional strokes. The Unicode Consortium maintains the "[[Unihan Database]]", with a  [https://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/UnihanRadicalIndex.pl Radical-Stroke-Index]. The Unicode [[Common Locale Data Repository]] provides no  official [[Unicode collation|collation]] (sort order) rule for Unicode CJK characters (short of sorting characters by code point);&lt;ref&gt;Ken Whistler, Markus Scherer, [https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Implicit_Weights Unicode Collation Algorithm, Unicode Technical Standard #10, version 7.0.0] (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; such collation rules as there are language-specific (such as [[JIS X 0208]] for Japanese kanji) and do not include any of the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension characters.

}}
In Unicode version 3.0 (1999), a separate Kangxi Radicals block was introduced which encodes the 214 radicals in sequence, at U+2F00&amp;ndash;2FD5. These are specific code points intended to represent the radical ''qua'' radical, as opposed to the character consisting of the unaugmented radical; thus, U+2F00  represents  [[radical 1]]  while U+4E00 represents the character ''yī'' meaning "one". In addition, the  [[CJK Radicals Supplement]] block (2E80–2EFF) was introduced, encoding alternative (often positional) forms taken by Kangxi radicals as they appear within specific characters. For example, ⺁ "CJK RADICAL CLIFF" (U+2E81) is a variant of ⼚ [[radical 27]] (U+2F1A), itself identical in shape to the character consisting of unaugmented radical 27,   厂 "cliff" (U+5382).

'''''Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender''''' (English: "Kürschner's Encyclopedia of German Scholars"), formerly subtitled ''Lexikon der lebenden deutschsprachigen Wissenschaftler'' ("Encyclopedia of Living German-Speaking Scholars"), is a German language biographical and bibliographical [[encyclopedia]] of [[scientist]]s and [[scholar]]s from the German-speaking part of Europe. It is published by [[Walter de Gruyter]]. The first edition appeared in 1925, edited by [[Gerhard Lüdtke]]. Prior to the 9th edition, it consisted of one volume, but with the 6th edition in 1941 and then again from the 9th in 1961 it was extended to two volumes. Since the 22nd edition in 2009, it includes four volumes. The 28th edition appeared in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;''Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender 2016.'' 28th edition, 4 volumes, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-11-040487-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsz-bw.de/depot/media/3400000/3421000/3421308/01_0020.html ''Kürschners deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender'']&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia generally only includes academics who hold the [[Habilitation]] or are [[full professor]]s, or have equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-marburg.de/bis/aktuelles/news/nachr08/gelehrten Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender], Marburg University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

It evolved from ''[[Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender]]'', a bio-bibliographical encyclopedia of German literature founded in 1879 and subsequently edited by [[Joseph Kürschner]], for whom both works are now named.&lt;ref&gt; Werner Kohlschmidt, Wolfgang Mohr (eds.), ''Reallexikon der deutschen Literaturgeschichte'', 2nd ed., vol. 1, p. 159, Berlin, 2001, {{ISBN|9783110879568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Manual of the Planes''''' (abbreviated '''MoP'''&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp |title=''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ |accessdate=October 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5omY07NIV?url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp |archivedate=April 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a manual for the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]]. This text addresses the [[Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|planar cosmology]] of the game universe.

The original book (for use with ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 1st Edition) was published in 1987 by [[TSR, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Manual of the Planes| isbn=0-88038-399-2| year=1987| publisher=TSR, Inc| first=Jeff| last=Grubb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2nd Edition, concern over inclusion of [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s led TSR to forgo the release, though they compensated years later with the [[Planescape]] campaign setting.  A third edition version of the ''Manual of the Planes'' was published in 2001 by [[Wizards of the Coast]], while a new version for 4th Edition debuted in 2008.

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' first edition==
The original ''Manual of the Planes'' was written by [[Jeff Grubb]], with a cover by [[Jeff Easley]] and interior illustrations by [[Stephen Fabian]] with Easley, and was published by TSR in 1987 as a 128-page hardcover.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easley's cover featured an illustration of a creature named in the book as an "ethereal dreadnought", although the book had no description or game statistics for the creature.&lt;!--From p19 of the MoP: "An illusionist creates a ''phatasmal force'' of a large ethereal dreadnought (see the cover of the book).--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grubb, Jeff. ''Manual of the Planes'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; This creature was later identified in 2nd edition as an [[astral dreadnought]].

The book describes various planes of existence, and what creatures characters might encounter there, covering the astral and ethereal planes, the elemental places, and the outer planes.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The book also details how to survive in the planes, and how combat and magic differ under each plane's special conditions. The [[Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]], The [[Inner Plane]]s—including the Plane of Elemental Air, the Plane of Elemental Fire, the Plane of Elemental Earth, and the Plane of Elemental Water, the Para-Elemental Planes (Smoke, Magma, Ooze, and Ice), the Energy Planes ([[Inner Plane#Positive Energy Plane|Positive Energy]] and [[Inner Plane#Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy]]), and the Quasi-Elemental Planes (Lightning, Radiance, Minerals, Steam, Vacuum, Ash, Dust, and Salt) -- and the [[Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Astral Plane|Astral Plane]]. After these planes, the [[Outer Plane]]s are briefly described, including [[Mechanus|Nirvana]], [[Arcadia (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Arcadia]], [[Mount Celestia|Seven Heavens]], [[Bytopia|Twin Paradises]], [[Elysium (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elysium]], [[Beastlands|Happy Hunting Grounds]], [[Arborea (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Olympus]], [[Ysgard|Gladsheim]], [[Limbo (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Limbo]], [[Pandemonium (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Pandemonium]], [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|The Abyss]], [[Carceri (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tarterus]], [[Gray Waste|Hades]], [[Gehenna (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Gehenna]], [[Baator|The Nine Hells]], [[Acheron (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Acheron]], and [[Outlands|Concordant Opposition]]. ''Manual of the Planes'' explains how each of the outer planes is related to each of the character [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]]s. For example, "[[Mount Celestia|The Seven Heavens]]" is the final resting place for characters of [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Lawful Good|Lawful Good]] alignment.

The third edition ''Manual of the Planes'' was designed by [[Jeff Grubb]], [[Bruce R. Cordell]], and [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]].  Cover art is by [[Arnie Swekel]], with interior art by [[Matt Cavotta]], [[Monte Moore (artist)|Monte Moore]], [[Wayne Reynolds]], [[Darrell Riche]], [[David Roach (comics)|David Roach]], and Arnie Swekel.

After the typical introduction found in almost all guides of D&amp;D 3rd. Edition, ''Manual of the Planes'' presents, in its first chapter, an overview of planes in general: what they are, what their nature is, and what is their function on gameplay. Info about how to shift between planes is also available in this chapter.

The second chapter presents hints on how to design your own cosmology of planes, based on the D&amp;D official cosmology known as "The Great Wheel". Generating a personalized cosmology involves several options—for example, consider how magic works if basic planes that feed magic (such as the Ethereal or Astral planes) are disposed of.

The next chapters in the ''Manual'' are dedicated to detail the Great Wheel and the 27 planes that constitute it, including the [[Inner Plane]]s and the [[Outer Plane]]s.

''Manual of the Planes'' won the 2002 [[ENnies|Ennie Award]] for "Best Rules Supplement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/about-us/2002-noms-and-winners/ 2002 Noms and Winners - ENnie Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cover art is by [[Howard Lyon]], with interior art by [[Rob Alexander]], [[Dave Allsop]], [[Steve Belledin]], [[Zoltan Boros (artist)|Zoltan Boros]] &amp; [[Gabor Szikszai]], Chippy, [[Daarken]], [[Eric Deschamps]], [[Steve Ellis (comics)|Steve Ellis]], [[Jason Engle]], [[Ralph Horsley]], Howard Lyon, [[Warren Mahy]], [[Torstein Nordstrand]], [[William O'Connor (artist)|William O'Connor]], [[Lucio Parillo]], [[Anne Stokes]], [[Francis Tsai]], and [[Franz Vohwinkel]]. The 4th Edition '''Manual of the Planes''' reinvented the cosmology into a streamlined arrangement called the World Axis cosmology.&lt;ref name="4EMotP"&gt;[[Richard Baker (game designer)|Baker, Richard]], [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]], [[Robert J. Schwalb]], and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''Manual of the Planes'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of five core types of planes:

* 1. The Mortal World.
* 2. The Parallel Planes - Two planes that are linked to the Mortal World.
** Feywild (Plane of Faerie).
** Shadowfell (Plane of Shadow).
* 3. Fundamental Planes - Two planes that surround the Mortal World.
** The Astral Sea - The plane above. Consists of Astral Dominions.
** The Elemental Chaos - The plane below. Consists of Elemental Realms.
* 4. Demiplanes - Unique bubbles of existence such as [[Sigil (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Sigil]].
* 5. Anomalous Planes - Planes of an obscure nature.
** The Far Realm - Uncharted plane that exists beyond the known cosmology.
** The Plane of Dreams - Composed of all the dreams that have ever been dreamt.

==Legacy==
The monster on the cover art for the Manual of the Planes, the [[Astral dreadnought]], is the inspiration for the [[Cacodemon]] in  the ''[[Doom (game)|DOOM]]'' video game series.

[[File:20160728MessageInBottleComposite.png | thumb | 400px | This bottle and its contents (sample postcard and insert shown above) were launched in 1959 as part of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]], and were found in 2013.&lt;ref name=NEFSC20140314/&gt;]]
A '''message in a bottle''' is a form of communication in which a printed, typed, or handwritten message is sealed in a container (typically a bottle) and released into a conveyance medium (typically a [[body of water]]).

Messages in bottles have been used to send distress messages; in [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] scientific studies of ocean currents; as memorial tributes; to send deceased loved ones' ashes on a final journey; to convey expedition reports, and to carry letters or reports from those believing themselves to be doomed. Invitations to prospective [[Pen pal|pen pals]] and letters to actual or imagined love interests have also been sent as messages in bottles.

The lore surrounding messages in bottles has often been of a romantic or poetic nature.

Use of the term "message in a bottle" has expanded to include metaphorical uses or uses beyond its traditional meaning as bottled messages released into oceans. The term has been applied to plaques on [[spacecraft|craft]] launched into [[outer space]], [[List of interstellar radio messages|interstellar radio messages]], stationary [[time capsule]]s, [[balloon mail]], and containers storing medical information for use by emergency medical personnel.

With a growing awareness that bottles constitute waste that can harm the environment and marine life, biodegradable drift cards and wooden blocks are alternatives favored by environmentalists.

==History and uses==

Finding a bottled message has generally been viewed positively, the finder of a 98-year-old message referring to his find as winning the lottery.&lt;ref name=BBC20120830/&gt; However, intense media attention over a personal relationship that resulted from one woman's find, is said to have caused her to remark that had she known what would happen, she would have left the bottle on the beach.&lt;ref name=IrishIndep20120805/&gt; Another woman said she initially felt shocked and violated by publication of the personal suffering she had expressed in a bottled letter that she never expected would be found or read.&lt;ref name=Guardian20100813/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph20100627/&gt;

[[Balloon mail]] involves sending undirected messages through the air rather than into bodies of water.&lt;ref name=Mittelhessen20130405/&gt; For example, during the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870, about 2.5 million letters were sent by hot air balloon, the only way Parisians' letters could reach the rest of France.&lt;ref name=ABCau20160224&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maher |first1=Louise |title=Letter flown by balloon out of besieged Paris in 1870 discovered in National Archives |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/letter-flown-out-of-paris-by-hot-air-ballon-in-1870-found/6408654 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027201056/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/letter-flown-out-of-paris-by-hot-air-ballon-in-1870-found/6408654 |archivedate=October 27, 2016 |date=February 24, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stationary [[time capsule]]s have been termed "messages in a bottle", such as a 1935 message in a lemonade bottle correctly portending difficult times, which was found in 2016 by masons restoring damaged Portland stone at [[Southampton Guildhall]].&lt;ref name=ITV20160209&gt;{{cite web |title='Message in a bottle' discovered in Southampton |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2016-02-09/message-in-a-bottle-discovered-in-southampton/ |publisher=ITV |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210164227/http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2016-02-09/message-in-a-bottle-discovered-in-southampton/ |archivedate=February 10, 2016 |date=February 9, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; A geologist left a bottled message in 1959 in a [[cairn]] on isolated [[Ward Hunt Island]] (Canada, 83°N latitude), allowing its finders in 2013 to determine that a nearby glacier had [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreated]] over 200 feet in the intervening 54 years.&lt;ref name=LATimes20131220&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mohan |first1=Geoffrey |title=Message in a bottle found 54 years later in Arctic |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-message-in-bottle-arctic-20131219-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145108/http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-message-in-bottle-arctic-20131219-story.html |archivedate=July 6, 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; More durable examples of time capsules are the [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]] of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]]s, intended to be opened 5,000 years after their creation.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider20140430&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sterbenz |first1=Christina |title=An Incredibly Ambitious Time Capsule Was Sealed 75 Years Ago Today — Here’s What’s Inside |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/westinghouse-time-capsule-2014-4 |publisher=''Business Insider'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331130601/http://www.businessinsider.com/westinghouse-time-capsule-2014-4 |archivedate=March 31, 2016 |date=April 30, 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{maplink|frame=yes|frame-width=240|zoom=11|type=point}}
The '''Monumental Axis''' ("Eixo Monumental" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is a central [[Street name|avenue]] in [[Brasília]]'s city design.

The avenue begins on the [[National Congress of Brazil]] building and is considered part of the [[DF-002]] road. Its first section is known as "Ministries Esplanade" ("Esplanada dos Ministérios"), as it is surrounded by ministries buildings.  Many important [[government]] buildings, [[monument]]s and [[memorial]]s are located on the Monumental Axis.

A common [[urban legend]] persists that the Monumental Axis is the widest road in the world, where "[100 to 160] cars can drive side by side".  This is untrue, as the road consists of two avenues with six lanes on either side; a total of twelve lanes. However, the street has been featured in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as having the widest [[central reservation]] of a [[dual carriageway]] in the world.

On April 21, 2008, a year before they formally broke up, the Mexican pop group [[RBD]] performed a free concert to a crowd of 500,000 on the Monumental Axis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Show RBD no Brasil|url=http://www.tudoemfoco.com.br/show-rbd-no-brasil.html|website=tudoemfoco.com.br|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Empezar Desde Cero Tour 2008]]. The show was to celebrate the 48th Anniversary of the founding of [[Brasilia]]. It was recorded and released as a DVD titled [[Live in Brasilia]]. The crowd in attendance was the largest for which the group had performed.

'''Picco Studio''' was a photography studio located in [[Rouyn-Noranda]], [[Quebec, Canada]]. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shevchenko schoolchildren.png|thumb|left|alt=A photograph taken at the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Hall in [[Rouyn-Noranda]], [[Quebec]] and attributed to Picco Studio.|A photograph taken at the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Hall in [[Rouyn-Noranda]], [[Quebec]] and attributed to Picco Studio.]] --&gt;For a time, the studio was home to [[Marcel Barbeau]], a recipient of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcelbarbeau.com/en/2014/04/_1953_/ |title=1953 |publisher=MarcelBarbeau.com |access-date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of the works of the studio have been incorporated into the [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec]] as part of the [[Pistard Archives]] and the [[Eddy Mathon Fund]]. That particular archive is made up of over 100,000 photographic works including 61,372 photographs, 33,213 negatives of black and white film and an assortment of other various negatives and slides.

'''Pluralism''' as a political philosophy is the recognition and affirmation of diversity within a political body, which permits the peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathwizurd.com/government/2015/10/12/three-theories-of-american-democracy "Theories of American Democracy"]&lt;/ref&gt; While not all political pluralists advocate for a [[pluralist democracy]], this is most common as [[democracy]] is often viewed as the most fair and effective way to moderate between the discrete values.&lt;ref&gt;''Pluralism Liberal Democracy'' {{ISBN|080188215X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As put by arch-pluralist [[Isaiah Berlin]], "let us have the courage of our admitted ignorance, of our doubts and uncertainties. At least we can try to discover what others [...] require, by [...] making it possible for ourselves to know men as they truly are, by listening to them carefully and sympathetically, and understanding them and their lives and their needs... ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/berlin/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Joshua|last1=Cherniss|first2=Henry|last2=Hardy|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism thus tries to encourage members of society to accommodate their differences by avoiding [[extremism]] (adhering solely to one value, or at the very least refusing to recognize others as legitimate) and engaging in [[good faith]] dialogue. Pluralists also seek the construction or reform of social institutions in order to reflect and balance competing principles. One of the more famous arguments for institutional pluralism came from [[James Madison]] in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' paper number 10]]. Madison feared that factionalism would lead to in-fighting in the new American republic and devotes this paper to questioning how best to avoid such an occurrence. He posits that to avoid factionalism, it is best to allow many competing factions (advocating different primary principles) to prevent any one from dominating the [[political system]]. This relies, to a degree, on a series of disturbances changing the influences of groups so as to avoid institutional dominance and ensure competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10751/Pluralism-Political-Pluralism.html|title=Pluralism - Political Pluralism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Edmund Burke]], this view concerns itself with balance, and subordinating any single abstract principle to a plurality or realistic harmony of interests.

Pluralism recognizes that certain conditions may make good faith negotiation impossible, and therefore also focuses on what institutional structures can best modify or prevent such a situation. Pluralism advocates institutional design in keeping with a form of pragmatic [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] here, with the preliminary adoption of suitable existing socio-historical structures where necessary.

==The common good==
Pluralism is connected with the hope that this process of conflict and [[dialogue]] will result in a quasi-[[common good]]. This common good is not an abstract value or set in stone, however, but an attempt at balancing competing social interests, and will thus constantly shift given present social conditions. Proponents in contemporary political philosophy of such a view include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Stuart Hampshire]] and [[Bernard Williams]]. An earlier version of political pluralism was a strong current in the formation of modern [[social democracy]] (to balance socialist and capitalist ideals), with theorists such as the early [[Harold Laski]] and [[G. D. H. Cole]], as well as other leading members of the British [[Fabian Society]]. In the United States, President [[Eisenhower]]'s "middle way" was arguably motivated by a belief in political pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI9952203/|title=Pursuing the "middle way":  Eisenhower Republicanism, 1952--1964|first=Wagner, Steven|last=Thomas|date=1 January 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While advocated by many pluralists, pluralism need not embrace social democracy given it does not [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] assume a desirable political system. Rather, pluralists advocate one based on the pre-existing traditions and cognizable interests of a given society, and the political structure most likely to harmonize these factors. Thus, pluralists have also included [[Michael Oakeshott]] and [[John Kekes]], proponents of something close to [[liberal conservatism]] (although will often reject such political labels). What pluralists certainly do have in common is the notion that a single vision or ideological schema, whether [[Marxism]] or unbridled [[neoliberalism]], is likely too simplistic and rigid to advocate human beings' natural plurality of values. Pluralists likewise reject [[historicism]] and [[utopian]] thinking. While some, like [[John Gray (philosopher)|John N. Gray]], repudiate historical progress altogether, others, like [[Edmund Burke]], indicate that human progress has occurred, as a function of improved social harmony.

== Conditions ==
For pluralism to function and to be successful in defining the common good, all groups have to agree to a minimal consensus that shared values are at least worth pursuing. The most important baseline value is thus that of mutual [[respect]] or [[Toleration|tolerance]]. If no such dialogue is possible, [[extremism]] and physical coercion are likely inevitable.

'''Pratt Contractors Ltd v Palmerston North City Council''' [1995] 1 NZLR 469  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding contract formation involving tenders.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=8 - 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Palmerston North City Council]] put out for tender the construction of a [[Overpass|flyover]]. The tender documents set out detailed criteria and plans for the construction of the flyover, and was to be awarded to the lowest tenderer.

However, a rival contractor submitted a tender for the construction of a redesigned flyover, and the council subsequently accepted that tender, without giving the other tenderers the opportunity to submit a tender for the new design.

After discovering all this, Pratt Contractors sued the council for damages.

==Held==
The court held that the city council tender was a legally binding obligation, and as a result the city council should have given Pratt Contractors the opportunity to revise and resubmit their tender. The court awarded [[damages]] of $17,822 for [[reimbursement]] of the costs in preparing the tender. On top of this, damages for $200,000 for loss of profit was also awarded.

'''Footnote:''' The judge noted that the council could have alternatively accepted none of the tenders instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3985">'''PriceSCAN.com''' was a US-based price comparison [[website]], founded in 1997 by David Cost and Jeffrey Trester, alumni of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] School.&lt;ref&gt;

From the outset PriceSCAN attempted to distinguish itself as serious instrument which consumers could use to achieve price transparency. Economists theorized that the [[internet]], then in its infancy, might provide consumers with an unprecedented opportunity to see through the screen of retail prices to a seller's underlying cost.  They could then use this information to judge whether the two are reasonably in line. "They can log on to price-comparison sites like PriceSCAN.com . . . to readily compare the prices and features . . . And every time a customer takes advantage of a cheaper price from an on-line discounter . . . she unlearns her long-held rules of thumb about how price and cost are related for the product she just purchased."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

  | url = http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=R00210&amp;referral=2341}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end, '''PriceSCAN''' set itself up as an "unbiased" price comparison engine.  The website's FAQ stated "At PriceSCAN, we believe that consumers should have access to unbiased reporting on products and prices. It seems obvious to us that if a price guide restricts its listings to those vendors who have paid to be included, then its database more accurately reflects the source of its revenue, not necessarily the best products at the lowest price."
&lt;ref&gt;

  | url = http://www.ftpress.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0130650757}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

PriceSCAN has been both criticized and praised for this strategy; criticized for the potential loss of advertising revenue ("But PriceScan won't accept payment from merchants for a higher ranking in the search results. In fact, PriceScan plays up its policy of not doing that.")
&lt;ref name = "White"/&gt; and praised for the integrity of the strategy itself ("'They've always had more purity in search results,'  says [Rob Leathern of Jupiter Media Metrix].  'They have a very consumer-friendly offer.'")

Since April 2011, the comparison service has been inactive; the company's Web page now reads simply "PriceSCAN.com, Inc. is a consumer and financial data technology company."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110430193720/http://pricescan.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''private sub-domain registry''' allocates [[domain name]]s in a subset of the [[Domain Name System]] under a domain registered with an [[ICANN]]-accredited or [[ccTLD]] registry. Most of the private sub-domain registries operate based on an [[ISO 3166-1]] name that is a subdomain of a higher-level domain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Some of these registries combine the [[domain registry]] and the [[domain registrar]] functions in the administration structure, while others distribute domains via third-party registrars.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Operation==
Private registries operate at a technical level identical to official domain registries using the well-known principles of operation of the Domain Name System. In addition, the registries may also operate a [[WHOIS]] service to publish domain name information.

==History==
The idea for an independent global domain name registry stems from a series of conversations between one of [[CentralNic]]'s original founders and the late [[Jon Postel]], one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet. Postel suggested the use of ''.UK.COM'' to compete with ''.CO.UK''{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, at a time when the proposed price of the latter was about $300.

After the use of ''UK.COM'' other ISO Country codes ending in ''.COM'' were also established such as ''AU.COM'' (Australia) and ''HK.COM'' (Hong Kong)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udr.hk.com UDR (Hong Kong) – registry website]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other countries. In 2011, CentralNic established the country code second-level domain ''.COM.DE''. Even though that domain is very similar to official ccSLDs, like ''COM.AU'' or ''COM.PL'', it has no official status since it is not operated by [[Denic]], the official registry service provider of ''.DE'' domains.

'''''Record World''''' magazine was one of the three main [[music industry]] [[trade magazine]]s in the [[United States]], along with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]''. It was founded in 1946 under the name '''''Music Vendor''''', but in 1964 it was changed to ''Record World'', under the ownership of Sid Parnes and Bob Austin. It ceased publication on April 10, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/muggy59/1982.html |title=RECORD WORLD 1982 (Defunct 4/10/82) |accessdate=2016-05-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820044013/http://geocities.com/muggy59/1982.html |archivedate=August 20, 2009 |df= }} ''Record World''. Geocities.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Many music industry personalities, writers, and critics began their careers there in the early 1970s to 1980s.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

==History==
===Growth===
''Record World'' has been considered the hipper, faster-moving [[music industry]] publication{{fact|date=January 2013}}, in contrast to the stodgier ''Billboard'' and ''Cash Box'', its sister magazine. 

A weekly, like its competitors, it was housed in [[New York City]] at 1700 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], at 53rd Street, just across the street from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], and West Coast editorial offices in [[Los Angeles]] on Sunset and Vine. 

Rock bands frequented ''Record World'''s offices as part of their promotional tours, often leaving questionable promo items in their wake. The band [[Hot Rats]], for instance, presented each writer with a freeze-dried and shrink-wrapped rat to remember them by.

Today ''Record World'' and its sister magazine ''Cash Box'' are at the forefront of today's music industry.

===Peak===
''Record World'' showed musical diversity by printing a "Non-Rock" survey, comparable to ''Billboard's'' "Easy Listening" chart. This chart appeared 2/4/67 and disappeared essentially 5 years later, 3/4/72, having morphed to the name "The MOR Chart" by 1971. Several titles of interest appeared on this 40-position list without making the ''Billboard'' Easy Listening survey.

''Record World'''s peak years coincided with the [[Studio 54]] era, when disco was in full swing. Recording artists tottered through on platform heels, bedecked in rhinestones, often seriously impaired by the then-popular recreational drug [[cocaine]]. 

Young writers labored far into the night writing reviews of records, analyses of sales data and music-related current events. Staffers included Mike Sigman, editor-in-chief (who then went on to become publisher of the ''[[LA Weekly]]''); Howie Levitt, managing editor (later of ''Billboard'' and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], the music royalty service); Pat Baird, who went on to key publicity positions at both RCA and BMI; (Mike Vallone, editor, charts and statistics; associate editor Allen Levy, who went to become a public relations person for [[United Artists Records]], [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[A&amp;M Records|A&amp;M]], and who is now a professor of mass communication at [[Chapman University]]; art directors Mitchell Kanner, who went on to become Director of Artist Development for Elektra/Asylum Records Records and later Art Director for PolyGram Records, Michael Schanzer, later Stephen Kling and David Ray Skinner; and writers [[Vince Aletti]] (later of ''[[The New Yorker]]''); Marc Kirkeby (he went on to [[CBS]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Records]]); Jeffrey Peisch (later of [[MTV]] and independent producing); Dave McGee (later of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''); [[Laurie David|Laurie Lennard]] (later as a talent booker on ''The Late Show'', then wife of comedian [[Larry David]], and producer of [[Al Gore]]'s ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''); columnist Sophia Midas; and chart editor and asst. editor Fred Goodman (later editor of ''Cash Box'' and current managing editor of ''Pro Sound News'' and a songwriter/music publisher); among many others.

===Demise===
''Record World'''s collapse was the result of discord between the two owners,{{fact|date=January 2013}} and a sudden downturn in record sales.
However, the new owners and management have revived ''Record World'' once again as an online Magazine and Music Charting Service.

===Legacy===
In 2012, it was announced that much of the history of ''Record World'' (and its predecessor publication, ''Music Vendor'') would be chronicled in a 1954–1982 volume produced by [[Joel Whitburn]]'s Record Research, long associated with ''Billboard''-related publications. The book was distributed in September 2012.{{fact|date=January 2013}} A second volume, featuring the ''Music Vendor''/''Record World'' "Beat Of The Week" charts (similar to ''Billboard'''s "Bubbling Under"), spotlighting positions 101–150, was announced in November 2012.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

In 2013, [[Bruce Elrod]] reactivated ''Record World'' as a sister publication of ''Cash Box'' magazine. The new ''Record World'' is geared solely to independent artists and labels. Bruce Elrod and [[Edward Straiter]] (CEO of ''Cash Box'') aim to make a difference in the music industry for years to come.

'''''Road to Zanzibar''''' is a 1941 [[Paramount Pictures]] comedy film starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]], and marked the second of seven picture in the popular "''[[Road to …]]''" series made by the trio. It takes place in the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]].

Paramount executives owned the rights to a story by [[Sy Bartlett]] titled "Find [[Percy Fawcett|Colonel Fawcett]]" about two men trekking through the jungles of [[Madagascar]]. They felt that its plot was so similar to the recently released ''[[Stanley and Livingstone]]'' (1939) that it could not be made as written without seeming too derivative, so they turned the project over to [[Frank Butler (writer)|Frank Butler]] and Don Hartman, the writers on the wildly successful ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' which Paramount had released the year before. Thus reborn as a comedy and [[satire|spoof]] of the [[safari]] [[genre]], the film resembled its predecessor in every important way, with plot taking a back seat to gags (many of them [[Ad libitum|ad libbed]]), and music.&lt;ref name=pc2b&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|2|B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was so successful that further "''Road to...''" pictures were assured.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=August 2016}}
The film starts with con-artist Chuck Reardon ([[Bing Crosby]]) singing "You Lucky People, You" as a side-show caller at a circus advertising an act featuring his friend Hubert "Fearless" Frazier ([[Bob Hope]]). "Fearless" poses as a human cannonball, but he quickly substitutes a dummy at the last minute and hides in a secret compartment.  The flaming dummy sets the big tent on fire and the two of them flee.  Their subsequent acts show 'Fearless' doing more dangerous acts, usually getting injured.  When Chuck brings the next 'great idea', wrestling a live [[octopus]], 'Fearless' finally balks and wants to go back to the states.  At a fancy restaurant, they're sent [[champagne]] by a wealthy man, diamond baron Charles Kimble ([[Eric Blore]]).  The festive mood turns sour when the police show up, but Kimble bails them out.  They decide to go home to the United States, but when Chuck goes to get the tickets Kimble invites him onto his [[yacht]] for a drink.  

'Fearless' is busy packing and when Chuck comes back, he finds out Chuck has spent all their money, five thousand, on the deed for one of Kimble's [[diamond]] mines.  It seems like a good deal, until they find out Kimble is an eccentric who would sign over anything and the deed is worthless.  Furious at Chuck losing all their money, 'Fearless' ends their partnership. Later that evening, 'Fearless' comes back with a fistful of money, claiming to have 'sold' the diamond mine to some guy at a bar for SEVEN thousand.  They start to leave only to be confronted by the same man, Monsieur Le Bec ([[Lionel Royce]]).  'Fearless' had inflated the story a little, so Le Bec and his huge bodyguard want Chuck and 'Fearless' to accompany them to actually see the mine.  Chuck and 'Fearless' manage to escape and jump onto a boat bound for [[Africa]].

Stranded in Africa, they are propositioned by Julia Quimby ([[Una Merkel]]) to help rescue her friend, Donna LaTour ([[Dorothy Lamour]]), from being sold at a slave auction.  They bid 150 in local coin on her to rescue her.  Unbeknownst to both of them, Julia and Donna are also con-artists and take half of the payment to get food.  Donna reveals to Julia about the seven thousand Chuck and 'Fearless' have and how she has convinced them to take her and Julia on a safari across the country, not telling them it's to see Donna's wealthy boyfriend. 

As their journey continues, with the help of an announcer and a montage, Chuck and 'Fearless' both vie for Donna's attention. During a moonlit canoe ride, Chuck proclaims his feelings singing "[[It's Always You]]" and Donna realizes she's starting to fall for him too.  Julia tells Donna it would be foolish to give up her wealthy boyfriend for a side show crooner. Donna finally confides to 'Fearless' that despite her feelings for Chuck, her heart belongs to another.  Thinking its him, 'Fearless' agrees to tell Chuck.  Chuck refuses to believe 'Fearless', who is practically skipping, but then Julia comes in and tell them both about the rich boyfriend.  

Chuck and 'Fearless' finally learn they've been duped from the beginning and everything had been a set-up.  They angrily run into the [[jungle]] to confront her.  While she is swimming in the nude, a pair of [[Leopard|leopards]] appear and tear her clothes while she hides in the reeds.  Upon seeing her torn clothes, Chuck and 'Fearless' assume she's dead.  They bury her clothes and have a funeral, all while Donna watches.  During their attempt at a eulogy, they admit that despite the fact she lied to them, they both loved her.  Chuck and 'Fearless' start to sing "It's Always You" and burst into tears, until Donna sings to them and then they both turn on her.  They storm off into the jungle and the safari leaves without them.

While trying to find their way back, Chuck and 'Fearless' stumble upon skeleton-laden caves.  They jokingly bang on the drums only to summon a local tribe of natives.  The natives, thinking they are gods, adorn them with jewels and give them food.  Chuck and 'Fearless' thinks it is great until the natives decide to test them by throwing 'Fearless' in a cage with a giant [[gorilla]].  After a comical wrestling match, in which 'Fearless' loses, the natives prepare to cook them both, until they use their infamous 'patty cake' routine to escape.

They return to civilization, haggard, dirty and penniless until they hock the jewels they had received from the natives.  'Fearless' reluctantly lets Chuck go to get the tickets. When he comes back empty handed, 'Fearless' is crushed, until Chuck presents Donna and Julia.  Donna gave up the rich boyfriend because she's in love with Chuck. When 'Fearless' asks what they are going to do for money, Chuck springs another 'great idea' and the film ends with the four of them again doing a carnival act, this time sawing a woman (Julia) in half.

==Reception==
The film was placed at No. 8 in the list of [[1941 in film|top-grossing movies]] for 1941 in the USA.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' loved it. "Pity the poor motion picture which ever again sets forth on a perilous (?) African safari, now that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope have traversed the course! For the cheerful report this morning is that the Messrs. Crosby and Hope, with an able left-handed assist from a denatured Dorothy Lamour, have thoroughly ruined the Dark Continent for any future cinematic pursuits. Never again will be hear those jungle drums throbbing menacingly but what we envision Bing and Bob beating a gleeful tattoo upon them. And never again will we behold a file of natives snaking solemnly through the trees without seeing in our mind’s eye the gangling Crosby-Hope expedition as it ambles in and along the Paramount’s “Road to Zanzibar,” which arrived at that house yesterday. Yessir, the heart of darkest Africa has been pierced by a couple of wags... Needless to say, Mr. Crosby and Mr. Hope are most, if not all, of the show—with a slight edge in favor of the latter, in case any one wants to know. Miss Lamour, who is passingly amusing in her frequent attempts to be, assists in the complications and sings a couple of songs... Farce of this sort very seldom comes off with complete effect, but this time it does, and we promise that there’s fun on the “Road to Zanzibar.” This time, as Mr. Hope puts it in one of his pungent phrases, they’re cooking with gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was not so impressed. "‘Zanzibar’ is Paramount’s second coupling of Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour following their successful teaming in ‘Road to Singapore’. Although picture has sufficient comedy situations and dialog between its male stars to get over with general audiences in regular runs, it lacks the compactness and spontaneity of its predecessor...The story framework is pretty flimsy foundation for hanging the series of comedy and thrill situations concocted for the pair. It’s a fluffy and inconsequential tale, with Crosby-Hope combo, through their individual and collective efforts, doing valiant work to keep up interest... Comedy episodes generally lack sparkle and tempo of ‘Singapore’, and musical numbers are also below par for a Crosby picture. Bing sings two, ‘It’s Always You’ the best candidate..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=March 12, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
* "You Lucky People, You", performed by Bing Crosby
* "African Etude / Road To Zanzibar", performed by Bing Crosby and a chorus while on safari
* "You're Dangerous", performed by Dorothy Lamour
* "[[It's Always You]]", performed by Bing Crosby
* "Birds of a Feather" was written to be sung by Crosby but ultimately it was only included in background music.
All lyrics by [[Johnny Burke (lyricist)|Johnny Burke]], and music by [[Jimmy Van Heusen]]

Bing Crosby recorded a number of the songs for [[Decca Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=A Bing Crosby Discography|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's songs were also included in the [[Bing's Hollywood vols.1-15#Only_Forever|Bing's Hollywood]] series.

==Copyright renewal==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The film's copyright was renewed in a timely manner by the company which had acquired it. Originally registered for copyright as LP10409 with a declared publication date of April 11, 1941, the continuation of copyright was contingent upon renewal between the 27th and 28th anniversaries of that date. Renewal occurred April 18, 1968, number R434268. 

While the film opened in New York on April 9, 1941, the renewal is still timely even if the earlier date were considered publication date. Renewal was filed by [[EMKA, Ltd.]], which acquired Paramount's classic pre-1950 library in 1957. Today, EMKA is part of [[NBC Universal Television Distribution]], and Universal Studios is now the theatrical and home video distributor. The copyright is now scheduled to run until 95 years after the publication date (2036). The film has not entered the [[public domain]].

'''Scott Group Ltd v McFarlane''' is a [[New Zealand]] case where it was held that an [[auditor]] was liable for damages for negligence to a 3rd party which later relied on the audit report.&lt;ref name="Gerbic &amp; Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Commercial Law |edition=5th |last1=Gerbic |first1=Philippa |last2=Lawrence |first2=Martin |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71714-9|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
G M McFarlane, a [[Chartered accountant|chartered accountant]], audited the 1970 John Duthie Holdings Ltd financial statements, and through a simple mathematical error, resulted in John Duthie Holdings net worth being overstated by $38,000.

At the same time, Scott Group Limited were considering making a [[takeover offer]], and after reading the audited reports in question, valued the company at over $1 million, and offered to take over the company on the basis of two shares for every one share.

However, just as the takeover was finalised, the mistake was discovered. As a result, Scott Group argued that it paid $38,000 too much for the shares, and sought compensation from the auditors for this amount.

The auditors in response denied any liability for this mistake, on the basis there was no contractual relationship between the auditors and the takeover company, and neither did they owe Scott Group a [[duty of care]] for the mistake.
  
==Decision==
The Court of Appeal ruled that as J D Holdings financial position was so poor, it made a takeover by another company a strong possibility, and that as a result, the auditors owed Scott Group a duty of care. No money for damages was awarded, as the court ruled that it had not suffered any financial loss.

Whilst the financial statements were overstated by $38,000, evidence suggested that the shareholders of John Duthie Holdings were unlikely to have accepted any offer lower than the two for one share swap that was offered. Furthermore, the evidence on hand was that Scott Group paid $263,885 less than what the company was worth.

The auditor's disclaimer did not exclude liability to the general public, which Scott Group was, and presumably since this case, most auditors disclaimers now exclude liability to members of the public.

'''Search for Common Ground''' (or '''SFCG''') is an international [[non-profit organization]] operating in 36&amp;nbsp;countries whose mission is to transform the way the world deals with conflict away from adversarial approaches toward cooperative solutions.  It is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], with the majority of its 600&amp;nbsp;employees based in field offices around the world including in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[United States]]. Search brought together numerous conflicting groups to find ways to peacefully resolve issues using independent media programming, track II diplomacy, and traditional peace building tactics. John Marks, Search's founder and former president, received an award in 2006 from the [[Skoll Foundation]] for [[social entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skollfoundation.org/entrepreneur/john-and-susan-collin-marks/ |title=Skoll &amp;#124; Search for Common Ground |website=Skollfoundation.org |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Search for Common Ground was awarded the [[Benjamin Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy]] by the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mountainrunner.us/2008/04/benjamin_franklin_awards_for_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126205904/http://mountainrunner.us/2008/04/benjamin_franklin_awards_for_p.html |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamil Idriss became President and CEO in September 2014. Prior to taking on his role with Search, Shamil was the CEO for [http://www.soliya.net Soliya], and served as Executive Director of the Alliance of Civilizations Media Fund which merged with Soliya in 2009. In 2005, he was appointed by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as Deputy Director of the UN Alliance of Civilizations. He served on the Steering Committee of the World Economic Forum's Council of 100 Leaders and is a member of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders and of the ASMA Society’s Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.sfcg.org/sfcg-announces-leadership-transition/ |title=SFCG Announces Leadership Transition - Search for Common Ground |website=Sfcg.org |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Search was founded in 1982 by John Marks, a former [[State Department]] diplomat. He knew that  conflict turns into violence when people focus on their differences rather than on their commonalities, and wanted a new way of connecting people across these differences. When Search was founded, it focused on facilitating cooperation between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The first project Search worked on was facilitating a U.S.‑Soviet task force on [[Lebanon]]. This task force developed a concept of a multilateral, regional approach to peace in the [[Middle East]]. Their idea was to bring together different ethnicities to create peace. This plan was later adopted, through Search's help with negotiations, to end the Israeli-Jordanian war.&lt;ref&gt;The New Humanitarians, ed. Chris E Stout, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, the organization has expanded its work to 30 countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[the Middle East]], and parts of [[Eastern Europe]]. Search’s first office in the Middle East was established in 1991. The organization started working in Europe in 1994, in Africa in 1995, and in Asia in 2002. It employs around 600 staff who represent more than 40 nationalities.

==Countries==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Search has over 600 staff operating in 36 countries around the world. The staff represents more than 40 nationalities. Search works in:
*Africa - Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe 
*Asia - Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste (East Timor)
*Europe - Belgium, Macedonia, United Kingdom 
*Middle East/Arab World - Jerusalem, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen
*Others - United States

==Work==
To achieve its mission, Search manages projects that use innovative tools and work at different levels of society to promote cooperation and non-adversarial solutions to problems. Its “toolbox” includes media production – [[radio]], [[TV]], [[film]], and [[printing|print]] – as well as [[mediation]] and [[facilitation (business)|facilitation]], training, community organizing, [[sports]], [[drama]], and [[music]].
Search works in "peace media" focused on building ties between different groups. Their media programs span four continents and Search offers tools for the expansion of programs such as theirs. By focusing mostly on radio and television, they break down many of the traditional literacy barriers of print media.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post, Elise Crane, June 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Ground Productions==
An internal arm of Search is Common Ground Productions, or CG Productions. This arm is responsible for the media production of Search, including radio, television, and internet programming. Programming includes&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcg.org/programmes/cgp/programmes_cgp.html|title=Search for Common GRound: Sikka Team - Sri Lanka|website=Sfcg.org|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Radio===
*[[Radio for Peacebuilding Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiopeaceafrica.org|title=Radio for Peacebuilding Africa &amp;#124; Programmes &amp;#124; Search for Common Ground|website=Radiopeaceafrica.org|date=2013-11-19|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see separate section below)
*Studio Ijambo: 
Common Ground Productions helped create [[Burundi]]'s independent radio studio, Studio Ijambo, in 1995, after fears that the Rwandan genocide of 1994 would spread to neighboring countries. A 2000 poll of listeners found that 82% of people in Burundi thought that Studio Ijambo "helped reconciliation a lot". The studio employs an ethically mixed staff of [[Hutu]]s and [[Tutsi]]s, who present an ethnically united front to an otherwise divided country.&lt;ref name="comminit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comminit.com/en/node/119655/38|title=Studio Ijambo &amp;#124; The Soul Beat Africa Network|website=Comminit.com|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Ijambo has been credited with playing a key role in decentralizing the media in Burundi and building local capacity for news coverage.&lt;ref name="comminit1"/&gt;
*Radio soap operas
Next to the BBC, Search is the largest producer of radio soap operas in the world, and in countries like [[Sierra Leone]] – which recently emerged from a civil war - its programming is listened to by over 90% of the population that has access to a radio. The radio was the most important form of mass communication after the civil war in Sierra Leone because there were three functioning radio stations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers University, Radio Waves Spread Peace in Africa&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Talking Drum Studios
The radio studios in Sierra Leone and Liberia not only promote peace, but also [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention. TDS-Liberia has released several public service announcements, created billboards and handed out T‑shirts and [[condom]]s at events.&lt;ref name="comminit2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comminit.com/en/node/114635/376|title=Talking Drum Studio &amp;#124; Africa - Community Radio |website=Comminit.com|date=2016-04-28|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide children and youth with platforms for expression, through programs such as ''Sisi Lorpu'' and ''Golden Kids News''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Television===
Programming for CG Productions include:
*Africa: The Search For Common Ground
It was produced in the late 1990s as a 13‑part series on the conflicts and struggles facing the African continent. It specifically highlights issues in 16 countries. The series, co‑produced by Ubuntu TV and Film Productions/Media Peace Centre and the [[South African Broadcast Corporation]] (SABC), was broadcast by TV and radio in English, French and Portuguese. The series has been broadcast in 22 countries in 40 local dialects, as well as the three languages it was produced in.
*"The President" (Jerusalem)
In Jerusalem, Search for Common Ground and [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma'an Network]] produced a new reality television program called [[The President (TV Series)|The President]], designed to promote democratic values and political engagement among Palestinian youth. Aired in 2013, the first season of The President challenged young Palestinians to win votes and become the new, mock Palestinian “Youth President.” Twenty-four contestants were filmed reacting to everything from a staged assassination attempt to an impromptu press conference. They debated a range of political and social issues regarding a future Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. Eight finalists became CEO for a day at major companies including Coca-Cola and Jibrini Dairy. The show’s challenges expanded internationally when the four finalists became Palestinian Ambassadors to Russia, Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt. With a live audience in primetime, the show ended with the first ever televised Palestinian political debate between the two finalists moderated by a seasoned journalist. After, viewers picked up their mobiles and elected their new mock president via SMS. Approximately 170,000 SMS messages were calculated to “elect” the winner. Search’s evaluations indicate that approximately 1 million Palestinian households watched the first season. Season 2 generated an even larger following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfcg.org/progressreport |title=Progress Report |website=Sfcg.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Nashe Maalo'' (Macedonia)

===''The Team'' TV series===
{{Main article|The Team (TV series)}}
An ongoing project of CG Productions is ''The Team'' (''L'Equipe''). Using the popularity of football (called [[soccer]] in [[United States|America]]), the show uses sports as a metaphor to unification while addressing local, deep-rooted conflict. The show follows specific characters on a football team who must learn to work together to overcome their differences and win the game. The show is specifically tailored to the country in which it airs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetgreen.discovery.com/work-connect/the-team-promotes-nonviolent-conflict-resolution-through-soccer.html |title=Environmental News and Information &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |website=Planetgreen.discovery.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each country has different issues it faces, and the scripts represent these differences. The cast, writers and production crews are, whenever possible, all indigenous to the country. In the DRC, ''The Team'' deals specifically with women's rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Mobile cinema===
In many countries in Africa, Search has introduced mobile cinema. These programs bring CG Production works into rural villages and expose more people to topics and discussion. In the DRC, Search has introduced mobile cinema dealing specifically with women's rights. Women in the DRC have been the victims of a brutal sexual assault war that has increased in intensity over the last few years.

According to UN estimates, close to "3,500 females were raped by soldiers, militiamen, and civilians during the first six months" of 2009, compared to 4,800 rapes for the whole of 2008. Search used Mobile Cinema in places like Kenya as a tool to broadcast ''The Team'' to a large audience who would otherwise not be exposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcg.org/programmes/cgp/pdf/Kenya%20Evaluation%20Summary04052010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Search for Common Ground : Mid Term Evaluation of the Team in Kenya|website=Sfcg.org|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic influence==
Members of the organization have worked for years to transform [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] decision-making processes by facilitating dialog between grant-makers and grantees. The process led to a youth program that bridges communities of wealth and social entrepreneurship. It also inspired a series of meetings at the United Nations on the idea of young philanthropy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.un.org/youthyear/news.html#philanthropy |title=What's New - International Year of Youth (IYY) August 2010-2011 |website=Social.un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nexus Global Youth Summit]].

==Partners in Humanity==
The Partners in Humanity (PiH) program aims to allay feelings of fear and suspicion based on perceived and real injustices, stereotypes, and inequalities.The mission of Partners in Humanity is to change the way individuals thank and feel about the issues, [[stereotypes]] and tensions that face Muslim-Western relations, which in turn will facilitate action.

The program started in 2003 at a meeting of over 60 international NGOs, media professionals, [[governmental agencies]] and international organizations. The meeting was held in Jordan, and was hosted by Search and His Royal Highness [[Prince Hassan bin Talal]].

In addition to working with Search offices in the United States, [[Rabat]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Jerusalem]], Partners in Humanity works with international organizations, including the [[World Economic Forum]] Council of 100, The Lebanese Center for Policy Studies, Soliya – The Connect Program, and The Institute for Interfaith Dialogue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. PiH news

This program is supported by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Foreign Ministry]], The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, The National Endowment for Democracy, His Royal Highness Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], [[Kingdom Holding Company|Kingdom Holdings]], the [[United States Institute of Peace]], [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], The Compton Foundation and individual donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcg.org/programmes/humanity/programme_about.html |title=Partners in Humanity &amp;#124; About &amp;#124; Programs &amp;#124; Search for Common Ground |website=Sfcg.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and Youth programs==
Search's Children and Youth programs work directly with children in 26 programs in 14 countries aiming to transform children's roles in conflict into alternatives to violence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcg.org/programmes/children/whatwedo.html |title=Search for Common GRound : Children &amp; Youth |website=Sfcg.org |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations recognizes that over 2&amp;nbsp;million children have been killed during war, 6&amp;nbsp;million children have been permanently disabled and over 250,000 child soldiers are still serving as soldiers, despite plans to release child soldiers in countries such as Burundi, the Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/conflicts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912152132/http://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/conflicts.html |archivedate=2009-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programs of Search Youth and Children include radio programming in all countries, news and journalism programs, mentoring programs between young girls and older women, Youth Parliaments, training youth as leaders in nonviolent projects, offering bilingual kindergartens to foster communication, training children and youth in nonviolent conflict resolution, and engaging youth in governmental creation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

The Talking Drum Studios (radio) in [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]] provide children and youth with platforms for expression, through programs such as ''Sisi Lorpu'' and ''Golden Kids News''.&lt;ref name="comminit2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11673">'''''The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham''''' is a series of volumes which, when complete, will form a definitive edition of the writings of the philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832). It includes texts which Bentham published (or which were published in his name) during his lifetime; and also the many texts which remained unpublished at his death, and which exist only in manuscript.

==Scope and history==
The ''Collected Works'' is intended to supersede the 11-volume ''The Works of Jeremy Bentham'' (1838–1843), edited by Bentham's friend and [[literary executor]], [[John Bowring]], which is now considered to be flawed in many points of detail, and which omits Bentham's writings on religion; and also the 3-volume ''Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings'' (1952–54) edited by [[Werner Stark]], which has likewise been subject to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Werner Stark and Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings |journal=History of European Ideas |volume=35 |year=2009 |pages=475–494 |doi=10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2009.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is being published under the auspices of the Bentham Project at [[University College London]], whose library holds the majority of Bentham's surviving manuscripts. Since 2010 the Project has also run [[Transcribe Bentham]], a project for transcribing Bentham's manuscripts through [[crowdsourcing]], the output of which is intended, once edited, to appear in future ''Collected Works'' volumes. 

The Bentham Project is governed by the Bentham Committee, which was established in 1959. The first volume in the ''Collected Works'' appeared in 1968, and to date 33 volumes have been published of a projected total of 80. The series was published from 1968 until 1981 by the [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Athlone Press]] (the [[University of London]]'s publishing house); and since 1983 by [[Oxford University Press]] under its Clarendon Press imprint.

==General Editors==
The General Editors of the series have been: J. H. Burns (1961–79); J. R. Dinwiddy (1977–83); Fred Rosen (1983–94); Fred Rosen and Philip Schofield (1995–2003); and Philip Schofield (2003–date).

==Published volumes==
The series divides into two sequences, the ''Correspondence'' (of which 12 volumes have appeared of an eventual 14); and the ''Works''. The ''Works'' volumes are not sequentially  numbered. 

Those volumes which have been published to date are as follows:

'''Tsung''' (formerly known as '''idx-Tsunami''') is a [[stress testing]] tool written in the [[Erlang programming language|Erlang]] language and distributed under the [[GPL]] license. It can currently stress test [[HTTP]], [[WebDAV]], [[LDAP]], [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[SOAP]] and [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] servers. Tsung can simulate hundreds of simultaneous users on a single system. It can also function in a clustered environment.

==Features==
*Several [[IP addresses]] can be used on a single machine using the underlying OS's IP Aliasing.
*OS monitoring (CPU, memory, and network traffic) using [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[Munin (network monitoring application)|munin-node agents]] or Erlang agents on remote servers.
*Different types of users can be simulated.
*Dynamic sessions can be described in [[XML]] (to retrieve, at runtime, an ID from the server output and use it later in the session).
*Simulated user thinktimes and the arrival rate can be randomized via probability distribution.
*[[HTML]] reports can be generated during the load to view response time measurements, server CPU, and other statistics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="848">'''Tushlaba''' is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for תם ונשלם שבח לאל בורא עולם (Abbr. Heb.: תושלב"ע) meaning "Finished and Complete, Praise be to God, Creator of the Universe."

At the end of [[Judaism|Jewish]] works on traditional and religious subjects, it is customary for the author to express thanks to God for enabling the author of the book to complete it satisfactorily. The author's gratitude is expressed in one word, תושלב"ע, printed on the last page of text of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Birnbaum|Birnbaum, Philip]], ''A Book of Jewish Concepts'', Hebrew Publishing Co., New York (1975), p. 672&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke des 17. Jahrhunderts''' (in English: ''Bibliography of Books Printed in the German Speaking Countries from 1601 to 1700''), abbreviated '''VD17''', is a project to make a retrospective German national bibliography for the 17th century. The project was initiated in 1996 and planned to continue for 10-12 years. It is financed by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (German Research Foundation). As of early 2007, the database contains more than 250,000 titles.

There is a corresponding German national bibliography for the 16th century, known as [[VD 16]], which was compiled during the period 1969-1999, and another for the 18th century is planned.
