In [[mathematics]], the '''algebraic topology''' on the set of group representations from ''G'' to a [[topological group]] ''H'' is the topology of pointwise convergence, i.e. ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''p'' if the limit of ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''g'') = ''p''(''g'') for every ''g'' in ''G''.

This terminology is often used in the case of the algebraic topology on the set of [[discrete group|discrete]], [[faithful representation]]s of a [[Kleinian group]] into [[PSL(2,C)]].  Another topology, the [[geometric topology (object)|geometric topology]] (also called the [[Chabauty topology]]), can be put on the set of images of the representations, and its closure can include extra Kleinian groups that are not images of points in the closure in the algebraic topology.  This fundamental distinction is behind the phenomenon of [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]] and plays an important role in the general theory of [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.

[[Image:Euclid flowchart.svg|thumb|right| [[Flowchart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number ''b'' − ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A &gt; B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|əm}}) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]] and [[automated reasoning]] tasks.

As an [[effective method]], an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; and in a well-defined formal language&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[Empty string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in, for example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding prime numbers and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.&lt;ref name=Cooke2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118460290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''algorithm'' itself derives from the 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], Latinized ''Algoritmi''. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (decision problem) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "[[effective calculability]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or "effective method".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s [[Formulation 1]] of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–37 and 1939.

== Etymology ==
The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in a first step to ''algorismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi.html|title=Al-Khwarizmi biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of algorithm|url=http://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=algorithm&amp;title=21st|website=Chambers Dictionary|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī ({{lang-fa|خوارزمی}}, c. 780–850) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]  mathematician, [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and scholar in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means 'the native of [[Khwarezm]]', a region that was part of [[Greater Iran]] and is now in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |title=al-Khwarzimi |journal=Pythagoras |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=4–5 |url=http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412193516/http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Oaks|url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|title=Was al-Khwarizmi an applied algebraist?|publisher=[[University of Indianapolis]]|accessdate=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGLbfttF?url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|archive-date=November 15, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an [[Arabic language]] treatise on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which was translated into [[Latin]] during the 12th century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brezina| first = Corona| title = Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra| url = https://books.google.com/?id=955jPgAACAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0513-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', English '[[algorism]]', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (''cf.'' 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to ''algorithmus'', and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2012 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4959 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:

{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

==Informal definition==
{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm"| Algorithm characterizations}}
An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that "it must terminate in a finite number of steps" (Stone 1973:7–8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flowchart]] above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' – two arbitrary "input variables" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, "good"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: "In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and "effectively"&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7–8 states that there must be, "...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a "reasonable" time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

==Formalization==
&lt;!-- [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".&lt;ref name="Minsky 1967:105"&gt;{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "[[memory]]" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].

===Expressing algorithms===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite-state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called "sets of quadruples" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 High-level description
: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
; 2 Implementation description
: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
; 3 Formal description
: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].

==Design==

{{See also|Algorithm#By design paradigm}}

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of [[operation research]], such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]]. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ww3.algorithmdesign.net/ch00-front.html|title=Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis, and Internet Examples|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael T.|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|last2=Tamassia|first2=Roberto|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-38365-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.

One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [[Big O notation|Big O]].

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
# Problem definition
# Development of a model
# Specification of the algorithm
# Designing an algorithm
# Checking the correctness of the algorithm
# Analysis of algorithm
# Implementation of algorithm
# Program testing
# Documentation preparation

==Implementation==
[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [[biological neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

==Computer algorithms==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (&lt;tt&gt;IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx&lt;/tt&gt;) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

''"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs '': The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] and precisely in [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]:
:Knuth: ". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by the procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human "computor"&lt;ref&gt;In his essay "Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp. 123–148 in [[Jon Barwise|J. Barwise]] et al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A "robot": "A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions." cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek's "abacus" is a "countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as "an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are "capable of holding any number of stones" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion results, the word "counters" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single "number".&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 "Computer models" and Chapter 14 "Very Simple Bases for Computability" pp. 255–281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF–THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z ← 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity. Volume A| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-X39_rA3VSQC| year = 1990| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-444-88071-0 | page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "[[spaghetti code]]", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, {{ISBN|0-201-13433-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;'': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]], offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

==Examples==
{{further|List of algorithms}}

===Algorithm example===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|right|An animation of the [[quicksort|quicksort algorithm]] sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.]]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description of English prose, as:

''High-level description:''
# If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
# Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
# For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
# When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.

''(Quasi-)formal description:''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The largest number in the list ''L''.

   '''if''' ''L.size'' = 0 '''return''' null
   ''largest'' ← ''L''[0]
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' ''L'', '''do'''
     '''if''' ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

===Euclid's algorithm===
{{further|Euclid's algorithm}}
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).]]

[[Euclid]]'s algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA" (Heath 1908:297)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r'' = ''l'' − ''q''×''s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293–297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

[[File:Euclids-algorithm-example-1599-650.gif|350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.
&lt;source lang="text" highlight="1,5"&gt;
 1599 = 650×2 + 299
 650 = 299×2 + 52
 299 = 52×5 + 39
 52 = 39×1 + 13
 39 = 13×3 + 0&lt;/source&gt;]]

====Computer language for Euclid's algorithm====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

====An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|163px|right|"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2–4. Depending on the two numbers "Inelegant" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than "Elegant".]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

'''INPUT''':
 {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:
   INPUT L, S
 {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:
   R ← L

'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
 {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:
   IF R &gt; S THEN
     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:
     GOTO step [[#6|6]]
   ELSE
     swap the contents of R and S.
 {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L ← R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).
 {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R ← S
 {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S ← L

'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.
 {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S &gt; R THEN
     done measuring so
     GOTO [[#10|10]]
   ELSE
     measure again,
 {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R ← R − S
 {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]].

'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.
 {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN
      done so
      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]
    ELSE
      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],

'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder ''r'' to measure what was previously smaller number ''s''; L serves as a temporary location.
 {{vanchor|11|el11}}  L ← R
 {{vanchor|12|el12}}  R ← S
 {{vanchor|13|el13}}  S ← L
 {{vanchor|14|el14}}  [Repeat the measuring process]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]]

'''OUTPUT''':

 {{vanchor|15|el15}} [Done. S contains the [[greatest common divisor]]]:
    PRINT S

'''DONE''':
 {{vanchor|16|el16}} HALT, END, STOP.

====An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction &lt;source lang="cbmbas" inline&gt;LET [] = []&lt;/source&gt; is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;source lang="cbmbas"&gt;
  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
  6 PRINT "Type two integers greater than 0"
  10 INPUT A,B
  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
  30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
  40 LET B=B-A
  50 GOTO 20
  60 LET A=A-B
  70 GOTO 20
  80 PRINT A
  90 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
integer euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){
     A=Math.abs(A);
     B=Math.abs(B);
     while (B!=0){
          if (A&gt;B) A=A-B;
          else B=B-A;
     }
     return A;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
''How "Elegant" works'': In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

===Testing the Euclid algorithms===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13–18. He credits "the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288–298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms===
''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294–313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

==Algorithmic analysis==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookups]] on sorted lists or arrays.

===Formal versus empirical===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis, and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.&lt;ref name="KriegelSchubert2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=The (black) art of run-time evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|volume=52|issue=2|year=2016|pages=341–378|issn=0219-1377|doi=10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution efficiency ===
{{Main|Algorithmic efficiency}}
To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&lt;ref name="Hassanieh12"&gt;Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704180806/http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf |date=July 4, 2013 }}, Kyoto, January 2012. See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref&gt; Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

; Recursion
: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
; Logical
: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.
; Serial, parallel or distributed
: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[computer network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.
; Deterministic or non-deterministic
: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
; Exact or approximate
: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the [[Knapsack problem]]. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540402862|title=Knapsack Problems {{!}} Hans Kellerer {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Quantum algorithm]]
: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of [[Quantum computing]] such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:

; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search
: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Divide and conquer
: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of the decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
; Search and enumeration
: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
;[[Randomized algorithm]]
: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation

# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].
# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]
: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as ''[[Transform and conquer algorithm|transform and conquer]]''.
; [[Back tracking]]
: In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.

=== Optimization problems ===

For [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:

; [[Linear programming]]
: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; [[Dynamic programming]]
: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s – meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
; The greedy method
: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
;The heuristic method
:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:

* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.
* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.
* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].
* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.
* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].

Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

== Continuous algorithms ==
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&amp;pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
{{see also|Software patent}}

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

== History: Development of the notion of "algorithm" ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], which was described in [[Introduction to Arithmetic]] by [[Nicomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/eratosthenes.html|title=Eratosthenes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.2}} and the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was first described in [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.1}} [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian clay tablets]] describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | author-link = Asger Aaboe | date = 2001 | title = Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy | publisher = Springer | place = New York | pages = 40–62 | isbn = 0-387-95136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], and the [[List of Iranian mathematicians|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms "[[algorism]]" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
''The clock'': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine"&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to "mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real [[Turing-complete]] computer instead of just a [[calculator]] – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

''Logical machines 1870—[[Stanley Jevons]]' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"'': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what is now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a ''Logical Machine''" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay'': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, it's discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[teleprinter]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

''Telephone-switching networks'' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century ===
''Symbols and rules'': In rapid succession, the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

''The paradoxes'': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

''Effective calculability'': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Finite Combinatory Processes&amp;mdash;formulation 1", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt;—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to "[[Church thesis]]" that he called "Thesis I",&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing "Turing's Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===
Here is a remarkable coincidence{{According to whom|date=March 2017}} of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
:"...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...

:"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]
[[File:Alan Turing.jpg|thumb|200px|Alan Turing's statue at [[Bletchley Park]]]]
[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we{{Who|date=March 2017}} might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]]—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...

:"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:"The simple operations must therefore include:
::"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
::"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"

:"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
[[J. Barkley Rosser]] defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
:"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

[[Stephen C. Kleene]] defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, "yes" or "no," to the question, "is the predicate value true?"" (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]). For more, see [[Algorithm characterizations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">In [[model theory]], an '''atomic model''' is a model such that the complete [[type (model theory)|type]] of every tuple is axiomatized by a single formula. Such types are called '''principal types''', and the formulas that axiomatize them are called '''complete formulas'''.

==Definitions==

A complete type ''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is called '''principal''' (or '''atomic''') if it is axiomatized by a single formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

A formula φ in a complete theory ''T'' is called '''complete''' if for every other formula ψ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), the formula φ implies exactly one of ψ and ¬ψ in ''T''.&lt;ref&gt;Some authors refer to complete formulas as "atomic formulas", but this is inconsistent with the purely syntactical notion of an atom or atomic formula as a formula that does not contain a proper subformula.&lt;/ref&gt;
It follows that a complete type is principal if and only if it contains a complete formula.

A model ''M'' of the theory is called '''atomic''' if every ''n''-tuple of elements of ''M'' satisfies a complete formula.

==Examples==
*The ordered field of real algebraic numbers is the unique atomic model of the theory of [[real closed field]]s. 
*Any finite model is atomic
*A dense linear ordering without endpoints is atomic.
*Any [[prime model]] of a countable theory is atomic by the omitting types theorem. 
*Any countable atomic model is prime, but there are plenty of atomic models that are not prime, such as an uncountable dense linear order without endpoints.
*The theory of a countable number of independent unary relations is complete but has no completable formulas and no atomic models.

==Properties==
The [[back-and-forth method]] can be used to show that any two countable atomic models of a theory that are elementarily equivalent are isomorphic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6106">In mathematics, the '''Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra''', introduced by {{harvtxt|Birman|Wenzl|1989}} and {{harvtxt|Murakami|1986}}, is a two-parameter family of [[algebra (mathematics)|algebra]]s C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') of dimension 1·3·5&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) having the [[Hecke algebra of a finite group|Hecke algebra]] of the [[symmetric group]] as a quotient.  It is related to the  [[Kauffman polynomial]] of a [[link (knot theory)|link]]. It is a deformation of  the [[Brauer algebra]] in much the same way that Hecke algebras are deformations of the [[group algebra]] of the symmetric group.

==Definition==

For each natural number ''n'', the BMW algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is generated by G&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,G&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,G&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,E&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt; and relations:

:&lt;math&gt; G_iG_j=G_jG_i, \mathrm{if} \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_i G_{i+1} G_i=G_{i+1} G_i G_{i+1},&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; E_i E_{i\pm1} E_i=E_i, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_i + {G_i}^{-1}=m(1+E_i), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} G_i E_{i\pm1} = E_i G_{i\pm1} G_i = E_i E_{i\pm1},&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} E_i G_{i\pm1} ={G_i}^{-1} E_{i\pm1} {G_i}^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_{i\pm1} E_i E_{i\pm1}={G_i}^{-1} E_{i\pm1}, &lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; E_{i\pm1} E_i G_{i\pm1} =E_{i\pm1} {G_i}^{-1},  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; G_i E_i= E_i G_i = l^{-1} E_i,&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; E_i G_{i\pm1} E_i =l E_i. &lt;/math&gt;

These relations imply the further relations: &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E_i E_j=E_j E_i, \mathrm{if} \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (E_i)^2 = (m^{-1}(l+l^{-1})-1) E_i, &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {G_i}^2 = m(G_i+l^{-1}E_i)-1. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the original definition given by Birman &amp; Wenzl. However a slight change by the introduction of some minus signs is  sometimes made, in accordance with Kauffman's 'Dubrovnik' version of his link invariant. In that way, the fourth relation in Birman &amp; Wenzl's original version is changed to &lt;br&gt;
(1) (Kauffman skein relation) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_i - {G_i}^{-1}=m(1-E_i), &lt;/math&gt;

:Given invertibility of ''m'', the rest of the relations in Birman &amp; Wenzl's original version can be reduced to &lt;br&gt;
(2) (Idempotent relation) 
::&lt;math&gt; (E_i)^2 = (m^{-1}(l-l^{-1})+1) E_i, &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
(3) (Braid relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_iG_j=G_jG_i, \text{if } \left\vert i-j \right\vert \geqslant 2, \text{ and } G_i G_{i+1} G_i=G_{i+1} G_i G_{i+1}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
(4) (Tangle relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; E_i E_{i\pm1} E_i=E_i \text{ and }  G_i G_{i\pm1} E_i = E_{i\pm1} E_i,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
(5) (Delooping relations) 
::&lt;math&gt; G_i E_i= E_i G_i = l^{-1} E_i \text{ and } E_i G_{i\pm1} E_i =l E_i. &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*The dimension of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is &lt;math&gt; (2n)!/(2^nn! )&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Iwahori-Hecke algebra]] associated with the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_n,&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The [[Braid group]] embeds in the BMW algebra &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal{B}}_n \hookrightarrow {\mathcal{C}}_n  &lt;/math&gt;.

==Isomorphism between the BMW algebras and Kauffman's tangle algebras==
It is proved by {{harvtxt|Morton|Wassermann|1989}} that the BMW algebra C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is isomorphic to the Kauffman's tangle algebra KT&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\phi : C_n \to KT_n &lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:KauffmannTangleAlg 2.PNG]] and [[Image:KauffmannTangleAlg 3.PNG]]

==Baxterisation of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra==
Define the face operator as
:&lt;math&gt; U_i(u)=1- \frac{i\sin u}{\sin \lambda \sin \mu}(e^{i(u-\lambda)} G_i -e^{-i(u-\lambda)}{G_i}^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are determined by 
:&lt;math&gt; 2\cos \lambda=1+(l-l^{-1})/m&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt; 2\cos \lambda = 1+(l-l^{-1})/(\lambda \sin \mu)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then the face operator satisfies the [[Yang-Baxter equation]]. 
:&lt;math&gt; U_{i+1}(v) U_i(u+v) U_{i+1}(u) = U_i(u) U_{i+1}(u+v) U_i(v)&lt;/math&gt; 
Now &lt;math&gt; E_i=U_i(\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; with 
:&lt;math&gt; \rho(u)=\frac{\sin (\lambda-u) \sin (\mu+u)}{\sin \lambda \sin \mu} &lt;/math&gt;. 
In the [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] &lt;math&gt; u \to \pm i  \infty &lt;/math&gt;, the [[braid theory|braid]]s &lt;math&gt; {G_j}^{\pm} &lt;/math&gt; can be recovered [[up to]] a [[scale factor]].

==History==
In 1984, [[Vaughan Jones]] introduced a new polynomial invariant of link isotopy types which is called the [[Jones polynomial]]. The invariants are related to the traces of irreducible representations of [[Hecke algebra of a finite group|Hecke algebras]] associated with the [[symmetric group]]s. In 1986, {{harvtxt|Murakami|1986}} showed that the [[Kauffman polynomial]] can also be interpreted as a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on a certain associative algebra. In 1989, {{harvtxt|Birman|Wenzl|1989}} constructed a two-parameter family of algebras C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') with the Kauffman polynomial K&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') as trace after appropriate renormalization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11222">In [[probability theory]], the '''Borel–Cantelli lemma''' is a [[theorem]] about [[sequence]]s of [[event (probability theory)|events]]. In general, it is a result in [[measure theory]].  It is named after [[Émile Borel]] and [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli]], who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Borel, "Les probabilités dénombrables et leurs applications arithmetiques" ''Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo'' (2) '''27''' (1909) pp. 247–271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Cantelli, "Sulla probabilità come limite della frequenza", ''Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei'' 26:1 (1917) pp.39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related result, sometimes called the '''second Borel–Cantelli lemma''', is a partial [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma.  The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]] and the [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]].

==Statement of lemma for probability spaces==

Let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... be a sequence of events in some [[probability space]].
The Borel–Cantelli lemma states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Achim |last=Klenke |title=Probability Theory |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-1-84800-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If the sum of the probabilities of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is finite

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \Pr(E_n)&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

:then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 0, that is,

::&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, "lim&amp;nbsp;sup" denotes [[set-theoretic limit|limit supremum]] of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. That is, lim&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k \geq n}^\infty E_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are "repeated" infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. Note that no assumption of [[statistical independence|independence]] is required.

===Example===

Suppose (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence of [[random variable]]s with Pr(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) = 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for each ''n''. The probability that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 occurs for infinitely many ''n'' is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many [''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0] events. The intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. However, the sum ∑Pr(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) converges to {{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.645&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, and so the Borel–Cantelli Lemma states that the set of outcomes that are common to infinitely many such events occurs with probability zero. Hence, the probability of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 occurring for infinitely many ''n'' is&amp;nbsp;0. [[Almost surely]] (i.e., with probability 1), ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero for all but finitely many&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==Proof&lt;ref name="ttaoproof"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tao, Terence.|title=The strong law of large numbers.|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/the-strong-law-of-large-numbers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Let &lt;math&gt;[E_n]&lt;/math&gt; denote the indicator function of the event &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; (using [[Iverson bracket]] notation).  Then, by the monotone convergence theorem
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left(\sum_n [E_n]\right) = \sum_n \operatorname{E}([E_n]) = \sum_n \Pr(E_n) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
by hypothesis.  This directly implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\sum_n [E_n] = \infty \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
because otherwise
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left(\sum_n [E_n]\right) \ge \int_{\{\sum_n [E_n]=\infty\}}\left(\sum_n [E_n]\right) \, \mathrm d\mathbb \Pr=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alternative proof &lt;ref name="math.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Romik, Dan. Probability Theory Lecture Notes, Fall 2009, UC Davis.|url=http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/teaching/lectures.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614024007/http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/teaching/lectures.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

Let (''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of events in some [[probability space]] and suppose that the sum of the probabilities of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is finite. That is suppose:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \Pr(E_n)&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

As the series converges, we must have that

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = N} ^\infty \Pr(E_n) \rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as } N \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore :

:&lt;math&gt; \inf_{N\geqslant 1} \sum_{n=N}^\infty \Pr(E_n) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n\right) &amp;= \Pr(\text{infinitely many of the } E_n \text{ occur} ) \\[6pt]
&amp;= \Pr\left(\bigcap_{N=1}^\infty \bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n\right) \\
&amp;= \inf_{N \geqslant 1} \Pr\left( \bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n\right) \\
&amp;\leqslant \inf_{N\geqslant 1} \sum_{n=N}^\infty \Pr(E_n) \\
&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==General measure spaces==

For general [[measure space]]s, the Borel–Cantelli lemma takes the following form:

:Let &amp;mu; be a (positive) [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on a set ''X'', with [[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]] ''F'', and let (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence in ''F''. If

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\mu(A_n)&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

:then

::&lt;math&gt;\mu\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Converse result==

A related result, sometimes called the '''second Borel–Cantelli lemma''', is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma. The lemma states: If the events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[statistical independence|independent]] and the sum of the probabilities of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; diverges to infinity, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. That is:

:: If  &lt;math&gt;\sum^{\infty}_{n = 1} \Pr(E_n) = \infty&lt;/math&gt;  and the events &lt;math&gt;(E_n)^{\infty}_{n = 1}&lt;/math&gt;  are independent, then  &lt;math&gt;\Pr(\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} E_n) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption of independence can be weakened to [[pairwise independence]], but in that case the proof is more difficult.

===Example===
The [[infinite monkey theorem]] is a special case of this lemma.

The lemma can be applied to give a covering theorem in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Specifically {{harv|Stein|1993|loc=Lemma X.2.1}}, if ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a collection of [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] subsets of a [[compact set]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_j \mu(E_j) = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

then there is a sequence ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of translates

:&lt;math&gt;F_j = E_j + x_j &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\sup F_j = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=n}^\infty F_k = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

apart from a set of measure zero.

==Proof&lt;ref name="math.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; ==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \Pr(E_n) = \infty&lt;/math&gt;  and the events &lt;math&gt;(E_n)^\infty_{n = 1}&lt;/math&gt;  are independent. It is sufficient to show the event that the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'s did not occur for infinitely many values of ''n'' has probability&amp;nbsp;0. This is just to say that it is sufficient to show that

: &lt;math&gt; 1-\Pr(\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} E_n) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Noting that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
1 - \Pr(\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} E_n) &amp;= 1 - \Pr\left(\{E_n\text{ i.o.}\}\right) = \Pr\left(\{E_n \text{ i.o.}\}^c \right) \\
&amp; = \Pr\left(\left(\bigcap_{N=1}^\infty \bigcup_{n=N}^\infty E_n\right)^c \right) = \Pr\left(\bigcup_{N=1}^\infty \bigcap_{n=N}^\infty E_n^c \right)\\
&amp;= \Pr\left(\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty}E_n^{c}\right)= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\Pr\left(\bigcap_{n=N}^\infty E_n^c \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

it is enough to show: &lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\bigcap_{n=N}^{\infty}E_n^{c}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the &lt;math&gt;(E_n)^{\infty}_{n = 1}&lt;/math&gt; are independent:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr\left(\bigcap_{n=N}^\infty E_n^c\right) 
&amp;= \prod^\infty_{n=N} \Pr(E_n^c) \\
&amp;= \prod^\infty_{n=N} (1-\Pr(E_n)) \\
&amp;\leq\prod^\infty_{n=N} \exp(-\Pr(E_n))\\
&amp;=\exp\left(-\sum^\infty_{n=N} \Pr(E_n)\right)\\
&amp;= 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This completes the proof. Alternatively, we can see &lt;math&gt;\Pr\left(\bigcap_{n=N}^\infty E_n^c \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; by taking negative the logarithm of both sides to get:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 -\log\left(\Pr\left(\bigcap_{n=N}^{\infty}E_n^{c}\right)\right) &amp;= -\log\left(\prod^{\infty}_{n=N} (1-\Pr(E_n))\right) \\
&amp;= - \sum^\infty_{n=N}\log(1-\Pr(E_n)). 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &amp;minus;log(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''x'' for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the result similarly follows from our assumption that &lt;math&gt;\sum^\infty_{n = 1} \Pr(E_n) = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

== Counterpart ==

Another related result is the so-called '''counterpart of the Borel&amp;ndash;Cantelli lemma'''.  It is a counterpart of the
Lemma in the sense that it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the limsup to be 1 by replacing the independence assumption by the completely different assumption that &lt;math&gt;(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; is monotone increasing for sufficiently large indices.   This Lemma says:

Let &lt;math&gt;(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;A_k \subseteq A_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
and let &lt;math&gt;\bar A&lt;/math&gt; denote the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the probability of infinitely many &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; occur (that is, at least one &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; occurs) is one if and only if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers &lt;math&gt;( t_k)&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_k \Pr( A_{t_{k+1}} \mid \bar A_{t_k}) = \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

This simple result can be useful in problems such as for instance those involving hitting probabilities for [[stochastic process]] with the choice of the sequence  &lt;math&gt;(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; usually being the essence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24564">In [[mathematics]], a '''building''' (also '''Tits building''', '''Bruhat–Tits building''', named after [[François Bruhat]] and [[Jacques Tits]]) is a combinatorial and geometric structure which simultaneously  generalizes certain aspects of [[flag manifold]]s, finite [[projective plane]]s, and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s. Initially introduced by Jacques Tits as a means to understand the structure of [[group of Lie type|exceptional groups of Lie type]], the theory has also been used to study the geometry and topology of [[homogeneous space]]s of [[p-adic Lie group]]s and their discrete subgroups of symmetries, in the same way that [[tree (mathematics)|trees]] have been used to study [[free group]]s.

==Overview==
The notion of a building was invented by [[Jacques Tits]] as a means of describing [[group of Lie type|simple algebraic groups]] over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Tits demonstrated how to every such [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' one can associate a [[simplicial complex]] Δ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ(''G'') with an [[group action|action]] of ''G'', called the '''spherical building''' of ''G''. The group ''G'' imposes very strong combinatorial regularity conditions on the complexes Δ that can arise in this fashion. By treating these conditions as axioms for a class of simplicial complexes, Tits arrived at his first definition of a building. A part of the data defining a building Δ is a [[Coxeter group]] ''W'', which determines a highly symmetrical simplicial complex ''Σ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Σ''(''W'',''S''), called the ''Coxeter complex''. A building Δ is glued together from multiple copies of Σ, called its ''apartments'', in a certain regular fashion. When ''W'' is a finite Coxeter group, the Coxeter complex is a topological sphere, and the corresponding buildings are said to be of '''spherical type'''. When ''W'' is an [[affine Weyl group]], the Coxeter complex is a subdivision of the affine plane and one speaks of '''affine''', or '''Euclidean''', buildings. An affine building of type &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle\tilde{A}_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as an infinite [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] without terminal vertices.

Although the theory of semisimple algebraic groups provided the initial motivation for the notion of a building, not all buildings arise from a group. In particular, projective planes and [[generalized quadrangle]]s form two classes of graphs studied in [[incidence geometry]] which satisfy the axioms of a building, but may not be connected with any group. This phenomenon turns out to be related to the low rank of the corresponding Coxeter system (namely, two). Tits proved a remarkable theorem: all spherical buildings of rank at least three are connected with a group; moreover, if a building of rank at least two is connected with a group then the group is essentially determined by the building.

Iwahori–Matsumoto, Borel–Tits and Bruhat–Tits demonstrated that in analogy with Tits' construction of spherical buildings, affine buildings can also be constructed from certain groups, namely, reductive algebraic groups over a [[local field|local non-Archimedean field]]. Furthermore, if the split rank of the group is at least three, it is essentially determined by its building. Tits later reworked the foundational aspects of the theory of buildings using the notion of a '''chamber system''', encoding the building solely in terms of adjacency properties of simplices of maximal dimension; this leads to simplifications in both spherical and affine cases. He proved that, in analogy with the spherical case, every building of affine type and rank at least four arises from a group.

==Definition==
An ''n''-dimensional '''building''' ''X'' is an [[abstract simplicial complex]] which is a union of subcomplexes ''A'' called '''apartments''' such that

* every ''k''-simplex of ''X'' is within at least three ''n''-simplices if ''k'' &lt; ''n'';
* any (''n'' – 1 )-simplex in an apartment  ''A'' lies in exactly two ''adjacent'' ''n''-simplices of ''A'' and the [[graph theory|graph]] of adjacent ''n''-simplices is connected;
* any two simplices in ''X'' lie in some common apartment ''A'';
* if two simplices both lie in apartments ''A'' and ''A'' ', then there is a simplicial isomorphism of ''A'' onto ''A'' ' fixing the vertices of the two simplices.

An ''n''-simplex in ''A'' is called a '''chamber''' (originally ''chambre'', i.e. ''room'' in [[French language|French]]).

The '''rank''' of the  building is defined to be ''n'' + 1.

==Elementary properties==
Every apartment ''A'' in a building is a '''[[Coxeter complex]]'''. In fact, for every two ''n''-simplices intersecting in an (''n'' – 1)-simplex or ''panel'', there is a unique period two simplicial automorphism of ''A'', called a ''reflection'', carrying one ''n''-simplex onto the other and fixing their common points. These reflections generate a [[Coxeter group]] ''W'', called the [[Weyl group]] of ''A'', and the simplicial complex ''A'' corresponds to the standard geometric realization of ''W''. Standard generators of the Coxeter group are given by the reflections in the walls of a fixed chamber in ''A''. Since
the apartment ''A'' is determined up to isomorphism by the building, the same is true of any two simplices in ''X'' lying in some common apartment ''A''. When ''W'' is finite, the building is said to be '''spherical'''. When it is an [[affine Weyl group]], the building is said to be '''affine''' or '''euclidean'''.

The '''chamber system''' is given by the adjacency graph formed by the chambers; each pair of adjacent chambers can in addition be labelled by one of the standard
generators of the Coxeter group (see {{harvnb|Tits|1981}}).

Every building has a canonical [[intrinsic metric|length metric]] inherited from the geometric realisation obtained by identifying the vertices with an [[orthonormal basis]] of a [[Hilbert space]]. For affine buildings, this metric satisfies the [[CAT(k) space|CAT(0)]] comparison inequality of [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov|Alexandrov]], known in this setting as the Bruhat-Tits ''non-positive curvature condition'' for geodesic triangles: the distance from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is no greater than the distance in the corresponding Euclidean triangle with the same side-lengths (see {{harvnb|Bruhat|Tits|1972}}).

==Connection with BN pairs==
If a group ''G'' acts simplicially on a building ''X'', transitively on pairs (C,A) of chambers ''C'' and apartments ''A'' containing them, then the stabilisers of such a pair define a [[BN pair]] or [[Tits system]]. In fact the pair of subgroups

:''B'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;

satisfies the axioms of a BN pair and the Weyl group can be identified with ''N'' / ''N'' &lt;math&gt; \cap &lt;/math&gt; ''B''.
Conversely the building can be recovered from the BN pair, so that every BN pair canonically defines a building.
In fact, using the terminology of BN pairs and calling any conjugate of ''B'' a [[Borel subgroup]] and any group containing a Borel subgroup a [[parabolic subgroup]],

* the vertices of the building ''X'' correspond to maximal parabolic subgroups;
* ''k'' + 1 vertices form a ''k''-simplex whenever the intersection of the corresponding maximal parabolic subgroups is also parabolic;
* apartments are conjugates under ''G'' of the simplicial subcomplex with vertices given by conjugates under ''N'' of maximal parabolics containing ''B''.

The same building can often be described by different BN pairs. Moreover, not every building comes from a BN pair: this corresponds to the failure of classification results in low rank and dimension (see below).

==Spherical and affine buildings for SL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;==
The simplicial structure of the affine and spherical buildings associated to ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as their interconnections, are easy to explain directly using only concepts from elementary [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] (see {{harvnb|Garrett|1997}}). In this case there are three different buildings, two spherical and one affine. Each is a union of ''apartments'', themselves simplicial complexes. For the affine building, an apartment is a simplicial complex [[tessellation|tessellating]] Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; by (''n''-1)-dimensional simplices; while for a spherical building it is the finite simplicial complex formed by all ''(n-1)''! simplices with a given common vertex in the analogous tessellation in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Each building is a simplicial complex ''X'' which has to satisfy the following axioms:

:* ''X'' is a union of apartments.
:* Any two simplices in ''X'' are contained in a common apartment.
:* If a simplex is contained in two apartments, there is a simplicial isomorphism of one onto the other fixing all common points.

===Spherical building===
Let ''F'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and let ''X'' be the simplicial complex with vertices the non-trivial vector subspaces of ''V''=''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Two subspaces ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are connected if one of them is a subset of the other. The ''k''-simplices of ''X'' are formed by sets of ''k'' + 1 
mutually connected subspaces. Maximal connectivity is obtained by taking ''n'' - 1 proper non-trivial subspaces and the corresponding (''n''-1)-simplex corresponds to a ''[[Flag (linear algebra)|complete flag]]''

: (0) &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ··· &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''V''

Lower dimensional simplices correspond to partial flags with fewer intermediary subspaces ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

To define the apartments in ''X'', it is convenient to define a ''frame'' in ''V'' as a basis (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) determined up to scalar multiplication of each of its vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; in other words a frame is a set of one-dimensional subspaces ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that any ''k'' of them generate a ''k''-dimensional subspace. Now an ordered frame ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defines a complete flag via

: ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \oplus&lt;/math&gt; ···  &lt;math&gt; \oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

Since reorderings of the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s also give a frame, it is straightforward to see that the subspaces, obtained as sums of the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s,
form a simplicial complex of the type required for an apartment of a spherical building. The axioms for a building can easily be verified using the classical [[Schreier refinement theorem|Schreier refinement argument]] used to prove the uniqueness of the [[Jordan-Hölder decomposition]].

===Affine building===
Let ''K'' be a field lying between '''Q''' and its [[p-adic number|p-adic completion]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the usual [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] [[p-adic norm]] 
||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; on '''Q''' for some prime ''p''. Let ''R'' be the [[subring]] of ''K'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt; R = \{x: \| x\|_p\le 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''K'' = '''Q''', ''R'' is the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] of '''Z''' at ''p'' and, when ''K'' = '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R'' = '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[p-adic integer]]s, i.e. the closure of '''Z''' in '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The vertices of the building ''X'' are the ''R''-lattices in ''V'' = ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. ''R''-[[submodules]] of the form

:''L'' = ''R''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ···&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;  ''R''·''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

where (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a basis of ''V'' over ''K''. Two lattices are said to be ''equivalent'' if one is a scalar multiple of the other by an element of 
the multiplicative group ''K''* of ''K'' (in fact only integer powers of ''p'' need be used). Two lattice ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be ''adjacent'' if some lattice equivalent to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies between ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and its sublattice ''p''·''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: this relation is symmetric. The ''k''-simplices of ''X'' are equivalence classes of ''k'' + 1 mutually adjacent lattices, The (''n'' - 1)- simplices correspond, after relabelling, to chains

:''p''·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ··· &lt;math&gt; \subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \subset&lt;/math&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

where each successive quotient has order ''p''. Apartments are defined by fixing a basis (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''V'' and taking all lattices with basis
(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) where (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is uniquely determined up to addition
of the same integer to each entry.

By definition each apartment has the required form and their union is the whole of ''X''. The second axiom follows by a variant of the Schreier refinement argument. The last
axiom follows by a simple counting argument based on the orders of finite Abelian groups of the form

:''L'' + ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ·''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; .

A standard compactness argument shows that ''X'' is in fact independent of the choice of ''K''. In particular taking ''K'' = '''Q''', it follows that ''X'' is countable. On the other hand, taking ''K'' = '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the definition shows that ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) admits a natural simplicial action on the building.

The building comes equipped with a ''labelling'' of its vertices with values in '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z'''. Indeed, fixing a reference lattice ''L'', the label of ''M'' is given by

:label (''M'') = log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; |''M''/ ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ''L''| modulo ''n''

for ''k'' sufficiently large. The vertices of any (''n'' – 1)-simplex in ''X'' have distinct labels, running through the whole of '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z'''. Any simplicial automorphism φ of ''X'' defines a permutation π of '''Z''' / ''n'' '''Z''' such that label (φ(''M'')) = π(label (''M'')). In particular for ''g'' in  ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;),

:label (''g''·''M'') = label (''M'') + log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; || det ''g'' ||&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; modulo ''n''.

Thus ''g'' preserves labels if ''g'' lies in ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Automorphisms===
Tits proved that any label-preserving [[automorphism]] of the affine building arises from an element of  ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;). Since automorphisms of the building permute the labels, there is a natural homomorphism

:Aut ''X'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The action of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) gives rise to an [[cyclic permutation|n-cycle]] τ. Other automorphisms of the building arise from [[outer automorphism]]s of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) associated with automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]]. Taking the standard
symmetric bilinear form with orthonormal basis ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the map sending a lattice to its dual lattice gives an automorphism whose square is the identity, giving the permutation σ that sends each label to its negative modulo ''n''. The image of the above homomorphism is generated by σ and τ and is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''2n''; when ''n'' = 3, it gives the whole of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''E'' is a finite [[Galois extension]] of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and the building is constructed from ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') instead of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Galois group]] Gal (''E''/'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) will also act by automorphisms on the building.

===Geometric relations===
Spherical buildings arise in two quite different ways in connection with the affine building ''X'' for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;):
 
* The [[link (geometry)|link]] of each vertex ''L'' in the affine building corresponds to submodules of ''L''/''p''·''L'' under the finite field ''F'' = ''R''/''p''·''R'' = '''Z'''/(''p''). This is just the spherical building for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'').
* The building ''X'' can be ''[[compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]'' by adding the spherical building for ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) as boundary "at infinity" (see {{harvnb|Garrett|1997}} or {{harvnb|Brown|1989}}).

===Bruhat-Tits trees with complex multiplication===

When ''L'' is an archimedean local field then on the building for the group ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''L'') an additional structure can be imposed of a building with complex multiplication. These were first introduced by [[Martin L. Brown]]  ({{harvnb|Brown|2004}}). These buildings arise when a quadratic extension of ''L'' acts on the vector space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These building with complex multiplication can be extended to any global field. They  describe  the action of the Hecke operators on  Heegner points on the classical modular curve ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') as well as on the Drinfeld modular curve ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Drin&lt;/sup&gt;(''I''). These buildings with complex multiplication are completely classified for the case of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''L'') in {{harvnb|Brown|2004}}

==Classification==
Tits proved that all irreducible spherical buildings (i.e. with finite [[Weyl group]]) of rank greater than 2 are associated to simple algebraic or classical groups.
A similar result holds for irreducible affine buildings of dimension greater than two (their buildings "at infinity" are spherical of rank greater than two). In lower rank or dimension, there is no such classification. Indeed, each [[incidence structure]] gives a spherical building of rank 2 (see {{harvnb|Pott|1995}}); and Ballmann and Brin proved that every 2-dimensional simplicial complex in which the links of vertices are isomorphic to the [[flag complex]] of a finite projective plane has the structure of a building, not necessarily classical. Many 2-dimensional affine buildings have been constructed using hyperbolic [[reflection group]]s or other more exotic constructions connected with [[orbifold]]s.

Tits also proved that every time a building is described by a BN pair in a group, then in almost all cases the automorphisms of the building correspond to automorphisms of the group (see {{harvnb|Tits|1974}}).

==Applications==

The theory of buildings has important applications in several rather disparate fields. Besides the already mentioned connections with the structure of reductive algebraic groups over general and local fields, buildings are used to study their [[group representation|representations]]. The results of Tits on determination of a group by its building have deep connections with [[Mostow rigidity theorem|rigidity theorems]] of [[George Mostow]] and [[Grigory Margulis]], and with [[Margulis arithmeticity]].

Special types of buildings are studied in discrete mathematics, and the idea of a geometric approach to characterizing simple groups proved very fruitful in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The theory of buildings of type more general than spherical or affine is still relatively undeveloped, but these generalized buildings have already found applications to construction of [[Kac–Moody algebra|Kac–Moody groups]] in algebra, and to nonpositively curved manifolds and [[hyperbolic group]]s in topology and [[geometric group theory]].

This diagram is for coordination number six: 4 anions in the plane shown, 1 above the plane and 1 below. The stability limit is at r&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.414]]
In [[condensed matter physics]] and [[inorganic chemistry]] the '''cation-anion radius ratio''' (also: '''radius ratio rule''' &lt;ref&gt;''Radius Ratio Rule Rescue'' Anna Michmerhuizen, Karine Rose, Wentiirim Annankra, and Douglas A. Vander Griend, Journal of Chemical Education 2017 94 (10), 1480-1485 {{DOI|10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00970}} &lt;/ref&gt;)  is the ratio of the [[ionic radius]] of the cation to the [[ionic radius]] of the anion in a cation-anion [[Chemical compound|compound]]. This is simply given by &lt;math&gt;r_{C} / r_{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

According to [[Pauling's rules]] for [[crystal structure]]s, the allowed size of the cation for a given structure is determined by the critical radius ratio.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linus Pauling]] (1960) {{Google books|L-1K9HmKmUUC&amp;PA544|Nature of the Chemical Bond|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cation is too small, then it will attract the anions into each other and they will collide hence the compound will be unstable due to anion-anion repulsion; this occurs when the radius ratio drops below 0.155.

At the stability limit the cation is touching all the anions and the anions are just touching at their edges (radius ratio = 0.155). For radius ratios greater than 0.155, the compound may be [[Chemical stability|stable]].

The table below gives the relation between radius ratio and [[coordination number]], which may be obtained from a simple geometrical proof.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan J. (1994) [[Journal of Chemical Education]] 71(2): 147 {{DOI|10.1021/ed071p147}} (and Erratum 71(9): 749 {{DOI|10.1021/ed071p749}}) ''A Simple Expression between Critical Radius Ratio and Coordination Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other bases ==
The complete listing of the smallest representative prime from all known cycles of circular primes in [[duodecimal|base 12]] is (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)
:2, 3, 5, 7, Ɛ, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 15, 57, 5Ɛ, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 117, 11Ɛ, 175, 1Ɛ7, 157Ɛ, 555Ɛ, R&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, 115Ɛ77, R&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;91&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;255&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;4ᘔ5&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;5777&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;879Ɛ&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;198Ɛ1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;23175&lt;/sub&gt;, and R&lt;sub&gt;311407&lt;/sub&gt;.

where R&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a repunit prime in base 12 with ''n'' digits. There are no other circular primes in base 12 up to 12&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[binary number|base 2]], only [[Mersenne prime]]s can be circular primes, since any 0 permuted to the one's place results in an [[even number]].

==Counting sequences and isomorphism==
The ''counting sequence'' of a combinatorial class is the sequence of the numbers of elements of size ''i'' for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 1, 2, ...; it may also be described as a [[generating function]] that has these numbers as its coefficients. The counting sequences of combinatorial classes are the main subject of study of [[enumerative combinatorics]]. Two combinatorial classes are said to be isomorphic if they have the same numbers of objects of each size, or equivalently, if their counting sequences are the same.&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{citation|title=Analytic Combinatorics|first1=Philippe|last1=Flajolet|author1-link=Philippe Flajolet|first2=Robert|last2=Sedgewick|author2-link=Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781139477161|at=Definition I.3, p.19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0h-4QcA1c1QC&amp;pg=PA19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, once two combinatorial classes are known to be isomorphic, a [[bijective proof]] of this equivalence is sought; such a proof may be interpreted as showing that the objects in the two isomorphic classes are [[cryptomorphism|cryptomorphic]] to each other.

For instance, the [[Polygon triangulation|triangulation]]s of [[regular polygon]]s (with size given by the number of sides of the polygon, and a fixed choice of polygon to triangulate for each size) and the set of [[Unrooted binary tree|unrooted binary]] [[Tree_(graph_theory)#Plane_tree|plane tree]]s (up to [[graph isomorphism]], with a fixed ordering of the leaves, and with size given by the number of leaves) are both counted by the [[Catalan number]]s, so they form isomorphic combinatorial classes. A bijective isomorphism in this case is given by [[Dual graph|planar graph duality]]: a triangulation can be transformed bijectively into a tree with a leaf for each polygon edge, an internal node for each triangle, and an edge for each two polygon edges or triangles that are adjacent to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Triangulations: Structures for Algorithms and Applications|volume=25|series=Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics|first1=Jesús A.|last1=De Loera|author1-link=Jesús A. De Loera|first2=Jörg|last2=Rambau|first3=Francisco|last3=Santos|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9783642129711|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxY1Xrr12DwC&amp;pg=PA4|at=Theorem 1.1.3, pp. 4–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic combinatorics==
The theory of [[combinatorial species]] and its extension to [[analytic combinatorics]] provide a language for describing many important combinatorial classes, constructing new classes from combinations of previously defined ones, and automatically deriving their counting sequences.&lt;ref name="ac"/&gt; For example, two combinatorial classes may be combined by [[disjoint union]], or by a [[Cartesian product]] construction in which the objects are ordered pairs of one object from each of two classes, and the size function is the sum of the sizes of each object in the pair. These operations respectively form the addition and multiplication operations of a [[semiring]] on the family of (isomorphism equivalence classes of) combinatorial classes, in which the zero object is the empty combinatorial class, and the unit is the class whose only object is the [[empty set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Cryptanalysis|first=Gregory V.|last=Bard|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387887579|at=Section 4.2.1, "Combinatorial Classes", ff., pp. 30–34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjbp0mgu3IAC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permutation patterns==
In the study of [[permutation pattern]]s, a combinatorial class of [[permutation class]]es, enumerated by permutation length, is called a [[Wilf class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2627">In [[mathematics]], '''conical functions''' or '''Mehler functions''' are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] which can be expressed in terms of [[Legendre function]]s of the first and second kind,
&lt;math&gt;P^\mu_{-(1/2)+i\lambda}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q^\mu_{-(1/2)+i\lambda}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The functions &lt;math&gt;P^\mu_{-(1/2)+i\lambda}(x)&lt;/math&gt; were introduced by [[Gustav Ferdinand Mehler]], in 1868, when expanding in series the distance of a point on the axis of a cone to a point located on the surface of the cone. Mehler used the notation &lt;math&gt;K^\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; to represent these functions. He obtained integral representation and series of functions representations for them. He also established an addition theorem
for the conical functions. [[Carl Neumann]] obtained an expansion of the functions &lt;math&gt;K^\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; in terms
of the [[Legendre polynomials]] in 1881. Leonhardt introduced for the conical functions the equivalent of the [[spherical harmonics]] in 1882.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1139">The '''Data Authentication Algorithm''' ('''DAA''') is a former [[Federal Information Processing Standard|U.S. government standard]] for producing cryptographic [[message authentication code]]s. DAA is defined in FIPS PUB 113,&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips113/fips113.html FIPS PUB 113 - Computer Data Authentication] - the [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] publication that defines the Data Authentication Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt; which was withdrawn on September 1, 2008. The algorithm is not considered secure by today's standards.

According to the standard, a code produced by the DAA is called a '''Data Authentication Code''' ('''DAC''').  The algorithm [[Block cipher modes of operation#Cipher-block chaining (CBC)|chain encrypts]] the data, with the last cipher block truncated and used as the DAC.

The DAA is equivalent to [[ISO/IEC 9797-1]] MAC algorithm 1, or [[CBC-MAC]], with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] as the underlying cipher, truncated to between 24 and 56 bits (inclusive).

[[File:Dedekind-Macneille completion.svg|thumb|240px|The [[Hasse diagram]] of a partially ordered set (left) and its Dedekind–MacNeille completion (right).]]
In [[order theory|order-theoretic mathematics]], the '''Dedekind–MacNeille completion''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (also called the '''completion by cuts''' or '''normal completion''')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey| Priestley|2002|p=166}}; {{harvtxt|Siegfried|Schröder|2003|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the smallest [[complete lattice]] that contains the given partial order. It is named after [[Holbrook Mann MacNeille]] whose 1937 paper first defined and constructed it, and after [[Richard Dedekind]] because its construction generalizes the [[Dedekind cut]]s used by Dedekind to construct the [[real number]]s from the [[rational number]]s.

==Order embeddings and lattice completions==
A [[partially ordered set]] consists of a set of elements together with a [[binary relation]] {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} on pairs of elements that is reflexive ({{math|''x'' ≤ ''x''}} for every ''x''), transitive (if {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{math|''y'' ≤ ''z''}} then {{math|''x'' ≤ ''z''}}), and antisymmetric (if both {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{math|''y'' ≤ ''x''}} hold, then {{math|1=''x'' = ''y''}}). The usual numeric orderings on the integers or real numbers satisfy these properties; however, unlike the orderings on the numbers, a partial order may have two elements that are ''incomparable'': neither {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} nor {{math|''y'' ≤ ''x''}} holds. Another familiar example of a partial ordering is the inclusion ordering ⊆ on pairs of sets.

If {{mvar|S}} is a partially ordered set, a ''completion'' of {{mvar|S}} means a [[complete lattice]] {{mvar|L}} with an [[order-embedding]] of {{mvar|S}} into {{mvar|L}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Siegfried|Schröder|2003}}, definition 5.3.1, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a complete lattice means that every subset of elements of {{mvar|L}} has [[infimum and supremum]]; this generalizes the analogous properties of the [[real number]]s. The notion of an order-embedding enforces the requirements that distinct elements of {{mvar|S}} must be mapped to distinct elements of {{mvar|L}}, and that each pair of elements in {{mvar|S}} has the same ordering in {{mvar|L}} as they do in {{mvar|S}}. The [[extended real number line]] (real numbers together with +∞ and &amp;minus;∞) is a completion in this sense of the rational numbers: the set of rational numbers {3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, 3.14159, ...} does not have a rational least upper bound, but in the real numbers it has the least upper bound {{pi}}.

A given partially ordered set may have several different completions. For instance, one completion of any partially ordered set {{mvar|S}} is the set of its [[lower set|downwardly closed subsets]] ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]. {{mvar|S}} is embedded in this (complete) lattice by mapping each element {{mvar|x}} to the lower set of elements that are less than or equal to {{mvar|x}}. The result is a [[distributive lattice]] and is used in [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]]. However, it may have many more elements than are needed to form a completion of {{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Concept data analysis: theory and applications|first1=Claudio|last1=Carpineto|first2=Giovanni|last2=Romano|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0-470-85055-8|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all possible lattice completions, the Dedekind–MacNeille completion is the smallest complete lattice with {{mvar|S}} embedded in it.&lt;ref name="smallest-completion"/&gt;

==Definition==
For each subset {{mvar|A}} of a partially ordered set {{mvar|S}}, let {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the set of upper bounds of {{mvar|A}}; that is, an element {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|S}} belongs to {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} whenever {{mvar|x}} is greater than or equal to every element in {{mvar|A}}. Symmetrically, let {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the set of lower bounds of {{mvar|A}}, the elements that are less than or equal to every element in {{mvar|A}}. Then the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of {{mvar|S}} consists of all subsets {{mvar|A}} for which 
:{{math|1=(''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''}};
it is ordered by inclusion: {{math|''A'' ≤ ''B''}} in the completion if and only if {{math|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} as sets.

An element {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|S}} embeds into the completion as its [[Ideal (order theory)|principal ideal]], the set {{math|↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of elements less than or equal to {{mvar|x}}. Then {{math|(↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the set of elements greater than or equal to {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|1=((↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; = ↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, showing that {{math|↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is indeed a member of the completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|MacNeille|1937}}, Lemma 11.8, p.&amp;nbsp; 444; {{harvtxt|Davey| Priestley|2002}}, Lemma 3.9(i), p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; It is straightforward to verify that the mapping from {{mvar|x}} to {{math|↓&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an order-embedding.

An alternative definition of the Dedekind–MacNeille completion that more closely resembles the definition of a Dedekind cut is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;This is the definition originally used by {{harvtxt|MacNeille|1937}}, for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; In a partially ordered set {{mvar|S}}, define a ''cut'' to be a pair of sets {{math|(''A'',''B'')}} for which {{math|1=''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''}} and {{math|1=''A'' = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If {{math|(''A'',''B'')}} is a cut then ''A'' satisfies the equation {{math|1=(''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''}}, and conversely if {{math|1=(''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''}} then {{math|(''A'',''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a cut. Therefore, the set of cuts, partially ordered by inclusion on the lower set of the cut (or the reverse of the inclusion relation on the upper set), gives an equivalent definition of the Dedekind–MacNeille completion.

With the alternative definition, both the join and the meet operations of the complete lattice have symmetric descriptions: if {{math|(''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} are the cuts in any family of cuts, then the meet of these cuts is the cut {{math|(''L'',''L''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)}} where {{math|1=''L'' = ∩&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and the join is the cut {{math|(''U''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;,''U'')}} where {{math|1=''U'' = ∩&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

==Examples==
If '''Q''' is the set of [[rational number]]s, viewed as a totally ordered set with the usual numerical order, then each element of the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of '''Q''' may be viewed as a [[Dedekind cut]], and the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of '''Q''' is the total ordering on the [[real number]]s, together with the two additional values ±∞.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey| Priestley|2002}}, Example 7.44(1), p.&amp;nbsp;168; {{harvtxt|Siegfried|Schröder|2003}}, Example 5.3.3(2), p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the real numbers from the rational numbers is an example of the Dedekind completion of a [[totally ordered set]], and the Dedekind–MacNeille completion generalizes this concept from total orders to partial orders.

If {{mvar|S}} is an [[antichain]] (a set of elements no two of which are comparable) then the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of {{mvar|S}} consists of {{mvar|S}} itself together with two additional elements, a bottom element that is below every element in {{mvar|S}} and a top element that is above every element in {{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey| Priestley|2002}}, Example 7.44(2), p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{mvar|O}} is any finite set of objects, and {{mvar|A}} is any finite set of unary attributes for the objects in {{mvar|O}}, then one may form a partial order of height two in which the elements of the partial order are the objects and attributes, and in which {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} when {{mvar|x}} is an object that has attribute&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. For a partial order defined in this way, the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of {{mvar|S}} is known as a [[concept lattice]], and it plays a central role in the field of [[formal concept analysis]].

==Properties==
The Dedekind–MacNeille completion is the smallest complete lattice with {{mvar|S}} embedded in it, in the sense that, if {{mvar|L}} is any lattice completion of {{mvar|S}}, then the Dedekind–MacNeille completion is a partially ordered subset of {{mvar|L}}.&lt;ref name="smallest-completion"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1978}}; {{harvtxt|Siegfried|Schröder|2003}}, Theorem 5.3.8, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; When {{mvar|S}} is finite, its completion is also finite, and has the smallest number of elements among all finite complete lattices containing {{mvar|S}}.

The partially ordered set {{mvar|S}} is join-dense and meet-dense in the Dedekind–MacNeille completion; that is, every element of the completion is a join of some set of elements of {{mvar|S}}, and is also the meet of some set of elements in {{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Siegfried|Schröder|2003}}, Proposition 5.3.7, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dedekind–MacNeille completion is characterized among completions of {{mvar|S}} by this property.

The Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a [[complete Boolean algebra]]; this result is known as the '''Glivenko–Stone theorem''', after [[Valery Ivanovich Glivenko]] and [[Marshall Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1995}}, Theorem 27, p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a [[residuated lattice]] is a complete residuated lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gabbay|Shehtman|Skvortsov|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the completion of a [[distributive lattice]] need not itself be distributive, and the completion of a [[modular lattice]] may not remain modular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cotlar|1944}}; {{harvtxt|Funayama|1944}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dedekind–MacNeille completion is self-dual: the completion of the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of a partial order is the same as the dual of the completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dedekind–MacNeille completion of {{mvar|S}} has the same [[order dimension]] as does {{mvar|S}} itself.&lt;ref&gt;This result is frequently attributed to an unpublished 1961 Harvard University honors thesis by K. A. Baker, "Dimension, join-independence and breadth in partially ordered sets". It was published by {{harvtxt|Novák|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of partially ordered sets and monotonic functions between partially ordered sets, the complete lattices form the [[injective object]]s for [[order-embedding]]s, and the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of {{mvar|S}} is the injective hull of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|Bruns|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
Several researchers have investigated algorithms for constructing the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a finite partially ordered set. Because the Dedekind–MacNeille completion may be exponentially larger than the partial order it comes from,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ganter|Kuznetsov|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to measure the time bounds for such algorithms both in terms of the number {{mvar|n}} of elements of the input partial order, but also in terms of the number {{mvar|c}} of elements of its completion, and sometimes also in terms of additional measures of the complexity of the input and output. The format in which the output lattice is represented may also affect the running time of its construction algorithms; for instance, if it is represented as a [[logical matrix]] specifying the result of a comparison between each pair of lattice elements, the output size is {{math|&amp;Theta;(''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and this will be a lower bound on the time for a construction algorithm.

===Constructing the set of cuts===
{{harvtxt|Ganter|Kuznetsov|1998}} describe an incremental algorithm, in which the input partial order is built up by adding one element at a time; at each step, the completion of the smaller partial order is expanded to form the completion of the larger partial order. In their method, the completion is represented by an explicit list of cuts. Each cut of the augmented partial order, except for the one whose two sets intersect in the new element, is either a cut from the previous partial order or is formed by adding the new element to one or the other side of a cut from the previous partial order, so their algorithm need only test pairs of sets of this form to determine which ones are cuts. The time for using their method to add a single element to the completion of a partial order is {{math|''O''(''cnw'')}} where {{mvar|w}} is the width of the partial order, that is, the size of its largest [[antichain]]. Therefore, the time to compute the completion of a given partial order is {{math|1=''O''(''cn''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''w'') = O(''cn''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

As {{harvtxt|Jourdan|Rampon|Jard|1994}} observe, the problem of listing all cuts in a partially ordered set can be formulated as a special case of a simpler problem, of listing all maximal [[antichain]]s in a different partially ordered set. If {{mvar|P}} is any partially ordered set, let {{mvar|Q}} be a partial order whose elements contain two copies of {{mvar|P}}: for each element {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}} contains two elements {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, with {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if and only if {{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}} and {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}}. Then the cuts in {{mvar|P}} correspond one-for-one with the maximal antichains in {{mvar|Q}}: the elements in the lower set of a cut correspond to the elements with subscript 0 in an antichain, and the elements in the upper set of a cut correspond to the elements with subscript 1 in an antichain. Jourdan et al. describe an algorithm for finding maximal antichains that, when applied to the problem of listing all cuts in {{mvar|P}}, takes time {{math|1=''O''(''c''(''nw'' + ''w''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;))}}, an improvement on the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Ganter|Kuznetsov|1998}} when the width {{mvar|w}} is small. Alternatively, a maximal antichain in {{mvar|Q}} is the same as a [[maximal independent set]] in the [[comparability graph]] of {{mvar|Q}}, or a [[maximal clique]] in the complement of the comparability graph, so algorithms for the [[clique problem]] or the independent set problem can also be applied to this version of the Dedekind–MacNeille completion problem.

===Constructing the covering graph===
The [[transitive reduction]] or covering graph of the Dedekind–MacNeille completion describes the order relation between its elements in a concise way:
each [[neighborhood (graph theory)|neighbor]] of a cut must remove an element of the original partial order from either the upper or lower set of the cut, so each vertex has at most {{mvar|n}} neighbors. Thus, the covering graph has {{mvar|c}} vertices and at most {{mvar|''cn''/2}} neighbors, a number that may be much smaller than the {{mvar|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} entries in a matrix that specifies all pairwise comparisons between elements. {{harvtxt|Nourine|Raynoud}} show how to compute this covering graph efficiently; more generally, if {{mvar|B}} is any family of sets, they show how to compute the covering graph of the lattice of unions of subsets of {{mvar|B}}. In the case of the Dedekind–MacNeille lattice, {{mvar|B}} may be taken as the family of [[complement set]]s of principal ideals, and the unions of subsets of {{mvar|B}} are complements of the lower sets of cuts. The main idea for their algorithm is to generate unions of subsets of {{mvar|B}} incrementally (for each set in {{mvar|B}}, forming its union with all previously generated unions), represent the resulting family of sets in a [[trie]], and use the trie representation to test certain candidate pairs of sets for adjacency in the covering relation; it takes time {{math|''O''(''cn''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. In later work, the same authors showed that the algorithm could be made fully incremental (capable of adding elements to the partial order one at a time) with the same total time bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nourine|Raynaud|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congruent non-congruent triangles.svg|thumb|370px|[[Congruence (geometry)|Congruence]] is an example of an equivalence relation. The leftmost two triangles are congruent, while the third and fourth triangles are not congruent to any other triangle shown here. Thus, the first two triangles are in the same equivalence class, while the third and fourth triangles are each in their own equivalence class.]]

In mathematics, when the elements of some [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an [[equivalence relation]]) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set {{math|''S''}} into '''equivalence classes'''. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} belong to the same '''equivalence class''' if and only if {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are equivalent.

Formally, given a set {{math|''S''}} and an equivalence relation {{math|~}} on {{math|''S''}}, the ''equivalence class'' of an element {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''S''}} is the set

:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \in S \mid x \sim a \}&lt;/math&gt;

of elements which are equivalent to {{math|''a''}}. It may be proven from the defining properties of "equivalence relations" that the equivalence classes form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of {{math|''S''}}. This partition – the set of equivalence classes – is sometimes called the '''quotient set''' or the '''quotient space''' of {{math|''S''}} by {{math|~}} and is denoted by {{math|''S'' / ~}}.

When the set {{math|''S''}} has some structure (such as a [[group (mathematics)|group operation]] or a [[topological space|topology]]) and the equivalence relation {{math|~}} is defined in a manner suitably compatible with this structure, then the quotient set often inherits a similar structure from its parent set. Examples include [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient spaces in linear algebra]], [[quotient space (topology)|quotient spaces in topology]], [[quotient group]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, [[quotient ring]]s, [[quotient monoid]]s, and [[quotient category|quotient categories]].

==Examples==
* If {{mvar|X}} is the set of all cars, and {{math|~}} is the [[equivalence relation]] "has the same color as", then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars. {{math|''X''/~}} could be naturally identified with the set of all car colors.
* Let {{mvar|X}} be the set of all rectangles in a plane, and {{math|~}} the equivalence relation "has the same area as". For each positive real number ''A'' there will be an equivalence class of all the rectangles that have area ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1989|loc=p. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider the [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2 equivalence relation on the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of [[integer]]s: {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if their difference {{math|''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''}} is an [[even number]]. This relation gives rise to exactly two equivalence classes: one class consisting of all even numbers, and the other consisting of all odd numbers. Under this relation {{math|[7]}}, {{math|[9]}}, and {{math|[1]}} all represent the same element of {{math|'''Z'''/~}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let {{mvar|X}} be the set of ordered pairs of integers {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} with {{mvar|b}} not zero, and define an equivalence relation {{math|~}} on {{mvar|X}} according to which {{math|(''a'',''b'') ~ (''c'',''d'')}} if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. Then the equivalence class of the pair {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} can be identified with the [[rational number]] {{math|''a''/''b''}}, and this equivalence relation and its equivalence classes can be used to give a formal definition of the set of rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same construction can be generalized to the [[field of fractions]] of any [[integral domain]].
* If {{mvar|X}} consists of all the lines in, say the [[Euclidean plane]], and ''L'' ~ ''M'' means that ''L'' and ''M'' are [[parallel lines]], then the set of lines that are parallel to each other form an equivalence class as long as a [[parallel (geometry)#Reflexive variant|line is considered parallel to itself]]. In this situation, each equivalence class determines a [[point at infinity]].

==Notation and formal definition&lt;!--linked from 'Bracket'--&gt;==
An [[equivalence relation]] is a [[binary relation]] {{math|~}} satisfying three properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For every element {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|X}}, {{math|''a'' ~ ''a''}} ([[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]),
*For every two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}}, then {{math|''b'' ~ ''a''}} ([[Symmetric relation|symmetry]]),
*For every three elements {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}} and {{math|''b'' ~ ''c''}}, then {{math|''a'' ~ ''c''}} ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).

The equivalence class of an element {{mvar|a}} is denoted {{math|[''a'']}} and is defined as the set

:&lt;math&gt;[a] = \{ x \in X \mid a \sim x \}&lt;/math&gt;

of elements that are related to {{mvar|a}} by&amp;nbsp;{{math|~}}. An alternative notation {{math|[''a'']&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be used to denote the equivalence class of the element {{mvar|a}}, specifically with respect to the equivalence relation {{mvar|R}}. This is said to be the {{mvar|R}}-equivalence class of {{mvar|a}}.

The set of all equivalence classes in {{mvar|X}} with respect to an equivalence relation {{math|''R''}} is denoted as {{math|''X''/''R''}} and called {{mvar|X}} '''modulo''' {{mvar|R}} (or the '''quotient set''' of {{mvar|X}} by {{math|''R''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[surjective map]] &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto [x]&lt;/math&gt; from {{mvar|X}} onto {{math|''X''/''R''}}, which maps each element to its equivalence class, is called the '''canonical surjection''' or the '''canonical projection map'''.

When an element is chosen (often implicitly) in each equivalence class, this defines an [[injective map]] called a ''[[section (category theory)|section]]''. If this section is denoted by {{math|''s''}}, one has {{math|1= [''s''(''c'')] = ''c''}} for every equivalence class {{math|''c''}}. The element {{math|''s''(''c'')}} is called a '''representative''' of {{math|''c''}}. Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.

Sometimes, there is a section that is more "natural" than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called ''[[Canonical form|canonical]] representatives''. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by {{math|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if {{math|''a'' − ''b''}} is a multiple of a given integer {{math| ''n''}}, called the ''modulus''. Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than {{math|''n''}}, and these integers are the canonical representatives. The class and its representative are more or less identified, as is witnessed by the fact that the notation {{math| ''a'' mod ''n''}} may denote either the class or its canonical representative (which is the [[remainder]] of the [[Euclidean division|division]] of {{math| ''a''}} by {{math|''n''}}).

==Properties==
Every element {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|X}} is a member of the equivalence class {{math|[''x'']}}. Every two equivalence classes {{math|[''x'']}} and {{math|[''y'']}} are either equal or [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of {{mvar|X}} forms a [[partition of a set|partition]] of {{mvar|X}}: every element of {{mvar|X}} belongs to one and only one equivalence class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=p. 74, Thm. 2.5.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely every partition of {{mvar|X}} comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} belong to the same set of the partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avelsgaard|1989|loc=p. 132, Thm. 3.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that
:: {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}} if and only if {{math|1=[''x''] = [''y'']}}.

In other words, if {{math|~}} is an equivalence relation on a set {{math|''X''}}, and {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are two elements of {{mvar|X}}, then these statements are equivalent:

* &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;[x] = [y]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;[x] \cap [y] \ne \emptyset.&lt;/math&gt;

==Graphical representation==
[[File:Equivalentie.svg|thumb|160px|Graph of an example equivalence with 7 classes]]
An [[undirected graph]] may be associated to any [[symmetric relation]] on a set {{math|''X''}}, where the vertices are the elements of {{math|''X''}}, and two vertices {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} are joined if and only if {{math|''s'' ~ ''t''}}. Among these graphs are the graphs of equivalence relations; they are characterized as the graphs such that the [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] are [[glossary of graph theory|cliques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariants==
If {{math|~}} is an equivalence relation on {{mvar|X}}, and {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is a property of elements of {{mvar|X}} such that whenever {{math|''x'' ~ ''y''}}, {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is true if {{math|''P''(''y'')}} is true, then the property {{mvar|P}} is said to be an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] of {{math|~}}, or [[well-defined]] under the relation {{math|~}}.

A frequent particular case occurs when {{mvar|f}} is a function from {{mvar|X}} to another set {{mvar|Y}}; if  {{math|1=''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} whenever {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then {{mvar|f}} is said to be ''class invariant under'' {{math|~}}, or simply ''invariant under'' {{math|~}}. This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use "compatible with {{math|~}}" or just "respects {{math|~}}" instead of "invariant under {{math|~}}".

Any [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} itself defines an equivalence relation on {{mvar|X}} according to which {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} if and only if {{math|1=''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. The equivalence class of {{mvar|x}} is the set of all elements in {{mvar|X}} which get mapped to {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, i.e. the class {{math|[''x'']}} is the [[inverse image]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This equivalence relation is known as the [[kernel of a function|kernel]] of {{mvar|f}}.

More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation {{math|~&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{mvar|X}}) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation {{math|~&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{mvar|Y}}). Such a function is a [[morphism]] of sets equipped with an equivalence relation.

==Quotient space in topology==

In [[topology]], a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] is a [[topological space]] formed on the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a topological space using the original space's topology to create the topology on the set of equivalence classes.

In [[abstract algebra]], [[congruence relation]]s on the underlying set of an algebra allow the algebra to induce an algebra on the equivalence classes of the relation, called a [[quotient algebra]]. In [[linear algebra]], a [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] is a vector space formed by taking a [[quotient group]] where the quotient homomorphism is a [[linear map]]. By extension, in abstract algebra, the term quotient space may be used for [[quotient module]]s, [[quotient ring]]s, [[quotient group]]s, or any [[quotient algebra]]. However, the use of the term for the more general cases can as often be by analogy with the orbits of a group action.

The orbits of a [[group action]] on a set may be called the quotient space of the action on the set, particularly when the orbits of the group action are the right [[coset]]s of a subgroup of a group, which arise from the action of the subgroup on the group by left translations, or respectively the left cosets as orbits under right translation.

A normal subgroup of a topological group, acting on the group by translation action, is a quotient space in the senses of topology, abstract algebra, and group actions simultaneously.

Although the term can be used for any equivalence relation's set of equivalence classes, possibly with further structure, the intent of using the term is generally to compare that type of equivalence relation on a set {{math|''X''}} either to an equivalence relation that induces some structure on the set of equivalence classes from a structure of the same kind on {{math|''X''}}, or to the orbits of a group action. Both the sense of a structure preserved by an equivalence relation and the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] under group actions lead to the definition of [[#Invariants|invariants]] of equivalence relations given above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17557">In [[mathematics]], the '''Euler–Maclaurin formula''' provides a powerful connection between [[integral]]s and sums.  It can be used to approximate integrals by finite sums, or conversely to evaluate finite sums and [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] using integrals and the machinery of calculus. For example, many asymptotic expansions are derived from the formula, and [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers is an immediate consequence.

The formula was discovered independently by [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Colin Maclaurin]] around 1735 (and later generalized as [[Darboux's formula]]).  Euler needed it to compute slowly converging infinite series while Maclaurin used it to calculate integrals.

==The formula==
If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[natural number]]s and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a complex or real valued [[continuous function]] for [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[m,n],&lt;/math&gt; then the integral

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_m^n f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

can be approximated by the sum (or vice versa)

:&lt;math&gt;S = f(m + 1) + \cdots + f(n - 1) + f(n)&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[Riemann sum#Right Riemann sum|rectangle method]]). The Euler–Maclaurin formula provides expressions for the difference between the sum and the integral in terms of the higher derivatives &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at the end points of the interval, that is to say when &lt;math&gt;x=m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=n.&lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; a positive integer and a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; that is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; times continuously differentiable in the interval &lt;math&gt;[m, n],&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt; S - I = \sum_{k=1}^p {\frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k - 1)}(n) - f^{(k - 1)}(m))} + R_p&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th [[Bernoulli numbers|Bernoulli number]] (with &lt;math&gt;B_1=1/2&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; is an [[numerical integration|error term]] which is normally small for suitable values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and depends on &lt;math&gt;n, m, p,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is often written with the subscript taking only even values, since the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero except for &lt;math&gt;B_1,&lt;/math&gt; in which case we have&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DLMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlmf.nist.gov/2.10|title=Digital Library of Mathematical Functions: Sums and Sequences|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=m}^n f(i) =
    \int^n_m f(x)\,dx + \frac{f(n) + f(m)}{2} +
    \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor p/2\rfloor} \frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(n) - f^{(2k - 1)}(m)) + R_p
&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=m+1}^n f(i) =
    \int^n_m f(x)\,dx + \frac{f(n) - f(m)}{2} +
    \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor p/2\rfloor} \frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(n) - f^{(2k - 1)}(m)) + R_p.
&lt;/math&gt;

The first few Bernoulli numbers of even index are:
:&lt;math&gt;B_{2}={\frac {1}{6}},\quad B_{4}=-{\frac {1}{30}},\quad B_{6}={\frac {1}{42}},\quad B_{8}=-{\frac {1}{30}}.&lt;/math&gt;
We may write the Euler-Maclaurin formula then as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum _{i=m}^n f(i)-\int _m^n f(x)~{\rm d}x=\frac {f(m)+f(n)}2+\frac 16\frac {f'(n)-f'(m)}{2!}-\frac 1{30}\frac {f'''(n)-f'''(m)}{4!}+\cdots +B_{2k}\frac {f^{(2k-1)}(n)-f^{(2k-1)}(m)}{(2k)!}+R_{2k}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The Bernoulli polynomials and periodic function===
The formula is derived below using repeated integration by parts applied to successive intervals &lt;math&gt;[r, r+1]&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;r=m, m+1, \cdots, n-1.&lt;/math&gt;  The derivation uses the periodic Bernoulli functions, &lt;math&gt;P_k(x),&lt;/math&gt; which are defined in terms of the [[Bernoulli polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;B_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2 \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The Bernoulli polynomials may be defined recursively by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_0(x) &amp;= 1 \\
  B_k'(x) &amp;= kB_{k - 1}(x) \text{ and } \int_0^1 B_k(x)\,dx = 0\text{ for }k \ge 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the periodic Bernoulli functions are defined as

:&lt;math&gt; P_k(x) = B_k \left(x - \lfloor x\rfloor\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the largest integer that is not greater than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x - \lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; always lies in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1).&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;B_k(1) = B_k(0)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k \neq 1&lt;/math&gt; so that except for &lt;math&gt;P_1(x),&lt;/math&gt; all the periodic Bernoulli functions are continuous.  The functions &lt;math&gt;P_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes written as &lt;math&gt;\tilde{B}_k(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===The remainder term===

The remainder term &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; R_p = (-1)^{p+1}\int_m^n f^{(p)}(x) {P_{p}(x) \over p!}\,dx. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| B_k (x) \right| \le \frac{2 \cdot k!}{(2\pi)^k}\zeta(k)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;  denotes the [[Riemann zeta function]]; one approach to prove this inequality is to obtain the Fourier series for the polynomials &lt;math&gt;B_k(x).&lt;/math&gt;   The bound is achieved for even &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is zero.  The term &lt;math&gt;\zeta(k)&lt;/math&gt; may be omitted for odd &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; but the proof in this case is more complex (see Lehmer).&lt;ref name="Lehmer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehmer|first1=D. H. |title=On the maxima and minima of Bernoulli polynomials | date=1940 | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=47|issue=8|pages=533–538 |doi=10.2307/2303833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this inequality, the size of the remainder term can be estimated using

:&lt;math&gt;\left|R_p\right|\leq\frac{2 \zeta (p)}{(2\pi)^{p}}\int_m^n\left|f^{(p)}(x)\right|\ \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

===Applicable formula===
We can use the formula as a means of approximating a finite integral, with the following simple formula:&lt;ref name="Devries"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devries |first1=Paul L. |last2=Hasbrun |first2=Javier E. |title=A first course in computational physics. |edition=2nd |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2011 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I &amp; = \int_{x_0}^{x_N} f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \\[6pt]
&amp; = h\left(\frac{f_{0}}{2} + f_1 +f_2+\cdots+f_{N-1} + \frac{f_{N}}{2} \right) + \frac{h^2}{12}[f'_0 - f'_N] - \frac{h^4}{720}[f'''_0 - f'''_N]+ \cdots,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of points in the interval of integration from &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x_N &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between points so that &lt;math&gt; h=(x_N - x_0)/N.&lt;/math&gt;  Note the series above is usually not convergent;  indeed, often the terms will increase rapidly after a number of iterations.  Thus, attention generally needs to be paid to the remainder term.
 
This may be viewed as an extension of the [[trapezoid rule]] by the inclusion of correction terms.&lt;ref name="Devries"/&gt;

==Applications==

===The Basel problem===
The [[Basel problem]] asks to determine the sum

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac14 + \frac19 + \frac1{16} + \frac1{25} + \cdots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Euler computed this sum to 20 decimal places with only a few terms of the Euler–Maclaurin formula in 1735. This probably convinced him that the sum equals &lt;math&gt;\pi^2/6,&lt;/math&gt; which he proved in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelley, David J. [http://www.math.nmsu.edu/~davidp/euler2k2.pdf "Dances between continuous and discrete: Euler's summation formula"], in: Robert Bradley and Ed Sandifer (Eds), ''Proceedings, Euler 2K+2 Conference (Rumford, Maine, 2002)'', [[Euler Society]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parseval's identity]] for the [[Fourier series]] of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; gives the same result.

===Sums involving a polynomial===
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polynomial]] and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is big enough, then the remainder term vanishes.  For instance, if &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^3,&lt;/math&gt; we can choose &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt; to obtain after simplification

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[Faulhaber's formula]]).

===Numerical integration===
The Euler–Maclaurin formula is also used for detailed [[error analysis (mathematics)|error analysis]] in [[numerical quadrature]]. It explains the superior performance of the [[trapezoidal rule]] on smooth [[periodic function]]s and is used in certain [[Series acceleration|extrapolation methods]]. [[Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature]] is essentially a change of variables to cast an arbitrary integral in terms of integrals of periodic functions where the Euler–Maclaurin approach is very accurate (in that particular case the Euler–Maclaurin formula takes the form of a [[discrete cosine transform]]). This technique is known as a periodizing transformation.

===Asymptotic expansion of sums===
In the context of computing [[asymptotic expansion]]s of sums and [[Series (mathematics)|series]], usually the most useful form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=a}^b f(n) \sim \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \frac{f(b) + f(a)}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \,\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(b) - f^{(2k - 1)}(a))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972}}, 23.1.30&lt;/ref&gt; Often the expansion remains valid even after taking the limits &lt;math&gt;a\rightarrow-\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\rightarrow +\infty&lt;/math&gt; or both.  In many cases the integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated in [[Differential Galois theory|closed form]] in terms of [[elementary function]]s even though the sum on the left-hand side cannot. Then all the terms in the asymptotic series can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(z + k)^2} \sim \underbrace{\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{(z + k)^2}\,dk}_{= 1/z} + \frac{1}{2z^2} + \sum_{t = 1}^\infty \frac{B_{2t}}{z^{2t + 1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the left-hand side is equal to &lt;math&gt;\psi^{(1)}(z),&lt;/math&gt; namely the first-order [[Polygamma function#Series representation|polygamma function]] defined through &lt;math&gt;\psi^{(1)}(z) = D^2( \log \Gamma(z) ); &lt;/math&gt; the [[gamma function]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) &lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;(z-1)! &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;z &lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive integer]]. This results in an asymptotic expansion for &lt;math&gt;\psi^{(1)}(z). &lt;/math&gt;  That expansion, in turn, serves as the starting point for one of the derivations of precise error estimates for [[Stirling's approximation]] of the [[factorial]] function.

===Examples===
If {{mvar|s}} is an integer greater than 1 we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^s} \approx \frac 1{s-1}+\frac 12-\frac 1{(s-1)n^{s-1}}+\frac 1{2n^s}+\sum_{i=1}\frac{B_{2i}}{(2i)!}\left[\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!}-\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!n^{s+2i-1}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Collecting the constants into a value of the [[Riemann zeta function]], we can write an asymptotic expansion:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^s} \sim\zeta(s)-\frac 1{(s-1)n^{s-1}}+\frac 1{2n^s}-\sum_{i=1}\frac{B_{2i}}{(2i)!}\frac{(s+2i-2)!}{(s-1)!n^{s+2i-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

For {{mvar|s}} equal to 2 this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2} \sim\zeta(2)-\frac 1n+\frac 1{2n^2}-\sum_{i=1}\frac{B_{2i}}{n^{2i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2} \sim \frac{\pi^2}{6} -\frac{1}{n} +\frac{1}{2n^2} -\frac{1}{6n^3}+\frac{1}{30n^5}-\frac{1}{42n^7}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can also derive (from Equation 1 below) the perhaps not-so-useful formula:
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^s} = \frac{1}{n^{s-1}} + s \int_1^n \frac{\lfloor x\rfloor}{x^{s+1}} dx \qquad \text{with }\quad s \in \R \setminus \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;

When {{mvar|s}} is 1, we get the following for the so-called [[harmonic number]]s:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} &amp;= \log n + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2n} - \int_1^n \frac{x-\lfloor x\rfloor -1/2}{x^{2}} dx\\
&amp;\approx \log n + \gamma +\frac{1}{2n} -\frac{1}{12n^2} + \frac{1}{120n^4} - \frac{1}{252n^6}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx 0.5772156649015328606065&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler constant]],

== Proofs ==

=== Derivation by mathematical induction ===
We follow the argument given in Apostol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = T. M. | title = An Elementary View of Euler's Summation Formula | journal = The [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 106 | date = 1 May 1999 | issue = 5 | pages = 409–418  | issn = 0002-9890| last = Apostol | doi = 10.2307/2589145| authorlink= Tom M. Apostol| publisher =    Mathematical Association of America| jstor =    2589145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bernoulli polynomials]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}} and the periodic Bernoulli functions {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} were introduced above.

The first several Bernoulli polynomials are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_1(x) &amp;= x - \frac{1}{2} \\
  B_2(x) &amp;= x^2 - x + \frac{1}{6} \\
  B_3(x) &amp;= x^3 - \frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x \\
  B_4(x) &amp;= x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 - \frac{1}{30} \\
         &amp; \,\,\,\vdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The values {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)}} are the [[Bernoulli numbers]].  Notice that for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1}} we have

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(0) = B_n(1) = B_n\quad(n\text{th Bernoulli number})&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}},

:&lt;math&gt; B_1(0) = -B_1(1) = B_1&lt;/math&gt;

The functions {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} agree with the Bernoulli polynomials on the interval {{math|[0,&amp;nbsp;1]}}  and are [[periodic function|periodic]] with period 1.  Furthermore, except when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}, they are also continuous. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; P_n(0) = P_n(1) = B_n \quad (n \neq 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''k''}} be an integer, and consider the integral

:&lt;math&gt; \int_k^{k + 1} f(x)\,dx = \int_k^{k + 1} u\,dv&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   u &amp;= f(x) \\
  du &amp;= f'(x)\,dx \\
  dv &amp;= P_0(x)\,dx &amp;&amp; \text{since }P_0(x) = 1 \\
   v &amp;= P_1(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[integration by parts|Integrating by parts]], we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int_k^{k + 1} f(x)\,dx &amp;= \Big[uv\Big]_k^{k + 1} - \int_k^{k + 1} v\,du \\[8pt]
                         &amp;= \Big[f(x)P_1(x)\Big]_k^{k + 1} - \int_k^{k+1} f'(x)P_1(x)\,dx \\[8pt]
                         &amp;= B_1(1)f(k+1)-B_1(0)f(k) - \int_k^{k+1} f'(x)P_1(x)\,dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;B_1(0)=-1/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1(1)=1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and summing the above from ''k'' = 0 to ''k'' = ''n'' − 1, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^n f(x)\, dx &amp;= \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx + \dotsb + \int_{n-1}^n f(x)\,dx  \\[8pt]
&amp;= \frac{f(0)}{2}+ f(1) + \dotsb + f(n-1) + {f(n) \over 2} - \int_0^n f'(x) P_1(x)\,dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding (''f''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''(0))/2 to both sides and rearranging, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n f(k) = \int_0^n f(x)\,dx + {f(n) - f(0) \over 2} + \int_0^n f'(x) P_1(x)\,dx\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

The last two terms therefore give the error when the integral is taken to approximate the sum.

Next, consider

:&lt;math&gt; \int_k^{k+1} f'(x)P_1(x)\,dx = \int_k^{k + 1} u\,dv &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   u &amp;= f'(x) \\
  du &amp;= f''(x)\,dx \\
  dv &amp;= P_1(x)\,dx \\
   v &amp;= \frac{1}{2}P_2(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating by parts again, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Big[uv\Big]_k^{k + 1} - \int_k^{k + 1} v\,du &amp;= \left[ {f'(x)P_2(x) \over 2} \right]_k^{k+1} - {1 \over 2}\int_k^{k+1} f''(x)P_2(x)\,dx \\
                  &amp;= {B_2 \over 2}(f'(k + 1) - f'(k)) - {1 \over 2}\int_k^{k + 1} f''(x)P_2(x)\,dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then summing from ''k'' = 0 to ''k'' = ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, and then replacing the last integral in (1) with what we have thus shown to be equal to it, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n f(k) = \int_0^n f(x)\,dx + {f(n) - f(0) \over 2} + \frac{B_2}{2}(f'(n) - f'(0)) - {1 \over 2}\int_0^n f''(x)P_2(x)\,dx.  &lt;/math&gt;

By now the reader will have guessed that this process can be iterated.  In this way we get a proof of the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula which can be formalized by [[mathematical induction]], in which the induction step relies on integration by parts and on the identities for periodic Bernoulli functions.
&lt;!--Commented out because it's imprecise and contains false information. In order to get bounds on the size of the error when the sum is approximated by the integral, we note that the Bernoulli polynomials on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] attain their maximum absolute values at the endpoints (see Lehmer in references below), and the value ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(1) is the ''n''th [[Bernoulli number]].--&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''formal power series''' is a generalization of a [[polynomial]], where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number. Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a [[power series]], whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^5&lt;/math&gt; is the fifth term in the sequence. In [[combinatorics]], formal power series provide representations of numerical [[sequence]]s and of [[multiset]]s, and for instance allow concise expressions for [[recursion|recursively]] defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of [[generating function]]s. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

==Introduction==
A formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a [[polynomial]], but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with [[power series]] (or [[Taylor series]]), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of [[Convergent series|convergence]] by not assuming that the variable ''X'' denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series

:&lt;math&gt;A = 1 - 3X + 5X^2 - 7X^3 + 9X^4 - 11X^5 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

If we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its [[radius of convergence]] is 1. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of [[coefficient]]s [1, −3, 5, −7, 9, −11, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the [[factorial]]s [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, … ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of ''X''.

Arithmetic on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if

:&lt;math&gt;B = 2X + 4X^3 + 6X^5 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

then we add ''A'' and ''B'' term by term:

:&lt;math&gt;A + B = 1 - X + 5X^2 - 3X^3 + 9X^4 - 5X^5 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

We can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular [[Cauchy product]]):

:&lt;math&gt;AB = 2X - 6X^2 + 14X^3 - 26X^4 + 44X^5 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that each coefficient in the product ''AB'' only depends on a ''finite'' number of coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. For example, the ''X''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; term is given by

:&lt;math&gt;44X^5 = (1\times 6X^5) + (5X^2 \times 4X^3) + (9X^4 \times 2X).&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of [[absolute convergence|absolute]], [[conditional convergence|conditional]] and [[uniform convergence]] which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].

Once we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series ''A'' is a formal power series ''C'' such that ''AC'' = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if ''A'' has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining ''B''/''A'' to be the product ''BA''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, provided that the inverse of ''A'' exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 + X} = 1 - X + X^2 - X^3 + X^4 - X^5 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

An important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator &lt;math&gt;[X^n]&lt;/math&gt; applied to a formal power series &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in one variable extracts the coefficient of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th power of the variable, so that &lt;math&gt;[X^2]A=5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[X^5]A=-11&lt;/math&gt;. Other examples include

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[X^3\right] (B) &amp;= 4, \\ 
\left[X^2 \right] (X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &amp;= 3Y^3, \\
\left[X^2Y^3 \right] ( X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &amp;= 3, \\
\left[X^n \right] \left(\frac{1}{1+X} \right) &amp;= (-1)^n, \\ 
\left[X^n \right] \left(\frac{X}{(1-X)^2} \right) &amp;= n.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.

==The ring of formal power series==
The set of all formal power series in ''X'' with coefficients in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' form another ring that is written &lt;math&gt;R[[X]],&lt;/math&gt; and called the '''ring of formal power series''' in the variable&amp;nbsp;''X'' over ''R''.

===Definition of the formal power series ring===
One can characterize &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; abstractly as the [[completeness (topology)|completion]] of the [[polynomial]] ring &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a particular [[metric space|metric]]&lt;!-- in which the powers of the ideal ''I'' of &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; form a shrinking set of neighbourhoods of 0; a precise description would be too long to spell out here--&gt;. This automatically gives &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; the structure of a topological ring (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. 
It is possible to describe &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.

====Ring structure====
As a set, &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as the set &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; of all infinite sequences of elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, indexed by the [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, one defines addition of two such sequences by

:&lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\N} + (b_n)_{n\in\N} = \left( a_n + b_n \right)_{n\in\N}&lt;/math&gt;

and multiplication by

:&lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\N} \times (b_n)_{n\in\N} = \left( \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} \right)_{n\in\N}.&lt;/math&gt;

This type of product is called the [[Cauchy product]] of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete [[convolution]]. With these operations, &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; becomes a commutative ring with zero element &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; and multiplicative identity &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;.

The product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; by sending any (constant) &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; to the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a,0,0,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; and designates the sequence &lt;math&gt;(0,1,0,0,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as

:&lt;math&gt;(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \ldots) = a_0 + a_1 X + \cdots + a_n X^n = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i;&lt;/math&gt;

these are precisely the polynomials in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\N}&lt;/math&gt; by the formal expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{i\in\N}a_i X^i&lt;/math&gt;, even though the latter ''is not'' an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i\in\N} a_i X^i\right)+\left(\sum_{i\in\N} b_i X^i\right) = \sum_{i\in\N}(a_i+b_i) X^i&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i\in\N} a_i X^i\right) \times \left(\sum_{i\in\N} b_i X^i\right) = \sum_{n\in\N} \left(\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\right) X^n.&lt;/math&gt;

which is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.

==== Topological structure ====
Having stipulated conventionally that

:&lt;math&gt;(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i X^i, \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

one would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; is defined and a [[topology]] on &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.

* We may give &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; the [[product topology]], where each copy of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is given the [[discrete topology]].

* We may give &lt;math&gt;R^\N&lt;/math&gt; the [[I-adic topology]], where &lt;math&gt;I=(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of all sequences whose first term &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is zero.

* The desired topology could also be derived from the following [[metric space|metric]]. The distance between distinct sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_n), (b_n) \in R^{\N},&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be
::&lt;math&gt;d((a_n), (b_n)) = 2^{-k},&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[natural number]] such that &lt;math&gt;a_k\neq b_k&lt;/math&gt;; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.

Informally, two sequences &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b_n\}&lt;/math&gt; become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of [[partial sum]]s of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;, since inclusion of the term for &lt;math&gt;i=n&lt;/math&gt; gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;X^n&lt;/math&gt;. It is also obvious that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.

This topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a [[topological ring]]. This is called the '''ring of formal power series over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;''' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; occurs in only finitely many terms.

The topological structure allows much more flexible use of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i\in\N} a_i X^i\right) \times \left(\sum_{i\in\N} b_i X^i\right) = \sum_{i,j\in\N} a_i b_j X^{i+j},&lt;/math&gt;

since only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed &lt;math&gt;X^n&lt;/math&gt;. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1.

==== Alternative topologies ====
The above topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest topology]] for which 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i X^i&lt;/math&gt; 

always converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.

Consider the ring of formal power series: &lt;math&gt;\Z[[X]][[Y]],&lt;/math&gt; then the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, since the topology that was put on &lt;math&gt;\Z[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in\N}XY^i&lt;/math&gt;

converges to the power series suggested, which can be written as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{X}{1-Y}&lt;/math&gt;; however the summation

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in\N}X^iY&lt;/math&gt;

would be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; (which coefficient is itself a power series in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;). This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is given the product topology where each copy of &lt;math&gt;\Z[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. As a consequence, for convergence of a sequence of elements of &lt;math&gt;\Z[[X]][[Y]]&lt;/math&gt; it then suffices that the coefficient of each power of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; converges to a formal power series in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a weaker condition that stabilizing entirely; for instance in the second example given here the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;converges to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{1-X}&lt;/math&gt;, so the whole summation converges to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y}{1-X}&lt;/math&gt;.

This way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing &lt;math&gt;\Z[[X,Y]],&lt;/math&gt; and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial &lt;math&gt;X^iY^j&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes. This topology, which is also the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology, where &lt;math&gt;I=(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.

The same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in &lt;math&gt;\R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{X}{n}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;

does not exist, so in particular it does not converge to 

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X)=\sum_{n\in\N}\frac{X^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is because for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; the coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{i}/n^i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X^i&lt;/math&gt; does not stabilize as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. It does however converge in the usual topology of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, and in fact to the coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{i!}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\exp(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if one would give &lt;math&gt;\R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\R^\N&lt;/math&gt; where the topology of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to &lt;math&gt;\exp(X)&lt;/math&gt;. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would ''not'' be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.

===Universal property===
The ring &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; may be characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative associative algebra over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-adic topology on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is complete, and if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a ''unique'' &lt;math&gt;\Phi: R[[X]]\to S&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:

* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra homomorphism

* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous

* &lt;math&gt;\Phi(X)=x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Operations on formal power series ==
One can perform algebraic operations on power series to generate new power series.&lt;ref name="Zwillinger_2014"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Izrail Solomonovich |author-last1=Gradshteyn |author-link1=Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn |author-first2=Iosif Moiseevich |author-last2=Ryzhik |author-link2=Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik |author-first3=Yuri Veniaminovich |author-last3=Geronimus |author-link3 =Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus |author-first4=Michail Yulyevich |author-last4=Tseytlin |author-link4=Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin |author-first5=Alan |author-last5=Jeffrey |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Zwillinger |editor2-first=Victor Hugo |editor2-last=Moll |translator=Scripta Technica, Inc. |title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |publisher=[[Academic Press, Inc.]] |date=2015 |orig-year=October 2014 |edition=8 |language=English |isbn=978-0-12-384933-5 |lccn=2014010276 &lt;!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjnLAwAAQBAJ |access-date=2016-02-21--&gt;|titlelink=Gradshteyn and Ryzhik |chapter=0.313 |page=18}} (Several previous editions as well.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=formalpowerseries&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ivan | last=Niven | authorlink=Ivan Niven | title=Formal Power Series | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=8 | date=October 1969 | pages=871–889 | doi=10.1080/00029890.1969.12000359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the ring structure operations defined above, we have the following.

===Power series raised to powers===
If ''n'' is a [[natural number]] we have

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k X^k \right)^n = \sum_{m=0}^\infty c_m X^m, &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
c_0 &amp;= a_0^n \\
c_m &amp;= \frac{1}{m a_0} \sum_{k=1}^m (kn - m+k) a_{k} c_{m-k} &amp;&amp; m \ge 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(This formula can only be used if ''m'' and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are invertible in the ring of scalars.)

In the case of formal power series with complex coefficients, the complex powers are well defined at least for series ''f'' with constant term equal to 1. In this case, &lt;math&gt;f^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined either by composition with the [[binomial series]] (1+''x'')&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, or by composition with the exponential and the logarithmic series, &lt;math&gt;f^{\alpha}=\exp(\alpha\log(f)),&lt;/math&gt; or as the solution of the differential equation &lt;math&gt;f( f^{\alpha})' = \alpha f^{\alpha} f'&lt;/math&gt; with constant term 1, the three definitions being equivalent. The rules of calculus &lt;math&gt;(f^\alpha)^\beta = f^{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^\alpha g^\alpha = (fg)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; easily follow.

=== Inverting series ===
The series

:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n X^n \in R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;

is invertible in &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its constant coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is invertible in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This condition is necessary, for the following reason: if we suppose that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has an inverse &lt;math&gt;B = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; then the [[constant term]] &lt;math&gt;a_0b_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt; is the constant term of the identity series, i.e., it is 1. This condition is also sufficient; we may compute the coefficients of the inverse series &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; via the explicit recursive formula

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
b_0 &amp;= \frac{1}{a_0}\\
b_n &amp;= -\frac{1}{a_0} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{n-i} &amp;&amp; \text{for } n \ge 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An important special case is that the [[geometric series]] formula is valid in &lt;math&gt;K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 - X)^{-1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty X^n.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;R=K&lt;/math&gt; is a field, then a series is invertible if and only if the constant term is non-zero, i.e., if and only if the series is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This says that &lt;math&gt;K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[discrete valuation ring]] with uniformizing parameter &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Dividing series===
The computation of a quotient &lt;math&gt;f/g=h&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n X^n }{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n X^n } =\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n X^n, &lt;/math&gt;

assuming the denominator is invertible (that is, &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is invertible in the ring of scalars), can be performed as a product &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the inverse of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or directly equating the coefficients in &lt;math&gt;f=gh&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \frac{1}{a_0}\left(b_n - \sum_{k=1}^n a_k c_{n-k}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Extracting coefficients ===
The coefficient extraction operator applied to a formal power series 

:&lt;math&gt;f(X) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n X^n &lt;/math&gt;

in ''X'' is written

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ X^m \right] f(X) &lt;/math&gt;

and extracts the coefficient of ''X&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', so that

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ X^m \right] f(X) = \left[ X^m \right] \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n X^n = a_m.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Composition of series ===
Given formal power series

:&lt;math&gt;f(X) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n X^n = a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(X) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n X^n = b_0 + b_1 X + b_2 X^2 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

one may form the ''composition''

:&lt;math&gt;g(f(X)) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n (f(X))^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n X^n,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are determined by "expanding out" the powers of ''f''(''X''):

:&lt;math&gt;c_n:=\sum_{k\in\N, |j|=n} b_k a_{j_1} a_{j_2} \cdots a_{j_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the sum is extended over all (''k'', ''j'') with &lt;math&gt;k\in\N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j\in\N_+^k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|j|:=j_1+\cdots+j_k=n.&lt;/math&gt;

A more explicit description of these coefficients is provided by [[Faà di Bruno's formula#Formal power series version|Faà di Bruno's formula]], at least in the case where the coefficient ring is a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic 0]].

A point here is that this operation is only valid when &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; has ''no constant term'', so that each &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on only a finite number of coefficients of &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(X)&lt;/math&gt;. In other word the series for &lt;math&gt;g(f(X))&lt;/math&gt; converges in the [[Completion (ring theory)#Krull topology|topology]] of &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example ====
Assume that the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has characteristic 0. If we denote by &lt;math&gt;\exp(X)&lt;/math&gt; the formal power series

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X) = 1 + X + \frac{X^2}{2!} + \frac{X^3}{3!} + \frac{X^4}{4!} + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

then the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(X) - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + \frac{5X^3}6 + \frac{5X^4}8 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

makes perfect sense as a formal power series. However, the statement

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(X)) = e \exp(\exp(X) - 1) = e + eX + eX^2 + \frac{5eX^3}{6} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

is not a valid application of the composition operation for formal power series. Rather, it is confusing the notions of convergence in &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; and convergence in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;; indeed, the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; may not even contain any number &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; with the appropriate properties.

=== Composition inverse ===
Whenever a formal series 

:&lt;math&gt;f(X)=\sum_k f_k X^k \in R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; 

has ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; being an invertible element of ''R'', there exists a series 

:&lt;math&gt;g(X)=\sum_k g_k X^k&lt;/math&gt; 

that is the [[composition inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that composing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; gives the series representing the [[identity function]] (whose first coefficient is 1 and all other coefficients are zero). The coefficients of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity ''X'' (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]] provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of ''g'', as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of ''g''.

=== Formal differentiation of series ===
Given a formal power series

:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{n\geq 0} a_n X^n \in R[[X]],&lt;/math&gt;

we define its '''[[formal derivative]]''', denoted ''Df'' or ''f''′, by

:&lt;math&gt; Df = \sum_{n \geq 1} a_n n X^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol ''D'' is called the '''formal differentiation operator'''. The motivation behind this definition is that it simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.

This operation is ''R''-[[linear operator|linear]]:

:&lt;math&gt;D(af + bg) = a \cdot Df + b \cdot Dg&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' and any ''f'', ''g'' in &lt;math&gt;R[[X]].&lt;/math&gt; Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual [[derivative]] of calculus. For example, the [[product rule]] is valid:

:&lt;math&gt;D(fg) = f \cdot (Dg) + (Df) \cdot g,&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[chain rule]] works as well:

:&lt;math&gt;D(f\circ g ) = ( Df\circ g ) \cdot Dg,&lt;/math&gt;

whenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under [[#Composition of series|composition of series]]).

Thus, in these respects formal power series behave like [[Taylor series]]. Indeed, for the ''f'' defined above, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;(D^k f)(0) = k! a_k, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''k''th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating ''k'' times).

== Properties ==

=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===
&lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is an [[associative algebra]] over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which contains the ring &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; of polynomials over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.

The [[Jacobson radical]] of &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the Jacobson radical of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.

The [[maximal ideal]]s of &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; all arise from those in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in the following manner: an ideal &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is maximal if and only if &lt;math&gt;M\cap R&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is generated as an ideal by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\cap R&lt;/math&gt;.

Several algebraic properties of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are inherited by &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;:

* if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local ring]], then so is &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;;

* if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], then so is &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;; this is a version of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]];

* if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integral domain]], then so is &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;;

* if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then &lt;math&gt;K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[discrete valuation ring]].

=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===
The metric space &lt;math&gt;(R[[X]], d)&lt;/math&gt; is [[completeness (topology)|complete]].

The ring &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if ''R'' is [[finite set|finite]]. This follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the characterisation of the topology on &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; as a product topology.

=== Weierstrass preparation ===
{{main article|Weierstrass preparation theorem#Formal power series in complete local rings}}
The ring of formal power series with coefficients in a [[complete local ring]] satisfies the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]].

==Applications==
Formal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, see the article on [[Examples of generating functions]].

One can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of &lt;math&gt;\Q[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(X) := \sum_{n \ge 0} \frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)!} X^{2n+1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos(X) := \sum_{n \ge 0} \frac{(-1)^n} {(2n)!} X^{2n} &lt;/math&gt;

Then one can show that

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(X) + \cos^2(X) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial X} \sin(X) = \cos(X),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin (X+Y) = \sin(X) \cos(Y) + \cos(X) \sin(Y).&lt;/math&gt;

The last one being valid in the ring &lt;math&gt;\Q[[X, Y]].&lt;/math&gt;

For ''K'' a field, the ring &lt;math&gt;K[[X_1, \ldots, X_r]]&lt;/math&gt; is often used as the "standard, most general" complete local ring over ''K'' in algebra.

==Interpreting formal power series as functions==
In [[mathematical analysis]], every convergent [[power series]] defines a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with values in the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers. Formal power series can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the [[function domain|domain]] and [[codomain]]. Let 

:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum a_n X^n \in R[[X]],&lt;/math&gt; 

and suppose ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', ''I'' is an ideal in ''S'' such that the [[I-adic topology]] on ''S'' is complete, and ''x'' is an element of ''I''. Define:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n\ge 0} a_n x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This series is guaranteed to converge in ''S'' given the above assumptions on ''x''. Furthermore, we have

:&lt;math&gt; (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; (fg)(x) = f(x) g(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.

Since the topology on &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is the (''X'')-adic topology and &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have [[constant coefficients]] (so that they belong to the ideal (''X'')): ''f''(0), ''f''(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−''X'') and ''f''((1−''X'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are all well defined for any formal power series &lt;math&gt;f \in R[[X]].&lt;/math&gt;

With this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series ''f'' whose constant coefficient ''a'' = ''f''(0) is invertible in ''R'':

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1} = \sum_{n \ge 0} a^{-n-1} (a-f)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

If the formal power series ''g'' with ''g''(0) = 0 is given implicitly by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;f(g) =X&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is a known power series with ''f''(0) = 0, then the coefficients of ''g'' can be explicitly computed using the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]].

==Generalizations==

=== Formal Laurent series ===
A '''formal Laurent series''' over a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree (this is different from the classical [[Laurent series]]), that is series of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{n\in\Z} a_n X^n&lt;/math&gt;

where '''&lt;math&gt;a_n=0&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many negative indices &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'''. Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of ''X&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' of two series with respective sequences of coefficients &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in\Z}a_ib_{k-i},&lt;/math&gt;

which sum is effectively finite because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices, and which sum zero for sufficiently negative &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for the same reason.

For a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; a_n\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; is called the order of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(f).&lt;/math&gt; (The order of the zero series is &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.) The formal Laurent series form the '''ring of formal Laurent series''' over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;R((X))&lt;/math&gt;. It is equal to the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of &lt;math&gt;R[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the set of positive powers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is a topological ring with the metric:

:&lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=2^{-\operatorname{ord}(f-g)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;R=K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then &lt;math&gt;K((X))&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integral domain]] &lt;math&gt;K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;.

One may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in a natural way (term-by-term). Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; above is

:&lt;math&gt;f' = Df = \sum_{n\in\Z} na_n X^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which is again an element of &lt;math&gt;K((X))&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a non-constant formal Laurent series, and K is a field of characteristic 0, then one has

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(f')= \operatorname{ord}(f)-1.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in general this is not the case since the factor ''n'' for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in ''R''.

====Formal residue====
Assume that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Then the map

:&lt;math&gt;D\colon K((X))\to K((X))&lt;/math&gt;

is a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\ker D=K&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im} D= \left \{f\in K((X)) : [X^{-1}]f=0 \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The latter shows that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is of particular interest; it is called ''formal residue of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'' and denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}(f)&lt;/math&gt;. The map

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res} : K((X))\to K&lt;/math&gt;

is &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-linear, and by the above observation one has an [[exact sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to K \to K((X)) \xrightarrow{D} K((X)) \;\xrightarrow{\operatorname{Res}}\; K \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Some rules of calculus'''. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any &lt;math&gt;f, g\in K((X))&lt;/math&gt;
:i. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}(f')=0;&lt;/math&gt;
:ii. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}(fg')=-\operatorname{Res}(f'g);&lt;/math&gt;
:iii. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=\operatorname{ord}(f),\qquad \forall f\neq0;&lt;/math&gt;
:iv. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}\left(( f\circ g) g'\right) = \operatorname{ord}(g)\operatorname{Res}(f),&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(g)&gt;0;&lt;/math&gt;
:v. &lt;math&gt;[X^n]f(X)=\operatorname{Res}\left(X^{-n-1}f(X)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Property (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to &lt;math&gt;(fg)'=f'g+fg'&lt;/math&gt;. Property (iii): any &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;f=X^mg&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;m=\operatorname{ord}(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(g)=0&lt;/math&gt;: then &lt;math&gt;f'/f = mX^{-1}+g'/g.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(g)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is invertible in &lt;math&gt;K[[X]]\subset \operatorname{im}(D) = \ker(\operatorname{Res}),&lt;/math&gt; whence &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=m.&lt;/math&gt; Property (iv): Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}(D) = \ker(\operatorname{Res}),&lt;/math&gt; we can write &lt;math&gt;f=f_{-1}X^{-1}+F',&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;F \in K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)g'= f_{-1}g^{-1}g'+(F'\circ g)g' = f_{-1}g'/g + (F \circ g)'&lt;/math&gt; and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.

===The Lagrange inversion formula===
{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}
As mentioned above, any formal series &lt;math&gt;f \in K[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0 has a composition inverse &lt;math&gt;g \in K[[X]].&lt;/math&gt; The following relation between the coefficients ''g&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''f&lt;sup&gt;−k&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds ("{{Visible anchor|Lagrange inversion formula}}"):

:&lt;math&gt;k[X^k] g^n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and all ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1,

:&lt;math&gt;[X^k] g=\frac{1}{k} \operatorname{Res}\left( f^{-k}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting it here. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ord}(f) =1 &lt;/math&gt;, by the above rules of calculus,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
k[X^k] g^n &amp;= k \operatorname{Res} \left(g^n X^{-k-1} \right) \\[4pt]
           &amp;= k \operatorname{ord} (f) \operatorname{Res}\left(g^n X^{-k-1}\right) \\[4pt] 
           &amp;= k \operatorname{Res} \left( \left ( \left (g^n X^{-k-1}\right )\circ f \right )f'\right)\\[4pt]
           &amp;= k \operatorname{Res} \left((g\circ f)^n f^{-k-1} f'\right) \\[4pt] 
           &amp;= k \operatorname{Res} \left(X^n f^{-k-1}f' \right) \\[4pt]
           &amp;= - \operatorname{Res} \left(X^n \left (f^{-k} \right )' \right) \\[4pt]
           &amp;=   \operatorname{Res} \left(\left(X^n\right)' f^{-k}\right) \\[4pt]
           &amp;= n \operatorname{Res} \left(X^{n-1}f^{-k}\right) \\[4pt]
           &amp;= n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Generalizations.''' One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than ''K''((''X'')): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the &lt;math&gt;\C((X))&lt;/math&gt;-modules &lt;math&gt;X^{\alpha}\C((X)),&lt;/math&gt; where α is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, with &lt;math&gt;f_1=g_1=1&lt;/math&gt;, we can relate the complex powers of ''f/X'' and ''g/X'': precisely, if α and β are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, &lt;math&gt;m=-\alpha-\beta\in\N,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\alpha}[X^m]\left( \frac{f}{X} \right)^\alpha=-\frac{1}{\beta}[X^m]\left( \frac{g}{X} \right)^\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, this way one finds the power series for [[Lambert W function#Integer and complex powers|complex powers of the Lambert function]].

=== Power series in several variables ===
Formal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If ''I'' is an index set and ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of indeterminates ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i''∈''I'', then a [[monomial]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is any finite product of elements of ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to a corresponding coefficient ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, and is denoted &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all such formal power series is denoted &lt;math&gt;R[[X_I]],&lt;/math&gt; and it is given a ring structure by defining

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha\right)+\left(\sum_\alpha d_\alpha X^\alpha \right)= \sum_\alpha (c_\alpha+d_\alpha) X^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha\right)\times\left(\sum_\beta d_\beta X^\beta\right)=\sum_{\alpha,\beta} c_\alpha d_\beta X^{\alpha+\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Topology ====
The topology on &lt;math&gt;R[[X_I]]&lt;/math&gt; is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If ''I'' is finite, then this the ''J''-adic topology, where ''J'' is the ideal of &lt;math&gt;R[[X_I]]&lt;/math&gt; generated by all the indeterminates in ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''. This does not hold if ''I'' is infinite. For example, if &lt;math&gt;I=\N,&lt;/math&gt; then the sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n\in \N}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f_n = X_n + X_{n+1} + X_{n+2} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt; does not converge with respect to any ''J''-adic topology on ''R'', but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.

As remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like &lt;math&gt;R[[X]][[Y]]&lt;/math&gt; is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a [[topological ring]] to &lt;math&gt;R[[X,Y]].&lt;/math&gt;

====Operations====
All of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.

* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in ''R''.

* The composition ''f''(''g''(''X'')) of two series ''f'' and ''g'' is defined if ''f'' is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of ''g'' is zero. For a series ''f'' in several indeterminates a form of "composition" can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of ''g'' as there are indeterminates.

In the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate [[partial derivative]] operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.

==== Universal property ====
In the several variables case, the universal property characterizing &lt;math&gt;R[[X_1, \ldots, X_r]]&lt;/math&gt; becomes the following. If ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', if ''I'' is an ideal of ''S'' such that the ''I''-adic topology on ''S'' is complete, and if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of ''I'', then there is a ''unique'' map &lt;math&gt;\Phi: R[[X_1, \ldots, X_r]] \to S&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:

* Φ is an ''R''-algebra homomorphism

* Φ is continuous

* Φ(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''r''.

===Non-commuting variables===
The several variable case can be further generalised by taking ''non-commuting variables'' ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i'' ∈ ''I'', where ''I'' is an index set and then a [[monomial]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is any [[word (mathematics)|word]] in the ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''; a formal power series in ''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to a corresponding coefficient ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, and is denoted &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. The set of all such formal power series is denoted ''R''«''X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''», and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha\right)+\left(\sum_\alpha d_\alpha X^\alpha\right)=\sum_\alpha(c_\alpha+d_\alpha)X^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

and multiplication by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_\alpha c_\alpha X^\alpha\right)\times\left(\sum_\alpha d_\alpha X^\alpha\right)=\sum_{\alpha,\beta} c_\alpha d_\beta X^{\alpha} \cdot X^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where · denotes concatenation of words. These formal power series over ''R'' form the '''Magnus ring''' over ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Helmut | last=Koch | title=Algebraic Number Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1997 | isbn=978-3-540-63003-6 | zbl=0819.11044 | series=Encycl.

=== On a semiring ===
{{expand section|sum, product, examples|date=August 2014}}
In [[theoretical computer science]], the following definition of a formal power series is given: let Σ be an alphabet (finite set) and ''S'' be a [[semiring]]. In this context, a formal power series is any [[function (mathematics)|mapping]] ''r'' from the set of [[string (computer science)|string]]s generated by Σ (denoted as Σ&lt;sup&gt;[[Kleene star|∗]]&lt;/sup&gt;) to the semiring ''S''. The values of such a mapping ''r'' are (somewhat idiosyncratically) denoted as (''r'', ''w'') where ''w'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the mapping ''r'' itself is conventionally written as 

:&lt;math&gt;r = \sum_{w \in \Sigma^*} (r,w)w.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this notation, the values (''r'', ''w'') are also called the coefficients of the series. Similarly to the non-commuting [ring] case discussed in the section above this, the notation for the collection of all power series given a fixed alphabet and semiring is ''S''&amp;#12298;Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#12299;.&lt;!-- the correct symbols are &amp;#10218; and &amp;#10219; but they work poorly in many browsers. Wikipedia's TeX doesn't support \llangle and \rrangle. Also no support for Greek italics in wiki TeX it seems --&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W. (2009). Semirings and Formal Power Series.

===Replacing the index set by an ordered abelian group===
{{Main|Hahn series}}

Suppose &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered abelian group, meaning an abelian group with a total ordering &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; respecting the group's addition, so that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a+c&lt;b+c&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Let '''I''' be a [[well-order]]ed subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, meaning '''I''' contains no infinite descending chain. Consider the set consisting of

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I} a_i X^i &lt;/math&gt;

for all such '''I''', with &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; in a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, where we assume that for any index set, if all of the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero then the sum is zero. Then &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of formal power series on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; because of the condition that the indexing set be well-ordered the product is well-defined, and we of course assume that two elements which differ by zero are the same. Sometimes the notation &lt;math&gt;[[R^G]]&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Khodr | last1=Shamseddine | first2=Martin | last2=Berz | url= http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/~khodr/Publications/RS-Overview-offprints.pdf | title=Analysis on the Levi-Civita Field: A Brief Overview | journal= Contemporary Mathematics | volume=508 | pages=215–237 | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various properties of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; transfer to &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field, then so is &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered field, we can order &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt; by setting any element to have the same sign as its leading coefficient, defined as the least element of the index set '''I''' associated to a non-zero coefficient. Finally if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[divisible group]] and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real closed field]], then &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt; is a real closed field, and if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[algebraically closed]], then so is &lt;math&gt;R((G))&lt;/math&gt;.

This theory is due to [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], who also showed that one obtains subfields when the number of (non-zero) terms is bounded by some fixed infinite cardinality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">In [[mathematics]], '''Fredholm's theorems''' are a set of celebrated results of [[Ivar Fredholm]] in the [[Fredholm theory]] of [[integral equations]]. There are several closely related theorems, which may be stated in terms of integral equations, in terms of [[linear algebra]], or in terms of the [[Fredholm operator]] on [[Banach space]]s.

The [[Fredholm alternative]] is one of the Fredholm theorems.

==Linear algebra==
Fredholm's theorem in linear algebra is as follows: if ''M'' is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], then the [[orthogonal complement]] of the [[row space]] of ''M'' is the [[null space]] of ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{row } M)^\bot = \ker M.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the orthogonal complement of the column space of ''M'' is the null space of the adjoint:

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{col } M)^\bot = \ker M^*.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integral equations==
Fredholm's theorem for integral equations is expressed as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;K(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; be an [[integral kernel]], and consider the [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b K(x,y) \phi(y) \,dy = \lambda \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and its complex adjoint

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \psi(x) \overline{K(x,y)} \, dx = \overline {\lambda}\psi(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of the [[complex number]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\overline{K(x,y)}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, Fredholm's theorem is that, for any fixed value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, these equations have either the trivial solution &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\phi(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; or have the same number of [[linearly independent]] solutions &lt;math&gt;\phi_1(x),\cdots,\phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(y),\cdots,\psi_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

A sufficient condition for this theorem to hold is for &lt;math&gt;K(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be [[square integrable]] on the rectangle &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\times[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; (where ''a'' and/or ''b'' may be minus or plus infinity).

Here, the integral is expressed as a one-dimensional integral on the real number line. In [[Fredholm theory]], this result generalizes to [[integral operator]]s on multi-dimensional spaces, including, for example, [[Riemannian manifold]]s.

==Existence of solutions==
One of Fredholm's theorems, closely related to the [[Fredholm alternative]], concerns the existence of solutions to the inhomogeneous [[Fredholm equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda \phi(x)-\int_a^b K(x,y) \phi(y) \,dy=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Solutions to this equation exist if and only if the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[orthogonal]] to the complete set of solutions &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \overline{\psi_n(x)} f(x) \,dx=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi_n(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the former is one of the complete set of solutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\overline{\psi(y)} -\int_a^b \overline{\psi(x)} K(x,y) \,dx=0.&lt;/math&gt;

A sufficient condition for this theorem to hold is for &lt;math&gt;K(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be [[square integrable]] on the rectangle &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\times[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics, a '''fundamental matrix''' of a system of ''n'' homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

is a matrix-valued function &lt;math&gt; \Psi(t) &lt;/math&gt; whose columns are [[linear independence|linearly independent]] solutions of the system.
Then every solution to the system can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \Psi(t) \mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;, for some constant vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; (written as a column vector of height ''n'').

One can show that a matrix-valued function &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is a fundamental matrix of  &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; \dot{\Psi}(t) = A(t) \Psi(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is a [[non-singular matrix]] for all &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chi-Tsong Chen |year=1998 |title=Linear System Theory and Design |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press, |location=New York |isbn=978-0195117776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control theory==
The fundamental matrix is used to express the [[state-transition matrix]], an essential component in the solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations.

In [[mathematics]], a '''generalized polygon''' is an [[incidence structure]] introduced by [[Jacques Tits]] in 1959.  Generalized ''n''-gons encompass as special cases [[projective plane]]s (generalized triangles, ''n'' = 3) and [[generalized quadrangle]]s (''n'' = 4). Many generalized polygons arise from [[groups of Lie type]], but there are also exotic ones that cannot be obtained in this way. Generalized polygons satisfying a technical condition known as the ''[[Ruth Moufang|Moufang]] property'' have been completely classified by Tits and Weiss. Every generalized ''n''-gon with ''n'' even is also a [[near polygon]].

==Definition==

A generalized ''2''-gon (or a digon) is an [[incidence structure]] with at least 2 points and 2 lines where each point is incident to each line.

For ''&lt;math&gt;n \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;'' a generalized ''n''-gon is an [[incidence structure]] (&lt;math&gt;P,L,I&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the set of lines and &lt;math&gt;I\subseteq P\times L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[incidence relation]], such that:
* It is a [[partial linear space]]. 
* It has no ordinary ''m''-gons as subgeometry for ''&lt;math&gt;2 \leq m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;''. 
* It has an ordinary ''n''-gon as a subgeometry. 
* For any &lt;math&gt; \{A_1, A_2\} \subseteq P \cup L &lt;/math&gt;  there exists a subgeometry  (&lt;math&gt; P', L', I' &lt;/math&gt;) isomorphic to an ordinary ''n''-gon such that &lt;math&gt;\{A_1, A_2\} \subseteq P' \cup L' &lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent but sometimes simpler way to express these conditions is: consider the [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] ''incidence graph'' with the vertex set &lt;math&gt;P \cup L&lt;/math&gt; and the edges connecting the incident pairs of points and lines.
* The [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] of the incidence graph is twice the [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] ''n'' of the incidence graph.

From this it should be clear that the incidence graphs of generalized polygons are [[Moore graph]]s.

A generalized polygon is of order ''(s,t)'' if:
* all vertices of the incidence graph corresponding to the elements of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; have the same degree ''s'' + 1 for some natural number ''s''; in other words, every line contains exactly ''s'' + 1 points,
* all vertices of the incidence graph corresponding to the elements of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; have the same degree ''t'' + 1 for some natural number ''t''; in other words, every point lies on exactly ''t'' + 1 lines.

We say a generalized polygon is thick if every point (line) is incident with at least three lines (points).  All thick generalized polygons have an order.

The dual of a generalized ''n''-gon (&lt;math&gt;P,L,I&lt;/math&gt;), is the incidence structure with notion of points and lines reversed and the incidence relation taken to be the [[converse relation]] of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. It can easily be shown that this is again a generalized ''n''-gon.

==Examples==

* The incidence graph of a generalized digon is a [[complete bipartite graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;''s''+1,''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* For any natural ''n'' ≥ 3, consider the boundary of the ordinary [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides. Declare the vertices of the polygon to be the points and the sides to be the lines, with set inclusion as the incidence relation. This results in a generalized ''n''-gon with ''s'' = ''t'' = 1.
* For each [[group of Lie type]] ''G'' of rank 2 there is an associated generalized ''n''-gon ''X'' with ''n'' equal to 3, 4, 6 or 8 such that ''G'' acts transitively on the set of flags of ''X''. In the finite case, for ''n=6'', one obtains the Split Cayley hexagon of order (''q'', ''q'') for [[List of finite simple groups#G2.28q.29 Chevalley groups|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')]] and the twisted triality hexagon of order (''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q'') for [[List of finite simple groups#3D4.28q3.29 Steinberg groups|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)]], and for ''n=8'', one obtains the Ree-Tits octagon of order (''q'', ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[List of finite simple groups#3D4.28q3.29 Steinberg groups|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')]] with ''q'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;''. Up to duality, these are the only known thick finite generalized hexagons or octagons.

== Restriction on parameters ==

[[Walter Feit]] and [[Graham Higman]] proved that ''finite'' generalized ''n''-gons of order (''s'', ''t'') with
''s''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 can exist only for the following values of ''n'':

:2, 3, 4, 6 or 8.

Generalized "n"-gons for these values are referred to as generalized digons, triangles, quadrangles, hexagons and octagons.

When Feit-Higman theorem is combined with the Haemers-Roos inequalities, we get the following restrictions,

* If ''n'' = 2, the incidence graph is a complete bipartite graph and thus "s", "t" can be arbitrary integers.
* If ''n'' = 3, the structure is a finite [[projective plane]], and ''s'' = ''t''.
* If ''n'' = 4, the structure is a finite [[generalized quadrangle]], and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''s'' ≤ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* If ''n'' = 6, then ''st'' is a [[Square number|square]], and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''s'' ≤ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* If ''n'' = 8, then ''2st'' is a square, and ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''s'' ≤ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* If ''s'' or ''t'' is allowed to be 1 and the structure is not the ordinary ''n''-gon then besides the values of ''n'' already listed, only ''n'' = 12 may be possible.

Every known finite generalized hexagon of order (''s'', ''t'') for ''s'', ''t'' &gt; 1 has order 
* (''q'', ''q''): the split Cayley hexagons and their duals,
* (''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''): the twisted triality hexagon, or
* (''q'', ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;): the dual twisted triality hexagon,
where ''q'' is a prime power.

Every known finite generalized octagon of order (''s'', ''t'') for ''s'', ''t'' &gt; 1 has order
*(''q'', ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): the Ree-Tits octagon  or
*(''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''): the dual Ree-Tits octagon, 
where ''q'' is an odd power of 2.

== Semi-finite generalized polygons ==
 
If ''s'' and ''t'' are both infinite then generalized polygons exist for each ''n'' greater or equal to 2. It is unknown whether or not there exist generalized polygons with one of the parameters finite (and bigger than ''1'') while the other infinite (these cases are called ''semi-finite''). [[Peter Cameron (mathematician)|Peter Cameron]] proved the non-existence of semi-finite generalized quadrangles with three points on each line, while [[Andries Brouwer]] and Bill Kantor independently proved the case of four points on each line. The non-existence result for five points on each line was proved by G. Cherlin using [[Model Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X04004054 | doi=10.1016/j.disc.2004.04.021 | volume=291 | title=Locally finite generalized quadrangles with at most five points per line | year=2005 | journal=Discrete Mathematics | pages=73–79 | last1 = Cherlin | first1 = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such results are known without making any further assumptions for generalized hexagons or octagons, even for the smallest case of three points on each line.

==Combinatorial applications==
As noted before the incidence graphs of generalized polygons have important properties. For example, every generalized ''n''-gon of order ''(s,s)'' is a ''(s+1,2n)'' [[Cage (graph theory)|cage]]. They are also related to [[expander graph]]s as they have nice expansion properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0605030&lt;/ref&gt; Several classes of extremal expander graphs are obtained from generalized polygons.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4562.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ramsey theory]], graphs constructed using generalized polygons give us some of the best known constructive lower bounds on offdiagonal Ramsey numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095895610000043 | doi=10.1016/j.jctb.2010.01.003 | volume=100 | title=Some constructive bounds on Ramsey numbers | year=2010 | journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B | pages=439–445 | last1 = Kostochka | first1 = Alexandr | last2 = Pudlák | first2 = Pavel | last3 = Rödl | first3 = Vojtech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">A '''human disease network''' is a network of human disorders and [[disease]]s with reference to their genetic origins or other features. More specifically, it is the map of human disease associations referring mostly to disease [[genes]]. For example, in a human disease network, two diseases are linked if they share at least one associated gene. A typical human disease network usually derives from bipartite networks which consist of both diseases and genes information. Additionally, some human disease networks use other features such as [[symptom]]s and proteins to associate diseases.
[[File:HDN.png|thumb|right|thumb|500px|Human disease network. It is generated as a [[Plotly]] plot
&lt;ref&gt;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Human-Disease-Network/blob/master/Human-Disease-Network.ipynb&lt;/ref&gt;. Nodes are diseases. Two diseases are connected if they share a genetic component.]]
==History==
In 2007, Goh et al. constructed a disease-gene bipartite graph using information from [[OMIM]] database and termed human disease network.&lt;ref name="Goh"&gt;Goh, Kwang-Il, et al. "The human disease network." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 104.21 (2007): 8685-8690.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Barrenas et al. derived complex disease-gene network using GWAs (Genome Wide Association studies).&lt;ref&gt;Barrenas, Fredrik, et al. "Network properties of complex human disease genes identified through genome-wide association studies." PLoS ONE 4.11 (2009): e8090.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Hidalgo et al. published a novel way of building human phenotypic disease networks in which diseases were connected according to their calculated distance.&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, César A., et al. "A dynamic network approach for the study of human phenotypes." PLoS Computational Biology 5.4 (2009): e1000353.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Cusick et al. summarized studies on genotype-phenotype associations in cellular context.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, Marc, Michael E. Cusick, and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi. "Interactome networks and human disease." Cell 144.6 (2011): 986-998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Zhou, et al. built a symptom-based human disease network by mining biomedical literature database.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;Zhou, XueZhong, et al. "Human symptoms–disease network." Nature Communications 5 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
A large-scale human disease network shows scale-free property. The degree distribution follows a power law suggesting that only a few diseases connect to a large number of diseases, whereas most diseases have few links to others. 
Such network also shows a clustering tendency by disease classes.&lt;ref name="Goh" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Venk"&gt;Kannan, Venkateshan et. al. "Conditional Disease Development extracted from Longitudinal Health Care Cohort Data using Layered Network Construction". Scientific Reports 6, 26170 (2016)[http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26170]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a symptom-based disease network, disease are also clustered according to their categories. Moreover, diseases sharing the same symptom are more likely to share the same genes and [[protein interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="Zhou" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">In [[mathematics]], a '''hyperplane section''' of a subset ''X'' of [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ''X'' with some [[hyperplane]] ''H''. In other words, we look at the subset ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; of those elements ''x'' of ''X'' that satisfy the single linear condition ''L'' = 0 defining ''H'' as a [[linear subspace]]. Here ''L'' or ''H'' can range over the [[dual projective space]] of non-zero [[linear form]]s in the [[homogeneous coordinates]], up to [[scalar multiplication]].

From a geometrical point of view, the most interesting case is when ''X'' is an [[algebraic subvariety]]; for more general cases, in [[mathematical analysis]], some analogue of the [[Radon transform]] applies. In [[algebraic geometry]], assuming therefore that ''X'' is ''V'', a subvariety not lying completely in any ''H'', the hyperplane sections are [[algebraic set]]s with [[irreducible component]]s all of dimension dim(''V'') &amp;minus; 1. What more can be said is addressed by a collection of results known collectively as [[Bertini's theorem]]. The topology of hyperplane sections is studied in the topic of the [[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem]] and its refinements. Because the dimension drops by one in taking hyperplane sections, the process is potentially an inductive method for understanding varieties of higher dimension. A basic tool for that is the [[Lefschetz pencil]].

'''Irmgard Flügge-Lotz''', née '''Lotz''' (16 July 1903 &amp;ndash; 22 May 1974) was a [[Germany|German]]-American [[mathematician]], [[aerospace engineer]], and [[control theorist]]. She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in [[bang-bang control|hysteresis control systems]]; such applications include [[guidance system]]s, [[electronics]], [[fire-control system]]s, and [[thermostat|temperature regulation]]. She became the first female engineering professor at [[Stanford University]] in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]].

==Early life and education==
Lotz was born in [[Hamelin]], [[Germany]] on 16 July 1903.&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{Cite web | last =Spreiter | first =John R. | author2 =Van Dyke, Milton D. | author3 =Vincenti, Walter G. | title =Irmgard Flügge-Lotz | work =Memorial Resolution | publisher =Stanford University | url =http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/Flugge-LotzI.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2009-11-24 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706133900/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/Flugge-LotzI.pdf | archivedate =2010-07-06 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist,&lt;ref name="agnesscott"&gt;{{Cite web | last =Cooper | first =Julie |author2=Banderas, Maria | title =Irmgard Flugge-Lotz | work =Biographies of Women Mathematicians | publisher =Agnes Scott College | date =May 1977 | url =http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/WOMEN/lotz.htm | accessdate =2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was drafted for military service in [[World War I]], the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls' [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family.&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=J.J.|last2=Robertson|first2=E.F.|title=Flugge-Lotz biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Flugge-Lotz.html|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the [[University of Hanover]] to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:
{{quote |I wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Engineering News, May 1969&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In college she studied applied mathematics and [[fluid dynamics]] and was often the only woman in her classes.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; In 1927, she received her [[Diplom#Germany|Diplom-Ingenieur]] and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.

Lotz went to work for the [[German Aerospace Center|Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt]] (AVA) in [[Göttingen]], one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with [[Ludwig Prandtl]] and [[Albert Betz]], two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his [[lifting-line theory]] for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use.&lt;ref name="agnesscott"/&gt; She published what is now known as the "Lotz method" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shenstone|first1=B. S.|title=The Lotz Method for Calculating the Aerodynamic Characteristics of Wings|journal=Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society|date=May 1934|volume=38|issue=281|pages=432–444|doi=10.1017/S036839310010940X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

In 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and [[privatdozent]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. As they prepared to marry, Lotz's career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; However, Flügge was branded "politically unreliable" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-[[Nazi]] views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was "blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The escalation and increasing influence of [[Nazi policies]] on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]] (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of [[Hermann Göring]], who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prof. lrmgard Flugge‐Lotz Dies; Taught Engineering at Stanford|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/23/archives/prof-irmgard-fluggelotz-dies.html?mcubz=1|accessdate=20 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=23 May 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in [[automatic control]] theory and pioneered the theory of [[bang-bang control|discontinuous control systems]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott"/&gt; These control systems, also known as "on-off" and "bang-bang" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application.&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spreiter|first1=J.|last2=Dyke|first2=M. Van|last3=Vincenti|first3=W.|title=In memoriam Irmgard Flugge-Lotz, 1903-1974|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|date=1975|volume=20|issue=2|pages=183–183|doi=10.1109/TAC.1975.1100901|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1100901|issn=0018-9286}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of [[autopilot|simple automatic flight control equipment]]. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

===Move to France===
As [[World War II]] progressed, [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies]]. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town [[Saulgau]] in the hills of southern Germany.&lt;ref name="resolution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gere|first1=James|last2=Herrmann|first2=George|last3=Steele|first3=Charles R.|title=Memorial Resolution: Wilhelm Flügge (1904 - 1990)|url=https://shellbuckling.com/cv/flugge.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]]. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the [[Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales]] (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.&lt;ref name="agnesscott"/&gt;

==Career at Stanford University==
Although Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to [[Stephen Timoshenko]] at [[Stanford University]] casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz's reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of "lecturer" as her husband became professor.&lt;ref name="resolution"/&gt;

Despite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in [[boundary layer theory]].&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in [[numerical methods]] to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with [[finite difference methods]] and the use of computers.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; In 1951 she set up a weekly [[fluid mechanics]] seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

===Discontinuous automatic control theory===
In addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:
{{quote|In the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;}}

Since automatic control devices often found application in [[electronics]], she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, ''Discontinuous and Optimal Control''.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;

===Tenure===
By the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the [[International Federation of Automatic Control]] in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Flügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on [[satellite]] control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle [[drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott"/&gt; During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the [[Society of Women Engineers]] in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Maryland]] in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:

{{quote|Professor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman's intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;}}

She was also a senior member of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE), a member of [[Sigma Xi]], and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckett|first1=Jamie|title=Stanford School of Engineering names new engineering heroes|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/december/engineering-school-heroes-120413.html|accessdate=20 August 2017|work=Stanford University|date=4 December 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award" was established by the Applied Mechanics Devision at [[Stanford University]] for outstanding graduate students.&lt;ref name="resolution"/&gt;

==Death==
Flügge-Lotz's health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from [[arthritis]] that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in [[Stanford Hospital]] after a long illness.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2936">'''Joe Peter Buhler''' (born 1950 in [[Vancouver, Washington]]) is an American mathematician.

Buhler received his undergraduate degree from [[Reed College]] in 1972, and his Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in 1977 with thesis ''Icosahedral Galois Representations'' and thesis advisor [[John Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy | id = 22872  | title=Joe Peter Buhler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buhler, Joe P.|title=Icosahedral Galois Representations|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics 654|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1978}} {{cite book|title=2006 pbk reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZV8CwAAQBAJ|isbn=9783540358183|last1=Buhler|first1=J. P|date=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buhler was a professor at Reed College in [[Portland, Oregon]] from 1980 until his retirement in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reed.edu/catalog/archives/catalog_2005_06/people/faculty_emeritus.html Reed College, Emeriti]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he, [[Zinovy Reichstein]], introduced the concept of [[essential dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Buhler, JP|author2=Reichstein, Z.|title=On the essential dimension of a finite group|journal=Compositio Mathematica|volume=106|issue=2|year=1997|pages=159–179|doi=10.1023/A:1000144403695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buhler is involved in a project to numerically verify the [[Kummer–Vandiver conjecture]] of [[Harry Vandiver]] and [[Ernst Eduard Kummer]] concerning the class number of [[cyclotomic field]]s. Vandiver proved it with a desk calculator up to class number 600, [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Derrick Lehmer]] (in the late 1940s) to about 5000, and Buhler with colleagues (in 2001) to 12 million.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Buhler, [[Richard Crandall]], Reijo Ernvall, Tauno Metsänkylä, M. Amin Shokrollahi ''Irregular primes and cyclotomic invariants to 12 million'', Journal of Symbolic Computation, Vol. 31, 2001, pp. 89–96 {{doi|10.1006/jsco.1999.1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues the project with David Harvey and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=0912.2121|author=Buhler, J.P.|author2=Harvey, D.|title=Irregular primes up to 163 million''|year=2009|class=math.NT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buhler's research deals with algorithmic algebraic number theory, algebra, and [[cryptography]].

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2012.

A '''key generator''' is used in many [[cryptography|cryptographic]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s to generate a sequence with many pseudo-random characteristics.  This sequence is used as an [[encryption]] key at one end of communication, and as a decryption key at the other.

Examples of key generators include [[linear feedback shift register]]s (LFSR) and the [[Solitaire (cipher)|Solitaire]] (or Pontifex) cipher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18774">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Löwenheim–Skolem theorem''', named for [[Leopold Löwenheim]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]], states that if a countable first-order [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] has an infinite [[Interpretation (logic)|model]], then for every infinite [[cardinal number]] κ it has a model of size κ.  The result implies that first-order theories are unable to control the cardinality of their infinite models, and that no first-order theory with an infinite model can have a unique model [[up to isomorphism]].

The (downward) Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is one of the two key properties, along with the [[compactness theorem]], that are used in [[Lindström's theorem]] to characterize [[first-order logic]]. In general, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem does not hold in stronger logics such as [[second-order logic]].

== Background ==
A [[signature (logic)|signature]] consists of a set of function symbols ''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;, a set of relation symbols ''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, and a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ar}: S_{\operatorname{func}}\cup S_{\operatorname{rel}} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;  representing the [[arity]] of function and relation symbols. (A nullary function symbol is called a constant symbol.) In the context of first-order logic, a signature is sometimes called a '''language'''. It is called countable if the set of function and relation symbols in it is countable, and in general the cardinality of a signature is the cardinality of the set of all the symbols it contains.

A first-order '''[[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]]''' consists of a fixed signature and a fixed set of sentences (formulas with no free variables) in that signature. Theories are often specified by giving a list of axioms that generate the theory, or by giving a structure and taking the theory to consist of the sentences satisfied by the structure.

Given a signature σ, a σ-[[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ''M''
is a concrete interpretation of the symbols in σ. It consists of an underlying set (often also denoted by "''M''") together with  an interpretation of the function and relation symbols of σ.  An interpretation of a constant symbol of σ in ''M'' is simply an element of ''M''.  More generally, an interpretation of an ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' is a function from ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''M''. Similarly, an interpretation of a relation symbol ''R'' is an ''n''-ary relation on ''M'', i.e. a subset of&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''substructure''' of a σ-structure ''M'' is obtained by taking a subset ''N'' of ''M'' which is closed under the interpretations of all the function symbols in σ (hence includes the interpretations of all constant symbols in σ), and then restricting the interpretations of the relation symbols to ''N''. An [[elementary substructure]] is a very special case of this; in particular an elementary substructure satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as the original structure (its '''elementary extension''').

== Precise statement ==
[[File:Lowenheim-skolem.svg|thumb|Illustration of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]
The modern statement of the theorem is both more general and stronger than the version for countable signatures stated in the introduction.

In its general form, the '''Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem''' states that for every [[signature (logic)|signature]] σ, every infinite σ-[[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ''M'' and every infinite cardinal number κ ≥ |σ|, there is a σ-structure ''N'' such that |''N''| = κ and
* if κ &lt; |''M''| then ''N'' is an elementary substructure of ''M'';
* if κ &gt; |''M''| then ''N'' is an elementary extension of ''M''.

The theorem is often divided into two parts corresponding to the two bullets above. The part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary substructures of all smaller infinite cardinalities is known as the '''downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem'''. The part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary extensions of all larger cardinalities is known as the '''upward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, B., ''The Logic of Infinity'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2014), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=RXzsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA372 p. 372].&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement given in the introduction follows immediately by taking ''M'' to be an infinite model of the theory. The proof of the upward part of the theorem also shows that a theory with arbitrarily large finite models must have an infinite model; sometimes this is considered to be part of the theorem. For historical variants of the theorem, see the notes below.

== Examples and consequences ==
Let '''N''' denote the natural numbers and '''R''' the reals. It follows from the theorem that the theory of ('''N''', +, ×, 0, 1) (the theory of true first-order arithmetic) has uncountable models, and that the theory of  ('''R''', +, ×, 0, 1) (the theory of [[real closed field]]s) has a countable model. There are, of course, axiomatizations characterizing ('''N''', +, ×, 0, 1) and ('''R''', +, ×, 0, 1) up to isomorphism. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that these axiomatizations cannot be first-order. For example, the completeness of a linear order, which is used to characterize the real numbers as a complete ordered field, is a non-first-order property.

A theory is called '''categorical''' if it has only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was introduced by {{harvtxt|Veblen|1904}}, and for some time thereafter mathematicians hoped they could put mathematics on a solid foundation by describing a categorical first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be categorical. Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].

Many consequences of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed counterintuitive to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of uncountable models of [[true arithmetic]], which satisfy every first-order [[Peano axioms|induction axiom]] but have non-inductive subsets. Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is the existence of a countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are uncountable. This counterintuitive situation came to be known as [[Skolem's paradox]]; it shows that the notion of countability is not [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]].

== Proof sketch ==

=== Downward part ===
For each first-order &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt;-formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(y,x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \,,&lt;/math&gt; the [[axiom of choice]] implies the existence of a function
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi}: M^n\to M&lt;/math&gt;

such that, for all &lt;math&gt;a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} \in M&lt;/math&gt;, either
:&lt;math&gt;M\models\varphi(f_{\varphi} (a_1, \dots, a_n), a_1, \dots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;M\models\neg\exists y \varphi(y, a_1, \dots, a_n) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the axiom of choice again we get a function from the first order formulas &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; to such functions &lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The family of functions &lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a [[preclosure operator]] &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt; on the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;M &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(A) = \{b \in M \mid b = f_{\varphi}(a_1, \dots, a_n); \, \varphi \in \sigma ; \, a_1, \dots, a_n \in A \} &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq M \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Iterating &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt; countably many times results in a [[closure operator]] &lt;math&gt;F^{\omega} \,.&lt;/math&gt; Taking an arbitrary subset &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left\vert A \right\vert = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, and having defined &lt;math&gt;N = F^{\omega}(A) \,,&lt;/math&gt; one can see that also &lt;math&gt;\left\vert N \right\vert = \kappa \,.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; is an elementary substructure of &lt;math&gt;M &lt;/math&gt; by the [[Tarski–Vaught test]].

The trick used in this proof is essentially due to Skolem, who introduced function symbols for the [[Skolem function]]s &lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; into the language. One could also define the &lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; as [[partial function]]s such that &lt;math&gt;f_{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; is defined if and only if &lt;math&gt;M \models \exists y \varphi(y,a_1,\dots,a_n) \,.&lt;/math&gt; The only important point is that &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt; is a preclosure operator such that &lt;math&gt;F(A) &lt;/math&gt; contains a solution for every formula with parameters in &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; which has a solution in &lt;math&gt;M &lt;/math&gt; and that 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert F(A) \right\vert \leq \left\vert A \right\vert + \left\vert \sigma \right\vert + \aleph_0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Upward part ===
First, one extends the signature by adding a new constant symbol for every element of ''M''. The complete theory of ''M'' for the extended signature σ' is called the ''elementary diagram'' of ''M''. In the next step one adds κ many new constant symbols to the signature and adds to the elementary diagram of ''M'' the sentences ''c'' ≠ ''c&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for any two distinct new constant symbols ''c'' and ''c&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. Using the [[compactness theorem]], the resulting theory is easily seen to be consistent. Since its models must have cardinality at least κ, the downward part of this theorem guarantees the existence of a model ''N'' which has cardinality exactly κ. It contains an isomorphic copy of ''M'' as an elementary substructure.

== Historical notes ==
This account is based mainly on {{harvtxt|Dawson|1993}}. To understand the early history of model theory one must distinguish between ''syntactical consistency'' (no contradiction can be derived using the deduction rules for first-order logic) and ''satisfiability'' (there is a model). Somewhat surprisingly, even before the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness theorem]] made the distinction unnecessary, the term ''consistent'' was used sometimes in one sense and sometimes in the other.

The first significant result in what later became [[model theory]] was ''Löwenheim's theorem'' in [[Leopold Löwenheim]]'s publication "Über Möglichkeiten im Relativkalkül" (1915):

:For every countable signature σ, every [[σ-sentence]] which is satisfiable is satisfiable in a countable model.

Löwenheim's paper was actually concerned with the more general Peirce&amp;ndash;Schröder ''[[calculus of relatives]]''  ([[relation algebra]] with quantifiers). He also used the now antiquated notations of [[Ernst Schröder]]. For a summary of the paper in English and using modern notations see {{harvtxt|Brady|2000|loc=chapter 8}}.

According to the received historical view, Löwenheim's proof was faulty because it implicitly used [[Kőnig's lemma]] without proving it, although the lemma was not yet a published result at the time. In a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] account, {{harvtxt|Badesa|2004}} considers that Löwenheim's proof was complete.

{{harvtxt|Skolem|1920}} gave a (correct) proof using formulas in what would later be called ''[[Skolem normal form]]'' and relying on the axiom of choice:

:Every countable theory which is satisfiable in a model ''M'', is satisfiable in a countable substructure of ''M''.

{{harvtxt|Skolem|1923}} also proved the following weaker version without the axiom of choice: 
: Every countable theory which is satisfiable in a model is also satisfiable in a countable model.
{{harvtxt|Skolem|1929}} simplified {{harvtxt|Skolem|1920}}. Finally, [[Anatoly Maltsev|Anatoly Ivanovich Maltsev]] (Анато́лий Ива́нович Ма́льцев, 1936) proved the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem in its full generality {{harv|Maltsev|1936}}. He cited a note by Skolem, according to which the theorem had been proved by [[Alfred Tarski]] in a seminar in 1928. Therefore, the general theorem is sometimes known as the ''Löwenheim–Skolem–Tarski theorem''. But Tarski did not remember his proof, and it remains a mystery how he could do it without the [[compactness theorem]].

It is somewhat ironic that Skolem's name is connected with the upward direction of the theorem as well as with the downward direction:

:''"I follow custom in calling Corollary 6.1.4 the upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. But in fact Skolem didn't even believe it, because he didn't believe in the existence of uncountable sets."'' – {{harvtxt|Hodges|1993}}.

:''"Skolem [...] rejected the result as meaningless; Tarski [...] very reasonably responded that Skolem's formalist viewpoint ought to reckon the downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem meaningless just like the upward."'' – {{harvtxt|Hodges|1993}}.

:''"Legend has it that Thoralf Skolem, up until the end of his life, was scandalized by the association of his name to a result of this type, which he considered an absurdity, nondenumerable sets being, for him, fictions without real existence."'' – {{harvtxt|Poizat|2000}}.

'''''Mathematics Made Difficult''''' is a book by Carl E. Linderholm that uses advanced mathematical methods to prove results normally shown using [[elementary proof]]s.  Although the aim is largely [[satirical]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As an example, the proof that two is a prime number starts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is easily seen that the only numbers between 0 and 2, including 0 but excluding 2, are 0 and 1.  Thus the remainder left by any number on division by 2 is either 0 or 1.  Hence the [[quotient ring]] ''Z''/2''Z'', where 2''Z'' is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in Z generated by 2, has only the [[element (mathematics)|element]]s [0] and [1], where these are the [[image (mathematics)|image]]s of 0 and 1 under the canonical [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient map]].  Since [1] must be the [[unit (mathematics)|unit]] of this ring, every element of this ring except [0] is a unit, and the ring is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ...&lt;ref&gt;Linderholm, Page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10008">A '''matrix difference equation'''&lt;ref&gt;Cull, Paul; [[Mary Flahive|Flahive, Mary]]; and Robson, Robbie. ''Difference Equations: From Rabbits to Chaos'', Springer, 2005, chapter 7; {{ISBN|0-387-23234-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C., ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', third edition, McGraw-Hill, 1984: 608&amp;ndash;612.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[difference equation]] in which the value of a [[Euclidean vector#Representations|vector]] (or sometimes, a matrix) of variables at one point in time is related to its own value at one or more previous points in time, using [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The '''order''' of the equation is the maximum time gap between any two indicated values of the variable vector.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = Ax_{t-1} + Bx_{t-2}&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of a second-order matrix difference equation, in which ''x'' is an ''n'' × 1 vector of variables and ''A'' and ''B'' are ''n×n'' matrices.  This equation is homogeneous because there is no vector constant term added to the end of the equation.  The same equation might also be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;x_{t+2} = Ax_{t+1} + Bx_{t}&lt;/math&gt;

or as 

:&lt;math&gt;x_n = Ax_{n-1} + Bx_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The most commonly encountered matrix difference equations are first-order.

==Non-homogeneous first-order case and the steady state==

An example of a non-homogeneous first-order matrix difference equation is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = Ax_{t-1} + b &lt;/math&gt;

with additive constant vector ''b''.  The steady state of this system is a value ''x*'' of the vector ''x'' which, if reached, would not be deviated from subsequently. ''x*'' is found by setting &lt;math&gt;x_t = x_{t-1}=x^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in the difference equation and solving for ''x*'' to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; x^{*} = [I-A]^{-1}b &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n×n'' [[identity matrix]], and where it is assumed that &lt;math&gt;[I-A]&lt;/math&gt; is invertible.  Then the non-homogeneous equation can be rewritten in homogeneous form in terms of deviations from the steady state:

:&lt;math&gt; [x_t - x^{*}] = A[x_{t-1}-x^{*}]. &lt;/math&gt;

==Stability of the first-order case==

The first-order matrix difference equation [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''x''*] = ''A''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''x''*]  is [[stability theory|stable]]&amp;mdash;that is, &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; converges asymptotically to the steady state ''x*''&amp;mdash;if and only if all [[eigenvalue]]s of the transition matrix ''A'' (whether real or complex) have an [[absolute value]] which is less than 1.

==Solution of the first-order case==

Assume that the equation has been put in the homogeneous form &lt;math&gt;y_t = Ay_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we can iterate and substitute repeatedly from the [[initial condition]] &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;, which is the initial value of the vector ''y'' and which must be known in order to find the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1=Ay_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2=Ay_1=AAy_0 = A^{2}y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_3=Ay_2=AA^{2}y_0=A^{3}y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

and so forth, so that by [[mathematical induction]] the solution in terms of ''t'' is

:&lt;math&gt;y_t=A^t y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Further, if A is diagonalizable, we can rewrite ''A'' in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, giving the solution as

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = PD^{t}P^{-1} y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is an ''n'' × ''n'' matrix whose columns are the [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' (assuming the eigenvalues are all distinct) and ''D'' is an ''n'' × ''n'' diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of ''A''.  This solution motivates the above stability result:  &lt;math&gt;A^t&lt;/math&gt; shrinks to the zero matrix over time if and only if the eigenvalues of ''A'' are all less than unity in absolute value.

==Extracting the dynamics of a single scalar variable from a first-order matrix system==

Starting from the ''n''-dimensional system &lt;math&gt;y_t = Ay_{t-1},&lt;/math&gt; we can extract the dynamics of one of the state variables, say &lt;math&gt;y_1.&lt;/math&gt; The above solution equation for &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; shows that the solution for &lt;math&gt;y_{1,t}&lt;/math&gt; is in terms of the ''n'' eigenvalues of ''A''.  Therefore the equation describing the evolution of &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; by itself must have a solution involving those same eigenvalues.  This description intuitively motivates the equation of evolution of &lt;math&gt;y_1,&lt;/math&gt; which is

:&lt;math&gt; y_{1,t} = a_1 y_{1,t-1} + a_2 y_{1,t-2} + \dots + a_n y_{1,t-n}&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameters &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are from the [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] of the matrix ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n} - a_1 \lambda^{n-1} - a_2 \lambda^{n-2} - \dots - a_n \lambda^{0} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus each individual scalar variable of an ''n''-dimensional first-order linear system evolves according to a univariate ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; degree difference equation, which has the same stability property (stable or unstable) as does the matrix difference equation.

==Solution and stability of higher-order cases==

Matrix difference equations of higher order&amp;mdash;that is, with a time lag longer than one period&amp;mdash;can be solved, and their stability analyzed, by converting them into first-order form using a block matrix.  For example, suppose we have the second-order equation

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = Ax_{t-1} + Bx_{t-2}&lt;/math&gt;

with the variable vector ''x'' being ''n''×1 and ''A'' and ''B'' being ''n''×''n''.  This can be stacked in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x_t \\ x_{t-1} \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \text{A} &amp; \text{B} \\ \text{I} &amp; 0 \\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_{t-1} \\ x_{t-2} \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''×''n'' [[identity matrix]] and 0 is the ''n''×''n'' [[zero matrix]].  Then denoting the 2''n''×1 stacked vector of current and once-lagged variables as &lt;math&gt;z_t&lt;/math&gt; and the 2''n''×2''n'' block matrix as ''L'', we have as before the solution 

:&lt;math&gt;z_t = L^{t} z_0. &lt;/math&gt;

Also as before, this stacked equation and thus the original second-order equation are stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix ''L'' are smaller than unity in absolute value.

==Nonlinear matrix difference equations: Riccati equations==

In [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]], there arises a nonlinear matrix equation for the reverse evolution of a current-and-future-cost ''matrix'', denoted below as ''H''.  This equation is called a discrete dynamic [[Riccati equation]], and it arises when a variable vector evolving according to a linear matrix difference equation is controlled by manipulating an [[exogeny|exogenous]] vector in order to optimize a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[Multi-objective optimization|cost function]].  This Riccati equation assumes the following, or a similar, form:

: &lt;math&gt; H_{t-1} = K +A'H_tA - A'H_tC(C'H_tC+R)^{-1}C'H_tA, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'', ''K'', and ''A'' are ''n''×''n'', ''C'' is ''n''×''k'', ''R'' is ''k''×''k'', ''n'' is the number of elements in the vector to be controlled, and ''k'' is the number of elements in the control vector.  The parameter matrices ''A'' and ''C'' are from the linear equation, and the parameter matrices ''K'' and ''R'' are from the quadratic cost function. See [[Algebraic Riccati equation#Context of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation|here]] for details.

In general this equation cannot be solved analytically for &lt;math&gt;H_t&lt;/math&gt; in terms of ''t'' ; rather, the sequence of values for &lt;math&gt;H_t&lt;/math&gt; is found by iterating the Riccati equation.  However, it was shown in &lt;ref&gt;Balvers, Ronald J., and Mitchell, Douglas W., "Reducing the dimensionality of linear quadratic control problems," ''[[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]'' 31, 2007, 141&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; that this Riccati equation can be solved analytically if ''R'' is the zero matrix and ''n''=''k''+1, by reducing it to a scalar [[rational difference equation]]; moreover, for any ''k'' and ''n'' if the transition matrix ''A'' is nonsingular then the Riccati equation can be solved analytically in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix, although these may need to be found numerically.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, D. R., "A nonrecursive algebraic solution for the discrete Riccati equation," ''IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control'' 15, 1970, 597-599.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most contexts the evolution of ''H'' backwards through time is stable, meaning that ''H'' converges to a particular fixed matrix ''H''* which may be irrational even if all the other matrices are rational. See also [[Stochastic control#Discrete time]].

A related Riccati equation&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. F., and Ammar, G., "The geometry of the matrix Riccati equation and associated eigenvalue method," in Bittani, Laub, and Willems (eds.), ''The Riccati Equation'', Springer-Verlag, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t+1} = -(E+BX_t)(C+AX_t)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

in which the matrices ''X'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''E'' are all ''n''×''n''.   This equation can be solved explicitly.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;X_t = N_t D_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which certainly holds for ''t''=0 with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and with ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equal to the identity matrix.  Then using this in the difference equation yields 

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t+1}=-(E+BN_tD_t^{-1})D_tD_t^{-1}(C+AN_tD_t^{-1})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=-(ED_t+BN_t)[(C+AN_t D_t^{-1})D_t]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=-(ED_t+BN_t)[CD_t+AN_t]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=N_{t+1}D_{t+1}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

so by induction  the form &lt;math&gt;X_t=N_tD_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''t''.  Then the evolution of ''N'' and ''D'' can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} N_{t+1} \\ D_{t+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -B &amp; -E \\ A &amp; C \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} N_t \\ D_t \end{pmatrix} \equiv J \begin{pmatrix}N_t \\ D_t \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} N_t \\ D_t \end{pmatrix} = J^{t} \begin{pmatrix} N_0 \\ D_0 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11808">The '''matroid partitioning''' problem is a problem arising in the mathematical study of [[matroid]]s and in the design and analysis of [[algorithm]]s, in which the goal is to partition the elements of a matroid into as few independent sets as possible. An example is the problem of computing the [[arboricity]] of an [[undirected graph]], the minimum number of [[tree (graph theory)|forests]] needed to cover all of its edges. Matroid partitioning may be solved in [[polynomial time]], given an [[matroid oracle|independence oracle]] for the matroid. It may be generalized to show that a [[matroid sum]] is itself a matroid, to provide an algorithm for computing [[Matroid rank|ranks]] and independent sets in matroid sums, and to compute the largest common independent set in the [[matroid intersection|intersection]] of two given matroids.&lt;ref name="fgt"&gt;{{citation

[[File:K44 arboricity.svg|thumb|A partition of the edges of the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt; into three forests, showing that it has arboricity at most three]]
The [[arboricity]] of an [[undirected graph]] is the minimum number of [[tree (graph theory)|forests]] into which its edges can be partitioned, or equivalently (by adding overlapping edges to each forest as necessary) the minimum number of [[spanning tree|spanning forests]] whose union is the whole graph. A formula proved by [[Crispin Nash-Williams]] characterizes the arboricity exactly: it is the maximum, over all subgraphs &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of the given graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, of the quantity &lt;math&gt;\left\lceil\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The forests of a graph form the independent sets of the associated [[graphic matroid]], and the quantity &lt;math&gt;|V(H)|-1&lt;/math&gt; appearing in Nash-Williams' formula is the rank of the graphic matroid of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum size of one of its independent sets. Thus, the problem of determining the arboricity of a graph is exactly the matroid partitioning problem for the graphic matroid. The fact that the &lt;math&gt;|E(H)|&lt;/math&gt; elements of this matroid cannot be partitioned into fewer than &lt;math&gt;\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1}&lt;/math&gt; independent subsets is then just an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]] saying that, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; items are partitioned into sets of size at most &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then at least &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt; sets are needed. The harder direction of Nash-Williams' formula, which can be generalized to all matroids, is the proof that a partition of this size always exists.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;

==Formula for partition size==
To generalize Nash-Williams' formula, one may replace &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by a matroid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and the subgraph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with a [[matroid minor|restriction]] &lt;math&gt;M|S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of its elements. The number of edges of the subgraph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; becomes, in this generalization, the cardinality &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; of the selected subset, and the formula &lt;math&gt;|V(H)|-1&lt;/math&gt; for the maximum size of a forest in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; becomes the rank &lt;math&gt;r(S)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the minimum number of independent sets in a partition of the given matroid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; should be given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;k(M)=\max_S \left\lceil\frac{|S|}{r(S)}\right\rceil,&lt;/math&gt;
which is valid for all matroids and was given an algorithmic proof by {{harvtxt|Edmonds|1965}}.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e65"&gt;{{citation

==Algorithms==
The first algorithm for matroid partitioning was given by {{harvtxt|Edmonds|1965}}.&lt;ref name="e65"/&gt; It is an incremental augmenting-path algorithm that considers the elements of the matroid one by one, in an arbitrary order, maintaining at each step of the algorithm an optimal partition for the elements that have been considered so far. At each step, when considering an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that has not yet been placed into a partition, the algorithm constructs a [[directed graph]] that has as its nodes the elements that have already been partitioned, the new element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and a special element &lt;math&gt;\bot_i&lt;/math&gt; for each of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; independent sets in the current partition. It then forms a directed graph &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; on this node set, with a directed arc &lt;math&gt;\bot_i\rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; for each matroid element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that can be added to partition set &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; without causing it to become dependent, and with a directed arc &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; for each pair of matroid elements &lt;math&gt;(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that removing &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; from its partition and replacing it with &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; forms another independent set.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e65"/&gt;

If this graph contains a [[directed path]] from an element &lt;math&gt;\bot_i&lt;/math&gt; to the newly considered element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then the shortest such path (or more generally any path that does not have any shortcutting edges) describes a sequence of changes that can be made simultaneously to the partition sets in order to form a new partition, with the same number of sets, that also includes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the algorithm performs these changes and continues. If, on the other hand, no such path exists, then let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; consist of the matroid elements from which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is [[reachability|reachable]] in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. Each set in the current partition must be a maximal independent set in &lt;math&gt;M|S&lt;/math&gt;, for if some element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; could be added to partition set &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the restriction, then either there would exist an arc &lt;math&gt;\bot_i\rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; (if partition set &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is non-maximal in the full matroid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) or an arc &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;z\notin S&lt;/math&gt; (if the partition set is non-maximal in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; but maximal in the full matroid). In either case the existence of this arc contradicts the assumed construction of the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and the contradiction proves that each partition set is maximal. Thus, by the easy direction of the matroid partitioning formula, the number of sets needed to partition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is at least
:&lt;math&gt;\left\lceil\frac{|S|}{r(S)}\right\rceil=\left\lceil\frac{kr(S)+1}{r(S)}\right\rceil=k+1&lt;/math&gt;,
so in this case the algorithm may find an optimal partition by placing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; into its own new independent set and leaving the other independent sets unchanged.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e65"/&gt;

The overall algorithm, then, considers  each element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the given matroid in turn, constructs the graph &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt;, tests which nodes can reach &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and uses this information to update the current partition so that it includes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. At each step, the partition of the elements considered so far is optimal, so when the algorithm terminates it will have found an optimal partition for the whole matroid.
Proving that this algorithm is correct requires showing that a shorcut-free path in the auxiliary graph always describes a sequence of operations that, when performed simultaneously, correctly preserves the independence of the sets in the partition; a proof of this fact was given by Edmonds.
Because the algorithm only increases the number of sets in the partition when the matroid partitioning formula shows that a larger number is needed, the correctness of this algorithm also shows the correctness of the formula.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e65"/&gt;

Although this algorithm depends only on the existence of an [[matroid oracle|independence oracle]] for its correctness, faster algorithms can be found in many cases by taking advantage of the more specialized structure of specific types of matroids (such as [[graphic matroid]]s) from which a particular partitioning problem has been defined.&lt;ref name="gw92"&gt;{{citation

==Related problems==
A [[matroid sum]] &lt;math&gt;\sum_i M_i&lt;/math&gt; (where each &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is a matroid) is itself a matroid, having as its elements the union of the elements of the summands. A set is independent in the sum if it can be partitioned into sets that are independent within each summand. The matroid partitioning algorithm generalizes to the problem of testing whether a set is independent in a matroid sum, and its correctness can be used to prove that a matroid sum is necessarily a matroid.&lt;ref name="e65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gw92"/&gt;

The [[matroid intersection]] problem of finding the largest set that is independent in two matroids &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; may be solved by turning it into an equivalent matroid sum problem: if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a basis of the sum &lt;math&gt;M_1+M_2^*&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M_2^*&lt;/math&gt; is the dual of &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; must have full rank in &lt;math&gt;M_2^*&lt;/math&gt; and removing a maximal independent set of &lt;math&gt;M_2^*&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; leaves a maximum intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Matroid partitioning is a form of [[set cover]] problem, and the corresponding [[set packing]] problem (find a maximum number of disjoint spanning sets within a given matroid) is also of interest. It can be solved by algorithms similar to those for matroid partitioning.&lt;ref name="gw92"/&gt; The fractional set packing and set covering problems associated with a matroid (that is, assign a weight to each independent set in such a way that for every element the total weight of the sets containing it is at most one or at least one, maximizing or minimizing the total weight of all the sets, respectively) can also be solved in polynomial time using matroid partitioning methods.&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;

As well as its use in calculating the arboricity of a graph, matroid partitioning can be used with other matroids to find a subgraph of a given graph whose average [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] is maximum, and to find the edge toughness of a graph (a variant of [[graph toughness]] involving the deletion of edges in place of vertices).&lt;ref name="fgt"/&gt;

'''Mechanism design''' is a field in [[economics]] and [[game theory]] that takes an [[engineering]] approach to designing economic mechanisms or [[Economic incentive|incentives]], toward desired objectives, in [[Strategy (game theory)|strategic settings]], where players act [[Rational choice theory|rationally]]. Because it starts at the end of the game, then goes backwards, it is also called '''reverse game theory'''. It has broad applications, from economics and politics (markets, auctions, voting procedures) to networked-systems (internet interdomain routing, sponsored search auctions).

Mechanism design studies [[solution concept]]s for a class of private-information games. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] explains that 'in a design problem, the goal function is the main "given", while the
mechanism is the unknown. Therefore, the design problem is the "inverse" of traditional economic theory, which is typically devoted to the analysis of the performance of a given mechanism.'&lt;ref&gt;L. Hurwicz &amp; S. Reiter (2006) [[Designing Economic Mechanisms]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; So, two distinguishing features of these games are:

* that a game "designer" chooses the game structure rather than inheriting one
* that the designer is interested in the game's outcome

The 2007 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] was awarded to [[Leonid Hurwicz]], [[Eric Maskin]], and [[Roger Myerson]] "for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2007/press.html |title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2007 |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuition==

In an interesting class of [[Bayesian game]]s, one player, called the "principal", would like to condition his behavior on information privately known to other players. For example, the principal would like to know the true quality of a used car a salesman is pitching. He cannot learn anything simply by asking the salesman, because it is in his interest to distort the truth. However, in mechanism design the principal does have one advantage: He may design a game whose rules can influence others to act the way he would like.

Without mechanism design theory, the principal's problem would be difficult to solve. He would have to consider all the possible games and choose the one that best influences other players' tactics. In addition, the principal would have to draw conclusions from agents who may lie to him. Thanks to mechanism design, and particularly the [[revelation principle]], the principal only needs to consider games in which agents truthfully report their private information.

==Foundations==

===Mechanism===

A game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents, called the principal, chooses the payoff structure. Following {{harvs|txt|last=Harsanyi|year=1967|author-link=John Harsanyi}}, the agents receive secret "messages" from nature containing information relevant to payoffs. For example, a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale. We call this information the agent's "type" (usually noted &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and accordingly the space of types &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;). Agents then report a type to the principal (usually noted with a hat &lt;math&gt;\hat\theta&lt;/math&gt;) that can be a strategic lie. After the report, the principal and the agents are paid according to the payoff structure the principal chose.

The timing of the game is:

# The principal commits to a mechanism &lt;math&gt;y()&lt;/math&gt; that grants an outcome &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a function of reported type
# The agents report, possibly dishonestly, a type profile &lt;math&gt;\hat\theta&lt;/math&gt;
# The mechanism is executed (agents receive outcome &lt;math&gt;y(\hat\theta)&lt;/math&gt;)

In order to understand who gets what, it is common to divide the outcome &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; into a goods allocation and a money transfer, &lt;math&gt;y(\theta) = \{ x(\theta), t(\theta) \}, \ x \in X, t \in T &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; stands for an allocation of goods rendered or received as a function of type, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; stands for a monetary transfer as a function of type.

As a benchmark the designer often defines what would happen under full information. Define a '''{{vanchor|social choice function}}''' &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; mapping the (true) type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta): \Theta \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast a '''mechanism''' maps the ''reported'' type profile to an ''outcome'' (again, both a goods allocation &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a money transfer &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;y(\hat\theta): \Theta \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;

===Revelation principle===
{{main|Revelation principle}}

A proposed mechanism constitutes a Bayesian game (a game of private information), and if it is well-behaved the game has a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]]. At equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type
:&lt;math&gt;\hat\theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

It is difficult to solve for Bayesian equilibria in such a setting because it involves solving for agents' best-response strategies and for the best inference from a possible strategic lie. Thanks to a sweeping result called the revelation principle, no matter the mechanism a  designer can&lt;ref&gt;In unusual circumstances some truth-telling games have more equilibria than the Bayesian game they mapped from. See Fudenburg-Tirole Ch. 7.2 for some references.&lt;/ref&gt; confine attention to equilibria in which agents truthfully report type. The '''revelation principle''' states: "To every Bayesian Nash equilibrium there corresponds a Bayesian game with the same equilibrium outcome but in which players truthfully report type."

This is extremely useful. The principle allows one to solve for a Bayesian equilibrium by assuming all players truthfully report type (subject to an [[incentive compatibility]] constraint). In one blow it eliminates the need to consider either strategic behavior or lying.

Its proof is quite direct. Assume a Bayesian game in which the agent's strategy and payoff are functions of its type and what others do, &lt;math&gt;u_i\left(s_i(\theta_i),s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}), \theta_{i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. By definition agent ''i'''s equilibrium strategy &lt;math&gt;s(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt; is Nash in expected utility:
:&lt;math&gt;s_i(\theta_i) \in \arg\max_{s'_i \in S_i} \sum_{\theta_{-i}} \ p(\theta_{-i} \mid \theta_i) \ u_i\left(s'_i, s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}),\theta_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Simply define a mechanism that would induce agents to choose the same equilibrium. The easiest one to define is for the mechanism to commit to playing the agents' equilibrium strategies ''for'' them.
:&lt;math&gt;y(\hat\theta) : \Theta \rightarrow S(\Theta) \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt;

Under such a mechanism the agents of course find it optimal to reveal type since the mechanism plays the strategies they found optimal anyway. Formally, choose &lt;math&gt;y(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; such that
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\theta_i \in {} &amp; \arg\max_{\theta'_i \in \Theta} \sum_{\theta_{-i}} \ p(\theta_{-i} \mid \theta_i) \ u_i\left( y(\theta'_i, \theta_{-i}),\theta_i \right) \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{\theta_{-i}} \ p(\theta_{-i} \mid \theta_i) \ u_i\left(s_i(\theta), s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}),\theta_i \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Implementability===

The designer of a mechanism generally hopes either
* to design a mechanism &lt;math&gt;y()&lt;/math&gt; that "implements" a social choice function
* to find the mechanism &lt;math&gt;y()&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes some value criterion (e.g. profit)

To '''implement''' a social choice function &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is to find some &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; transfer function that motivates agents to pick outcome &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, if the equilibrium strategy profile under the mechanism maps to the same goods allocation as a social choice function,
:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = x \left(\hat\theta(\theta) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
we say the mechanism implements the social choice function.

Thanks to the revelation principle, the designer can usually find a transfer function &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; to implement a social choice by solving an associated truthtelling game. If agents find it optimal to truthfully report type,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat\theta(\theta) = \theta&lt;/math&gt;
we say such a mechanism is '''truthfully implementable''' (or just "implementable"). The task is then to solve for a truthfully implementable &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and impute this transfer function to the original game. An allocation &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is truthfully implementable if there exists a transfer function &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; such that
: &lt;math&gt;u(x(\theta),t(\theta),\theta) \geq u(x(\hat\theta),t(\hat\theta),\theta) \ \forall \theta,\hat\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt;
which is also called the '''incentive compatibility''' (IC) constraint.

In applications, the IC condition is the key to describing the shape of &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in any useful way. Under certain conditions it can even isolate the transfer function analytically.  Additionally, a participation ([[individual rationality]]) constraint is sometimes added if agents have the option of not playing.

====Necessity====

Consider a setting in which all agents have a type-contingent utility function &lt;math&gt;u(x,t,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider also a goods allocation &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; that is vector-valued and size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (which permits &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; number of goods) and assume it is piecewise continuous with respect to its arguments.

The function &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is implementable only if
:&lt;math&gt; \sum^n_{k=1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \frac{\partial u / \partial x_k}{\left|\partial u / \partial t\right|} \right) \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
whenever &lt;math&gt;x=x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t=t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and ''x'' is continuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. This is a necessary condition and is derived from the first- and second-order conditions of the agent's optimization problem assuming truth-telling.

Its meaning can be understood in two pieces. The first piece says the agent's [[marginal rate of substitution]] (MRS) increases as a function of the type,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \partial {\partial \theta} \left( \frac{\partial u / \partial x_k}{\left|\partial u / \partial t\right|} \right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \mathrm{MRS}_{x,t}&lt;/math&gt;
In short, agents will not tell the truth if the mechanism does not offer higher agent types a better deal. Otherwise, higher types facing any mechanism that punishes high types for reporting will lie and declare they are lower types, violating the truthtelling IC constraint. The second piece is a monotonicity condition waiting to happen,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
which, to be positive, means higher types must be given more of the good.

There is potential for the two pieces to interact. If for some type range the contract offered less quantity to higher types &lt;math&gt;\partial x / \partial \theta &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible the mechanism could compensate by giving higher types a discount. But such a contract already exists for low-type agents, so this solution is pathological. Such a solution sometimes occurs in the process of solving for a mechanism. In these cases it must be "[[Mechanism design#Myerson ironing|ironed]]." In a multiple-good environment it is also possible for the designer to reward the agent with more of one good to substitute for less of another (e.g. [[butter]] for [[margarine]]). Multiple-good mechanisms are an ongoing problem in mechanism design theory.

====Sufficiency====

Mechanism design papers usually make two assumptions to ensure implementability:
:&lt;math&gt;1. \ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial u / \partial x_k}{\left|\partial u / \partial t\right|} &gt; 0 \ \forall k&lt;/math&gt;
This is known by several names: the [[single-crossing condition]], the sorting condition and the Spence–Mirrlees condition. It means the utility function is of such a shape that the agent's MRS is increasing in type.
:&lt;math&gt;2. \ \exists K_0, K_1 \text{ such that } \left| \frac{\partial u / \partial x_k}{\partial u / \partial t} \right| \leq K_0 + K_1 |t|&lt;/math&gt;
This is a technical condition bounding the rate of growth of the MRS.

These assumptions are sufficient to provide that any monotonic &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is implementable (a &lt;math&gt;t(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; exists that can implement it). In addition, in the single-good setting the single-crossing condition is sufficient to provide that only a monotonic &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is implementable, so the designer can confine his search to a monotonic &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Highlighted results==

===Revenue equivalence theorem===
{{main|Revenue equivalence}}

{{harvs|txt|last=Vickrey|year=1961|author-link=William Vickrey}} gives a celebrated result that any member of a large class of auctions assures the seller of the same expected revenue and that the expected revenue is the best the seller can do. This is the case if
# The buyers have identical valuation functions (which may be a function of type)
# The buyers' types are independently distributed
# The buyers types are drawn from a [[Continuous distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous distribution]]
# The type distribution bears the monotone hazard rate property
# The mechanism sells the good to the buyer with the highest valuation

The last condition is crucial to the theorem. An implication is that for the seller to achieve higher revenue he must take a chance on giving the item to an agent with a lower valuation. Usually this means he must risk not selling the item at all.

===Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanisms===
{{main|Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism}}

The Vickrey (1961) auction model was later expanded by {{harvs|txt|last=Clarke|year=1971|author-link=Edward H. Clarke}} and Groves to treat a public choice problem in which a public project's cost is borne by all agents, e.g. whether to build a municipal bridge. The resulting "Vickrey–Clarke–Groves" mechanism can motivate agents to choose the socially efficient allocation of the public good even if agents have privately known valuations. In other words, it can solve the "[[tragedy of the commons]]"—under certain conditions, in particular quasilinear utility or if budget balance is not required.

Consider a setting in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; number of agents have quasilinear utility with private valuations &lt;math&gt;v(x,t,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where the currency &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is valued linearly. The VCG designer designs an incentive compatible (hence truthfully implementable) mechanism to obtain the true type profile, from which the designer implements the socially optimal allocation
:&lt;math&gt; x^*_I(\theta) \in \underset{x\in X}{\operatorname{argmax}} \sum_{i \in I} v(x,\theta_i) &lt;/math&gt;

The cleverness of the VCG mechanism is the way it motivates truthful revelation. It eliminates incentives to misreport by penalizing any agent by the cost of the distortion he causes. Among the reports the agent may make, the VCG mechanism permits a "null" report saying he is indifferent to the public good and cares only about the money transfer. This effectively removes the agent from the game. If an agent does choose to report a type, the VCG mechanism charges the agent a fee if his report is '''pivotal''', that is if his report changes the optimal allocation ''x'' so as to harm other agents. The payment is calculated
:&lt;math&gt; t_i(\hat\theta) = \sum_{j \in I-i} v_j(x^*_{I-i}(\theta_{I-i}),\theta_j) - \sum_{j \in I-i} v_j(x^*_I (\hat\theta_i,\theta_I),\theta_j) &lt;/math&gt;
which sums the distortion in the utilities of the other agents (and not his own) caused by one agent reporting.

===Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem===

{{main|Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem}}

{{harvs|txt|last=Gibbard|year=1973|author-link=Allan Gibbard}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Satterthwaite|year=1975|author-link=Mark Satterthwaite}} give an impossibility result similar in spirit to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]. For a very general class of games, only "dictatorial" social choice functions can be implemented.

A social choice function ''f''() is '''dictatorial''' if one agent always receives his most-favored goods allocation,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{for } f(\Theta)\text{, } \exists i \in I \text{ such that } u_i(x,\theta_i) \geq u_i(x',\theta_i) \ \forall x' \in X&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem states that under general conditions any truthfully implementable social choice function must be dictatorial,
# ''X'' is finite and contains at least three elements
# Preferences are rational
# &lt;math&gt;f(\Theta) = X&lt;/math&gt;

===Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem===
{{main|Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem}}

{{harvs|txt|last=Myerson|last2=Satterthwaite|year=1983|author-link=Roger Myerson}} show there is no efficient way for two parties to trade a good when they each have secret and probabilistically varying valuations for it, without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss. It is among the most remarkable negative results in economics—a kind of negative mirror to the [[fundamental theorems of welfare economics]].

==Examples==

===Price discrimination===

{{harvs|txt|last=Mirrlees|year=1971|author-link=James Mirrlees}} introduces a setting in which the transfer function ''t''() is easy to solve for. Due to its relevance and tractability it is a common setting in the literature. Consider a single-good, single-agent setting in which the agent has [[quasilinear utility]] with an unknown type parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t,\theta) = V(x,\theta) - t&lt;/math&gt;
and in which the principal has a prior [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]] over the agent's type &lt;math&gt;P(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. The principal can produce goods at a convex marginal cost ''c''(''x'') and wants to maximize the expected profit from the transaction
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x(\theta),t(\theta)} \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ t(\theta) - c\left(x(\theta)\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
subject to IC and IR conditions
:&lt;math&gt; u(x(\theta),t(\theta),\theta) \geq u(x(\theta'),t(\theta'),\theta) \ \forall \theta,\theta' &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; u(x(\theta),t(\theta),\theta) \geq \underline{u}(\theta) \ \forall \theta &lt;/math&gt;
The principal here is a monopolist trying to set a profit-maximizing price scheme in which it cannot identify the type of the customer. A common example is an airline setting fares for business, leisure and student travelers. Due to the IR condition it has to give every type a good enough deal to induce participation. Due to the IC condition it has to give every type a good enough deal that the type prefers its deal to that of any other.

A trick given by Mirrlees (1971) is to use the [[envelope theorem]] to eliminate the transfer function from the expectation to be maximized,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{let } U(\theta) = \max_{\theta'} u\left(x(\theta'),t(\theta'),\theta \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{d\theta} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating,
:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta) = \underline{u}(\theta_0) + \int^\theta_{\theta_0} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \tilde\theta} d\tilde\theta&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt; is some index type. Replacing the incentive-compatible &lt;math&gt;t(\theta) = V(x(\theta),\theta) - U(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; in the maximand,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ V(x(\theta),\theta) - \underline{u}(\theta_0) - \int^\theta_{\theta_0} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \tilde\theta} d\tilde\theta - c\left(x(\theta)\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ V(x(\theta),\theta) - \underline{u}(\theta_0) - \frac{1-P(\theta)}{p(\theta)} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} - c\left(x(\theta)\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
after an integration by parts. This function can be maximized pointwise.

Because &lt;math&gt;U(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is incentive-compatible already the designer can drop the IC constraint. If the utility function satisfies the Spence–Mirrlees condition then a monotonic &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; function exists. The IR constraint can be checked at equilibrium and the fee schedule raised or lowered accordingly. Additionally, note the presence of a [[hazard rate]] in the expression. If the type distribution bears the monotone hazard ratio property, the FOC is sufficient to solve for ''t''(). If not, then it is necessary to check whether the monotonicity constraint (see [[Mechanism design#Sufficiency|sufficiency]], above) is satisfied everywhere along the allocation and fee schedules. If not, then the designer must use Myerson ironing.

===Myerson ironing===

[[Image:Myerson ironing.png|thumb|325px| It is possible to solve for a goods or price schedule that satisfies the first-order conditions yet is not monotonic. If so it is necessary to "iron" the schedule by choosing some value at which to flatten the function.]]

In some applications the designer may solve the first-order conditions for the price and allocation schedules yet find they are not monotonic. For example, in the quasilinear setting this often happens when the hazard ratio is itself not monotone. By the Spence–Mirrlees condition the optimal price and allocation schedules must be monotonic, so the designer must eliminate any interval over which the schedule changes direction by flattening it.

Intuitively, what is going on is the designer finds it optimal to '''bunch''' certain types together and give them the same contract. Normally the designer motivates higher types to distinguish themselves by giving them a better deal. If there are insufficiently few higher types on the margin the designer does not find it worthwhile to grant lower types a concession (called their [[information rent]]) in order to charge higher types a type-specific contract.

Consider a monopolist principal selling to agents with quasilinear utility, the example above. Suppose the allocation schedule &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the first-order conditions has a single interior peak at &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and a single interior trough at &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;, illustrated at right.

* Following Myerson (1981) flatten it by choosing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
:: &lt;math&gt; \int^{\phi_1(x)}_{\phi_2(x)} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{1-P(\theta)}{p(\theta)} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \theta \, \partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}(x) \right) d\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;\phi_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse function of x mapping to &lt;math&gt;\theta \leq \theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;is the inverse function of x mapping to &lt;math&gt;\theta \geq \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; returns a &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; before the interior peak and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; returns a &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; after the interior trough.

* If the nonmonotonic region of &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; borders the edge of the type space, simply set the appropriate &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; function (or both) to the boundary type. If there are multiple regions, see a textbook for an iterative procedure; it may be that more than one troughs should be ironed together.

====Proof====

The proof uses the theory of optimal control. It considers the set of intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[\underline\theta, \overline\theta \right] &lt;/math&gt; in the nonmonotonic region of &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; over which it might flatten the schedule. It then writes a Hamiltonian to obtain necessary conditions for a &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; within the intervals
# that does satisfy monotonicity
# for which the monotonicity constraint is not binding on the boundaries of the interval
Condition two ensures that the &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the optimal control problem reconnects to the schedule in the original problem at the interval boundaries (no jumps). Any &lt;math&gt;x(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the necessary conditions must be flat because it must be monotonic and yet reconnect at the boundaries.

As before maximize the principal's expected payoff, but this time subject to the monotonicity constraint
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;
and use a Hamiltonian to do it, with shadow price &lt;math&gt;\nu(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = \left( V(x,\theta) - \underline{u}(\theta_0) - \frac{1-P(\theta)}{p(\theta)} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}(x,\theta) - c(x) \right)p(\theta) + \nu(\theta) \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a state variable and &lt;math&gt;\partial x/\partial \theta&lt;/math&gt; the control. As usual in optimal control the costate evolution equation must satisfy
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = -\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{1-P(\theta)}{p(\theta)} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \theta \, \partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}(x) \right) p(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
Taking advantage of condition 2, note the monotonicity constraint is not binding at the boundaries of the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; interval,
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(\underline\theta) = \nu(\overline\theta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
meaning the costate variable condition can be integrated and also equals 0
:&lt;math&gt;\int^{\overline\theta}_{\underline\theta} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{1-P(\theta)}{p(\theta)} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \theta \, \partial x}(x,\theta) - \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}(x) \right) p(\theta) \, d\theta = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
The average distortion of the principal's surplus must be 0. To flatten the schedule, find an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that its inverse image maps to a &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; interval satisfying the condition above.

Message authentication is typically achieved by using [[message authentication code]]s (MACs), [[authenticated encryption]] (AE) or [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name=hac /&gt; The message authentication code, also known as digital authenticator, is used as an integrity check based on a secret key shared by two parties to authenticate information transmitted between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information Security: Theory and Practice|last=Patel|first=Dhiren|publisher=Prentice Hall India Private Lt.|year=2008|isbn=9788120333512|location=New Delhi|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on using a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] or [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Information Security: The Application of Systems Engineering Concepts to Achieve Information Assurance|last=Jacobs|first=Stuart|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|year=2011|isbn=9780470565124|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authentication key is only shared by at least two parties or two communicating devices but it will fail in the existence of a third party since the algorithm will no longer be effective in detecting forgeries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer and Information Security Handbook|last=Vacca|first=John|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780123743541|location=Burlington, MA|pages=111-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the key must also be randomly generated to avoid its recovery through brute force searches and related key attacks designed to identify it from the messages transiting the medium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some cryptographers distinguish between "message authentication without secrecy" systems -- which allow the intended receiver to verify the source of the message, but don't bother hiding the plaintext contents of the message -- from [[authenticated encryption]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;

Some cryptographers have researched [[subliminal channel]] systems that send messages that appear to use a "message authentication without secrecy" system, but in fact also transmit a secret message.

The '''pseudorandom-function advantage''' ('''PRF advantage''') of an algorithm on a [[pseudorandom function family]] is a measure of how effectively the algorithm can distinguish between a member of the family and a [[random oracle]]. Consequently, the maximum pseudorandom advantage attainable by any algorithm with a fixed amount of computational resources is a measure of how well such a function family emulates a random oracle. 

Say that an adversary algorithm has access to an oracle that will apply a function to inputs that are sent to it. The algorithm sends the oracle a number of queries before deciding whether the oracle is a random oracle or simply an instance of the pseudorandom function family. Say also that there is a 50% chance that the oracle is a random oracle and a 50% chance that it is a member of the function family. The pseudorandom advantage of the algorithm is defined as two times the probability that the algorithm guesses correctly minus one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shafi Goldwasser|Goldwasser, S.]] and [[Mihir Bellare|Bellare, M.]] [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/gb.html "Lecture Notes on Cryptography"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">{{about|the applications of asymptotic safety|a detailed introduction to asymptotic safety|Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity}}

The [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|'''asymptotic safety''']] approach to [[quantum gravity]] provides a nonperturbative notion of [[renormalization]] in order to find a consistent and predictive [[quantum field theory]] of the [[Gravitation|gravitational interaction]] and [[spacetime]] geometry. It is based upon a nontrivial fixed point of the corresponding [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow such that the running [[coupling constants]] approach this [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This suffices to avoid divergences in physical observables. Moreover, it has predictive power: Generically an arbitrary starting configuration of coupling constants given at some RG scale does not run into the fixed point for increasing scale, but a subset of configurations might have the desired UV properties. For this reason it is possible that — assuming a particular set of couplings has been measured in an experiment — the requirement of [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] fixes all remaining couplings in such a way that the UV fixed point is approached.

Asymptotic safety, if realized in Nature, has far reaching consequences in all areas where quantum effects of gravity are to be expected. Their exploration, however, is still in its infancy. By now there are some phenomenological studies concerning the implications of asymptotic safety in [[particle physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], for instance.

== Asymptotic safety and the parameters of the Standard Model ==

=== The mass of the Higgs boson ===

The [[Standard Model]] in combination with [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotic safety]] might be valid up to arbitrarily high energies. Based on the assumption that this is indeed correct it is possible to make a statement about the [[Higgs boson]] mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Callaway|first1=D.|last2=Petronzio|first2=R.|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(87)90657-2|title=Is the standard model Higgs mass predictable?|journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]]|volume=292|pages=497|year=1987|bibcode=1987NuPhB.292..497C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concrete results were obtained by Shaposhnikov and [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaposhnikov|first=Mikhail|author2=Wetterich, Christof|title=Asymptotic safety of gravity and the Higgs boson mass|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2010|volume=683|issue=2-3|pages=196–200|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.12.022|arxiv=0912.0208|bibcode = 2010PhLB..683..196S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the sign of the gravity induced [[anomalous dimension]] &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; there are two possibilities: For &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the Higgs mass &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to the window &lt;math&gt;126\,\text{GeV} &lt; m_\text{H} &lt; 174\,\text{GeV}&lt;/math&gt;. If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; which is the favored possibility, &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; must take the value
:&lt;math&gt;
m_\text{H}=126\,\text{GeV} ,
&lt;/math&gt;
with an uncertainty of a few GeV only. In this spirit one can consider &lt;math&gt;m_\text{H}&lt;/math&gt; a prediction of asymptotic safety. The result is in surprisingly good agreement with the latest experimental data measured at [[CERN]] by the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] collaborations.

=== The fine structure constant ===

By taking into account the gravitational correction to the running of the [[fine structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of [[quantum electrodynamics]], Harst and Reuter were able to study the impacts of asymptotic safety on the infrared (renormalized) value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harst|first=Ulrich|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=QED coupled to QEG|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2011|volume=2011|issue=5|pages=119|doi=10.1007/JHEP05(2011)119|arxiv=1101.6007|bibcode = 2011JHEP...05..119H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They found two [[UV fixed point|fixed points]] suitable for the asymptotic safety construction both of which imply a well-behaved UV limit, without running into a [[Landau pole]] type singularity. The first one is characterized by a vanishing &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and the infrared value &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{IR}&lt;/math&gt; is a free parameter. In the second case, however, the fixed point value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero, and its infrared value is a computable prediction of the theory.

In a more recent study, Christiansen and Eichhorn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Nicolai|author2=Eichhorn, Astrid|title=An asymptotically safe solution to the U(1) triviality problem|journal=Physics Letters B|year=2017|volume=770|pages=154-160|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2017.04.047|arxiv=1702.07724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that quantum fluctuations of gravity generically generate self-interactions for gauge theories, which have to be included in a discussion of a potential ultraviolet completion. Depending on the gravitational and gauge parameters, they conclude that the fine structure constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; might be asymptotically free and not run into a [[Landau pole]], while the induced coupling for the gauge self-interaction is irrelevant and thus its value can be predicted. This is an explicit example where Asymptotic Safety solves a problem of the [[Standard Model]] - the triviality of the U(1) sector - without introducing new free parameters.

== Asymptotic safety in astrophysics and cosmology ==

Phenomenological consequences of asymptotic safety can be expected also for [[astrophysics]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Bonanno and Reuter investigated the [[Event horizon|horizon]] structure of "[[renormalization group]] improved" [[black hole]]s and computed quantum gravity corrections to the [[Hawking radiation|Hawking temperature]] and the corresponding thermodynamical [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Renormalization group improved black hole spacetimes|journal=Physical Review D|year=2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=043008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.62.043008|arxiv=hep-th/0002196|bibcode = 2000PhRvD..62d3008B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By means of an RG improvement of the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], Reuter and Weyer obtained a modified version of the [[Einstein equations]] which in turn results in a [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics|modification of the Newtonian limit]], providing a possible explanation for the observed flat [[galaxy rotation curve]]s without having to postulate the presence of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|author2=Weyer, Holger|title=Running Newton constant, improved gravitational actions, and galaxy rotation curves|journal=Physical Review D|year=2004|volume=70|issue=12|pages=124028|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.124028|arxiv=hep-th/0410117|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..70l4028R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for cosmology, Bonanno and Reuter argued that asymptotic safety modifies the very early Universe, possibly leading to a resolution to the [[Horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]] of standard cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Cosmology of the Planck era from a renormalization group for quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=65|issue=4|pages=043508|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508|arxiv=hep-th/0106133|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65d3508B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, asymptotic safety provides the possibility of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] without the need of an [[inflaton|inflaton field]] (while driven by the [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=Alfio|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Entropy signature of the running cosmological constant|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|year=2007|volume=2007|issue=08|pages=024|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2007/08/024|arxiv=0706.0174|bibcode = 2007JCAP...08..024B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was reasoned that the [[scale invariance]] related to the non-Gaussian fixed point underlying asymptotic safety is responsible for the near scale invariance of the [[Structure formation#Very early universe|primordial density perturbations]]. Using different methods, asymptotically safe inflation was analyzed further by Weinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|title=Asymptotically safe inflation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2010|volume=81|issue=8|pages=083535|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.083535|arxiv=0911.3165|bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81h3535W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré conjecture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|w|æ̃|k|ɑː|ˈ|r|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|pwɛ̃kaʁe|lang}})&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|Poincaré, Jules Henri}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[theorem]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[3-sphere]], which is the [[hypersphere]] that bounds the [[unit ball]] in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: {{quote|Every [[simply connected space|simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]].}} An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than [[homeomorphism]] called [[homotopy equivalence]]: if a 3-manifold is ''homotopy equivalent'' to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily ''homeomorphic'' to it.

Originally conjectured by [[Henri Poincaré]], the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).  The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere.  The [[generalized Poincaré conjecture|analogous conjecture]]s for all higher dimensions had already been proved.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [[Grigori Perelman]] presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [[arXiv]]. The proof built upon the program of [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to use the [[Ricci flow]] to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''Ricci flow with surgery'' to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method "converged" in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard S. | authorlink = Richard S.

Several teams of mathematicians verified that Perelman's proof was correct.

The Poincaré conjecture, before being proved, was one of the most important open questions in [[topology]].  In 2000, it was named one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], for which the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution. Perelman's work survived review and was confirmed in 2006, leading to his being offered a [[Fields Medal]], which he declined. Perelman was awarded the Millennium Prize on March 18, 2010.&lt;ref name="press-release-2010-03-18"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]]| date=March 18, 2010 | format=PDF | title = Prize for Resolution of the Poincaré Conjecture Awarded to Dr. Grigoriy Perelman|url = http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/millenniumprizefull.pdf | accessdate=November 13, 2015 | quote = The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) announces today that Dr. Grigoriy Perelman of St. Petersburg, Russia, is the recipient of the Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincaré conjecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2010, he turned down the prize saying that he believed his contribution in proving the Poincaré conjecture was no greater than Hamilton's.&lt;ref name="interfax"&gt;{{cite web|title=Последнее "нет" доктора Перельмана''|trans-title=The last "no" Dr. Perelman|url=http://www.interfax.ru/society/txt.asp?id=143603|website=[[Interfax]]|accessdate=5 April 2016|language=Russian|date=July 1, 2010}}

==History==

===Poincaré's question===
{{Refimprove section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Henri Poincaré]] was working on the foundations of topology—what would later be called [[combinatorial topology]] and then [[algebraic topology]].  He was particularly interested in what topological properties characterized a [[sphere]].

Poincaré claimed in 1900 that [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], a tool he had devised based on prior work by [[Enrico Betti]], was sufficient to tell if a [[3-manifold]] was a [[3-sphere]].  However, in a 1904 paper he described a counterexample to this claim, a space now called the [[Poincaré homology sphere]].  The Poincaré sphere was the first example of a [[homology sphere]], a manifold that had the same homology as a sphere, of which many others have since been constructed.  To establish that the Poincaré sphere was different from the 3-sphere, Poincaré introduced a new [[topological invariant]], the [[fundamental group]], and showed that the Poincaré sphere had a [[fundamental group]] of order 120, while the 3-sphere had a trivial fundamental group.  In this way he was able to conclude that these two spaces were, indeed, different.

In the same paper, Poincaré wondered whether a 3-manifold with the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a 3-sphere and also trivial fundamental group had to be a 3-sphere.  Poincaré's new condition—i.e., "trivial fundamental group"—can be restated as "every loop can be shrunk to a point."

The original phrasing was as follows:

{{Quote|Consider a compact 3-dimensional manifold V without boundary.  Is it possible that the fundamental group of V could be trivial, even though V is not homeomorphic to the 3-dimensional sphere?}}

Poincaré never declared whether he believed this additional condition would characterize the 3-sphere, but nonetheless, the statement that it does is known as the Poincaré conjecture.  Here is the standard form of the conjecture:

{{Quote|Every [[simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere.}}

===Attempted solutions===
This problem seemed to lay dormant until [[J. H. C. Whitehead]] revived interest in the conjecture, when in the 1930s he first claimed a proof and then retracted it.  In the process, he discovered some interesting examples of simply-connected (indeed contractible, i.e homotopically equivalent to a point) non-compact 3-manifolds not homeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the prototype of which is now called the [[Whitehead manifold]].

In the 1950s and 1960s, other  mathematicians attempted proofs of the conjecture only to discover that they contained flaws.  Influential mathematicians such as G. de Rham, [[RH Bing|Bing]], [[Wolfgang Haken|Haken]], [[Edwin E. Moise|Moise]], and [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos|Papakyriakopoulos]] attempted to prove the conjecture.  In 1958 Bing proved a weak version of the Poincaré conjecture: if every simple closed curve of a compact 3-manifold is contained in a 3-ball, then the manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bing | first = RH | authorlink = RH Bing | title = Necessary and sufficient conditions that a 3-manifold be S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = Annals of Mathematics |series=Second Series | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–37 | date = 1958 | doi = 10.2307/1970041 | jstor=1970041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bing also described some of the pitfalls in trying to prove the Poincaré conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Bing | first = RH | title = Some aspects of the topology of 3-manifolds related to the Poincaré conjecture | booktitle=Lectures on Modern Mathematics | volume=II | pages = 93–128 | publisher = Wiley | date = 1964 | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Włodzimierz Jakobsche showed in 1978 that, if the [[Bing–Borsuk conjecture]] is true in dimension 3, then the Poincaré conjecture must also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the conjecture gained the reputation of being particularly tricky to tackle.  [[J. W. Milnor|John Milnor]] commented that sometimes the errors in false proofs can be "rather subtle and difficult to detect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~jack/PREPRINTS/poiproof.pdf | title = The Poincaré Conjecture 99 Years Later: A Progress Report | accessdate=2007-05-05 | last = Milnor |first = John |authorlink = John Milnor | date = 2004 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on the conjecture improved understanding of 3-manifolds.  Experts in the field were often reluctant to announce proofs, and tended to view any such announcement with skepticism.  The 1980s and 1990s witnessed some well-publicized fallacious proofs (which were not actually published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taubes | first = Gary | title = What happens when hubris meets nemesis | journal = Discover | volume = 8 | pages = 66–77 | date = July 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Matthews | title = $1 million mathematical mystery "solved" | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2143 | work = NewScientist.com | date = 9 April 2002 |accessdate = 2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exposition of attempts to prove this conjecture can be found in the non-technical book ''Poincaré's Prize'' by [[George Szpiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Szpiro |first=George |title=Poincaré's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles |date=July 29, 2008 |publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] |isbn=978-0-452-28964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===
{{Main|Generalized Poincaré conjecture}}
The [[Surface (topology)|classification of closed surfaces]] gives an affirmative answer to the analogous question in two dimensions.  For dimensions greater than three, one can pose the Generalized Poincaré conjecture: is a [[homotopy sphere|homotopy ''n''-sphere]] homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere?  A stronger assumption is necessary; in dimensions four and higher there are simply-connected, closed manifolds which are not [[Homotopy#Homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to an ''n''-sphere.

Historically, while the conjecture in dimension three seemed plausible, the generalized conjecture was thought to be false.  In 1961 [[Stephen Smale]] shocked mathematicians by proving the Generalized Poincaré conjecture for dimensions greater than four and extended his techniques to prove the fundamental [[h-cobordism theorem]].  In 1982 [[Michael Freedman]] proved the Poincaré conjecture in four dimensions.  Freedman's work left open the possibility that there is a smooth four-manifold homeomorphic to the four-sphere which is not [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the four-sphere.  This so-called smooth Poincaré conjecture, in dimension four, remains open and is thought to be very difficult.  [[Milnor]]'s [[exotic sphere]]s show that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is false in dimension seven, for example.

These earlier successes in higher dimensions left the case of three dimensions in limbo.  The Poincaré conjecture was essentially true in both dimension four and all higher dimensions for substantially different reasons.  In dimension three, the conjecture had an uncertain reputation until the [[geometrization conjecture]] put it into a framework governing all 3-manifolds.  [[John Morgan (mathematician)|John Morgan]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, John W., Recent progress on the Poincaré conjecture and the classification of 3-manifolds.
Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 42 (2005), no. 1, 57–78&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It is my view that before [[William Thurston|Thurston]]'s work on [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s and . . . the Geometrization conjecture there was no consensus among the experts as to whether the Poincaré conjecture was true or false.  After Thurston's work, notwithstanding the fact that it had no direct bearing on the Poincaré conjecture, a consensus developed that the Poincaré conjecture (and the Geometrization conjecture) were true.}}

===Hamilton's program and Perelman's solution===
[[File:Ricci flow.png|thumb|upright|200px|right|Several stages of the [[Ricci flow]] on a two-dimensional manifold]]

Hamilton's program was started in his 1982 paper in which he introduced the [[Ricci flow]] on a manifold and showed how to use it to prove some special cases of the Poincaré conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard S.

The actual solution was not found until [[Grigori Perelman]] published his papers.

In late 2002 and 2003 Perelman posted three papers on the [[arXiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last = Perelman | first = Grigori | authorlink = Grigori Perelman | title = The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications | eprint = math.DG/0211159 | date = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last = Perelman | first = Grigori | title = Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds | eprint = math.DG/0303109 | date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last = Perelman | first = Grigori | title = Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds | eprint = math.DG/0307245 | date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these papers he sketched a proof of the Poincaré conjecture and a more general conjecture, [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], completing the Ricci flow program  outlined earlier by [[Richard S. Hamilton]].

From May to July 2006, several groups presented papers that filled in the details of Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture, as follows:
* [[Bruce Kleiner]] and [[John Lott (mathematician)|John W. Lott]] posted a paper on the arXiv in May 2006 which filled in the details of Perelman's proof of the geometrization conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Bruce | last = Kleiner | authorlink = Bruce Kleiner |author2=John W.

* [[Huai-Dong Cao]] and [[Xi-Ping Zhu]] published a paper in the June 2006 issue of the ''[[Asian Journal of Mathematics]]'' with an exposition of the complete proof of the Poincaré and geometrization conjectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Huai-Dong | last = Cao | authorlink = Huai-Dong Cao | author2 = Xi-Ping Zhu | author2-link = Xi-Ping Zhu | title = A Complete Proof of the Poincaré and Geometrization Conjectures&amp;nbsp;– application of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of the Ricci flow | url = http://www.intlpress.com/AJM/p/2006/10_2/AJM-10-2-165-492.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | journal = Asian Journal of Mathematics | volume = 10 | date = June 2006 | issue = 2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120514194949/http://www.intlpress.com/AJM/p/2006/10_2/AJM-10-2-165-492.pdf | archivedate = 2012-05-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They initially implied the proof was their own achievement based on the "Hamilton–Perelman theory", but later retracted the original version of their paper, and posted a revised version, in which they referred to their work as the more modest "exposition of Hamilton–Perelman's proof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=Cao, Huai-Dong|author2=Zhu, Xi-Ping|last-author-amp=yes |eprint=math.DG/0612069 |title=Hamilton–Perelman's Proof of the Poincaré Conjecture and the Geometrization Conjecture |date=December 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They  also  published an [[erratum]] disclosing that they had forgotten to cite properly the previous work of Kleiner and Lott published in 2003. In the same issue, the AJM editorial board issued an apology for what it called "incautions" in the Cao–Zhu paper.
* [[John Morgan (mathematician)|John Morgan]] and [[Gang Tian]] posted a paper on the arXiv in July 2006 which gave a detailed proof of just the Poincaré Conjecture (which is somewhat easier than the full geometrization conjecture)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv | first = John | last = Morgan | authorlink = John Morgan (mathematician) | author2 = Gang Tian | author2-link = Gang Tian | title = Ricci Flow and the Poincaré Conjecture | eprint = math.DG/0607607 | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded this to a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = John | last = Morgan | authorlink = John Morgan (mathematician) |author2=Gang Tian |author2-link=Gang Tian  | title = Ricci Flow and the Poincaré Conjecture |publisher= Clay Mathematics Institute |isbn = 0-8218-4328-1| date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three groups found that the gaps in Perelman's papers were minor and could be filled in using his own techniques.

On August 22, 2006, the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] awarded Perelman the [[Fields Medal]] for his work on the conjecture, but Perelman refused the medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Sylvia | last = Nasar | authorlink = Sylvia Nasar |author2=David Gruber | title = [[Manifold destiny]] | work = [[The New Yorker]] | pages = 44–57 | date = August 28, 2006 }} [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact2 On-line version at the ''New Yorker'' website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Kenneth | last = Chang | title = Highest Honor in Mathematics Is Refused | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 22, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/science/22cnd-math.html?hp&amp;ex=1156305600&amp;en=aa3a9d418768062c&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Reclusive Russian solves 100-year-old maths problem | work = [[China Daily]] | page = 7 | date = 23 August 2006 | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2006-08/23/content_671442.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
John Morgan spoke at the ICM on the Poincaré conjecture on August 24, 2006, declaring that "in 2003, Perelman solved the Poincaré Conjecture."&lt;ref&gt;A Report on the Poincaré Conjecture. Special lecture by John Morgan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' honored the proof of Poincaré conjecture as the [[Breakthrough of the Year]] and featured it on its cover.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

==Ricci flow with surgery==
{{Main|Ricci flow}}
Hamilton's program for proving the Poincaré conjecture involves first putting a [[Riemannian metric]] on the unknown simply connected closed 3-manifold. The idea is to try to improve this metric; for example, if the metric can be improved enough so that it has constant curvature, then it must be the 3-sphere.  The metric is improved using the [[Ricci flow]] equations;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the metric and ''R'' its Ricci curvature, and one hopes that as the time ''t'' increases the manifold becomes easier to understand.  Ricci flow expands the negative curvature part of the manifold and contracts the positive curvature part.

In some cases Hamilton was able to show that this works; for example, if the manifold has positive Ricci curvature everywhere he showed that the manifold becomes extinct in finite time under Ricci flow without any other singularities.  (In other words, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time; it is easy to describe the structure just before the manifold collapses.)  This easily implies the Poincaré conjecture in the case of positive Ricci curvature.  However, in general the Ricci flow equations lead to singularities of the metric after a finite time. Perelman showed how to continue past these singularities: very roughly, he cuts the manifold along the singularities, splitting the manifold into several pieces, and then continues with the Ricci flow on each of these pieces.  This procedure is known as Ricci flow with surgery.

A special case of Perelman's theorems about Ricci flow with surgery is given as follows.
{{quote|The Ricci flow with surgery on a closed  oriented 3-manifold is well defined for all time. If the fundamental group is a [[free product]] of [[finite group]]s and [[cyclic group]]s then the Ricci flow with surgery becomes extinct in finite time, and at all times all components of the manifold are connected sums of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bundles over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and quotients of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

This result implies the Poincaré conjecture because it is easy to check it for the possible manifolds listed in the conclusion.

The condition on the fundamental group turns out to be necessary (and sufficient) for finite time extinction, and in particular includes the case of trivial fundamental group.  It is equivalent to saying that the prime decomposition of the manifold has no acyclic components, and turns out to be equivalent to the condition that all geometric pieces of the manifold have geometries based on the two Thurston geometries ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R''' and ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  By studying the limit of the manifold for large time, Perelman proved Thurston's geometrization conjecture for any fundamental group: at large times the manifold has a [[thick-thin decomposition]], whose thick piece has a hyperbolic structure, and whose thin piece is a [[graph manifold]], but this extra complication is not necessary for proving just the Poincaré conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Tao]] wrote an exposition of Ricci flow with surgery in: {{cite arXiv | first = Terence | last = Tao | title = Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture: a nonlinear PDE perspective | eprint = math.DG/0610903 | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perelman, Grigori (1966).jpg|thumb|right|[[Grigori Perelman]]]]
On November 13, 2002, Russian mathematician [[Grigori Perelman]] posted the first of a series of three [[E-print|eprints]] on [[arXiv]] outlining a solution of the Poincaré conjecture. Perelman's proof uses a modified version of a [[Ricci flow]] program developed by [[Richard S. Hamilton]]. In August 2006, Perelman was awarded, but declined, the [[Fields Medal]] (worth $15,000 CAD) for his proof. On March 18, 2010, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] awarded Perelman the $1&amp;nbsp;million [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Prize]] in recognition of his proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/ |date=March 18, 2010 |title=Prize for Resolution of the Poincaré Conjecture Awarded to Dr. Grigoriy Perelman |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322192115/http://www.claymath.org/poincare/ |archive-date=2010-03-22 |publisher=Clay Mathematics Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poincaré Conjecture |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/poincaré-conjecture |publisher=Clay Mathematics Institute |access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman rejected that prize as well.&lt;ref name="interfax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysOrg1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news197209671.html |title=Russian mathematician rejects $1 million prize |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[PhysOrg]] |author=Malcolm Ritter |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perelman proved the conjecture by deforming the manifold using the Ricci flow (which behaves similarly to the [[heat equation]] that describes the diffusion of heat through an object). The Ricci flow usually deforms the manifold towards a rounder shape, except for some cases where it stretches the manifold apart from itself towards what are known as [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]]. Perelman and Hamilton then chop the manifold at the singularities (a process called "surgery") causing the separate pieces to form into ball-like shapes.  Major steps in the proof involve showing how manifolds behave when they are deformed by the Ricci flow, examining what sort of singularities develop, determining whether this surgery process can be completed and establishing that the surgery need not be repeated infinitely many times.

The first step is to deform the manifold using the [[Ricci flow]]. The Ricci flow was defined by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] as a way to deform manifolds.   The formula for the Ricci flow is an imitation of the [[heat equation]] which describes the way heat flows in a solid. Like the heat flow, Ricci flow tends towards uniform behavior. Unlike the heat flow, the Ricci flow could run into singularities and stop functioning.   A singularity in a manifold is a place where it is not differentiable: like a corner or a cusp or a pinching.   The Ricci flow was only defined for smooth differentiable manifolds.  Hamilton used the Ricci flow to prove that some compact manifolds were [[diffeomorphic]] to spheres and he hoped to apply it to prove the Poincaré Conjecture.   He needed to understand the singularities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Hamilton created a list of possible singularities that could form but he was concerned that some singularities might lead to difficulties. He wanted to cut the manifold at the singularities and paste in caps, and then run the Ricci flow again, so he needed to understand the singularities and show that certain kinds of singularities do not occur.  Perelman  discovered the singularities were all very simple: essentially three-dimensional cylinders made out of spheres stretched out along a line. An ordinary cylinder is made by taking circles stretched along a line.  Perelman proved this using something called the "Reduced Volume" which is closely related to an [[eigenvalue]] of a certain [[elliptic equation]].

Sometimes an otherwise complicated operation reduces to multiplication by a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] (a number). Such numbers are called eigenvalues of that operation.  Eigenvalues are closely related to vibration frequencies and are used in analyzing a famous problem: [[can you hear the shape of a drum?]] Essentially an eigenvalue is like a note being played by the manifold. Perelman proved this note goes up as the manifold is deformed by the Ricci flow. This helped him eliminate some of the more troublesome singularities that had concerned Hamilton, particularly the cigar soliton solution, which looked like a strand sticking out of a manifold with nothing on the other side. In essence Perelman showed that all the strands that form can be cut and capped and none stick out on one side only.

Completing the proof, Perelman takes any compact, simply connected, three-dimensional manifold without boundary and starts to run the Ricci flow. This deforms the manifold into round pieces with strands running between them. He cuts the strands and continues deforming the manifold until eventually he is left with a collection of round three-dimensional spheres. Then he rebuilds the original manifold by connecting the spheres together with three-dimensional cylinders, morphs them into a round shape and sees that, despite all the initial confusion, the manifold was in fact homeomorphic to a sphere.

One immediate question posed was how one could be sure that infinitely many cuts weren't necessary. This was raised due to the cutting potentially progressing forever. Perelman proved this can't happen by using [[minimal surfaces]] on the manifold. A minimal surface is essentially a soap film. Hamilton had shown that the area of a minimal surface decreases as the manifold undergoes Ricci flow.  Perelman verified what happened to the area of the minimal surface when the manifold was sliced.  He proved that eventually the area is so small that any cut after the area is that small can only be chopping off three-dimensional spheres and not more complicated pieces. This is described as a battle with a Hydra by [[Christina Sormani|Sormani]] in Szpiro's book cited below. This last part of the proof appeared in Perelman's third and final paper on the subject.

==Shape of the universe by Poincaré conjecture==
Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker universe corresponds to a time-evolving radius of an S3 space. It argues that if this universe is modified in M3, at the end the acceleration it may produce a phase transition changing M3 to a space of constant curvature which corresponds precisely to a de Sitter phase associated with S3. Another point of view is that since the [[geometrization conjecture]] (a generalization of the Poincaré conjecture) requires one to understand all locally homogeneous geometries on closed three manifolds, using Ricci flow one may consider [[Bianchi classification]]  used to study cosmological models. What one may add to this scenario is that such a transition may require a torsion in order to make S3 (or other Bianchi cosmological models) parallelizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=J.

'''Probabilistic number theory''' is a subfield of [[number theory]], which explicitly uses [[probability]] to answer questions of number theory. One basic idea underlying it is that different [[prime number]]s are, in some serious sense, like [[independent random variables]]. This however is not an idea that has a unique useful formal expression.

The founders of the theory were [[Paul Erdős]], [[Aurel Wintner]] and [[Mark Kac]] during the 1930s, one of the periods of investigation in [[analytic number theory]]. The [[Erdős–Wintner theorem]] and the [[Erdős–Kac theorem]] on [[additive function]]s were foundational results.

Every two non-adjacent vertices can be connected by a rainbow path, either directly through the center vertex (bottom left) or by detouring around one triangle to avoid a repeated edge color (bottom right).]]
In [[graph theory]], a path in an [[Edge coloring|edge-colored graph]] is said to be '''rainbow''' if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be '''rainbow-connected''' (or '''rainbow colored''') if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. If there is a rainbow [[Path (graph theory)|shortest path]] between each pair of vertices, the graph is said to be '''strongly rainbow-connected''' (or '''strongly rainbow colored''').{{sfnp|Chartrand|Johns|McKeon|Zhang|2008}}

== Definitions and bounds ==

The '''rainbow connection number''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum number of colors needed to rainbow-connect &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the '''strong rainbow connection number''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum number of colors needed to strongly rainbow-connect &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{src}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, each strong rainbow coloring is also a rainbow coloring, while the converse is not true in general.

It is easy to observe that to rainbow-connect any connected graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we need at least &lt;math&gt;\text{diam}(G)&lt;/math&gt; colors, where &lt;math&gt;\text{diam}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Distance (graph theory)|diameter]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the length of the longest shortest path). On the other hand, we can never use more than &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; colors, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, because each strongly rainbow-connected graph is rainbow-connected, we have that &lt;math&gt;\text{diam}(G) \leq \text{rc}(G) \leq \text{src}(G) \leq m&lt;/math&gt;.

The following are the extremal cases:{{sfnp|Chartrand|Johns|McKeon|Zhang|2008}}
*&lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) = \text{src}(G) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complete graph]].
*&lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) = \text{src}(G) = m&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]].

The above shows that in terms of the number of vertices, the upper bound &lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) \leq n - 1&lt;/math&gt; is the best possible in general. In fact, a rainbow coloring using &lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt; colors can be constructed by coloring the edges of a spanning tree of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in distinct colors. The remaining uncolored edges are colored arbitrarily, without introducing new colors. When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is 2-connected, we have that &lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) \leq \lceil n/2 \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfnp|Ekstein|Holub|Kaiser|Koch|Camacho|Ryjáček|Schiermeyer|2013}} Moreover, this is tight as witnessed by e.g. odd cycles.

== Exact rainbow or strong rainbow connection numbers ==
The rainbow or the strong rainbow connection number has been determined for some structured graph classes:
*&lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(C_n) = \text{src}(C_n) = \lceil n/2 \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, for each integer &lt;math&gt;n \geq 4&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cycle graph]].{{sfnp|Chartrand|Johns|McKeon|Zhang|2008}}
*&lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(W_n) = 3&lt;/math&gt;, for each integer &lt;math&gt;n \geq 7&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\text{src}(W_n) = \lceil n/3 \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wheel graph]].{{sfnp|Chartrand|Johns|McKeon|Zhang|2008}}

== Complexity ==
The problem of deciding whether &lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) = 2&lt;/math&gt; for a given graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is [[NP-complete]].{{sfnp|Chakraborty|Fischer|Matsliah|Yuster|2011}} Because &lt;math&gt;\text{rc}(G) = 2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\text{src}(G) = 2&lt;/math&gt;,{{sfnp|Chartrand|Johns|McKeon|Zhang|2008}} it follows that deciding if &lt;math&gt;\text{src}(G) = 2&lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete for a given graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variants and generalizations == 
Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang{{sfnp|Chartrand|Okamoto|Zhang|2010}} generalized the rainbow connection number as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an edge-colored nontrivial connected graph of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a ''rainbow tree'' if no two edges of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are assigned the same color. Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be a fixed integer with &lt;math&gt;2 \leq k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. An edge coloring of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rainbow coloring'' if for every set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; vertices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, there is a rainbow tree in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; containing the vertices of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The '''&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rainbow index''' &lt;math&gt;\text{rx}_k(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum number of colors needed in a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rainbow coloring of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. A &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rainbow coloring using &lt;math&gt;\text{rx}_k(G)&lt;/math&gt; colors is called a ''minimum &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rainbow coloring''. Thus &lt;math&gt;\text{rx}_2(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the rainbow connection number of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

Rainbow connection has also been studied in vertex-colored graphs. This concept was introduced by Krivelevich and Yuster.{{sfnp|Krivelevich|Yuster|2010}}
Here, the '''rainbow vertex-connection number''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{rvc}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum number of colors needed to color &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that for each pair of vertices, there is a path connecting them whose internal vertices are assigned distinct colors.

In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], '''relation construction''' and '''relational constructibility''' have to do with the ways that one [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] is determined by an [[indexed family]] or a [[sequence]] of other relations, called the ''relation dataset''.  The relation in the focus of consideration is called the ''faciendum''.  The relation dataset typically consists of a specified relation over sets of relations, called the ''constructor'', the ''factor'', or the ''method of construction'', plus a specified set of other relations, called the ''faciens'', the ''ingredients'', or the ''makings''.

[[Relation composition]] and [[relation reduction]] are special cases of relation constructions.

==Undirected solution==
The undirected route inspection problem may be solved in [[polynomial time]] by an [[algorithm]] based on the concept of a ''T''-join.
Let ''T'' be a subset of the vertex set of a graph.  An edge set ''J'' is called a ''T'''''-join''' if the collection of vertices that have an odd number of neighboring edges in ''J'' is exactly the set ''T''. A ''T''-join exists whenever every connected component of the graph contains an even number of vertices in ''T''. The ''T'''''-join problem''' is to find a ''T''-join with the minimum possible number of edges or the minimum possible total weight.
 
For any ''T'', a smallest ''T''-join (when it exists) necessarily consists of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}|T|&lt;/math&gt; paths that join the vertices of ''T'' in pairs. The paths will be such that the total length or total weight of all of them is as small as possible. In an optimal solution, no two of these paths will share any edge, but they may have shared vertices. A minimum ''T''-join can be obtained by constructing a [[complete graph]] on the vertices of ''T'', with edges that represent shortest paths in the given input graph, and then finding a [[Matching (graph theory)|minimum weight perfect matching]] in this complete graph. The edges of this matching represent paths in the original graph, whose union forms the desired ''T''-join.
Both constructing the complete graph, and then finding a matching in it, can be done in O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) computational steps.

For the route inspection problem, ''T'' should be chosen as the set of all odd-degree vertices. By the assumptions of the problem, the whole graph is connected (otherwise no tour exists), and by the [[handshaking lemma]] it has an even number of odd vertices, so a ''T''-join always exists. Doubling the edges of a ''T''-join causes the given graph to become an Eulerian multigraph (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree), from which it follows that it has an [[Euler tour]], a tour that visits each edge of the multigraph exactly once. This tour will be an optimal solution to the route inspection problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=E.L.|last=Lawler|title=Combinatorial Optimization: Networks and Matroids|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "EdmondsJohnson"&gt;{{citation|first1=J.|last1=Edmonds|first2=E.L.|last2=Johnson|title=Matching Euler tours and the Chinese postman problem|journal=Mathematical Programming|volume=5|year=1973|pages=88–124|doi=10.1007/bf01580113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directed solution==
On a directed graph, the same general ideas apply, but different techniques must be used. If the graph is Eulerian, one need only find  an Euler cycle. If it is not, one must find ''T''-joins, which in this case entails finding paths from vertices with an in-[[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] greater than their out-[[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] to those with an out-[[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] greater than their in-[[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] such that they would make in-degree of every vertex equal to its out-degree. This can be solved as an instance of the [[minimum-cost flow problem]] in which there is one unit of supply for every unit of excess in-degree, and one unit of demand for every unit of excess out-degree. As such it is solvable in O(|''V''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''E''|) time. A solution exists if and only if the given graph is [[strongly connected]].&lt;ref name = "EdmondsJohnson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Eiselt | first = H.

==Windy postman problem==
The '''windy postman problem''' is a variant of the route inspection problem in which the input is an undirected graph, but where each edge may have a different cost for traversing it in one direction than for traversing it in the other direction.
In contrast to the solutions for directed and undirected graphs, it is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Various combinatorial problems are reduced to the Chinese Postman Problem, including finding a maximum cut in a planar graph

* Minimize the Chinese postman problem for mixed graphs: for this problem, some of the edges may be directed and can therefore only be visited from one direction. When the problem calls for a minimal traversal of a digraph (or multidigraph) it is known as the "New York Street Sweeper problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Fred S.|last1=Roberts|first2=Barry|last2=Tesman|title=Applied Combinatorics|edition=2nd|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420099829|pages=642–645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minimize the ''k''-Chinese postman problem: find ''k'' cycles all starting at a designated location such that each edge is traversed by at least one cycle. The goal is to minimize the cost of the most expensive cycle.
* Minimize the "Rural Postman Problem": solve the problem with some edges not required. &lt;ref name = "Complexity" /&gt;

In [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''Steiner system''' (named after [[Jakob Steiner]]) is a type of [[block design]], specifically a [[Block design#Generalization: t-designs|t-design]] with λ = 1 and ''t'' ≥ 2.

A Steiner system with parameters ''t'', ''k'', ''n'', written S(''t'',''k'',''n''), is an ''n''-element [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' together with a set of ''k''-element [[subset]]s of ''S'' (called '''blocks''') with the property that each ''t''-element subset of ''S'' is contained in exactly one block. In an alternate notation for block designs, an S(''t'',''k'',''n'') would be a ''t''-(''n'',''k'',1) design.

This definition is relatively modern, [[generalizing]] the ''classical'' definition of Steiner systems which in addition required that ''k'' = ''t'' + 1. An S(2,3,''n'') was (and still is) called a ''Steiner triple'' (or ''triad'') ''system'', while an S(3,4,''n'') was called a ''Steiner quadruple system'', and so on. With the generalization of the definition, this naming system is no longer strictly adhered to.

A long-standing problem in [[block design|design theory]] was if any nontrivial (''t'' &lt; ''k'' &lt; ''n'') Steiner systems have ''t'' ≥ 6; also if infinitely many have ''t'' = 4 or 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designtheory.org/library/encyc/tdes/g |title=Encyclopaedia of Design Theory: t-Designs |publisher=Designtheory.org |date=2004-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was solved in the affirmative by [[Peter Keevash]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Keevash |first=Peter |eprint=1401.3665 |title=The existence of designs |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150609-a-design-dilemma-solved-minus-designs/ |title=A Design Dilemma Solved, Minus Designs |publisher=Quanta Magazine |date=2015-06-09 |accessdate=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalai|first1=Gil|title=Designs exist!|url=http://www.bourbaki.ens.fr/TEXTES/1100.pdf|website=http://www.bourbaki.ens.fr|publisher=S´eminaire BOURBAKI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Finite projective planes ===
A finite [[projective plane]] of order {{math|''q''}}, with the lines as blocks, is an {{math|S(2, ''q'' + 1, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q'' + 1)}}, since it has {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q'' + 1}} points, each line passes through {{math|''q'' + 1}} points, and each pair of distinct points lies on exactly one line.

===Finite affine planes===
A finite [[Affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] of order {{math|''q''}}, with the lines as blocks, is an {{math|S(2,&amp;nbsp;''q'',&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. An affine plane of order {{math|''q''}} can be obtained from a projective plane of the same order by removing one block and all of the points in that block from the projective plane. Choosing different blocks to remove in this way can lead to non-isomorphic affine planes.

==Classical Steiner systems==

===Steiner triple systems===
An S(2,3,''n'') is called a '''Steiner triple system''', and its blocks are called '''triples'''. It is common to see the abbreviation STS(''n'') for a Steiner triple system of order ''n''. 
The total number of pairs is ''n(n-1)/2'', of which three appear in a triple, and so the total number of triples is ''n''(''n''&amp;minus;1)/6. This shows that ''n'' must be of the form ''6k+1'' or ''6k + 3'' for some ''k''. The fact that this condition on ''n'' is sufficient for the existence of an S(2,3,''n'') was proved by [[Raj Chandra Bose]]&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Bose. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1939.tb02219.x On the construction of balanced incomplete block designs]. Ann. Eugenics 9 (1939), 353–399.&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Skolem.&lt;ref&gt;T. Skolem. [http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/10551 Some remarks on the triple systems of Steiner.] Math. Scand. 6 (1958), 273–280.&lt;/ref&gt; The projective plane of order 2 (the [[Fano plane]]) is an STS(7) and the [[Affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] of order 3 is an STS(9).

Up to isomorphism, the STS(7) and STS(9) are unique, there are two STS(13)s, 80 STS(15)s, and 11,084,874,829 STS(19)s.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg.60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We can define a multiplication on the set ''S'' using the Steiner triple system by setting ''aa'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''S'', and ''ab'' = ''c'' if {''a'',''b'',''c''} is a triple. This makes ''S''  an [[idempotent]], [[commutative]] [[quasigroup]].  It has the additional property that ''ab'' = ''c'' implies ''bc'' = ''a'' and ''ca'' = ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;This property is equivalent to saying that (xy)y = x for all x and y in the idempotent commutative quasigroup.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, any (finite) quasigroup with these properties arises from a Steiner triple system. Commutative idempotent quasigroups satisfying this additional property are called ''Steiner quasigroups''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 497, definition 28.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steiner quadruple systems===
An S(3,4,''n'') is called a '''Steiner quadruple system'''. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an S(3,4,''n'') is that ''n'' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; 2 or 4 (mod 6). The abbreviation SQS(''n'') is often used for these systems.

Up to isomorphism, SQS(8) and SQS(10) are unique, there are 4 SQS(14)s and 1,054,163 SQS(16)s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg.106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steiner quintuple systems===
An S(4,5,''n'') is called a ''Steiner quintuple system''. A necessary condition for the existence of such a system is that ''n'' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; 3 or 5 (mod 6) which comes from considerations that apply to all the classical Steiner systems. An additional necessary condition is that ''n'' &lt;math&gt;\not\equiv&lt;/math&gt; 4 (mod 5), which comes from the fact that the number of blocks must be an integer. Sufficient conditions are not known.

There is a unique Steiner quintuple system of order 11, but none of order 15 or order 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Östergard|Pottonen|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems are known for orders 23, 35, 47, 71, 83, 107, 131, 167 and 243. The smallest order for which the existence is not known (as of 2011) is 21.

== Properties ==
It is clear [[logical consequence|from the definition]] of {{math|S(''t'', ''k'', ''n'')}} that &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; t &lt; k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;. (Equalities, while technically possible, lead to trivial systems.)

If {{math|S(''t'', ''k'', ''n'')}} exists, then taking all blocks containing a specific element and discarding that element gives a ''derived system'' {{math|S(''t''&amp;minus;1, ''k''&amp;minus;1, ''n''&amp;minus;1)}}. Therefore, the existence of {{math|S(''t''&amp;minus;1, ''k''&amp;minus;1, ''n''&amp;minus;1)}} is a necessary condition for the existence of {{math|S(''t'', ''k'', ''n'')}}.

The number of {{math|''t''}}-element subsets in {{math|S}} is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n t&lt;/math&gt;, while the number of {{math|''t''}}-element subsets in each block is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom k t&lt;/math&gt;. Since every {{math|''t''}}-element subset is contained in exactly one block, we have &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n t = b\tbinom k t&lt;/math&gt;, or 
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{\tbinom nt}{\tbinom kt} = \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-t+1)}{k(k-1)\cdots(k-t+1)},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''b''}} is the number of blocks. Similar reasoning about {{math|''t''}}-element subsets containing a particular element gives us &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n-1}{t-1}=r\tbinom{k-1}{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;, or 
:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{\tbinom{n-1}{t-1}}{\tbinom{k-1}{t-1}}&lt;/math&gt; =&lt;math&gt;\frac{(n-t+1)\cdots(n-2)(n-1)}{(k-t+1)\cdots(k-2)(k-1)},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''r''}} is the number of blocks containing any given element. From these definitions follows the equation &lt;math&gt;bk=rn&lt;/math&gt;. It is a necessary condition for the existence of {{math|S(''t'', ''k'', ''n'')}} that {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''r''}} are integers. As with any block design, [[Fisher's inequality]] &lt;math&gt;b\ge n&lt;/math&gt; is true in Steiner systems.

Given the parameters of a Steiner system {{math|S(''t, k, n'')}} and a subset of size &lt;math&gt;t' \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, contained in at least one block, one can compute the number of blocks intersecting that subset in a fixed number of elements by constructing a [[Pascal triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus|Key|1994|loc=pg. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the number of blocks intersecting a fixed block in any number of elements is independent of the chosen block.

The number of blocks that contain any ''i''-element set of points is:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_i =  \left.\binom{n-i}{t-i} \right/ \binom{k-i}{t-i} \text{ for } i = 0,1,\ldots,t, &lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that if there is a Steiner system {{math|S(2, ''k'', ''n'')}}, where {{math|''k''}} is a prime power greater than 1, then {{math|''n''}} &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; 1 or {{math|''k'' (mod ''k''(''k''&amp;minus;1))}}. In particular, a Steiner triple system {{math|S(2, 3, ''n'')}} must have {{math|1=''n'' = 6''m'' + 1 or 6''m'' + 3}}. And as we have already mentioned, this is the only restriction on Steiner triple systems, that is, for each [[natural number]] {{math|''m''}}, systems {{math|S(2, 3, 6''m'' + 1)}} and {{math|S(2, 3, 6''m'' + 3)}} exist.

== History ==
Steiner triple systems were defined for the first time by [[Wesley S. B. Woolhouse|W.S.B. Woolhouse]] in 1844 in the Prize question #1733 of Lady's and Gentlemen's Diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindner|Rodger|1997|loc=pg.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posed problem was solved by {{Harvs|first=Thomas|last=Kirkman|authorlink=Thomas Kirkman|year=1847|txt}}. In 1850 Kirkman posed a variation of the problem known as [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]], which asks for triple systems having an additional property (resolvability). Unaware of Kirkman's work, {{harvs|first=Jakob|last=Steiner|authorlink=Jakob Steiner|year=1853|txt}} reintroduced triple systems, and as this work was more widely known, the systems were named in his honor.

== Mathieu groups ==
Several examples of Steiner systems are closely related to [[group theory]].  In particular, the [[List of finite simple groups|finite simple groups]] called [[Mathieu group]]s arise as  [[automorphism group]]s of Steiner systems:

* The [[Mathieu group M11|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group of a S(4,5,11) Steiner system
* The [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group of a S(5,6,12) Steiner system
* The [[Mathieu group M22|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the unique index 2 subgroup of the automorphism group of a S(3,6,22) Steiner system
* The [[Mathieu group M23|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group of a S(4,7,23) Steiner system
* The [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group of a S(5,8,24) Steiner system.

== The Steiner system S(5, 6, 12) ==
There is a unique S(5,6,12) Steiner system; its automorphism group is the [[Mathieu group]] M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and in that context it is denoted by W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Constructions ===
There are different ways to construct an S(5,6,12) system.

==== Projective line method ====

This construction is due to Carmichael (1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carmichael|1956|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Add a new element, call it {{mvar|∞}}, to the 11 elements of the [[finite field]] {{mvar|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (that is, the integers mod 11). This set, {{mvar|''S''}}, of 12 elements can be formally identified with the points of the [[projective line]] over {{mvar|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. Call the following  specific subset of size 6,
:&lt;math&gt;\{\infty,1,3,4,5,9\}, &lt;/math&gt;
a "block" (it contains {{math|∞}} together with the 5 nonzero squares in {{mvar|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;).  From this block, we obtain the other blocks of the {{mvar|S}}(5,6,12) system by repeatedly applying the [[linear fractional transformation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;z' = f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|a,b,c,d}} are in {{mvar|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and {{math|1= ''ad &amp;minus; bc'' = 1}}.
With the usual conventions of defining {{math|1= ''f'' (&amp;minus;''d''/''c'') = ∞}} and {{math|1= ''f'' (∞) = ''a''/''c''}}, these functions map the set {{mvar|''S''}} onto itself. In geometric language, they are [[Projectivity|projectivities]] of the projective line. They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition which is the [[projective special linear group]] {{mvar|PSL}}(2,11) of order 660. There are exactly five elements of this group that leave the starting block fixed setwise,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beth|Jungnickel|Lenz|1986|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely those such that {{math|1= ''b=c=0''}} and {{math|1= ''ad''=1}} so that {{math|1= ''f(z) = a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''z''}}. So there will be 660/5 = 132 images of that block. As a consequence of the multiply transitive property of this group [[group action|acting]] on this set, any subset of five elements of {{mvar|''S''}} will appear in exactly one of these 132 images of size six.

==== Kitten method ====
An alternative construction of W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained by use of the 'kitten' of R.T. Curtis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended as a "hand calculator" to write down blocks one at a time. The kitten method is based on completing patterns in a 3x3 grid of numbers, which represent an [[affine geometry]] on the [[vector space]] F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;xF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an S(2,3,9) system.

==== Construction from K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; graph factorization ====
The relations between the [[graph factorization|graph factors]] of the [[complete graph|complete graph K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] generate an S(5,6,12).&lt;ref&gt;[http://linear.ups.edu/eagts/section-24.html EAGTS textbook]&lt;/ref&gt; A K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; graph has six different 1-factorizations (ways to partition the edges into disjoint [[perfect matching]]s), and also six vertices. The set of vertices  (labeled 123456) and the set of factorizations (labeled ABCDEF) provide one block each. Every pair of factorizations has exactly one perfect matching in common. Suppose factorizations A and B have the common matching with edges 12, 34 and 56. Add three new blocks AB3456, 12AB56, and 1234AB, replacing each edge in the common matching with the factorization labels in turn. Similarly add three more blocks 12CDEF, 34CDEF, and 56CDEF, replacing the factorization labels by the corresponding edge labels of the common matching. Do this for all 15 pairs of factorizations to add 90 new blocks. Finally take the full set of 12C6 = 924 combinations of 6 objects out of 12, and discard any combination that has 5 or more objects in common with any of the 92 blocks generated so far. Exactly 40 blocks remain, resulting in 2+90+40 = 132 blocks of the S(5,6,12).

== The Steiner system S(5, 8, 24) ==
The Steiner system S(5, 8, 24), also known as the '''Witt design''' or '''Witt geometry''', was first described by {{Harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Daniel Carmichael|last=Carmichael|year=1931}} and rediscovered by {{Harvs|txt|last=Witt|year=1938|authorlink=Ernst Witt}}. This system is connected with many of the [[sporadic simple group]]s and with the [[exceptional object|exceptional]] 24-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] known as the [[Leech lattice]].

The automorphism group of S(5, 8, 24) is the [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]], and in that context the design is denoted W&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; ("W" for "Witt")

=== Constructions ===

There are many ways to construct the S(5,8,24).  Two methods are described here:

==== Method based on 8-combinations of 24 elements ====
All 8-element subsets of a 24-element set are generated in lexicographic order, and any such subset which differs from some subset already found in fewer than four positions is discarded.

The list of octads for the elements 01, 02, 03, ..., 22, 23, 24 is then:

::    01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
::    01 02 03 04 09 10 11 12

Each single element occurs 253 times somewhere in some octad. Each pair occurs 77 times. Each triple occurs 21 times. Each quadruple (tetrad) occurs 5 times. Each quintuple (pentad) occurs once. Not every hexad, heptad or octad occurs.

==== Method based on 24-bit binary strings ====
All 24-bit binary strings are generated in lexicographic order, and any such string that [[Hamming distance|differs from some earlier one in fewer than 8 positions]] is discarded. The result looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
    000000000000000000000000
    000000000000000011111111
    000000000000111100001111
    000000000000111111110000
    000000000011001100110011
    000000000011001111001100
    000000000011110000111100
    000000000011110011000011
    000000000101010101010101
    000000000101010110101010
    .
    . (next 4083 24-bit strings omitted)
    .
    111111111111000011110000
    111111111111111100000000
    111111111111111111111111
&lt;/pre&gt;
The list contains 4096 items, which are each code words of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]]. They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under the XOR operation. One of them has zero 1-bits, 759 of them have eight 1-bits, 2576 of them have twelve 1-bits, 759 of them have sixteen 1-bits, and one has twenty-four 1-bits. The 759 8-element blocks of the S(5,8,24) (called [http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rwb/octad.html octads]) are given by the patterns of 1's in the code words with eight 1-bits.

'''Thyra Eibe''' (3 November 1866 – 4 January 1955)&lt;ref name=dbl&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/636/origin/170/|language=Danish|title=Thyra Eibe (1866 – 1955)|work=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=2018-05-05|first=Else|last=Høyrup}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] mathematician and translator, the first woman to earn a mathematics degree from the [[University of Copenhagen]]. She is known for her translation of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' into the [[Danish Language]]. In undertaking this translation, she was motivated by the earlier work of Danish historian [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]], who published an edition of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' in its original Greek, with translations into Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Writing the History of Mathematics: Its Historical Development|volume=27|series=Science Networks: Historical Studies|editor1-first=Joseph W.|editor1-last=Dauben|editor2-first=Christoph J.|editor2-last=Scriba|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2002|isbn=9783764361679|first=Kirsti|last=Andersen|contribution=Scandinavia|at=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA157 6.7 Text Editions, p. 157]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eibe was one of ten children of a Copenhagen bookseller. After completing a degree in historical linguistics in 1889 from [[N. Zahle's School]] (then a girls' school), Eibe studied mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, and earned a [[cand.mag.]] there in 1895. She returned to Zahle's School as a teacher, also teaching boys at Slomann's School and becoming the first woman to become an advanced mathematics teacher for boys in Denmark. In 1898 she moved to H. Adler Community College, later to become the {{ill|Sortedam Gymnasium|da}}, where she remained until 1934, serving as principal for a year in 1929–1930.&lt;ref name=dbl /&gt;

As well as her translations, Eibe wrote several widely-used Danish mathematics textbooks.&lt;ref name=dbl /&gt;

In 1942, she was given the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]], an award for Danish woman who have made a significant contribution in science, literature or art.&lt;ref name=dbl /&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''Toda oscillator''' is a special kind of [[nonlinear oscillator]]. It represents a chain of particles with exponential potential interaction between neighbors.&lt;ref name="toda"&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Toda |title=Studies of a non-linear lattice |journal=[[Physics Reports]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=1 |year=1975 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(75)90018-6 |bibcode=1975PhR....18....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concepts are named after [[Morikazu Toda]].  The Toda oscillator is used as a simple model to understand the phenomenon of [[self-pulsation]], which is a quasi-periodic pulsation of the output intensity of a [[solid-state laser]] in the [[transient regime]].

== Definition ==
The Toda oscillator is a [[dynamical system]] of any origin, which can be described with dependent coordinate &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt; and independent coordinate &lt;math&gt;~z~&lt;/math&gt;, characterized in that the [[evolution]] along independent coordinate &lt;math&gt;~z~&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated with equation
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{{\rm d^{2}}x}{{\rm d}z^{2}}+
D(x)\frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}z}+
\Phi'(x) =0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;~D(x)=u e^{x}+v~&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;~\Phi(x)=e^x-x-1~&lt;/math&gt; and prime denotes the derivative.

== Physical meaning ==
The independent coordinate &lt;math&gt;~z~&lt;/math&gt; has sense of [[time]]. Indeed, it may be proportional to time &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; with some relation like &lt;math&gt;~z=t/t_0~&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;~t_0~&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

The [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;~\dot x=\frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}z}&lt;/math&gt; may have sense of [[velocity]] of particle with coordinate &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;~\ddot x=\frac{{\rm d}^2x}{{\rm d}z^2}~&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as [[acceleration]]; and the mass of such a particle is equal to unity.

The dissipative function &lt;math&gt;~D~&lt;/math&gt; may have sense of coefficient of the speed-proportional [[friction]].
 
Usually, both parameters &lt;math&gt;~u~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~v~&lt;/math&gt; are supposed to be positive; then this speed-proportional friction coefficient grows exponentially at large positive values of coordinate &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt;.

The potential &lt;math&gt;~\Phi(x)=e^x-x-1~&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed function, which also shows [[exponential grow]]th at large positive values of coordinate &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt;.

In the application in [[laser physics]], &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt; may have a sense of [[logarithm]] of number of photons in the [[laser cavity]], related to its steady-state value.  Then, the [[output power]] of such a laser is proportional to &lt;math&gt;~\exp(x)~&lt;/math&gt; and may show pulsation at [[oscillation]] of &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt;.

Both analogies, with a unity mass particle and logarithm of number of photons, are useful in the analysis of behavior of the Toda oscillator.

==Energy==
Rigorously, the oscillation is periodic only at &lt;math&gt;~u=v=0~&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, in the realization of the Toda oscillator as a self-pulsing laser, these parameters may have values of order of &lt;math&gt;~10^{-4}~&lt;/math&gt;; during several pulses, the amplitude of pulsation does not change much. In this case, we can speak about the [[Frequency|period]] of pulsation, since the function &lt;math&gt;~x=x(t)~&lt;/math&gt; is almost periodic.

In the case &lt;math&gt;~u=v=0~&lt;/math&gt;, the energy of the oscillator &lt;math&gt;~E=\frac 12 \left(\frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}z}\right)^{2}+\Phi(x)~&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt;~z~&lt;/math&gt;, and can be treated as a constant of motion. Then, during one period of pulsation, the relation between &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~z~&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed analytically:
&lt;ref name="oppo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oppo |first=G.L. |last2=Politi |first2=A. |title=Toda potential in laser equations |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik B]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=111–115 |year=1985 |doi=10.1007/BF01325388 |bibcode = 1985ZPhyB..59..111O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kouz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kouznetsov |first=D. |last2=Bisson |first2=J.-F. |last3=Li |first3=J. |last4=Ueda |first4=K. |title=Self-pulsing laser as Toda oscillator: Approximation through elementary functions |journal=[[Journal of Physics A]] |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=1–18 |year=2007 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/40/9/016 |bibcode = 2007JPhA...40.2107K  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z=\pm\int_{x_\min}^{x_\max}\!\!\frac{{\rm d}a}
{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{E-\Phi(a)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;~x_{\min}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~x_{\max}~&lt;/math&gt; are minimal and maximal values of &lt;math&gt;~x~&lt;/math&gt;; this solution is written for the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot x(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

however, other solutions may be obtained using the principle of [[Translational symmetry|translational invariance]].

The ratio &lt;math&gt;~x_\max/x_\min=2\gamma~&lt;/math&gt; is a convenient parameter to characterize the amplitude of pulsation.  Using this, we can express the median value
&lt;math&gt;
\delta=\frac{x_\max -x_\min}{1}
&lt;/math&gt;
as
&lt;math&gt;
\delta=
\ln\frac{\sin(\gamma)}{\gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;;
and the energy
&lt;math&gt;
 E=E(\gamma)=\frac{\gamma}{\tanh(\gamma)}+\ln\frac{\sinh \gamma}{\gamma}-1
&lt;/math&gt;
is also an elementary function of &lt;math&gt;~\gamma~&lt;/math&gt;.

In application, the quantity &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; need not be the physical energy of the system; in these cases, this dimensionless quantity may be called [[quasienergy]].

==Period of pulsation==
The period of pulsation is an increasing function of the amplitude &lt;math&gt;~\gamma~&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;~\gamma \ll 1~&lt;/math&gt;, 
the period 
&lt;math&gt;~T(\gamma)=2\pi
\left(
 1 + \frac{\gamma^2} {24} + O(\gamma^4)
\right)
~&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;~\gamma \gg 1~&lt;/math&gt;, the period 
&lt;math&gt;~T(\gamma)=
4\gamma^{1/2}
\left(1+O(1/\gamma)\right) ~&lt;/math&gt;

In the whole range
&lt;math&gt;~\gamma &gt; 0~&lt;/math&gt;, the period &lt;math&gt;~{T(\gamma)}~&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;~k(\gamma)=\frac{2\pi}{T(\gamma)}~&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated by

: &lt;math&gt;
k_\text{fit}(\gamma)=
\frac{2\pi}
{T_\text{fit}(\gamma)}=
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\left(
\frac
{
10630
+ 674\gamma 
+ 695.2419\gamma^2 
+ 191.4489\gamma^3

to at least 8 [[significant figures]].  The [[approximation error|relative error]] of this approximation does not exceed &lt;math&gt;22 \times 10^{-9} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Decay of pulsation==
At small (but still positive) values of &lt;math&gt;~u~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~v~&lt;/math&gt;, the pulsation decays slowly, and this decay can be described analytically. In the first approximation, the parameters &lt;math&gt;~u~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~v~&lt;/math&gt; give additive contributions to the decay; the decay rate, as well as the amplitude and phase of the nonlinear oscillation, can be approximated with elementary functions in a manner similar to the period above.  In describing the behavior of the idealized Toda oscillator, the error of such approximations is smaller than the differences between the ideal and its experimental realization as a [[self-pulsing]] laser at the [[optical bench]].  However, a self-pulsing laser shows qualitatively very similar behavior.&lt;ref name="kouz" /&gt;

==Continuous limit==
The [[Toda lattice|Toda chain]] equations of motion, in the continuous limit in which the distance between neighbors goes to zero, become the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] (KdV) equation.&lt;ref name="toda" /&gt; Here the index labeling the particle in the chain becomes the new spatial coordinate.

In contrast, the [[Toda field theory]] is achieved by introducing a new spatial coordinate which is independent of the chain index label. This is done in a relativistically invariant way, so that time and space are treated on equal grounds.&lt;ref name="todafieldtheory"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Kashaev |first=R.-M. |last2=Reshetikhin |first2=N. |title=Affine Toda field theory as a 3-dimensional integrable system  |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume=188 |pages=251–266 |year=1997 |doi=10.1007/s002200050164 |arxiv=hep-th/9507065|bibcode = 1997CMaPh.188..251K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Toda field theory is not a continuous limit of the Toda chain.

[[File:William Farish.jpg|thumb|Portrait of William Farish, 1815.]] 
'''William Farish''' (1759–1837) was a British scientist who was a [[professor]] of [[Chemistry]] and [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], known for the development of the method of [[isometric projection]] and development of the first written university [[Test (assessment)|examination]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Maynard (2005). ''Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression''. p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The examination, disciplinary power and rational schooling |author=K Hoskin |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shift from Oral to Written Examination: Cambridge and Oxford 1700–1900 |author=C Stray |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Short History of Performance Assessment: Lessons Learned. |author=GF Madaus, LM O'Dwyer |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Farish was probably born around mid-April, as he was baptized on 21 April 1759. 
Farish's father was the Reverend James Farish (1714–1783), vicar of Stanwix near Carlisle. Farish himself was educated at Carlisle [[Grammar School]], entered [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], as a [[sizar]] in 1774, and graduated [[Senior Wrangler]] and first in [[Smith's Prize]] in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FRS774W|name=Farish, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[tutor]] in 1792, Farish developed the [[concept]] of [[Grade (education)|grading]] [[student]]s' work quantitatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Postman|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Postman|title=[[Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology]]|year=1992|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|location=[[New York City]]|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Professor of Chemistry (Cambridge University)|Professor of Chemistry]] at Cambridge from 1794 to 1813, lecturing on chemistry's practical application.&lt;ref&gt;Anita McConnell, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9162 ‘Farish, William (1759–1837)’], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004 ,accessed 24 Oct 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Farish's lectures as professor of chemistry, which were oriented towards [[natural philosophy]] while the professor of natural and experimental philosophy F. J. H. Wollaston (1762–1828) gave very chemically oriented lectures.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Gunter (1937). ''Early Science in Cambridge''. Oxford, 1937. Pages 230-2&lt;/ref&gt; From 1813 to 1837 Farish was [[Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy]]. In 1819 Professor Farish became the first president of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].

Farish was also Vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Cambridge|St Giles']] and [[St Peter's Church, Cambridge|St Peter]] from 1800 to 1837. He extensively remodelled [[St Giles' Church, Cambridge]], increasing the accommodation from 100 to 600 seats.

== Work ==
At [[Cambridge University]], according to Hilkens (1967), Farish was "the first man to teach the construction of machines as a subject in its own right instead of merely using mechanisms as examples to illustrate the principles of theoretical physics or applied mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Norman Hilken (1967). ''Cambridge University: 1783-1965''. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; He further became "famous for his work in applying chemistry and mechanical science to arts and manufactures".&lt;ref&gt;Rollo Appleyard (1933). ''Charles Parsons: his life and work''. Constable &amp; Co., ltd. p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isometric projection ===
[[File:Optical-grinding engine model.jpg|thumb|Optimal-grinding engine model (1822), drawn in 30° [[Isometric projection|isometric]].&lt;ref&gt;William Farish (1822) "On Isometrical Perspective". In: ''Cambridge Philosophical Transactions''. 1 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In his lectures on the mechanical principles of machinery used in [[manufacturing]] industries, Farish often used [[scale model|models]] to illustrated particular principles. This models were often especially assembled for these lectures and disassembled for storage afterwards. In order to explain how these models were to be assembled he had developed a [[technical drawing|drawing technique]], which he called "Isometrical Perspective".&lt;ref&gt;Snezana Lawrence (2003). [http://gilbert.aq.upm.es/sedhc/biblioteca_digital/Congresos/CIHC1/CIHC1_121.pdf "History of Descriptive Geometry in England"] In: ''Proceedings of the First International Congress on Construction History, Madrid, 20th-24th January 2003''. ed. S. Huerta, Madrid: I. Juan de Herrera, SEdHC, ETSAM, A. E. Benvenuto, COAM, F. Dragados, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of an isometric had existed in a rough way for centuries, William Farish is generally regarded as the first to provide rules for [[isometric drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;Barclay G. Jones (1986). ''Protecting historic architecture and museum collections from natural disasters''. University of Michigan. {{ISBN|0-409-90035-4}}. p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1822 paper "On Isometrical Perspective" Farish recognized the "need for accurate technical working drawings free of optical distortion. This would lead him to formulate isometry. Isometry means "equal measures" because the same scale is used for height, width, and depth".&lt;ref name="Kri96"&gt;J. Krikke (1996). "[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/eastasia/krikke.html A Chinese perspective for cyberspace?]". In: ''International Institute for Asian Studies Newsletter'', 9, Summer 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle of the 19th century, according to Jan Krikke (2006)&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt;  isometry became an "invaluable tool for engineers, and soon thereafter axonometry and isometry were incorporated in the curriculum of architectural training courses in Europe and the U.S. The popular acceptance of axonometry came in the 1920s, when modernist architects from the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] embraced it".&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt; De Stijl architects like [[Theo van Doesburg]] used "axonometry for their architectural designs, which caused a sensation when exhibited in Paris in 1923".&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt;
