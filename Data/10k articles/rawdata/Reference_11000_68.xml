'''''ABC of Emergency Radiology''''' is a book edited by British [[radiologist]] [[Otto Chan]]. It is meant to be useful in emergencies by providing examples to refer to. The book addresses the difficulties in evaluating a radiograph during emergency situations. It also highlights comparisons between normal and abnormal radiographs. One of the main themes of the book is how to avoid the mistakes that can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/ABC-of-Emergency-Radiology/Otto-Chan/e/9780727915283 |title=ABC of Emergency Radiology, ABC Series, Otto Chan, Book - Barnes &amp; Noble |publisher=Search.barnesandnoble.com |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is aimed at trainee radiologists and medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoisier.fr/notice/fr608523.html |title=livre abc of emergency radiology (2nd ed.), médecine d'urgence, radiologie et imagerie medicale, edition lavoisier |publisher=Lavoisier.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It presents radiology from a British perspective and emphasizes plain [[radiography]] and [[sonography]].&lt;ref name=Chong2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chong|first1=Suzanne T.

The '''AMNH Exhibitions Lab''' or '''AMNH Department of Exhibition''' is an interdisciplinary art and research team at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] that designs and produces museum installations, computer programs and film. Founded in 1869, the lab has since produced thousands of installations, many of which have become celebrated works. The department is notable for its integration of new scientific research into immersive art and multimedia presentations. In addition to the famous dioramas at its home museum and the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]], the lab has also produced international exhibitions and software such as the revolutionary [[Digital Universe Atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMNH Education Exhibition|url=http://rggs.amnh.org/pages/school_overview/amnh_education_exhibition|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibitions team currently consists of over sixty artists, writers, preparators, designers and programmers. The department is responsible for the creation of two to three exhibits per year, making the AMNH one of the most extensive exhibition creators in the world. These extensive shows typically travel nationally to sister [[natural history museums]]. Due to the strong relationship between the lab and the museum's extensive research and curation wing, the department has been among the first to introduce brand new topics to the public. They have produced, among others, the first exhibits to discuss [[Darwinian evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/107236a0|last=Osborn|first=Henry Fairfield|authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn|title=The Hall of the Age of Man in the American Museum|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=107|pages=236–240|date=1921-04-21|issue=2686}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change|human-induced climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Hall of Biodiversity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/01/opinion/in-the-hall-of-biodiversity.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=1 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[KT Boundary|mesozoic mass extinction]] via [[asteroid]].

==Dioramas==

The AMNH Dioramas have themselves become major historic attractions, and possibly the best known works of the exhibitions lab. Notable among them is the Akeley Hall of African Mammals which opened in 1936, at a time before widespread color photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: The History of the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index2.html|accessdate=2009-04-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310030540/http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index2.html|archivedate=2009-03-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall showcases the vanishing wildlife of Africa in spaces where the human presence is notably absent, and includes hyperrealistic depictions of [[elephants]], [[hippopotamuses]], [[lions]], [[gorilla]]s, [[zebra]]s, and various species of [[antelope]], including the rarely seen aquatic [[sitatunga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upper Nile Region Diorama|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/uppernile/|accessdate=2009-04-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310030525/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/uppernile/|archivedate=2009-03-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the displays are up to &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;18&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;(5&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; in height and &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;23&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;(7&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; in depth.

With the 1942 opening of the Hall of North American Mammals, diorama art reached a pinnacle. It took more than a decade to create the scenes depicted in the hall which includes a &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;432&amp;nbsp;square foot&amp;nbsp;(40&amp;nbsp;m²)&lt;/span&gt; diorama of the [[American bison]]. The department recently redesigned the hall in order to revitalize the artistic influences of the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Betsy|title=Taxidermists, Artists Bring Aging Museum Animals Back to Lifelike|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/amnh-museum-mammals-restoration/|accessdate=4 June 2013|work=Wired|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, although the art of diorama has ceased to be a major exhibition technique, dramatic examples of this art form are still occasionally employed. In 1997 Museum artists and scientists traveled to the [[Central African Republic]] to collect samples and photographs for the construction of a &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;3,000&amp;nbsp;square foot&amp;nbsp;(300&amp;nbsp;m²)&lt;/span&gt; recreation of a tropical West African rainforest, the Dzanga-Sangha rain forest diorama in the Hall of Biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Biodiversity |url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/biodiversity/rainforest/ |accessdate=2009-03-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403060515/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/biodiversity/rainforest/ |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable dioramas, some dating back to the 1930s have been restored in the [[Milstein Hall of Ocean Life]]. The hall is a &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;29,000&amp;nbsp;square foot&amp;nbsp;(2,700&amp;nbsp;m²)&lt;/span&gt; bi-level room that includes a delicately mounted &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;94&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;(29&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; long model of a Blue Whale swimming beneath and around video projection screens and interactive computer stations. Among the hall's notable dioramas is the "[[sperm whale]] and [[giant squid]]", which represents a true melding of art and science since an actual encounter between these two giant creatures at over one half mile depth has never been witnessed. Another celebrated diorama in the hall represents the "Andros coral reef" in the [[Bahamas]], a two-story-high diorama that features the land form of the Bahamas and the many inhabitants of the coral reef found beneath the water's surface.

[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]

An '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brevis/breve, brevis M – Latin is Simple Online Dictionary|url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/adjective/91/|website=www.latin-is-simple.com|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'', or ''abbrev.''

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[crasis]], [[acronym]]s, or [[initialism]]s, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&amp;dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&amp;q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&amp;q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&amp;f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.

== History ==
{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abbreviations%20history&amp;f=false ''The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography'', Wm. S. Orr and Company, 1838, p.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, ''A'' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as ''ager'', ''amicus'', ''annus'', ''as'', ''Aulus'', ''Aurelius'', ''aurum'' and ''avus''.)"&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;dq=abbreviations++fashionable&amp;q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&amp;f=false ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome''], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' used many abbreviations, for example ''7'' or ''&amp;'' for ''and'', and ''y'' for ''since'', so that "not much space is wasted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviations%20beowulf&amp;f=false Gelderen, E. v, ''A History of the English Language: Revised edition'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483–1660&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015214606/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php |date=October 15, 2007 }} Doesn't work.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for ''master'' and ‹exacɔbate› for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{quote|Mastɔ subwardenɔ y ɔmēde me to you. And wherɔ y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differrɔ thelectionɔ ovɔ to quīdenaɔ tinitatis y have be thougħt me synɔ that itt woll be thenɔ a bowte mydsomɔ.}}

The [[Early Modern English]] period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' for ''Þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', used for the word ''the'': "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."&lt;ref&gt;Lass, R., ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, Vol. 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185657/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does "OK" stand for? |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "[[Special Operations, Executive]]"—"S.O., E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Twitter, a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

== Style conventions in English ==

In modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

=== Lowercase letters ===

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for ''Leviticus''. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for ''year-to-date'', PCB for ''printed circuit board'' and FYI for ''for your information''. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===
[[File:“To Penna. R.R. Station”.jpg|thumb|Sign in New York City subway, reading “Penna.” for Penn''sylvani''a, showing American style of including the period even for contractions.]]
A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to [[Hart's Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="harts"/&gt;{{rp|p167–170}} [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. ''Dr.'' or ''Mrs.''. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either ''US'' or ''U.S.'' for  ''United States'', ''EU'' or ''E.U.'' for ''European Union'', and ''UN'' or ''U.N.'' for ''United Nations''. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:
* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, ''"Northwest Blvd"'', ''"W. Jefferson"'', and ''"PED XING"'' all follow this recommendation.) 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are "[[Numéro sign|No.]]" (to avoid the appearance of "[[yes and no|No]]"); initials within persons' names (such as "George R. Smith"); and "St." within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as "Emily R. St. Clair") (but not in city names such as ''St Louis''  or ''St Paul''). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U.&amp;nbsp;S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: ''The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C''.

=== Plural forms ===

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation".  Also, the [[American Psychological Association]] specifically says,&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'', 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of [[run batted in]], simply add an s to the end of RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RBIs

For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase ''s'' to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.
* A group of MPs
* The roaring 20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb or 20&amp;nbsp;lb
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft or 16&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, ''Hart's Rules'' recommends putting the ''s'' after the final one.
* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* the d.t.s
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:
* PhDs
* MPhils
* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the ''New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors''.)

According to ''Hart's Rules'', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x's of the equation
* Dot the i's and cross the t's
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The ''x''s of the equation
* Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===

==== United States ====

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and the [[Associated Press]].{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.

==== United Kingdom ====

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops—see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''"US"'', not ''"U.S."'');
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''"PR"'', instead of ''"p.r."'', or ''"pr"'')
** Names (''"FW de Klerk"'', ''"GB Whiteley"'', ''"Park JS"'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''"Mr F. W. de Klerk"''.
** Scientific units (see Measurement below).
* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''"Nato"'' or ''"NATO"'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''"Sars"'' or ''"SARS"'' (compare with ''"[[laser]]"'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the ''"British Broadcasting Corporation"'' is abbreviated to ''"BBC"'', never ''"Bbc"''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (&lt;nowiki&gt;100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C&lt;/nowiki&gt;). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====

* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double "l" is a separate sound: "Ll. George" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].
* Some titles, such as "Reverend" and "Honourable", are spelt out when preceded by "the", rather than as "Rev." or "Hon." respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 53. New York City: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurement shorthand—symbol or abbreviation ==
[[File:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China—"km" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]

Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "[[inch]]" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "[[kilometre]]/kilometer".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Woordeboek/Dictionary; Afrikaans-English / Engels-Afrikaans
| editor = Abel Coetzee
| publisher = Collins
| year = 1969
| oclc = 29232187
| location = Glasgow and Johannesburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both "in" and "dm" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary
|publisher = Oxford University Press
|year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies the appropriate shorthand by ''substitution'' rather than by ''contraction''. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (''[[:pt:Quilômetro|quilômetro]]'' in Portuguese or ''[[:el:Χιλιόμετρο|χιλιόμετρο]]'' in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:
*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1&amp;nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;mW (milliwatts).
*No periods should be inserted between letters—for example "m.s" (which is an approximation of "m·s", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for "metres multiplied by seconds", but "ms" is the symbol for milliseconds.
*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter "s" to denote a plural.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==
&lt;!--irony is this is linked from the MOS on how not to do it like this! - see [[MOS:CAPSACRS]]--&gt;
A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

=== Usage ===

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Com'''munications'') and [[Oftel]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Tel'''ecommunications'') use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as [[Tribeca]] ('''''Tri'''angle '''be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street'') and [[SoHo]] ('''''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street''). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]], San Francisco ('''''So'''uth of '''Ma'''rket'') and [[LoDo, Denver]] ('''''Lo'''wer '''Do'''wntown''), among others.

==== Languages other than English====

On the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the ''[[Comintern]]'' (''Communist International'') and ''[[Komsomol]]'' ('''''Kom'''munisticheskii '''So'''yuz '''Mol'''odyozhi'', or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell's [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei'', and are still used, e.g. ''[[:de:Kripo|Kripo]]'' for ''[[:de:Kriminalpolizei|Kriminalpolizei]]''.

In the modern Russian language words like ''Minoborony'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''oborony''' — Ministry of Defence) and ''Minobrnauki'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''obr'''azovaniya i '''nauki''' — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for '''''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit'' ("state security", the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], from the name of the founder, Theo '''Al'''brecht, and the German word '''''Di'''skont'' (discount) or [[Haribo]], from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, '''Ha'''ns '''Ri'''egl '''Bo'''nn.

Syllabic abbreviations are ''de rigueur'' in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as [[Pemex]] for '''''Pe'''tróleos '''Mex'''icanos'' ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for '''''Fo'''ndo '''Na'''cional de '''Fi'''nancimiento '''Fo'''restal'' (National Forestry Financing Fund).

East Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in Japanese the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai rengō'' (国際連合) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (国連). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:略語|ryakugo]] (略語) in Japanese; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''Běidà'' (北大) for ''Běijīng Dàxué'' (北京大学, [[Peking University]]) and ''Tōdai'' (東大) for ''Tōkyō daigaku'' (東京大学, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase "[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

==== Organizations ====
{{See also|Neologism}}

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Ae-oyna-kamuy''' (short: '''Oyna-kamuy''' (オイナカムイ)) is an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[kamuy]]'' (''god'') and [[culture hero]].  In Ainu mythology, he is credited with teaching humans domestic skills, and for this reason he is called '''Aynurakkur''' (アイヌラックㇽ, ''father of the Ainu'' or ''father of humanity'').

==Depiction==
Ae-oyna-kamuy is described as a large man wreathed in smoke.  When the smoke parts, he is seen to be surrounded by flames from his waist to his feet, and wearing a coat of elm bark and a sword.  He also wields a magical [[spear]] of [[mugwort]].  The flames he is wreathed in indicate his virtuous character.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael. ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, 2003. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
There are a number of myths of Ae-oyna-kamuy's origin, arising from different Ainu tribes.&lt;ref name="ash"/&gt;  He is said to be the son of, variously, the elm tree, thunder, the sun, or [[Pakor-kamuy]], the god of plague.

Ae-oyna-kamuy is taught by [[Kamuy-huci]], the hearth deity, and descends from the heavens to impart his knowledge to humanity.  He is responsible for teaching weaving to the Ainu women and carving to the men.  He is credited with teaching techniques of fishing, hunting, gathering, architecture, medicine, and religious ritual, and is associated with law and singing.&lt;ref name="ash"/&gt;  He also fights several battles on behalf of humanity; in one instance, he destroys a personification of famine with his spear of mugwort, then creates herds of deer and schools of fish from the snow on his snowshoes.&lt;ref name="munro"&gt;Munro, Neil Gordon. ''Ainu Creed and Cult''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1995. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Ae-oyna-kamuy, disappointed at the decline of the Ainu, departs for another country; some myths say he returns to the heavens.

In one myth, when he returns to the heavens, the gods send him back because he reeks of humans.  Then he leaves his clothes on earth in order to return. It is said that his old sandals turned into the first squirrels.

However, the manual was likely written either by a member of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] or [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]; in addition, the mentioned targets in the manual are the rulers of Arab countries, not the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/al-qaeda-manual-blueprint-arab-spring-abu-anas-al-libi.html|title=Is Libi’s Al-Qaeda Manual A Blueprint for Arab Spring?|publisher=Al Monitor|date=20 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the selected translated text from the manual are found on a [[United States Department of Justice]] website. (Only some of the manual is provided because it "does not want to aid in educating terrorists or encourage further acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Qaeda Training Manual|url=http://fas.org/irp/world/para/manualpart1.html|website=FAS|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The handbook has been repeatedly invoked by American officials when confronted with accusations of detainee abuse or torture.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;

== Contents ==
The manual was found in a computer file described as "the military series" related to the "Declaration of Jihad."&lt;ref name=FAS /&gt;
According to the United States military, the handbook contains 180 pages divided into 18 chapters.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; It reportedly begins, "The confrontation we are calling for... knows the dialogue of bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing and destruction, and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;
Excerpts publicly available describe the structure of a military organization whose main mission is the "overthrow of the godless regimes and their replacement with an Islamic regime," and include instructions on counterfeiting and forgery, security measures for undercover activities, and strategies in the case of arrest and indictment.&lt;ref name=PbsNewshour20040213 /&gt;
The handbook provides [[religious]] justifications and quotations from the [[Qur'an]] throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4722833.stm|title=US under fire over al-Qaeda guide|date=27 July 2005|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military states that the handbook instructs members of Al Qaeda how to lie to captors during interrogation, and falsely claim they are being tortured.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;

The '''Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary''' (APF) is the national [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] used by pharmacists in [[Australia]], compiled by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Australia]]. New editions of the APF are released every few years, with the latest edition being the 24th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.psa.org.au/product/australian-pharmaceutical-formulary-and-handbook/|title=Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary and Handbook – Pharmaceutical Society of Australia – Online Shop|website=shop.psa.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The APF was originally a pocket-sized booklet first published in 1902, used by physicians as a drugs reference in Australia. In later editions, rather than simply being a listing of pharmaceuticals, medical and clinical information became incorporated within the publication as well, and eventually the title of the APF was extended to the ''Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary and Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;''Preface'', Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary and Handbook (21st edition), page ix. Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. {{ISBN|978-0-908185-95-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The APF is divided in a number of sections, with each pertaining to a specific topic. Information includes dispensing advice for pharmacists when dealing with consumers, clinical monographs, information on complementary medicines, clinical and therapeutic information, national pharmacy standards and guidelines, and physicochemical data of drug constituents.

'''Automated species identification''' is a method of making the expertise of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] available to ecologists, [[parataxonomy|parataxonomists]] and others via computers and other digital technology through [[artificial intelligence]].

== Introduction ==
The '''automated identification''' of biological objects such as [[insects]] (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., [[species]], guilds, characters) has been a dream among [[systematics|systematists]] for centuries. The goal of some of the first [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[biometric]] methods was to address the perennial problem of [[group discrimination]] and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological [[identification (biology)|identification]] has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 [[Daniel Janzen|Dan Janzen]]

updated the dream for a new audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spaceship lands. He steps out. He points it around. It says ‘friendly–unfriendly—edible–poisonous—safe– dangerous—living–inanimate’. On the next sweep it says ‘''Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides''—serpentine’. This has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a century ago.{{clarify|reason=how is this relevant?|date=January 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janzen’s preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their [[DNA]]. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen’s vision in the hands of the [[systematics]] and [[computer science]] community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for creating [[DNA barcode]]s, but also for identification based on [[digital images]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies why automated species identification had not become widely employed at this time and whether it would be a realistic option for the future. The authors found that "a small but growing number of studies sought to develop automated species identification systems based on morphological characters". An overview of 20 studies analyzing species’ structures, such as cells, pollen, wings, and genitalia, shows identification success rates between 40% and 100% on training sets with 1 to 72 species. However, they also identified four fundamental problems with these systems: (1) training sets—were too small (5-10 specimens per species) and their extension especially for rare species may be difficult, (2) errors in identification—are not sufficiently studied to handle them and to find systematics, (3) scaling—studies consider only small numbers of species (&lt;200 species), and (4) novel species — systems are restricted to the species they have been trained for and will classify any novel observation as one of the known species.

A survey published in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wäldchen|first=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|volume=25|issue=2|language=en|pages=507–543|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|pmid=29962832|pmc=6003396|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematically compares and discusses progress and findings towards automated plant species identification within the last decade (2005–2015). 120 primary studies have been published in high-quality venues within this time, mainly by authors with computer science background. These studies propose a wealth of [[computer vision]] approaches, i.e., [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] reducing the high-dimensionality of the pixel-based image data while preserving the characteristic information as well as classification methods.  The vast majority of these studies analyzes [[Leaf|leaves]] for identification, while only 13 studies propose methods for [[flower]]-based identification. The reasons being that leaves can easier be collected and imaged and are available for most of the year. Proposed [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] capture generic object characteristic, i.e., [[shape]], texture, and [[color]] as well as leaf-specific characteristics, i.e., [[Leaf|venation]] and margin. The majority of studies still used datasets for evaluation that contained no more than 250 [[species]]. However, there is progress in this regard, one study uses a dataset with &gt;2k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joly|first=Alexis|last2=Goëau|first2=Hervé|last3=Bonnet|first3=Pierre|last4=Bakić|first4=Vera|last5=Barbe|first5=Julien|last6=Selmi|first6=Souheil|last7=Yahiaoui|first7=Itheri|last8=Carré|first8=Jennifer|last9=Mouysset|first9=Elise|date=2014-09-01|title=Interactive plant identification based on social image data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495411300071X|journal=Ecological Informatics|series=Special Issue on Multimedia in Ecology and Environment|volume=23|pages=22–34|doi=10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another with &gt;20k&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Huisi|last2=Wang|first2=Lei|last3=Zhang|first3=Feng|last4=Wen|first4=Zhenkun|date=2015-08-01|title=Automatic Leaf Recognition from a Big Hierarchical Image Database|journal=International Journal of Intelligent Systems|language=en|volume=30|issue=8|pages=871–886|doi=10.1002/int.21729|issn=1098-111X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[species]].

These developments could not have come at a better time. As the [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very [[biodiversity]] whose preservation has become a global concern. In commenting on this problem in [[palaeontology]] as long ago as 1993, [[Roger Kaesler]] &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; recognized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have contributed so much to its success.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., [[agriculture]], [[biostratigraphy]]) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., [[Conservation biology|conservation]], biological [[oceanography]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]]). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.

[[Systematics]] too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many have identified use of the [[Internet]]— especially via the [[World Wide Web]] — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, [[GenBank]]-like system for accessing [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the [[taxonomic impediment]] or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.

[[File:sphinxGels.png|thumb|340px|thumbnail|[[SDS-PAGE|SDS]] protein gel images of sphinx moth caterpillars. It can be used in a similar way to [[DNA fingerprinting]] ]]

Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and [[gene sequence]]s) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters.

'''Bobo Ashanti''' ("Ashanti" to pay homage to their [[Asante people|Asante]] ancestors of the [[Akan people|Akan]] tribe in present-day [[Ghana]]), also called the '''Ethiopian International Congress''', is a religious group originating in Bull Bay near [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]]. The Bobo Ashanti are one of the strictest [[Mansions of Rastafari]]. They cover their [[dreadlocks]] with [[turban]]s and wear long robes. While some Nyabinghi and Twelve tribe Rastafari drink [[wine]] and are either [[vegetarian]]s or [[Omnivore|omnivores]] (eating plants, animals, and fungi), the Bobo Ashanti are all strictly [[vegan]] and stick to the biblical restrictions regarding their [[nazarite|vow]]; they also add extra restrictions to their diet, e.g. they do not eat [[mangoes]] or [[sugarcane]]. They also adhere to a strict communal life, where women are separated from men; women are also not allowed to cook for their "[[priest]]", they can only cook for their "[[prophet]]s".

The ''Bobo Ashanti'' were founded by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafari)|Prince Emmanuel Charles Edwards]] in the 1950s. Most of its members, called "Bobos" or "Bobo dreads" and "Bobo Ashanti" because the Ashanti (Asante) was majority of African slaves in Jamaica, live in a small utopian community called Bobo Hill, which is near Bull Bay, nine miles from Kingston.

Prince Emmanuel is called "Dada" by his followers, which was a name taken from [[Idi Amin]], who is called Idi Amin Dada. Emmanuel is also seen by the Bobos as part of a [[Trinity|holy trinity]], together with [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]], in which Selassie is seen as king or god ([[Jah]]), Garvey as prophet, and Emmanuel as high priest.

Additionally, some Bobos see Idi Amin, the former [[military]] [[dictator]] of Uganda during the 1970s, as a second coming of Garvey.

Bobos say that "[[Africa]]" is the name that the white man gave to [[Ethiopia]] or [[Jerusalem]]. Many see Black supremacy as essential to the faith; in the Bobo conception, the true [[Israelite]] is a black man.

Twice each week and on the first Sunday of every month, the Bobos fast. Almost all songs and tributes within the community end with the phrase "Holy Emmanuel I Selassie I Jah I Rastafari."  "I" symbolizes unity.

Bobos can usually be distinguished from other Rastafari by their wearing of turbans and robes. Bobo men make and carry brooms to signify cleanliness. The brooms are also sold in Kingston as a way to provide funds for the community.

Almost all men within the community are seen as prophets or priests. The function of a prophet is to "reason" and of a priest is to conduct the services.

Women and children are considered precious to men. Women must cover their legs and arms. A woman may serve food to a guest, but never to a Bobo male.

All children attend a basic school called Jerusalem School Room. After that, they can go to Kingston to school, but that is seldom.

The Bobos have built a strong relationship with the local community outside of Bobo Hill and they often invite people to their services.

From the mid-1990s, many [[reggae]] artists have emerged from the Bobo Ashanti; the most well-known among them are [[Sizzla]], [[Capleton]], [[Anthony B]], [[Lutan Fyah]], [[Turbulence (musician)|Turbulence]] and [[Ras Shiloh]].

'''Building 64''', also known as the '''64 Building''', '''Building #64''' or the '''Building 64 Residential Apartments''', was the first building constructed on the island of [[Alcatraz]] off the coast of [[San Francisco]], USA, entirely for the purpose of accommodating the military officers and their families living on the island.&lt;ref name="Jr2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Jerry Lewis Champion|title=The Fading Voices of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxH3-mB5rCcC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=27 January 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-1488-8|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located next to the [[Alcatraz Wharf|dock]] on the southeastern side of the island below the [[Warden's House (Alcatraz Island)|Warden's House]],&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Donald|last2=Nadel|first2=Ira|title=Alcatraz: History and Design of a Landmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfQWSJLKXdoC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-0153-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three-story apartment block was built in 1905 on the site of a U.S. Army barracks which had been there from the 1860s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31082">The '''''{{lang|fr|mission civilisatrice}}''''' (in English "'''civilising mission'''") was a rationale for [[military intervention|intervention]] or [[colonization]], purporting to contribute to the spread of [[civilization]], and used mostly in relation to the [[Westernization]] of [[indigenous peoples]] in the 15th – 20th centuries.

It was notably the underlying principle of French{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and Portuguese{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} [[colonialism|colonial rule]] in the late 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and early and mid 20th centuries.  It was influential in the French colonies of [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], [[French West Africa]], and [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and in the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]]. The European colonial powers felt it was their duty to bring [[Western civilization]] to what they perceived as [[primitive cultures|backward peoples]]. Rather than merely govern colonial peoples, the Europeans would attempt to Westernize them in accordance with a colonial ideology known as "[[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]".

==Intellectual origins==
The intellectual origins of the ''mission civilisatrice''  can be traced back the Christian tradition dating from the [[Middle Ages]]. European thinkers had naturalized social change by using the [[human development (humanity)|development]] metaphor. In the eighteenth century, history came to be seen as a unilinear, unending, inevitable process of [[Sociocultural evolution|social evolutionism]] with the European nations running ahead.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gilbert Rist]],''Le développement. Histoire d'une croyance occidentale''.Chapter 2: «Les métamorphose d'un mythe occidental», Paris 1996, pp. 48-80, engl. ''The History of development'', 3rd edition 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialists saw the "backward" nations as intrinsically incapable.  "Progressive" thinkers like the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] postulated a holy duty to help those peoples "which, to civilize themselves, wait only to receive the means from us, to find brothers among Europeans and to become their friends and disciples".&lt;ref&gt;Condorcet, ''Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès historique de l'esprit humain'', Paris: GF Flammarion, 1988, p. 269 (chapter 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionist views survived colonialism. [[Modernization theory|Modernization theorists]] declared that traditional customs had to be destroyed, traditional societies had to adapt&lt;ref&gt;"Economic development of an underdeveloped people by themselves is not compatible with the maintenance of their traditional customs and mores. A break with the latter is a prerequisite to economic progress. What is needed is a revolution in the totality of social, cultural and religious institutions and habits, and thus in their psychological attitude, their philosophy and their way of life." J.&amp;nbsp;L. Sadie, "The Social Anthropology of Economic Underdevelopment", ''The Economic Journal'', No. 70, 1960, p.302, quoted in: Gérald Berthoud, "Market" in: ''The Development Dictionary'', ed. by Wolfgang Sachs, London: Zed Books, 1992, pp. 70-87, citation pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; or to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;On the disappearance of indigenous people  as a 'price' for modernization see John H. Bodley, ''Victims of progress'', 3rd ed., Mountain View, Calif : Mayfield Pub. Co, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Development criticism]] sees development therefore as continuation of the colonial civilizing mission. To become civilized has always meant to become "like us", therefore "Civilizing" now meant that in the long run all societies had to become [[Consumerism|consumer societies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Walt Rostow]], ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A non-communist manifesto'', 1960. - on Rostow see Rist 1996, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; and renounce their native traditions and habits.

==By state==

===French colonialism===
An early champion of this idea was French Republican political leader [[Jules Ferry]].  Equal rights and citizenship were extended to those peoples who adopted French culture, including primary use of the French language in their lives, wearing Western clothes, and conversion to Christianity.  Despite granting French citizenship to the residents of the "[[Four Communes]]" ([[Dakar]],  [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Gorée]], and [[Rufisque]]), most West Africans did not adopt French culture or [[Christianity]]. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], "association" replaced assimilation as the fundamental tenet of the colonial relationships. It was thought that French culture might exist in association with indigenous societies and that these autonomous colonies might freely associate with France in the [[French Union]].

===Dutch colonialism===

===Portuguese colonialism===
After consolidating its territory in the 13th century through a [[Reconquista]] of the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim states]] of Western Iberia, the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] started to expand overseas. In 1415, [[Caliphate|Islamic]] [[Ceuta]] was occupied by the Portuguese during the reign of [[John I of Portugal]]. Portuguese expansion in [[North Africa]] was the beginning of a larger process eventually known as the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Overseas Expansion]], under which the Kingdom's goals included the expansion of [[Christianity]] into [[Muslim]] lands and the desire of [[nobility]] for epic acts of war and conquest with the support of the [[Pope]].

As the Portuguese extended their influence around the coast to [[Mauritania]], [[Senegambia]] (by 1445) and [[Guinea]], they created [[trading post]]s. Rather than become direct competitors to the Muslim merchants, they used expanding market opportunities in [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] to increase trade across the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Hodder, Some Comments on the Origins of Traditional Markets in Africa South of the Sahara - Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 1965 - JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Portuguese merchants gained access to the African interior via the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] and [[Gambia river|Gambia]] rivers, which crossed long-standing trans-Saharan routes. The Portuguese brought in [[copper]] ware, [[cloth]], [[tool]]s, [[wine]] and [[horse]]s. Trade goods soon also included [[weapon|arms]] and [[ammunition]]. In exchange, the Portuguese received gold (transported from mines of the [[Akan people|Akan]] deposits), [[Black pepper|pepper]] (a trade which lasted until [[Vasco da Gama]] reached [[India]] in 1498) and [[ivory]]. It was not until they reached the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] coast in the 1480s that they moved beyond Muslim trading territory in Africa.

Forts and [[Factory (trading post)|trading posts]] were established along the coast. Portuguese sailors, merchants, cartographers, priests and soldiers had the task of taking over the coastal areas, settling, and building churches, forts and factories, as well as exploring unknown land and sea. A ''[[Company of Guinea]]'' was founded as a Portuguese governmental institution to control the trade, and called ''Casa da Guiné'' or ''Casa da Guiné e Mina'' from 1482 to 1483, and ''Casa da Índia e da Guiné'' in 1499.

The first of the major European trading [[fort]]s, [[Elmina]], was founded on the Gold Coast in 1482 by the Portuguese. [[Elmina Castle]] (originally known as São Jorge da Mina Castle) was modelled on the [[Castelo de São Jorge]], one of the earliest royal residences in [[Lisbon]]. Elmina, which means "the port", became a major trading centre. By the beginning of the colonial era there were forty such forts operating along the coast. Rather than being icons of colonial domination, the forts acted as trading posts—they rarely saw military action—the fortifications were important, however, when arms and ammunition were being stored prior to trade.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kuper, ''Urbanization and Migration in West Africa'' - 1965 - Berkeley, Calif., U. of California&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th-century Portuguese exploration of the [[Africa]]n coast, is commonly regarded as the harbinger of [[European colonialism]], and also marked the beginnings of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Christian missionary]] [[evangelization]] and the first [[globalization]] processes which were to become a major element of the European colonialism until the end of the 18th century.

Although the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s policy regarding native peoples in the less technologically advanced places around the world (most prominently in [[Brazil]]) had always been devoted to [[enculturation]], including [[teaching]] and [[evangelization]] of the indigenous populations, as well as the creation of novel infrastructure to openly support these roles, it reached its largest extent after the 18th century in what was then [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Portuguese Timor]]. New cities and towns were purportedly designed to accommodate Portuguese settlers and their Europe-inspired infrastructure, which included administrative, military, healthcare, educational, religious, and entrepreneurial halls. 
[[File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|right|[[Queen Nzinga|Queen Ana de Sousa Nzingha Mbande]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657]]
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as "São Paulo de Loanda", with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]], a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of Africa. In the [[Island of Mozambique]], one of the first places where the Portuguese permanently settled in Sub-Saharan Africa, they built the [[Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte]], in 1522, now considered the oldest European building in the [[southern hemisphere]]. Later the hospital, a majestic neo-classical building constructed in 1877 by the Portuguese, with a garden decorated with ponds and fountains, was for many years the biggest hospital south of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Lages, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_/ai_19557190 The island of Mozambique], [[UNESCO]] Courier, May, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a dual, [[racialized]] civil society was formally recognized in ''Estatuto do Indigenato'' (The Statute of Indigenous Populations) adopted in 1929, and was based in the subjective concept of [[civilization]] versus [[tribalism]]. Portugal's colonial authorities were totally committed to develop a fully [[multiethnic]] "civilized" society in its African colonies, but that goal or "civilizing mission", would only be achieved after a period of [[Europeanization]] or [[enculturation]] of the native black tribes and ethnocultural groups. It was a policy which had already been stimulated in the former [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]]. Under Portugal's [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, headed by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], the ''Estatuto'' established a distinction between the "colonial citizens", subject to [[Portuguese law]] and entitled to citizenship rights and duties effective in the "[[metropole]]", and the ''indigenas'' (natives), subject to both colonial legislation and their customary, tribal laws. Between the two groups there was a third small group, the ''assimilados'', comprising native blacks, mulatos, Asians, and mixed-race people, who had at least some formal education, were not subjected to paid forced labor, were entitled to some citizenship rights, and held a special identification card that differed from the one imposed on the immense mass of the African population (the ''indigenas''), a card that the colonial authorities conceived of as a means of controlling the movements of forced labor (CEA 1998). The indigenas were subject to the traditional authorities, who were gradually integrated into the colonial administration and charged with solving disputes, managing the access to land, and guaranteeing the flows of workforce and the payment of taxes. As several authors have pointed out (Mamdani 1996; Gentili 1999; O'Laughlin 2000), the ''Indigenato'' regime was the political system that subordinated the immense majority of native Africans to local authorities entrusted with governing, in collaboration with the lowest echelon of the colonial administration, the "native" communities described as tribes and assumed to have a common ancestry, language, and culture. After the [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], as [[communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of independence. Regardless it was exaggerated anti-Portuguese/anti-"Colonial" propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Dinerman, [http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 "Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624032003/http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 |date=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dominant tendency in Portuguese Africa, or a mix of both, these movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of the territories' ethnic Portuguese population, little attention was paid to local tribal integration and the development of its native communities. According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Portuguese Africa's Portuguese whites were indeed wealthier and more skilled than the black indigenous majority, but the late 1950s, the 1960s and principally the early 1970s, were being testimony of a gradual change based in new socioeconomic developments and equalitarian policies for all.

[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|right|Portuguese overseas territories in Africa during the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime (1933–1974): [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the two largest of those territories]]
The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] began in [[Portuguese Angola]] on 4 February 1961, in an area called the ''Zona Sublevada do Norte'' (ZSN or the Rebel Zone of the North), consisting of the provinces of [[Zaire (province)|Zaire]], [[Uíge Province|Uíge]] and [[Cuanza Norte]]. The U.S.-backed UPA wanted national [[self-determination]], while for the Portuguese, who had settled in Africa and ruled considerable territory since the 15th century, their belief in a multi-racial, assimilated overseas empire justified going to war to prevent its breakup and protect its populations.&lt;ref&gt;George Wright, ''The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945'', Pluto Press, 1997 - {{ISBN|0-7453-1029-X}}, 9780745310299&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese leaders, including [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], defended the policy of multiracialism, or [[Lusotropicalism]], as a way of integrating Portuguese colonies, and their peoples, more closely with Portugal itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnard.edu/history/sample%20thesis/Fine%20thesis.pdf Colorblind Colonialism? Lusotropicalismo and Portugal’s 20th. Century Empire. in Africa.] Leah Fine. Barnard College Department of History, Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For the Portuguese ruling regime, the overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]]. In Portuguese Africa, trained Portuguese black Africans were allowed to occupy positions in several occupations including specialized military, administration, teaching, health and other posts in the [[civil service]] and private [[business]]es, as long as they had the right [[skill|technical]] and human qualities. In addition, [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] of black women with white Portuguese men was a common practice since the earlier contacts with the Europeans. The access to basic, secondary and technical education was being expanded and its availability was being increasingly opened to both the indigenous and European Portuguese of the territories. Examples of this policy include several black Portuguese Africans who would become prominent individuals during the war or in the post-independence, and who had studied during the Portuguese rule of the territories in local schools or even in Portuguese schools and universities in the mainland (the [[metropole]]) - [[Samora Machel]], [[Mário Pinto de Andrade]], [[Marcelino dos Santos]], [[Eduardo Mondlane]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Amílcar Cabral]], [[Joaquim Chissano]], and [[Graça Machel]] are just a few examples. Two large state-run universities were founded in Portuguese Africa in the early 1960s (the ''[[Universidade de Luanda]]'' in Angola and the ''[[Universidade de Lourenço Marques]]'' in Mozambique, awarding a wide range of degrees from engineering to medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/troy/4285/ensino52.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:17:49 52. UNIVERSIDADE DE LUANDA]&lt;/ref&gt;), during a time that in the European mainland only four public universities were in operation, two of them in Lisbon (which compares with the 14 Portuguese public universities today). Several figures in Portuguese society, including one of the most idolized sports stars in Portuguese football history, a black football player from [[Portuguese East Africa]] named [[Eusébio]], were another examples of assimilation and multiracialism. Since 1961, with the beginning of the colonial wars in its overseas territories, Portugal had begun to incorporate black Portuguese Africans in the war effort in Angola, [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] based on concepts of multi-racialism and preservation of the empire.  African participation on the Portuguese side of the conflict ranged from marginal roles as laborers and informers to participation in highly trained operational combat units, including platoon commanders. As the war progressed, use of African counterinsurgency troops increased; on the eve of the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup of 25 April 1974]], Africans accounted for more than 50 percent of Portuguese forces fighting the war. Due to both the technological gap between civilisations and [[Portuguese Empire|the centuries-long colonial era]], [[Portugal]] was a driving force in the development and shaping of all [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Africa]] since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of the nationalistic guerrillas and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the overseas territories were totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development programs to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of the overseas territories in Africa by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of [[economic growth]] and support from the populace.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Mozambique development"&gt;{{pt icon}} [[Kaúlza de Arriaga]] (General), [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/desenvol.html O DESENVOLVIMENTO DE MOÇAMBIQUE E A PROMOÇÃO DAS SUAS POPULAÇÕES - SITUAÇÃO EM 1974, Kaúlza de Arriaga's published works and texts]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this redevelopment program, construction of the [[Cahora Bassa Dam]] began in 1969 in the [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] (the official designation of Portuguese Mozambique by then). This particular project became intrinsically linked with Portugal's concerns over security in the overseas colonies. The Portuguese government viewed the construction of the dam as testimony to Portugal's "civilising mission"&lt;ref&gt;Allen Isaacman.

Retrieved on March 10, 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; and intended for the dam to reaffirm Mozambican belief in the strength and security of the Portuguese colonial government.

====Colonial Brazil====

When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers arrived in 1500, the [[Amerindians]] were mostly semi-[[nomadic]] tribes, with the largest population living on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Unlike [[Christopher Columbus]] who thought he had reached [[India]], the Portuguese sailor [[Vasco da Gama]] had already reached India sailing around [[Africa]] two years before [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] reached Brazil. Nevertheless, the word ''índios'' ("Indians") was by then established to designate the peoples of the [[New World]] and remains so (it is used to this day in the Portuguese language, the people of India being called ''indianos'').

Initially, the Europeans saw the natives as [[noble savage]]s, and [[miscegenation]] began straight away. Tribal warfare and [[cannibalism]] convinced the Portuguese that they should "civilize" the Amerindians,&lt;ref&gt;Megan Mylan, [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/brazil501/indians_trade.html "Indians of the Amazon: Jewel of the Amazon"], FRONTLINE/World, [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), (24 January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; even if one of the four groups of [[Aché people]] in Paraguay practiced cannibalism regularly until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=clast3&gt;Clastres, P. (1974) ''Guayaki cannibalism. In Native South Americans: Ethnology of the Least Known Continent, P. Lyon, ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;309–321''. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]'s [[Exploration|explorers]] discovered Brazil in the 15th century and started to [[colonize]] its new possessions in the [[New World]], the territory was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|various indigenous peoples and tribes]] which had developed neither a [[writing system]] nor [[school]] education.

The [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) has been since its beginnings in 1540 a [[missionary order]]. [[Evangelisation]] was one of the main goals of the Jesuits, but they were also committed to teaching and education, both in Europe and overseas. Their missionary activities, both in the cities and in the countryside, were complemented by a strong commitment to [[Education in Portugal|education]]. This took the form of the opening of schools for young boys, first in Europe, but rapidly extended to America and Asia. The foundation of [[Mission (Christian)|Catholic mission]]s, [[school]]s, and [[seminary|seminaries]] was another consequence of the Jesuit involvement in education. As the spaces and cultures where the Jesuits were present varied considerably, their evangelising methods were very often quite different from one place to another. However, the Society's engagement in trade, architecture, science, literature, languages, arts, music and religious debate corresponded, in fact, to the same main purpose of Christianisation. By the middle of the 16th century the Jesuits were present in West Africa, South America, Ethiopia, India, China, and Japan. In a period of history when the world had a largely [[illiterate]] population, the [[Portuguese Empire]], was home to one of the first universities founded in Europe - the [[University of Coimbra]], which currently is still one of the oldest universities. Throughout the centuries of Portuguese rule, Brazilian students, mostly graduated in the Jesuit missions and seminaries, were allowed and even encouraged to enroll at [[higher education in Portugal|higher education]] in [[mainland Portugal]]. By 1700, and reflecting a larger transformation of the [[Portuguese Empire]], the Jesuits had decisively shifted their activity from the [[East Indies]] to Brazil. In the late 18th century, Portuguese minister of the kingdom [[Marquis of Pombal]] attacked the power of the privileged nobility and the church, and expelled the Jesuits from Portugal and its overseas possessions. Pombal seized the Jesuit schools and introduced educational reforms all over the empire.

In 1772, even before the establishment of the [[Science Academy of Lisbon]] (1779), one of the first learned societies of both Brazil and the [[Portuguese Empire]] was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]] - it was the ''Sociedade Scientifica''. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Bahia]]. During the late 18th century, the ''Escola Politécnica'' (then the ''Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho'') of Rio de Janeiro was created in 1792 through a decree issued by the Portuguese authorities as a higher education school for the teaching of the sciences and engineering. It belongs today to the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]] and is the oldest engineering school of Brazil, and one of the oldest in [[Latin America]]. A royal letter of November 20, 1800 by the King [[John VI of Portugal]] established in [[Rio de Janeiro]] the ''Aula Prática de Desenho e Figura'', the first institution in Brazil dedicated to teaching the arts. During [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]], the arts were mainly religious or utilitarian and were learned in a system of [[apprenticeship]]. A Decree of August 12, 1816 created an ''Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios'' (Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts), which established an official education in the fine arts and was the foundation of the current [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]].

In the 19th century the Portuguese royal family, headed by [[John VI of Portugal|D. João VI]], arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] escaping from the [[Napoleon]]'s army invasion of Portugal in 1807. D. João VI gave impetus to the expansion of European civilization in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Sérgio Campos Gonçalves, "[http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/pesquisa/DetalheObraDownload.do?select_action=&amp;co_obra=176848&amp;co_midia=2 O pensamento civilizador e a cultura historiográfica brasileira no século XIX]", ''Revista Fazendo História'' - CCHLA / UFRN (Natal), v. 1, p. 128-147, 2008, ISSN 1983-1439.&lt;/ref&gt; In a short period between 1808 and 1810, the [[Portuguese government]] founded the Royal Naval Academy and the Royal Military Academy, the [[Fundação Biblioteca Nacional|Biblioteca Nacional]], the [[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden]], the Medico-Chirurgical School of [[Bahia]], currently known as Faculdade de Medicina under harbour of [[Universidade Federal da Bahia]] and the Medico-Chirurgical School of Rio de Janeiro which is the modern-day Faculdade de Medicina of the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]].

===Chile===
Nineteenth century elites of South American republics also used a civilizing mission rhetoric to justify armed actions against indigenous groups. On January 1, 1883, Chile refounded the old city of [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]], thus formally ending the process of the [[Occupation of Araucanía|occupation of the indigenous lands of Araucanía]].&lt;ref name=MemCHL&gt;{{Citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;The country has with satisfaction seen the problem of the reduction of the whole Araucanía solved. This event, so important to our social and political life, and so significant for the future of the republic, has ended, happily and with costly and painful sacrifices. Today the whole Araucanía is subjugated, more than to the material forces, to the moral and civilizing force of the republic ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Optical media ability==
Information about what kinds of [[optical disc]]s the players can play. Footnotes lead to information about abilities of future versions of the players or plugins that provide such functionality.
Playback of [[Super Audio CD]] is not possible for any media player, because no suitable hardware exists.
All media players capable of [[Compact Disc|audio CD]] playback will also play the [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Redbook]] core of any [[High Definition Compatible Digital|HDCD]] disc, providing no sound-quality benefits over standard audio CDs.

==Features==
* '''Hidden containers''': Whether hidden containers (an encrypted container (A) within another encrypted container (B) so the existence of container A can not be established)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetico.com/linux/bcrypt-help/c_hiddn.htm] Hidden containers description from Jetico (BestCrypt)&lt;/ref&gt; can be created for [[deniable encryption]]. Note that some [[Block cipher modes of operation|modes of operation]] like CBC with a plain IV can be more prone to [[watermarking attack]]s than others.
* '''Pre-boot authentication''': Whether authentication can be required before booting the computer, thus allowing one to encrypt the [[boot disk]].
* '''[[Single sign-on]]''': Whether credentials provided during pre-boot authentication will automatically log the user into the host operating system, thus preventing [[password fatigue]] and reducing the need to remember multiple passwords.
* '''Custom authentication''': Whether custom authentication mechanisms can be implemented with third-party applications.{{clarify|e.g. perhaps link to WP's article re: 1-time password (OTP) tokens? See Talk Page: someone else also was confused about exactly what this includes; pls give some examples &amp; links.|date=January 2011}}
* '''Multiple keys''': Whether an encrypted volume can have more than one active [[Key (cryptography)|key]].
* '''Passphrase strengthening''': Whether [[key strengthening]] is used with plain text passwords to frustrate [[dictionary attack]]s, usually using [[PBKDF2]].
* '''Hardware acceleration''': Whether dedicated [[cryptographic accelerator]] expansion cards can be taken advantage of.
* '''[[Trusted Platform Module]]''': Whether the implementation can use a TPM [[cryptoprocessor]].
* '''Filesystems''': what filesystems are supported.
* '''[[Two-factor authentication]]''': Whether optional [[security tokens]] ([[Hardware Security Module|hardware security modules]], such as Aladdin eToken and [[smart cards]]) are supported (for example using [[PKCS11|PKCS#11]])

&lt;ref name=BitLocker2F&gt;BitLocker can be used with a TPM PIN + external USB key for two-factor authentication&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=BitLockerFS&gt;Windows 7 introduces Bitlocker-To-Go which supports NTFS, FAT32 or exFAT, however for hard drive encryption, [[Windows Vista]] and later are limited to be installable only on NTFS volumes&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=dm-cryptTPM&gt;An external tool can be used to read the key from the TPM and then have the key passed on to dm-crypt/LUKS via the [[standard input]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TrueCryptMystery&gt;The current situation around TrueCrypt project is controversial. On 28.05.2014 after many years of development and broad usage the open-source (although anonymous) project was suddenly stopped, and all previous official materials and complete (encrypt/decrypt) binaries were withdrawn from its website citing some "unfixed security issues" and Windows XP end of support. The technical information herein is valid only for previous versions of TrueCrypt (v7.1a and some earlier). The latest available version (v7.2) is decrypt only, its authenticity and actual reasons behind the move are unclear, and its usage is not recommended. http://www.zdnet.com/truecrypt-quits-inexplicable-7000029994/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layering==
{{details|Encryption layer in storage stack}}
* '''Whole disk''': Whether the whole physical disk or logical volume can be encrypted, including the partition tables and master boot record. Note that this does not imply that the encrypted disk can be used as the boot disk itself; refer to pre-boot authentication in the features comparison table.
* '''Partition''': Whether individual [[disk partition]]s can be encrypted.
* '''File''': Whether the encrypted container can be stored in a file (usually implemented as encrypted [[loop device]]s).
* '''Swap space''': Whether the [[swap space]] (called a "pagefile" on Windows) can be encrypted individually/explicitly.
* '''Hibernation file''': Whether the [[Hibernate (OS feature)|hibernation file]] is encrypted (if hibernation is supported).

==Modes of operation==
{{details|Disk encryption theory}}

Different modes of operation supported by the software. Note that an encrypted volume can only use one mode of operation.
* '''CBC with predictable IVs''': The CBC ([[cipher block chaining]]) mode where [[initialization vector]]s are statically derived from the sector number and are not secret; this means that IVs are re-used when overwriting a sector and the vectors can easily be guessed by an attacker, leading to [[watermarking attack]]s.
* '''CBC with secret IVs''': The CBC mode where initialization vectors are statically derived from the encryption key and sector number. The IVs are secret, but they are re-used with overwrites. Methods for this include ESSIV and encrypted sector numbers (CGD).
* '''CBC with random per-sector keys''': The CBC mode where random keys are generated for each sector when it is written to, thus does not exhibit the typical weaknesses of CBC with re-used initialization vectors. The individual sector keys are stored on disk and encrypted with a master key. (See [[GBDE]] for details)
* '''LRW''': The Liskov-Rivest-Wagner tweakable narrow-block mode, a mode of operation specifically designed for disk encryption. Superseded by the more secure XTS mode due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE P1619#LRW issue|LRW_issue]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Disk encryption theory#XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (XTS)|XTS]]''': XEX-based Tweaked CodeBook mode (TCB) with CipherText Stealing (CTS), the [[IEEE P1619|SISWG]] (IEEE P1619) standard for disk encryption.
* '''[[Authenticated encryption]]''': Protection against ciphertext modification by an attacker

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6304">The '''''PubMed Dietary Supplement Subset''''' (PMDSS) is a joint project between the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) and the NIH ''Office of Dietary Supplements'' (ODS). PMDSS is designed to help people search for [[academic journal|academic journal articles]] related to [[dietary supplement]] literature. The subset was created using a search strategy that includes terms provided by the Office of Dietary Supplements, and selected journals indexed for [[PubMed]] that include significant dietary supplement related content. It succeeds the ''International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements'' (IBIDS) database, 1999-2010, which was a collaboration between the Office of Dietary Supplements and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[National Agricultural Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==The Subset==
ODS and NLM partnered to create this Dietary Supplement Subset of NLM's PubMed database. PubMed provides access to citations from the [[MEDLINE]] database and additional [[life science]] academic journals. It also includes links to many full-text articles at journal Web sites and other related Web resources.

The subset is designed to limit search results to [[citation index|citations]] from a broad spectrum of dietary supplement literature including vitamin, mineral, phytochemical, ergogenic, botanical, and herbal supplements in human nutrition and animal models. The subset will retrieve dietary supplement-related citations on topics including, but not limited to:

*chemical composition; 
*biochemical role and function — both in vitro and in vivo; 
*clinical trials; 
*health and adverse effects; 
*fortification; 
*traditional Chinese medicine and other folk/ethnic supplement practices; 
*cultivation of botanical products used as dietary supplements; as well as, 
*surveys of dietary supplement use.&lt;ref&gt;

|title=About the PubMed Dietary Supplement Subset 
|format= U.S.Government content and in the Public Domain
|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/PubMed_Dietary_Supplement_Subset.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PMDSS is a free service and can be accessed either directly through the ODS Website or in PubMed using the Dietary Supplement filter (formerly referred to as a Limit).

==History==
Dietary supplements were first regulated in by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. In 1941 the United States Food and Drug Administration proferred definitions for dietary supplementary foods which included minerals, vitamins and other specialized supplements. In the early 1970s the FDA tried to restrict the definition of dietary supplements to essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. However, as the 1970s progressed, a 1974 court decision and legislation that passed in 1976 would not allow such action. In 1994, against recommendations from the FDA, the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (DSHEA) was passed. This act defined dietary supplements, made safety a matter of regulation, stated the requirements for approved third party literature, and regulated label content.&lt;ref name=hpg/&gt;

DSHEA mandated the establishment of the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health. The mission of ODS is to strengthen knowledge and understanding of dietary supplements by evaluating scientific information, stimulating and supporting research, disseminating research results, and educating the public to foster an enhanced quality of life and health for the U.S. population. In support of this mission the ODS created two databases one of which was named the ''International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements (IBIDS) database''. The other database, ''Computer Access to Research on Dietary Supplements'' (CARDS), is a database of federally funded research projects pertaining to dietary supplements. The IBIDS database was retired in 2010 and the PMDSS was launched to continue the ODS mission to disseminate dietary supplement-related research results.&lt;ref name=hpg&gt;

'''DigitalNZ''' is a service run by the [[National Library of New Zealand]] and funded by the [[New Zealand Government]]. It is aimed at making New Zealand digital content easier to find, share and use.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About DigitalNZ | work = DigitalNZ | publisher = National Library of New Zealand | url = http://www.digitalnz.org/about | format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date there are over 25 million digital items&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = McDowall | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Visualising DigitalNZ content over time | work = DNZ Blog | publisher = DigitalNZ | date = 3 November 2011 | url = http://www.digitalnz.org/blog/posts/visualising-digitalnz-content-over-time | format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  available to view from over 120 partner organisations.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; The partner organisations include from the cultural institutions, government departments, publicly funded organisations, educational and research organisations as well as the private sector and community groups. The digital content available to search in DigitalNZ includes photographs, artworks, newspapers, books, other archival material, journal articles, music, film and data sets. DigitalNZ also supports the creation and digitisation of new material, hosts content, advocates for Creative Commons NZ licences and the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework,&lt;ref&gt;http://nzgoal.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes and encourages the creative reuse of digital material.

==History==
DigitalNZ was officially launched on 3 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Media release: Digital New Zealand Launched | work = National Library of New Zealand website | publisher = National Library of New Zealand | date = 3 December 2008 | url = http://www.natlib.govt.nz/about-us/news/media-releases/3-dec-2008-digitalnz-launch | format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its official launch, DigitalNZ worked on and launched the Coming Home search experience and the Coming Home Memory Maker campaign. Both of those experiences went live on 11 November 2008 as part of the celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|World War One Armistice]].

==Services==

===Finding===
DigitalNZ aims to make discoverable New Zealand digital content. Much of the content available via DigitalNZ's [[federated search]] function is part of the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|deep web]]. Deep web content is not indexed by standard search engines and so does not appear in standard search engine results. The project continues to recruit content-contributing partners and harvests content metadata via auto-updating [[XML sitemaps]], [[RSS]] feeds, or [[OAI-PMH]] compliant feeds. Contributor's content must have a connection and relevance to New Zealand and also have metadata (machine readable content descriptions).

===Sharing===
The project is making more digital content available as its partners build on their contributions. DigitalNZ also continues to recruit new partner organisations. It supports digitisation efforts via its Make it Digital site, where it provides guides to assist digitisation good practice and a platform to nominate, discuss and vote on possible digitisation projects. It aims to encourage organisations who are undertaking digitisation work, or who are funding digitisation, to test digitisation against community wishes. DigitalNZ has also provided seed funding to a number of ideas nominated on this platform.

DigitalNZ also provides [[API]] access to computer programmers so the programmers can use the metadata to create their own applications.

===Using===
The project also encourages the reuse and remixing of both the metadata and content (rights permitting). It encourages contributors to open their content to reuse and remix by providing educational guides on rights management and supporting creative commons licenses. As an aggregator of metadata rather than hosting the content itself, DigitalNZ relies on the contributors to check the copyright status of contributions and commit to openness and reuse.

Digital NZ has run two Mix &amp; Mash Competitions, in association with [https://creativecommons.org.nz/ Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ], aimed at promoting and providing examples of community reuse and remixing of digital content. Supreme winners to date are:
*[http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/supreme-creative-remix/ 2011 - Supreme Mashup: A Grand Mother by Candy Elsmore]
*[http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/supreme-data-mashup/ 2011 - Supreme Data Mashup: 100 Companies by Alex Gibson &amp; Graham Jenson]

===Make it Digital===
Make it Digital provides good practice guides for creating digital content and identifies elements of good practice based on an understanding of the digital content life cycle.

Oppen''' was the creator of one of the first [[stamp catalogue]]s in English&lt;ref name=abps&gt;[http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/Who_Was_Who/index.xalter#O Who Was Who in British Philately], [[Association of British Philatelic Societies]], 2010. Retrieved 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the author of a number of foreign language textbooks. In a stamp collecting journal, he was described as a "...classical teacher".&lt;ref&gt;"Answers to Correspondents" in ''The Stamp-Collector's Magazine'', Vol. V, 1 October 1867, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Postage Stamp Album and Catalogue==
In January 1863, Oppen published the first edition of his ''Postage Stamp Album, and Catalogue of British and Foreign Postage Stamps'', which combined for the first time a stamp catalogue and [[stamp album]] in one book. The publication quickly went through many editions as news of new stamps reached collectors. There were two editions in 1863, and three in 1864-65, all edited by Henry Whymper. A review of the second edition noted that it was ''"...much improved by that prince of engravers, Henry Whymper."'' &lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PNoEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA13&amp;lpg=RA2-PA13&amp;dq=Henry+Whymper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v08NMy3qdv&amp;sig=WnbMNsrZEJRLbunvvRRU1brn4TI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F00WTpqBDYywhQelk8g0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20Whymper&amp;f=false Reviews]" in ''The National Postage Stamp Express'', 15 March 1864, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1865 review of the sixth edition recorded that the editor had included, with permission, information from [[Mount Brown (philatelist)|Mount Brown]], [[John Edward Gray|Dr Gray]] and Mr Pemberton (presumably [[Edward Loines Pemberton|E.L. Pemberton]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews of Postal Publications" in ''The Stamp-Collector's Magazine'', Vol. III, 1 January 1865, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; A further twenty-eight editions followed, edited by [[Charles Viner]].&lt;ref name=abps/&gt;

'''Edward Ellis Morris''' (25 December 1843 – 1 January 1902) was an English educationist and miscellaneous writer and latterly in colonial Australia.

Morris was born at [[Madras]], [[India]], fourteenth child of [[John Carnac Morris]],  accountant-general of the [[British East India Company]] at Madras, and his wife Rosanna Curtis. Morris was educated at [[Rugby School]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], where he graduated B.A. in 1866, with final honours in classics, law and modern history and M.A. 1869. He was an assistant master at St Peter's College, Radley, and at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]], and in 1871 became headmaster of the [[Bedfordshire]] middle class public school. From 1875 to 1883 he was headmaster of the [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Church of England grammar school]] which made progress under his direction. During his period he established the prefect system in 1876, and started the first school journal and the first school library in [[Melbourne]]. Morris resigned from Melbourne Grammar in March 1882 after financial difficulties hit the school; pupil numbers were in decline, partly due to the economic environment and partly to Morris's disciplinary measures.

In November 1882 Morris was appointed [[Walter Watson Hughes|Hughes]] professor of [[English language|English]] at the [[University of Adelaide]]. In 1883 Morris accepted an offer from the [[University of Melbourne]] for the position of professor of modern languages and literatures. Morris introduced courses in English, [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] languages and literature. Morris took a prominent part in the management of the university; for several years he was president of the professorial board, and he was also  in 1876 elected to the council of [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', 10 Oct. 1876, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also many outside interests and it was at his suggestion that a branch of the [[Charity Organization Society]], of which he was the first president, was founded in Melbourne in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;"Charity Organisation Conference: A Society Formed," ''The Argus'' [Melbourne], 13 May 1887, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Melbourne Shakespeare Society]], for many years the most flourishing literary society in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], was also founded on his suggestion and was its inaugural president 1884–1888. Morris took the greatest interest in the Melbourne public library of which he was appointed a trustee in 1879. He became vice-president of the trustees in 1896. His "''Memoirs of [[George Higinbotham]]''"  was published in 1895, and his most important work, his painstaking and valuable ''Austral English: A Dictionary Of Australasian Words, Phrases And Usages'' was published in 1898. For this, he was awarded a [[Doctor of Letters|Litt. D.]] degree by the University of Melbourne. Morris died while on a visit to Europe on 1 January 1902.

Morris married the eldest daughter (died 1896) of George Higinbotham in 1879. He was survived by a son and three daughters. Morris also wrote two small volumes for the "Epochs of Modern History" series, ''The Age of Anne'' (1877), and ''The Early Hanovarians'' (1886). Morris edited the four volumes of Cassell's ''Picturesque Australasia'' (1887–89) and some of his lectures were also published separately. He had completed a work ''Cook and his Companions'' before his death which has not been published.

The '''Eurasia Party''' ({{lang-ru|Евразия}}) is a [[Russian political party]]. It was registered by the [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice]] on 21 June 2002, approximately one year after the [[All-Russian nation|pan-Russian]] [[Eurasia Movement]] was established by [[Aleksandr Dugin]]. This means that the party enjoys full rights within the Russian political process.

Often seen to be a form of [[National Bolshevism]], one of the basic ideas that underpin Eurasian theories is that [[Moscow]], [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] form a natural geopolitical axis because a line or axis from Moscow to Berlin will pass through the vicinity of Paris if extended. They foresee an eternal world conflict between land and sea, between the [[United States]] and [[Russia]], Dugin believes: "In principle, [[Eurasia]] and our space, the heartland (Russia), remain the staging area of a new anti-[[bourgeois]], [[anti-American]] [[revolution]]". According to his 1997 book ''[[The Basics of Geopolitics]]'': "The new Eurasian [[empire]] will be constructed on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of [[Atlanticism]], strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us. This common [[civilisation]]al impulse will be the basis of a political and strategic union".

The Eurasia Party was founded by Dugin on the eve of [[George W. Bush]]'s visit to Russia at the end of May 2002. The party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the [[Second Chechen War|Chechen problem]], with the objective of setting the stage for Dugin's dream of a Russian [[strategic alliance]] with [[Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern states, primarily [[Iran]].

== Platform ==
The Eurasia Party is based on the following five principles:
# It is a [[geopolitical]] party of the [[wikt:patriot|patriot]]s of Russia and of the [[Statism|statists]].
# It is a [[Social conservatism|social]] party, believing that the development of the [[Market (economics)|market]] must serve the national interest. Interests of the [[Sovereign state|state]] are in command and administrative resources must be [[Nationalisation|deprivatized]].
# It is a [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]]-[[communist party]], founded on a system of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] values elaborated by the traditional Eurasian [[Religion|confessions]], namely [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurasia.com.ru/dugin0103_eng.html|title=The Pan-Russian Social-Political Movement EURASIA: stages of our path|publisher=Eurasia|date=1 March 2002|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Separation of church and state|church is separated from the state]] in some degree from the society, culture, education and information and it is controlled by the state.
# It is a [[Nationalism|national]] party. In it the representatives of the national movements—first of all [[Russians|Russian]], but also [[Tatars|Tatar]], [[Yakuts|Yakut]], [[Tuva]], [[Chechen people|Chechen]], [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]] and [[Demographics of Russia|all the other ones]]—can find a way to express their political and cultural aspirations.
# It is a [[Regionalism (politics)|regional]] party. The rectification and salvation of Russia will come from the [[Regions of Russia|regions]], where the people have saved their [[Communism|communist]] roots, the [[Tradition|sentiment of the past]] and [[family values]].

=== Foreign policy ===
With respect to [[foreign policy]], the Eurasia Party believes that:
* The path the West has taken is destructive. Its civilization is spiritually empty, false and monstrous. Behind [[First World|economic prosperity]] there is a total spiritual [[Decadence|degradation]].
* The [[Exceptionalism|originality]] of Russia, its difference from both [[Western world|West]] and [[Eastern world|East]], is a positive value. It must be saved, developed and taken care of.
* The United States exploited sorrow of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]] in order to strengthen their positions in [[Central Asia]]. Under the cover of the [[War on Terror|fight on terrorism]], it took roots in the [[Post-Soviet space|Russian zone of influence]] and in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].
* From the cultural, social and political points of view, Europe is close to the United States, but its geopolitical, geostrategic and economic concerns are on the contrary close to Russia-Eurasia.

=== Domestic policy ===
With respect to [[domestic policy]], the Eurasia Party intends to:
* Reinforce the strategic unity of Russia, her geopolitical homogeneity, the vertical line of authority, curtail the influence of the [[Russian oligarch|oligarchic clans]], support [[national business]] and fight [[separatism]], [[extremism]] and [[localism (politics)|localism]].
* Promote Eurasist [[federalism]] by conferring the status of political subjects onto the ethno-cultural formations and by enforcing the principles of the rights of the peoples.
* Promote Eurasist [[economics]] by encouraging [[autarchy]] of the great spaces, [[economic nationalism]] and subordination of the [[market mechanism]]s to the concerns of the [[national economy]].

The '''''Flora Europaea''''' is a 5-volume encyclopedia of plants, published between 1964 and 1993 by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The aim was to describe all the national [[Flora]]s of Europe in a single, authoritative publication to help readers identify any wild or widely cultivated plant in Europe to the [[subspecies]] level. It also provides information on geographical distribution, [[habitat]] preference, and [[chromosome]] number, where known.

The ''Flora'' was released in CD form in 2001, and the  [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] have made an index to the plant names available online.

==History==
The idea of a pan-European Flora was first mooted at the 8th [[International Congress of Botany]] in Paris in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Newbould   | first = Palmer  | authorlink =  | title = Obituary: Alan Burges  | publisher = Independent  | date = 4 November 2002  | location = London  | pages =   | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Britain's [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] provided grants to fund a secretariat of three people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The House of Lords enquiry:- Systematic Biology in the UK - transcript of committee Tuesday 5 February 2002 | work =   | publisher = The Systematics Association  | date =   | url =  http://www.systass.org/links/systass-lords-transcript.shtml | doi =   | accessdate =  2007-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Volume 1 was published in 1964. More volumes were issued in the following years, culminating in 1980 with the [[monocot]]s of Volume 5. The royalties were put into a trust fund administered by the [[Linnean Society]], which allowed funding for Dr John Akeroyd to continue work on the project.&lt;ref name="Plantbase"&gt;{{cite web   | last =  | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = E+M About  | work =   | publisher =  Euro+Med Plantbase | date =   | url = http://www.emplantbase.org/information.html#19  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate =  2007-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised Volume 1 was launched at the Linnean Society on 11 March 1993.

[[Herb Green|Green]] v Matheson [1989] NZCA 195; [1989] 3 NZLR 564; [1990] NZAR 49  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding compensation for [[medical error|medical misadventure]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Matheson was a victim of the "unfortunate experiment" at the [[National Women's Hospital]]. Doctor Green was her [[gynaecologist]]. Barred by the [[Accident Compensation Act]] to sue for negligence, she sued instead for trespass to her person.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal sitting as a bench of 5, ruled that her claim came under the term of medical misadventure, which was barred under the Act

The '''Jewish National Front''' ({{lang-he-n|חֲזִית יְהוּדִית לְאוּמִּית}}, ''Hazit Yehudit LeUmit''), commonly known in Israel by its Hebrew acronym, '''Hayil''' (Hebrew: חי"ל), was a [[far-right]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709072310/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1227702390504&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Date for far right Umm el-Fahm march announced] The Jerusalem Post, 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of political parties in Israel|political party]] in [[Israel]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
The party was founded in January 2004 by [[Baruch Marzel]]. The party ran in the [[Israel legislative election, 2006|2006 elections to the Knesset]] on a joint list with Professor [[Paul Eidelberg]]'s [[Yamin Yisrael]] party but received less than the 2% minimum number of votes required to pass the threshold to receive representation. 

[[Baruch Marzel]] was a senior activist for [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], the most right-wing stream of nationalism in Israel, though Marzel was number two on Kleiner's Herut list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 Knesset elections]].

In 2008, prior to the elections for the 18th Knesset, the party merged with [[Eretz Yisrael Shelanu]], which, in turn, joined with the larger [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] party.  Jewish National Front representative [[Michael Ben-Ari]] was given the fourth spot on the list, and subsequently won a seat in the 18th Knesset in 2009.  This marks the first time the Jewish National Front enjoyed [[Knesset]] representation.

==Position==
The party calls for a change in the country's electoral system so that [[Knesset]] members represent constituencies, rather than being elected on a party list system, as well as switching to a presidential system of government.&lt;ref name=GB&gt;[http://galileeblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/hazit-jewish-national-front-by-prof.html Hazit: The Jewish National Front -- By Prof. Paul Eidelberg] GalileeBlog, 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It also supports preserving Israel as a [[Jew]]ish state by increasing [[aliyah|Jewish immigration]], limiting immigration of people who are not Jews according to [[Halakha]], and Jewish education in public schools,&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; and is against territorial compromise, citing the stance of Rabbi [[Chaim Zimmerman]], who wrote a halakhic discourse entitled "The Prohibition of Abandoning Land in Eretz Yisrael".&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10389">{{About||the Polish film|Little Moscow (film)}}
'''Little Moscow''' was a term for towns and villages in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] societies whose population appeared to hold extreme [[left-wing]] political values or [[Communism|communist]] views. The places so named were typically in working class areas, normally with strong [[trade union]] links to a heavy industry.

==History of use in Great Britain==
The term first appeared within [[Great Britain]] between the two World Wars, and although referring to several places in Britain, three communities are primarily associated with the pseudonym: the [[Vale of Leven]] in Scotland, [[Chopwell]] in England and [[Maerdy]] in Wales. The term was initially used as an insult by newspapers,&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/03_79_85.pdf|title=Red Strongholds Between the Wars | work=Marxism Today | author=[[Stuart Macintyre]]| date=March 1979 | accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was quickly embraced and used as a term of pride by the labelled communities.&lt;ref name="Davies468"&gt;Davies (2008), pg 468.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Vale of Leven, the area was reliant on the dyeing industry, and after high unemployment during the 1920s and 1930s the people of the area turned to radical socialist and communist views. This resulted in the Vale of Leven District Council becoming the first local council in Great Britain to see the Communists becoming the single largest representatives. Chopwell and Maerdy have a more similar history, with both areas once housing coal mining industries. Chopwell was first tagged as a 'Little Moscow' in the 1920s as a result of its strong support for the Communist Party, and still has streets in the village named after Communist Party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/09/24/little-moscow-in-gateshead-set-to-get-revamp-72703-24768923/|title=Little Moscow in Gateshead set to get revamp | work=Evening Chronicle | author=Linda Richards| date=24 September 2009 | accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maerdy was also labelled on account of its socialist sympathies; the first recorded instance of its being named a 'Little Moscow' was recorded in the ''South Wales Daily News'' in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/heritagetrail/english/rhondda/maerdy.html |title=Library Service Heritage Trail- Maerdy | work=Rhondda Cynon Taf Library Services | author=| accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miners of Maerdy took great pride in the tag, producing several important Communist trade unionists including [[Arthur Horner (trade unionist)|Arthur Horner]], a founder member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].

===Reasons for the popularity of communism in Great Britain===
Social and economic conditions were very similar in all the towns labelled 'Little Moscow'. All these areas comprised a single industry community, in which one heavy industry employed the majority of the workers, and the local amenities were reliant upon the wages that industry supplied.&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"/&gt; This resulted in a close-knit community with strong social ties and responsibilities. During the early 20th century most of the areas were still expanding, and employment levels were high, but after [[World War I]], despite an initial inflationary boom, the industries experienced market contractions and a series of general strikes. These were followed by a protracted depression in the 1930s, which resulted in mass unemployment across all sectors of the coal, steel, textile and shipbuilding industries.&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"/&gt; A mixture of unemployment, the rise of trade unionism and the dissatisfaction brought about by World War I led to an increasing level of industrial unrest.

Many of the areas that would later be dubbed 'Little Moscows' had earlier in the century attempted to find another system other than the capitalist system favoured by the state. In 1912 the [[Rhondda]] saw the publication of ''[[The Miners' Next Step]]'', a [[Syndicalism|Syndicalist]] manifesto published by [[Noah Ablett]]. Ablett, a one-time check weight man from the [[Mardy Colliery]] in Maerdy, was a founding member of the [[Plebs' League]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] organisation originating from [[Ruskin College, Oxford]]. Syndicalism was quickly replaced by communist ideals.

In the 1920s, the old [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] were being surpassed by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the trade unions began the transition from supporting the Liberals to Labour.&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"/&gt; In many communities the constituency Labour parties were not established, and thus through worker efforts both Labour and communist organisations came into being at the same time.&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"/&gt; This allowed militant workers to join the Communist Party without being isolated. These Communists were able to fashion alliances with the newly formed Labour Party, and eventually gained enough support to gain seats on local councils.

Another factor was the admiration held by many people from the areas for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Marxism Today"/&gt; [[Friends of the Soviet Union]] had branches in many of the communities, and reciprocal visits of children and sports teams were arranged.

==History of use in mainland Europe==
As within Britain, several settlements in mainland Europe have been dubbed "Little Moscow" during the 20th century. Similarly to Great Britain, these towns and villages often held Communist values or sympathies and often voted in local political officers of the Communist party despite being outside the [[Iron Curtain]]. In his 2011 paper ''Little Moscows in Western Europe: The Ecology of Small-Place Communism'', Professor Ad Knotter of Maastricht University, identified ten such locations in mainland Western Europe that had been named as ''Little Moscow'': [[Tarnac]], [[Saint-Junien]], [[Halluin]], [[Sallaumines]] and [[Villerupt]] in France; [[Finsterwolde]] in the Netherlands and [[Mössingen]], [[Selb]], [[Frauenau]] and [[Penzberg]] in Germany. It should be noted that Knotter's research explored Western Europe alone, and that his work intentionally omitted research into settlements of similar characteristics in the Scandinavian north or Mediterranean south of the continent. In Germany, the village of [[Mörfelden-Walldorf|Mörfelden]] in Hessen, traditionally home to many bricklayers, used to be nicknamed Little Moscow before World War Two for its support of the Communist Party, and still retains a somewhat strong presence of the otherwise very small German Communist Party.

==Usage outside Europe==
A common usage of the term 'Little Moscow' outside Europe is to refer to a community that has a substantial [[ethnic enclave]] of [[Russia]]n immigrants or people of Russian descent; similar to a '[[Little Italy]]' or '[[Chinatown]]'. Examples include [[Sunny Isles Beach, Florida]], which is sometimes known as 'Little Moscow', with over 7% of its population listing Russian as their first language in a 2000 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Sunny_Isles_Beach::sub::Demographics|title=Sunny Isles Beach: Demographics | work=Serving History | author=| accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside ethnic enclaves, the term is also used to show left-wing leanings of a community in other countries. In South America, the neighbourhood of [[Realengo]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, was nicknamed 'Little Moscow' during the mid twentieth century because of the sometimes militant support of the residents towards the [[Brazilian Communist Party|Partido Comunista Brasileiro]], the Brazilian Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4286019|title=Memories of 'Little Moscow' (1943-1964): Study for a public housing experiment for industrial workers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | work=| author=Wilma Mangabeira| date=| volume=17| pages=271–287| doi=10.1080/03071029208567838| journal=Social History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the coal mining town of [[Collinsville, Queensland|Collinsville]] in [[North Queensland]] was known as 'Little Moscow' for its left-wing political radicalism, based in a culture of militant trades unionism.&lt;ref name="wofct"&gt;{{cite book |title=Women of the Coal Rushes |last=Murray |first=Georgina |author2=David Peetz |year=2010 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=1742232213 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XYdWokkWcIoC |accessdate=5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, as in Britain, the term has been used by the media to label a community with socialist or left-wing sympathies. In 1937, radio commentators used the term for [[Racine, Wisconsin]], because of strikes and labour disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racinehistory.com/timeline2.htm |title=Racine Time Line 1900-2000 | work=Racinehistory.com | author=| accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though unlike in Britain, Racine did not have an open Communist political following, but through militant trade unions ran a series of strikes across industries throughout the city in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19371031&amp;id=83YxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DiIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7134,1911484 |title=Industry, Labour at Peace in Former 'Little Moscow' | work=The Milwaukee Journal| author=| date=31 October 1937 | accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included one of the first areas to have an automobile union, which picketed before the likes of Flint, Detroit or Johnstown,&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal"/&gt; and received negative media attention.

'''''Lubbe v Volkskas''''' is an important case in the South African law of lease. In October 1987, the appellant brought an urgent application before a single judge in which he applied for an order
# declaring that he had established a lien over the wheat crop on a certain part of the farm T; and
# instructing the deputy sheriff to sell the said farm subject to his lien.

It was common cause that the respondent's intention, as mortgagee, had been to sell the land subject to the lease and, if the property did not realise the amount of the judgment debt, then free of the lease.

Judgment had been obtained by the respondent against the owner in January 1986 on a mortgage bond registered over the farm in 1983, and the property had been attached in March 1986. In May 1987 the owner had entered into a partiarian lease agreement with the appellant, in terms of which the latter had obtained occupation of part of the farm, and upon which he had subsequently cultivated the wheat crop.

The appellant's application was dismissed, ''inter alia'', on the ground that the appellant did not have a lien over the proceeds of the sale in execution. The sale in execution took place in October 1987.

The appellant bought the land himself in order to protect his rights. His appeal to the Full Bench was dismissed, whereupon he appealed to the Appellate Division.

The court held that it had been common cause at the time of appellant's original application that it had been the respondent's intention to sell the land first, subject to lease, and only if the amount of the judgment debt was not realised, free thereof, and that this was in complete accordance with the common law as well as with the established legal procedure in sales in execution.

Furthermore, the court held that, if the land was sold free of the partiarian lease agreement, the appellant's averred lien would lapse, and the holders of real rights of security in the land would become preferent creditors in respect of the proceeds of the sale.

It was only where the appellant, as lienholder elected to lay claim to part of the proceeds, and the deputy sheriff had to decide whether or not to allow it, that an application for a declaratory order as to the existence of the lien (as prayed for in prayer 1) became necessary.

The court held that it was clear that prayer (1) had been intended to serve as a precursor to prayer (2). The contents of prayer (2) were, however, contrary to the above- mentioned common-law principles and procedures applicable in sales in execution. Accordingly, the appeal had to be dismissed with costs.

'''Mairu''' (plural: '''mairuak'''), also called '''Maideak''', '''Mairiak''', '''Saindi Maidi''' (in [[Lower Navarre]]), '''Intxisu''' in the [[Bidasoa]] valley are creatures of [[Basque mythology]]. They were [[giant (mythology)|giants]] who built [[dolmen]]s or [[harrespil]]. Like the dolmens, they are only found in mountains. They are often associated with [[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamia]], though these are known in all the [[Basque people|Basque Country]].

''Mairu'' means "[[moors|moor]]" in Basque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/resultado.asp Mairu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104134318/http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/resultado.asp |date=2014-11-04 }} in the Online Morris Basque-English dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is used with the sense of 'non-Christian' to refer to former civilizations or [[megalith]]ic monuments.

In parts of Spain, any ancient monument was popularly attributed to the age of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish domination]].
The origin of the Mairu is thought to be as old as the "[[Enchanted moor|mouros encantados]]" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ({{lang-es|moros encantados}}), who are thought to be the remnant of old pre-Roman deities.

The '''Metropolitan Museum of Art''' of [[New York City]], colloquially "'''the Met'''",{{efn|The [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York is also nicknamed "The Met"}} is the largest art museum in the United States. With 7.06 million visitors in 2016, it was the [[list of most visited art museums|third most visited art museum in the world]], and the fifth [[List of most visited museums|most visited museum]] of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;"The World's 20 most popular museums", CNN.com, 22 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Its permanent collection contains over two million works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2000/metropolitan-museum-launches-new-and-expanded-web-site "Metropolitan Museum Launches New and Expanded Web Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128201035/http://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2000/metropolitan-museum-launches-new-and-expanded-web-site |date=2016-11-28 }}, press release, The Met, January 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; divided among seventeen curatorial departments. The main building, on the eastern edge of [[Central Park]] along [[Fifth Avenue#Museum Mile|Museum Mile]] in [[Manhattan]], is by area one of the world's [[list of largest art museums|largest art galleries]]. A much smaller second location, [[The Cloisters]] at [[Fort Tryon Park]] in [[Upper Manhattan]], contains an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from [[Medieval Europe]]. On March 18, 2016, the museum opened the [[Met Breuer]] museum at [[Madison Avenue]] on the [[Upper East Side]]; it extends the museum's modern and contemporary art program.

The permanent collection consists of works of art from [[classical antiquity]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], paintings, and sculptures from nearly all the [[Western painting|European]] masters, and an extensive collection of [[Visual art of the United States|American]] and [[Modern art|modern]] art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of [[African art|African]], [[Asian art|Asian]], [[Oceanian art|Oceanian]], [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], and [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art. The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of [[musical instrument]]s, costumes, and accessories, as well as antique [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] from around the world. Several notable interiors, ranging from first-century Rome through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 for the purposes of opening a museum to bring art and art education to the American people. It opened on February 20, 1872, and was originally located at 681 [[Fifth Avenue]].

=== Collections: Geographically designated collections ===
==== Ancient Near Eastern art ====
Beginning in the late 19th century, the Met started acquiring ancient art and artifacts from the [[Near East]]. From a few [[cuneiform]] tablets and [[seal (device)|seals]], the Met's collection of Near Eastern art has grown to more than 7,000 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/ancient-near-eastern-art |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Ancient Near Eastern Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530055600/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/ancient-near-eastern-art |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing a history of the region beginning in the [[Neolithic]] Period and encompassing the fall of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and the end of [[Late Antiquity]], the collection includes works from the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Hittites|Hittite]], Sasanian, [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n, and [[Elam]]ite cultures (among others), as well as an extensive collection of unique [[Bronze Age]] objects. The highlights of the collection include a set of monumental stone ''[[lamassu]]'', or guardian figures, from the Northwest Palace of the Assyrian king [[Ashurnasirpal II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/assy/hd_assy.htm |title=Assyria, 1365–609 B.C. &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704004141/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/assy/hd_assy.htm |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas ====
[[File:Queen Mother Pendant Mask- Iyoba MET DP231460.jpg|thumb|[[Benin ivory mask]], Iyoba, 16th century Nigeria]]
Though the Met first acquired a group of Peruvian antiquities in 1882, the museum did not begin a concerted effort to collect works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas until 1969, when American businessman and [[philanthropist]] [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson A. Rockefeller]] donated his more than 3,000-piece collection to the museum. Today, the Met's collection contains more than 11,000 pieces from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Pacific Islands]], and the [[Americas]] and is housed in the {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} Rockefeller Wing on the south end of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/art-of-africa-oceania-and-the-americas |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609135107/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/art-of-africa-oceania-and-the-americas |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection ranges from 40,000-year-old [[Indigenous Australian art#Rock painting|indigenous Australian rock paintings]], to a group of {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} memorial poles carved by the [[Asmat people]] of [[New Guinea]], to a priceless collection of ceremonial and personal objects from the [[Nigeria]]n [[Benin Empire|Court of Benin]] donated by [[Klaus Perls]].&lt;ref name=Ezra&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ezra |first1=Kate |title=Royal Art of Benin – The Perls Collection |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1992 |isbn=0-87099-632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of materials represented in the Africa, Oceania, and Americas collection is undoubtedly the widest of any department at the Met, including everything from precious metals to [[porcupine]] quills.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Asian art ====
[[File:NatarajaMET.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bronze]] [[Chola]] Statue of ''[[Nataraja]]'']]
The Met's Asian department holds a collection of [[Asia]]n art, of more than 35,000 pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/asian-art |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Asian Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609141544/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/asian-art |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is arguably the most comprehensive in the US. The collection dates back almost to the founding of the museum: many of the philanthropists who made the earliest gifts to the museum included Asian art in their collections. Today, an entire wing of the museum is dedicated to the Asian collection, and spans 4,000 years of Asian art. Every Asian civilization is represented in the Met's Asian department, and the pieces on display include every type of decorative art, from painting and printmaking to sculpture and metalworking. The department is well known for its comprehensive collection of [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]], as well as for its Indian sculptures, [[Nepal]]ese and [[Tibet]]an works, and the arts of Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia and Thailand. All three ancient religions of India&amp;nbsp;– Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism&amp;nbsp;– are well represented in these sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/asian-art |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416233603/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/asian-art |archivedate=2017-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not only "art" and ritual objects are represented in the collection; many of the best-known pieces are functional objects. The Asian wing also contains a complete [[Ming Dynasty]]-style [[Astor Court|garden court]], modeled on a courtyard in the [[Master of the Nets Garden]] in [[Suzhou]]. Maxwell K. Hearn is the current department chairman of Asian Art since 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Egyptian art ====

[[File:Mummy, Metropolitan Museum of Art NYC.jpg|thumb|Mummy, Metropolitan Museum of Art NYC]]
Though the majority of the Met's initial holdings of [[Egypt]]ian art came from private collections, items uncovered during the museum's own archeological excavations, carried out between 1906 and 1941, constitute almost half of the current collection. More than 26,000 separate pieces of Egyptian art from the [[Paleolithic]] era through the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] era constitute the Met's Egyptian collection, and almost all of them are on display in the museum's massive wing of 40 Egyptian galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/egyptian-art |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Egyptian Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608081546/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/egyptian-art |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most valuable pieces in the Met's Egyptian collection are 13 wooden models (of the total 24 models found together, 12 models and 1 offering bearer figure is at the Met, while the remaining 10 models and 1 offering bearer figure are in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]), discovered in a tomb in the Southern Asasif in western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 1920. These models depict, in unparalleled detail, a cross-section of Egyptian life in the early [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]: boats, gardens, and scenes of daily life are represented in miniature.

However, the popular centerpiece of the Egyptian Art department continues to be the [[Temple of Dendur]]. Dismantled by the Egyptian government to save it from rising waters caused by the building of the [[Aswan High Dam]], the large [[sandstone]] temple was given to the United States in 1965 and assembled in the Met's Sackler Wing in 1978. Situated in a large room and partially surrounded by a reflecting pool and illuminated by a wall of windows opening onto Central Park, the Temple of Dendur has been one of the Met's most enduring attractions. The oldest items at the Met, a set of Archeulian flints from [[Deir el-Bahri]] which date from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period (between 300,000 and 75,000 BC), are part of the Egyptian collection. The curator is Diana Craig Patch.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== European sculpture and decorative arts ====
[[File:NYC - Metropolitan Museum - Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court.jpg|thumb|left|European sculpture court.]]
The European Sculpture and Decorative Arts collection is one of the largest departments at the Met, holding in excess of 50,000 separate pieces from the [[15th century|15th]] through the early [[20th century|20th centuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/european-sculpture-and-decorative-arts |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – European Sculpture and Decorative Arts |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530060925/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/european-sculpture-and-decorative-arts |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the collection is particularly concentrated in Renaissance sculpture—much of which can be seen ''[[in situ]]'' surrounded by contemporary furnishings and decoration—it also contains comprehensive holdings of furniture, jewelry, glass and ceramic pieces, tapestries, textiles, and timepieces and mathematical instruments. In addition to its outstanding collections of English and French furniture, visitors can enter dozens of completely furnished period rooms, transplanted in their entirety into the Met's galleries. The collection even includes an entire [[16th century]] [[patio]] from the Spanish castle of [[Vélez Blanco]], reconstructed in a two-story gallery, and the intarsia ''[[studiolo]]'' from the ducal palace at Gubbio. Sculptural highlights of the sprawling department include [[Bernini]]'s ''Bacchanal'', a cast of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', and several unique pieces by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon|Houdon]], including his ''Bust of [[Voltaire]]'' and his famous portrait of his daughter Sabine.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Greek and Roman art ====
[[File:Photograph of the New Roman Gallery at the Metropolitan—New York City.jpg|thumb|left|Greek and Roman gallery]]

The Met's collection of Greek and Roman art contains more than 17,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Attributed to the Bastis Master |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/en/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/greek-and-roman-art |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Greek and Roman Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704183223/http://www.metmuseum.org/en/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/greek-and-roman-art |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek and Roman collection dates back to the founding of the museum—in fact, the museum's first accessioned object was a Roman [[sarcophagus]], still currently on display. Though the collection naturally concentrates on items from [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire]], these historical regions represent a wide range of cultures and artistic styles, from classic Greek [[black-figure pottery|black-figure]] and [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] vases to carved Roman [[tunic]] pins.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Limestone sarcophagus- the Amathus sarcophagus MET DT352.jpg|thumb|The [[Amathus sarcophagus]], from [[Amathus]], [[Cyprus]], arguably the single most important object in the Cesnola Collection]]
Highlights of the collection include the monumental [[Amathus sarcophagus]] and a magnificently detailed Etruscan chariot known as the "[[Monteleone chariot]]". The collection also contains many pieces from far earlier than the Greek or Roman empires—among the most remarkable are a collection of early [[Cyclades|Cycladic]] sculptures from the mid-third millennium BC, many so abstract as to seem almost modern. The Greek and Roman galleries also contain several large classical wall paintings and reliefs from different periods, including an entire reconstructed bedroom from a noble [[villa]] in [[Boscoreale]], excavated after its entombment by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] in AD 79. In 2007, the Met's Greek and Roman galleries were expanded to approximately {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|-3}}, allowing the majority of the collection to be on permanent display.&lt;ref name="nytimes_greekroman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |title=Classical Treasures, Bathed in a New Light |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2007-04-25 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/arts/design/20anci.html?ex=1334721600&amp;en=d719d4e4c2744f72&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416045735/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/arts/design/20anci.html?ex=1334721600&amp;en=d719d4e4c2744f72&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic art ====
[[File:Folio_Blue_Quran_Met_2004.88.jpg|thumb|left|Leaf from the [[Blue Qur'an]] showing Chapter 30: 28–32]]
The Metropolitan Museum owns one of the world's largest collection of works of art of the Islamic world. The collection also includes artifacts and works of art of cultural and secular origin from the time period indicated by the rise of Islam predominantly from the Near East and in contrast to the Ancient Near Eastern collections. The biggest number of miniatures from the "Shahnama" list prepared under the reign of Shah Tahmasp I, the most luxurious of all the existing Islamic manuscripts, also belongs to this museum. Other rarities include the works of Sultan Muhammad and his associates from the Tabriz school "The Sade Holiday", "Tahmiras kills divs", "Bijan and Manizhe", and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/10/30/arts/design/20111030-met-islamic-wing.html|title=Interactive Guide to Islamic Art Galleries at Met|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=October 30, 2011|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Met's collection of [[Islamic art]] is not confined strictly to [[religious art]], though a significant number of the objects in the Islamic collection were originally created for religious use or as decorative elements in [[mosque]]s. Much of the 12,000 strong collection consists of secular items, including ceramics and [[textiles]], from Islamic cultures ranging from [[Spain]] to [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/islamic-art |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Islamic Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609142925/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/islamic-art |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Art department's collection of miniature paintings from [[Iran]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]] are a highlight of the collection. [[Calligraphy]] both religious and secular is well represented in the Islamic Art department, from the official decrees of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to a number of [[Qur'an]] manuscripts reflecting different periods and styles of calligraphy. Modern calligraphic artists also used a word or phrase to convey a direct message, or they created compositions from the shapes of Arabic words. Others incorporated indecipherable cursive writing within the body of the work to evoke the illusion of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/trmd/hd_trmd.htm| last=Mikdadi| first=Salwa| title=West Asia: Between Tradition and Modernity| publisher=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History; The Metropolitan Museum of Art| location=New York| year=2000| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208105151/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/trmd/hd_trmd.htm| archivedate=2011-12-08| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic Arts galleries had been undergoing refurbishment since 2001 and were reopened on November 1, 2011, as the New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia. Until that time, a narrow selection of items from the collection had been on temporary display throughout the museum. As with many other departments at the Met, the Islamic Art galleries contain many interior pieces, including the entire reconstructed ''Nur Al-Din Room'' from an early 18th-century house in [[Damascus]]. However, the museum has confirmed to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that it has withdrawn from public display all paintings depicting Muhammad and may not rehang those that were displayed in the Islamic gallery before the renovation.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jihad_jitters_at_met_76yj3VNUy4hcRAnhOcPCHP| title='Jihad' jitters at Met| first=Isabel| last=Vincent| date=10 January 2010| work=[[New York Post]]| accessdate=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Met's Department of Arms and Armor is one of the museum's most popular collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/art-of-collecting-arms-and-armor|title=Arms and Armor: Notable Acquisitions 2003–2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928010140/http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/art-of-collecting-arms-and-armor|archivedate=2017-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive "parade" of armored figures on horseback installed in the first-floor Arms and Armor gallery is one of the most recognizable images of the museum, which was organized in 1975 with the help of the Russian immigrant and arms and armors' scholar, Leonid Tarassuk (1925–90). The department's focus on "outstanding craftsmanship and decoration," including pieces intended solely for display, means that the collection is strongest in [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] [[Europe]]an pieces and [[Japan]]ese pieces from the 5th through the 19th centuries. However, these are not the only cultures represented in Arms and Armor; the collection spans more geographic regions than almost any other department, including weapons and armor from [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|dynastic Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], the ancient [[Near East]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]], and the [[Americas]], as well as American firearms (especially [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] firearms) from the 19th and 20th centuries.

However, due to the fragile nature of the items in the collection, the Costume Institute does not maintain a permanent installation. Instead, every year it holds two separate shows in the Met's galleries using costumes from its collection, with each show centering on a specific designer or theme. The Costume Institute is known for hosting the annual [[Met Gala]] and in the past has presented summer exhibitions such as [[Savage Beauty (exhibition)|Savage Beauty]] and [[China: Through the Looking Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bourne |first=Leah |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-Everything-You-Ever-Wanted-to-Know-About-the-Met-Gala-But-Were-Too-Afraid-To-Ask-121096889.html |title=Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Met Gala (But Were Too Afraid To Ask) |publisher=NBC New York |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032814/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-Everything-You-Ever-Wanted-to-Know-About-the-Met-Gala-But-Were-Too-Afraid-To-Ask-121096889.html |archivedate=May 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trebay&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trebay|first1=Guy|title=At the Met, Andrew Bolton Is the Storyteller in Chief|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/fashion/mens-style/at-the-met-andrew-bolton-is-the-storyteller-in-chief.html|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=The New York Times|date=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002173729/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/fashion/mens-style/at-the-met-andrew-bolton-is-the-storyteller-in-chief.html|archivedate=2 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tomkins&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomkins|first1=Calvin|title=Anarchy Unleashed|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/25/anarchy-unleashed|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=25 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016060324/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/25/anarchy-unleashed|archivedate=16 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, Costume Institute shows organized around famous designers such as [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], [[Chanel]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], and [[Gianni Versace]]; and style doyenne like [[Diana Vreeland]], [[Mona von Bismarck]], [[Babe Paley]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], [[Nan Kempner]], and [[Iris Apfel]] have drawn significant crowds to the Met. The [[Met Ball|Costume Institute's annual Benefit Gala]], co-chaired by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Anna Wintour]], is an extremely popular, if exclusive, event in the fashion world; in 2007, the 700 available tickets started at $6,500 per person.&lt;ref name="postrel_dress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Postrel |first=Virginia |title=Dress Sense |date=May 2007 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exhibits displayed over the past decade in the Costume Institute include: Rock Style, in 1999, representing the style of more than 40 rock musicians, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[David Bowie]], and [[The Beatles]]; Extreme Beauty: The Body Transformed, in 2001, which exposes the transforming ideas of physical beauty over time and the bodily contortion necessary to accommodate such ideals and fashion; The [[Chanel]] Exhibit, displayed in 2005, acknowledging the skilled work of designer [[Coco Chanel]] as one of the leading fashion names in history; Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy, exhibited in 2008, suggesting the metaphorical vision of superheroes as ultimate fashion icons; the 2010 exhibit on the American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity, which exposes the revolutionary styles of the American woman from the years 1890 to 1940, and how such styles reflect the political and social sentiments of the time. The theme of the 2011 event was "Alexander McQueen: [[Savage Beauty (exhibition)|Savage Beauty]]". Each of these exhibits explores fashion as a mirror of cultural values and offers a glimpse into historical styles, emphasizing their evolution into today's own fashion world. On January 14, 2014, the Met named the Costume Institute complex after [[Anna Wintour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/met-names-costume-institute-complex-in-honor-of-anna-wintour-7360586?src=nl/mornReport/20140115 |title=Met Names Costume Institute Complex in Honor of Anna Wintour |publisher=[[Women's Wear Daily]] |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014 |author=Karimzadeh, Marc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116152221/http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/met-names-costume-institute-complex-in-honor-of-anna-wintour-7360586?src=nl%2FmornReport%2F20140115 |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The curator is [[Andrew Bolton (curator)|Andrew Bolton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Drawings and prints ====
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|''[[Melencolia I]]'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
Though other departments contain significant numbers of [[drawing]]s and [[printmaking|prints]], the Drawings and Prints department specifically concentrates on [[North America]]n pieces and [[western Europe]]an works produced after the [[Middle Ages]]. The first Old Master drawings, comprising 670 sheets, were presented as a single group in 1880 by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]] and in effect launched the department, though it was not formally constituted as a department until later. Other early donors to the department include [[Junius Spencer Morgan II]] who presented a broad range of material, but mainly dated from the sixteenth century, including 2 woodblocks and many prints by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1919. Currently, the Drawings and Prints collection contains more than 17,000 drawings, 1.5 million prints, and twelve thousand illustrated books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/drawings-and-prints |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Drawings and Prints |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609141109/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/drawings-and-prints |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The great masters of European painting, who produced many more sketches and drawings than actual paintings, are extensively represented in the Drawing and Prints collection. The department's holdings contain major drawings by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Rembrandt]], as well as prints and etchings by [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] among many others.

Lehman the collector concentrated heavily on paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance]], particularly the [[Siena|Sienese]] school. Paintings in the collection include masterpieces by [[Botticelli]] and [[Domenico Veneziano]], as well as works by a significant number of [[Spain|Spanish]] painters, [[El Greco]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] among them. Lehman's collection of drawings by the [[Old Masters]], featuring works by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], is particularly valuable for its breadth and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DF1131F93BA25751C0A9669C8B63| title=Art Review: Feast of Illuminations and Drawings| first=John| last=Russell| work=The New York Times| date=February 18, 2000| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327004847/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DF1131F93BA25751C0A9669C8B63| archivedate=March 27, 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University Press]] has documented the massive collection in a multi-volume book series published as ''The Robert Lehman Collection Catalogues''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Medieval art and the Cloisters ====
[[File:Pol, Jean, and Herman de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Limbourg brothers]]' ''[[Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry]]'']]
The Met's collection of medieval art consists of a comprehensive range of Western art from the 4th through the early 16th centuries, as well as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and pre-medieval European antiquities not included in the Ancient Greek and Roman collection. Like the Islamic collection, the Medieval collection contains a broad range of two- and three-dimensional art, with religious objects heavily represented. In total, the Medieval Art department's permanent collection numbers about 11,000 separate objects, divided between the main museum building on Fifth Avenue and [[The Cloisters]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===== Main building =====
The medieval collection in the main Metropolitan building, centered on the first-floor medieval gallery, contains about six thousand separate objects. While a great deal of European medieval art is on display in these galleries, most of the European pieces are concentrated at the Cloisters (see below). However, this allows the main galleries to display much of the Met's Byzantine art side-by-side with European pieces. The main gallery is host to a wide range of tapestries and church and funerary statuary, while side galleries display smaller works of precious metals and ivory, including [[reliquary]] pieces and secular items. The main gallery, with its high arched ceiling, also serves double duty as the annual site of the Met's elaborately decorated Christmas tree.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===== The Cloisters museum and gardens =====
{{Main|The Cloisters}}
[[File:The Cloisters Hudson River crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[The Cloisters]] from the Hudson River]]
The Cloisters was a principal project of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], a major benefactor of the Met. Located in [[Fort Tryon Park]] and completed in 1938, it is a separate building dedicated solely to medieval art. The Cloisters collection was originally that of a separate museum, assembled by [[George Grey Barnard]] and acquired ''in toto'' by Rockefeller in 1925 as a gift to the Met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cloisters Museum and Gardens |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/the-cloisters-museum-and-gardens |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415030814/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/the-cloisters-museum-and-gardens |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cloisters are so named on account of the five medieval French [[cloisters]] whose salvaged structures were incorporated into the modern building, and the five thousand objects at the Cloisters are strictly limited to medieval European works. The collection features items of outstanding beauty and historical importance; including the ''[[Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry]]'' illustrated by the [[Limbourg Brothers]] in 1409, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] altar cross known as the "[[Cloisters Cross]]" or "Bury Cross", and the seven [[tapestry|tapestries]] depicting the [[The Hunt of the Unicorn|Hunt of the Unicorn]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Modern and contemporary art ====
With some 13,000 artworks, primarily by European and American artists, the modern art collection occupies {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|-3}}, of gallery space and contains many iconic modern works. Cornerstones of the collection include [[Picasso]]'s portrait of [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jasper Johns]]'s ''[[White Flag (Johns painting)|White Flag]]'', [[Jackson Pollock]]'s ''[[Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)]]'', and [[Max Beckmann]]'s [[triptych]] ''Beginning''. Certain artists are represented in remarkable depth, for a museum whose focus is not exclusively on modern art: for example, the collection contains forty paintings by [[Paul Klee]], spanning his entire career. Due to the Met's long history, "contemporary" paintings acquired in years past have often migrated to other collections at the museum, particularly to the American and European Paintings departments.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In April 2013, it was reported that the museum was to receive a collection worth $1 billion from cosmetics tycoon [[Leonard Lauder]]. The collection of [[Cubism|Cubist]] art includes work by Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris and went on display in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307327/New-York-Metropolitan-Museum-Art-receives-1bn-donation-cosmetics-tycoon-Leonard-Lauder.html |location=London |work=[[Daily Mail]] |title=Collection worth $1BILLION is donated to New York Metropolitan Museum of Art by cosmetics tycoon Leonard Lauder |first=Steve |last=Nolan |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130703115000/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307327/New-York-Metropolitan-Museum-Art-receives-1bn-donation-cosmetics-tycoon-Leonard-Lauder.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Musical instruments ====
[[File:Grand Pianoforte MET DP225545.jpg|thumb|Grand piano by [[Sébastien Érard]], ~1840]]
The Met's collection of musical instruments, with about 5,000 examples of musical instruments from all over the world, is virtually unique among major museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/musical-instruments |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Musical Instruments |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529084750/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/musical-instruments |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection began in 1889 with a donation of 270 instruments by [[Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown]], who joined her collection to become the museum's first curator of musical instruments, named in honor of her husband, [[John Crosby Brown]]. By the time she died, the collection had 3,600 instruments that she had donated and the collection was housed in five galleries. Instruments were (and continue to be) included in the collection not only on aesthetic grounds, but also insofar as they embodied technical and social aspects of their cultures of origin. The modern Musical Instruments collection is encyclopedic in scope; every continent is represented at virtually every stage of its musical life. Highlights of the department's collection include several [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] [[violin]]s, a collection of [[Asia]]n instruments made from precious metals, and the oldest surviving [[piano]], a 1720 model by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]]. Many of the instruments in the collection are playable, and the department encourages their use by holding concerts and demonstrations by guest musicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Photographs ====
[[File:La Tour St. Jacques La Boucherie à Paris ca. 1867.jpg|thumb|''La Tour St. Jacques La Boucherie à Paris'' by Charles Soulier, 1867.]]
The Met's collection of [[photograph]]s, numbering more than 25,000 in total,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/photographs |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Photographs |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621234446/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/photographs |archivedate=2012-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is centered on five major collections plus additional acquisitions by the museum. [[Alfred Stieglitz]], a famous photographer himself, donated the first major collection of photographs to the museum, which included a comprehensive survey of [[Pictorialism|Photo-Secessionist]] works, a rich set of master prints by [[Edward Steichen]], and an outstanding collection of Stieglitz's photographs from his own studio. The Met supplemented Stieglitz's gift with the 8,500-piece [[Gilman Paper Company Collection]], the Rubel Collection, and the Ford Motor Company Collection, which respectively provided the collection with early French and American photography, early British photography, and post-[[World War I|WWI]] American and European photography. The museum also acquired [[Walker Evans]]'s personal collection of photographs, a particular coup considering the high demand for his works. The department of photography was founded in 1992. Though the department gained a permanent gallery in 1997, not all of the department's holdings are on display at any given time, due to the sensitive materials represented in the photography collection. However, the Photographs department has produced some of the best-received temporary exhibits in the Met's recent past, including a [[Diane Arbus]] retrospective and an extensive show devoted to spirit photography. In 2007, the museum designated a gallery exclusively for the exhibition of photographs made after 1960.&lt;ref name="Karen Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite news| first=Karen| last=Rosenberg| date=September 28, 2007| title=Modern Photography in a Brand-New Space| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/arts/design/28mens.html| work=The New York Times| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723014034/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/arts/design/28mens.html| archivedate=July 23, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Digital collection ====
Beginning in 2013, the Met organized the Digital Media Department for the purpose of increasing access of the museum's collections and resources using digital media and expanded website services. The first Chief Digital Officer [[Sree Sreenivasan]] from 2013 departed in 2016 and was replaced by Loic Tallon at the time that the department became known by its simplified designation as the Digital Department. At the start of 2017, the department began its Open Access initiative summarized on the Met's website titled "Digital Underground" stating: "It's been six months since The Met launched its Open Access initiative, which made available all 375,000+ images of public-domain works in The Met collection under Creative Commons Zero (CC0). During what is just the dawn of this new initiative, the responses so far have been incredible."&lt;ref&gt;Met Museum.

On March 18, 2016, the museum opened a new venue in the [[Marcel Breuer]]-designed building at [[Madison Avenue]] and 75th Street in Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], the former [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/arts/design/a-look-at-the-met-breuer-before-the-doors-open.html "A Look at the Met Breuer Before the Doors Open"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422173654/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/arts/design/a-look-at-the-met-breuer-before-the-doors-open.html |date=2016-04-22 }} by Randy Kennedy, ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It extends the museum's modern and contemporary art program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-breuer The Met Breuer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305023041/http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-breuer |date=2016-03-05 }}, he Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

== Libraries ==
Each Department maintains a library, most of the material of which can be requested online through the libraries' catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://libmma.org/portal/category/met-libraries/| title=The Met Libraries| publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527062843/http://libmma.org/portal/category/met-libraries/| archivedate=2013-05-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the libraries may be accessed without an appointment:

=== Thomas J. Watson Library ===
{{Main|Thomas J. Watson Library}}
The [[Thomas J. Watson Library]] is the central library of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and supports the activities of staff and researchers. Watson Library's collection contains approximately 900,000 volumes, including monographs and exhibition catalogs; over 11,000 periodical titles; and more than 125,000 auction and sale catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/portal/collections/|title=Collections|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219121344/http://libmma.org/portal/collections/|archivedate=2014-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library includes a reference collection, auction and sale catalogs, a rare book collection, manuscript items, and vertical file collections. The Library is accessible to anyone 18 years of age or older simply by registering online and providing a valid photo ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/portal/access-hours-and-policies/|title=Access Hours and Policies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515040406/http://libmma.org/portal/access-hours-and-policies/|archivedate=2014-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nolen Library ===
The Nolen Library is open to the general public. The collection of some 8,000 items, arranged in open shelves, includes books, picture books, DVDs, and videos. The Nolen Library includes a children's reading room and materials for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/research/libraries-and-study-centers/nolen-library|title=Libraries and Study Centers|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908213050/http://www.metmuseum.org/research/libraries-and-study-centers/nolen-library|archivedate=2013-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special exhibitions ==
The museum regularly hosts notable special exhibitions, often focusing on the works of one artist that have been loaned out from a variety of other museums and sources for the duration of the exhibition. These exhibitions are part of the attraction that draw people both within and outside Manhattan to explore the Met. Such exhibitions include displays especially designed for the Costume Institute, paintings from artists from across the world, works of art related to specific art movements, and collections of historical artifacts. Exhibitions are commonly located within their specific departments, ranging from American decorative arts, arms and armor, drawings and prints, Egyptian art, Medieval art, musical instruments, and photographs. Typical exhibitions run for months at a time and are open to the general public. Each exhibition provides insight into the world of art as a transformative, cultural experience and often includes a historical analysis to demonstrate the profound impact that art has on society and its dramatic transformation over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/ |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Exhibitions |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923193603/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/ |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, a special exhibition,  titled "Harlem on My Mind" was criticized for failing to exhibit work by [[Harlem]] artists. The museum defended its decision to portray Harlem itself as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Black Artists and Activism: Harlem on My Mind (1969)| first=Bridget R.| last=Cooks| work=[[American Studies (journal)|American Studies]]| date=Spring 2007| volume=48| issue=1| url=http://www.theasa.net/journals/name/american_studies/3958/| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018041457/http://www.theasa.net/journals/name/american_studies/3958/| archivedate=2014-10-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Lewis (artist)|Norman Lewis]], [[Benny Andrews]], [[Romare Bearden]], [[Clifford Joseph (artist)|Clifford Joseph]], [[Roy DeCarava]], [[Reginald Gammon]], [[Henri Ghent]], [[Raymond Saunders (artist)|Raymond Saunders]], and [[Alice Neel]] were among the artists who picketed the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Norman Lewis – First Major African American Abstract Expressionist| author=Michael Rosenfeld Gallery| publisher=Violette de Mazia Foundation| accessdate=2015-03-19| url=http://demazia.org/features/norman-lewis-first-major-african-american-abstract-expressionist| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021221800/http://demazia.org/features/norman-lewis-first-major-african-american-abstract-expressionist| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Metropolitan opening reception.jpg|thumb|Opening reception in the picture gallery at 681 Fifth Avenue, February 20, 1872; wood-engraving published in ''[[Frank Leslie's Weekly]]'', March 9, 1872]]
The [[New York Legislature|New York State Legislature]] granted the Metropolitan Museum of Art an Act of Incorporation on April 13, 1870 "for the purpose of establishing and maintaining in said City a Museum and Library of Art, of encouraging and developing the Study of the Fine Arts, and the application of Art to manufacture and natural life, of advancing the general knowledge of kindred subjects, and to that end of furnishing popular instruction and recreations".&lt;ref&gt;Disturnell, John [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z16LK1yEhBUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA101 ''New York as it was and as it is''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101224446/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z16LK1yEhBUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA101 |date=2016-01-01 }}, D. Van Nostrand, New York, 1876. "Metropolitan Museum of Art", p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was supplemented later by the 1893 Act, Chapter 476, which required that its collections "shall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year."&lt;ref name=nyt20170426/&gt; The founders included businessmen and financiers, as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day, who wanted to open a museum to bring art and art education to the American people.&lt;ref name="Met History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/general-information/2005/a-brief-history-of-the-museum |title=Brief History of The Museum |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024120326/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/general-information/2005/a-brief-history-of-the-museum |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum first opened on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moske |first=James |title=This Weekend in Met History: February 20 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about%20the%20museum/now%20at%20the%20met/features/2012/this%20weekend%20in%20met%20history%20february%2020 |publisher=Museum Archives |accessdate=18 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223132752/http://www.metmuseum.org/about%20the%20museum/now%20at%20the%20met/features/2012/this%20weekend%20in%20met%20history%20february%2020 |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum, served as its first president, and the publisher [[George Palmer Putnam]] came on board as its founding superintendent.

The former Civil War officer, [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola]], was named as its first director. He served from 1879 to 1904. Under their guidance, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola|Cesnola Collection]] of [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Mrs. Nicholas Cruger Mansion also known as the Douglas Mansion (James Renwick, 1853–54, demolished) at 128 West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations proved temporary, as the growing collection required more space than the mansion could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gross| first=Michael| title=Rogues' Gallery, The Secret History of the Moguls and the Money That Made the Metropolitan Museum| publisher=Broadway Books| location=New York| date=5 May 2009| page=45| url=https://www.amazon.com/Rogues-Gallery-Secret-Betrayals-Metropolitan-ebook/dp/B001NLKYBA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426801110&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Secret+History+of+the+Moguls+and+the+Money+That+Made+the+Metropolitan+Museum#reader_B001NLKYBA| subscription=yes| isbn=978-0767924887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1879 and 1895, the Museum created and operated a series of educational programs, known as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools]], intended to provide vocational training and classes on fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Schools_Records_b18062179.pdf Finding aid for Schools of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Records (1879–1895)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403192844/http://www.libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Schools_Records_b18062179.pdf |date=2016-04-03 }}.

The museum celebrated its 75th anniversary (which it termed Diamond Jubilee) with a variety of events in 1946, culminating in the anniversary of the opening of its first exhibition on February 22, 1947. The anniversary festivities included speeches, exhibitions, cross-promotions with films and plays, and related displays in Fifth Avenue store windows. The celebration also included membership drive and a fundraising campaign to support a planned renovation and expansion of the [[Central Park]] building under the chairmanship of the museum's Vice President [[Thomas J.

In the 1960s, the governance of the Met was expanded to include, for the first time, a Chairman of the Board of Trustees in contemplation of a large bequest from the estate of [[Robert Lehman]]. For six decades Lehman built upon an art collection begun by his father in 1911 and devoted a great deal of time the Met, before finally becoming the first chairman of the board at the Metropolitan in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, Lansing.

In 2012, following the earlier appointment of [[Daniel Brodsky]] as Chairman of the Board at the Met, the by-laws of the museum were formally amended to recognize the office of the Chairman as having authority over the assignment and review of the both the offices of President and Director of the museum.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; The office of Chairman was first introduced relatively late in the museum's history in the 1960s in contemplation of the anticipated donation of the Lehman collection to the museum and has since that time, under Brodsky, become the most senior administrative position at the museum.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; In January 2018, Daniel Weiss as president of the museum announced that the century old policy of free admission to the museum would be replaced by a new admission policy which would require a charge of $25 to out-of-state and foreign visitors to the museum effective March 2018.&lt;ref name="nypogrebin"/&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:MET architecture NYC.jpg|thumb|Charles Engelhard Court in the North Wing facing Central Park.]]
After negotiations with the City of New York in 1871, the Met was granted the land between the East Park Drive, Fifth Avenue, and the 79th and [[85th Street]] Transverse Roads in [[Central Park]]. A red-brick and stone "mausoleum" was designed by American architect [[Calvert Vaux]] and his collaborator [[Jacob Wrey Mould]]. Vaux's ambitious building was not well received; the building's [[Gothic Revival|High Victorian Gothic]] style being considered already dated prior to completion, and the president of the Met termed the project "a mistake".&lt;ref name="newyorker_halford"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/12/01/081201ta_talk_halford?printable=true |title=At the Museums: Four Eyes |last=Halford |first=Macy |date=December 1, 2008 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218053644/https://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/12/01/081201ta_talk_halford?printable=true |archivedate=December 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 20 years, a new architectural plan engulfing the Vaux building was already being executed. Since that time, many additions have been made including the distinctive [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Fifth Avenue facade, Great Hall, and Grand Stairway. These were designed by architect and Met trustee [[Richard Morris Hunt]], but completed by his son, [[Richard Howland Hunt]] in 1902 after his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Michael, ''Rogues' Gallery, The Secret History of the Moguls and the Money That Made the Metropolitan Museum'', Broadway Books, New York, 2009, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[architectural sculpture]] on the facade is by [[Karl Bitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Schevill, Ferdinand, 'Karl Bitter: A Biography", The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 1917 p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Central Park from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (425424361).jpg|thumb|Northern view of Central Park through the glass wall of the [[Temple of Dendur]] room]]
The wings that completed the Fifth Avenue facade in the 1910s were designed by the firm of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]. The modernistic glass sides and rear of the museum are the work of [[Roche-Dinkeloo]]. [[Kevin Roche]] has been the architect for the master plan and expansion of the museum for the past 42 years. He is responsible for designing all of its new wings and renovations including but not limited to the American Wing, Greek and Roman Court, and recently opened Islamic Wing.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin (Summer 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the Met measures almost {{convert|1/4|mi|m|adj=on}} long and with more than {{convert|2000000|ft2|m2}} of floor space, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.&lt;ref name="humanitiesweb.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=1138 |title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art at HumanitiesWeb |publisher=Humanitiesweb.org |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601220656/http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum building is an accretion of over 20 structures, most of which are not visible from the exterior.

=== Governance ===
Although the City of New York owns the museum building and contributes utilities, heat, and some of the cost of guardianship, the collections are owned by a private corporation of fellows and benefactors which totals about 950 persons. The museum is governed by a board of trustees of 41 elected members, several officials of the City of New York, and persons honored as trustees by the museum. The current chairman of the board, [[Daniel Brodsky]] was elected in 2011.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other notable trustees include [[Anna Wintour]], [[Richard Chilton]], [[Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed|Candace Beinecke]], [[Alejandro Santo Domingo]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/annual-reports/~/media/924DCB0D4562488A8DC818F4515912BE.pdf| title=Annual Report: Board of Trustees| date=November 1, 2014| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217062337/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/annual-reports/~/media/924DCB0D4562488A8DC818F4515912BE.pdf| archivedate=December 17, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] and his appointee [[Ken Sunshine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Emily| last=Smith| date=September 13, 2014| url=http://pagesix.com/2014/09/13/ken-sunshine-joins-the-mets-board-of-trustees/| title=Ken Sunshine Joins the Met's Board of Trustees| work=New York Post| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115172725/http://pagesix.com/2014/09/13/ken-sunshine-joins-the-mets-board-of-trustees/| archivedate=November 15, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2015, the board of trustees chose [[Daniel Weiss (art historian)|Daniel Weiss]], then president of [[Haverford College]], to be the current president and chief operating officer of the Met, replacing Emily K.

In September 2016, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' first reported financial set-backs at the museum related to servicing its outstanding debts and associated cut-backs in staffing at the museum, with the goal of trying to balance its budget by fiscal year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/metropolitan-museum-of-art-cuts-staff-1475072125 "Metropolitan Museum of Art Cuts Staff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329045832/https://www.wsj.com/articles/metropolitan-museum-of-art-cuts-staff-1475072125 |date=2017-03-29 }}, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Met's annual tax filing for fiscal year 2016, several top executives had received disproportionately high compensation, often exceeding 1M USD per annum with over 100K USD bonuses per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/met-execs-awarded-bonus-and-raises-894431|title=Met Execs Got Hefty Bonuses Amid Rising Deficit|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=2017-03-16|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325223837/https://news.artnet.com/art-world/met-execs-awarded-bonus-and-raises-894431|archivedate=2017-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the ''New York Times'' reported that the Met's annual debt was approaching $40 million, in addition to an outstanding museum bond for $250 million. This resulted in the indefinite postponement of a planned $600 million architectural expansion of the exhibition space for the museum's modern art collection as well as started a general discussion over the Met's [[human resources management]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/arts/design/met-museum-campbell-resignation-brodsky-coburn.html|title=A Hushed Departure at the Met Museum Reveals Entrenched Management Culture|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=2017-04-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-06|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414145243/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/arts/design/met-museum-campbell-resignation-brodsky-coburn.html|archivedate=2017-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of the board at the Met elected in 2011, [[Real Estate Board of New York|Daniel Brodsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/arts/design/daniel-brodsky-is-voted-chairman-of-metropolitan-museum.html|title=Daniel Brodsky is Voted Chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=May 5, 2011|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314074207/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/arts/design/daniel-brodsky-is-voted-chairman-of-metropolitan-museum.html|archivedate=March 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in response to the ''Times'' reports that he "looked forward to working with my administrative and board colleagues to support a climate of candor, transparency, accountability and mutual respect."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In January 2018, Daniel Weiss as president of the museum stated that a downsized version of the original $600 million architectural expansion might be reconsidered as early as 2020 at a reduction to the $450 million level.&lt;ref name="nypogrebin"/&gt;

Brodsky, the Chairman of the Met, stated that after the 2017 financial setbacks, the Director position would be appointed separately from the position of CEO. Following a commissioned report from the [[Boston Consulting Group]], the current interim CEO, president, and [[Chief Operating Officer|COO]] of the Met, [[Daniel Weiss (art historian)|Daniel Weiss]], said that the Met's 2015–2017 financial setbacks were caused by "slowing revenue, rising costs, and too many projects at once." Weiss was further reported as having hired Will Manzer, formerly an executive at [[Perry Ellis (brand)|Perry Ellis]], to help re-invigorate recently declining revenues at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/what-broke-the-met-museum.html|title=With Rumors, Scandal, and a Record Budget Shortfall, What Broke the Met?|last=Kachka|first=Boris|date=April 16, 2017|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-05-06|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]|pages=44–50|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501102836/http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/what-broke-the-met-museum.html|archivedate=May 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, Weiss stated that the budget shortfall of $15 million might require a re-assessment and increase in the museum's current admission payment policy.

In January 2018, Pogrebin writing for ''The New York Times'' reported that amid continuing reverbations from "a period of financial turbulence and leadership turmoil" that the museum president Daniel Weiss had announced that the museum would rescind its century old policy of free admission to the museum and begin charging $25 for out-of-state visitors starting in March 2018.&lt;ref name="nypogrebin"/&gt; Pogrebin stated that although the museum had made progress in decreasing its deficit from forty million dollars to ten million dollars, that an adverse decision from the City of New York to curtail funding for the Met's operating costs by as much as eight million dollars "for security and building staff" caused Weiss to announce the change in admissions policy. Weiss indicated that the new policy would be estimated to increase revue from the current $43 million it receives from admissions to an enhanced revenue stream as high as $49 million USD.&lt;ref name="nypogrebin"/&gt;

=== Attendance ===
For the fiscal year 2017 which ended on June 30, the museum was reported as having 7 million visitors during the past year, where "37 percent of these were international visitors, while 30 percent came from New York's five boroughs."&lt;ref name="artnet.com"&gt;Staff authors (July 12, 2017), [https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-july-12-1020134 The Met Museum Boasts Record Attendance Numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214754/https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-july-12-1020134 |date=2018-01-12 }} ''ArtNet News''.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in 2016, the museum set a record for attendance, attracting 6.7 million visitors—the highest number since the museum began tracking admissions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web | last=Pogrebin | first=Robin | title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Announces Record Attendance | website=The New York Times | date=2016-08-05 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/arts/design/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-announces-record-attendance.html | access-date=2018-01-12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112215040/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/arts/design/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-announces-record-attendance.html | archivedate=2018-01-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of the Met's visitors in fiscal year 2016 came from New York City and the tristate area; 41 percent from 190 countries besides the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; In 2017, the attendance figures indicated seven million annual visitors with 63% of the visitors arriving from outside of New York State.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Quiet_Talks-2017"/&gt;

[[Roberta Smith]] writing for ''The New York Times'' in September 2017 voiced growing public concern that proposed increases in admissions costs would have an adverse effect upon attendance statistics at the museum. Smith referred to the public perception that such costs would appear "greedy and inapproriate" because "The museum already gets around $39 million a year from its gate -- equal to the entire annual budget of the Brooklyn Museum."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta.

Effective March 2018, the vast majority of visitors who do not live in New York State will have to pay $25 to enter the museum.&lt;ref name="nypogrebin"/&gt;  The City of New York has reduced funding at the Metropolitan as part of Mayor De Blasio's political effort to increase artistic diversity.  They made an agreement to allow the fees in exchange for less funding which the city pledged to use at alternate facilities and promote diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pogrebin | first=Robin | title=De Blasio, With 'Cultural Plan,' Proposes Linking Money to Diversity | website=The New York Times | date=2017-05-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/arts/design/new-york-cultural-plan-museums.html | access-date=2018-01-12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111062426/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/arts/design/new-york-cultural-plan-museums.html | archivedate=2018-01-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Holland Carter and [[Roberta Smith]] of ''The New York Times'' have argued in response to Weiss's decision to rescind the previous free admission policy as lacking in responsible fiscal planning. They stated that a recent $65 million expenditure for renovating fountains seemed to be a poor allocation of the limited available funding. Smith added, "Those new awful Darth Vaderish fountains take huge chunks out of the plaza and disrupt movement," as an indication of the misuse of funds.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Smith and Holland Carter.

It stated, "Some critics are outraged. The past week has seen a ''New York Times'' piece titled "The New Pay Policy Is a Mistake", while Jezebel's Aimée Lutkin claimed "The Met Should Be Fucking Free". ''The New York Post'' writes that the museum has never had the right to charge admission and Alexandra Schwartz in the ''New Yorker'' says the new policy diminishes New York City".&lt;ref&gt;Nadja Sayej.

== Acquisitions and deaccessioning ==
{{See also|Looted art}}
The Metropolitan Museum of Art spent $39 million to acquire art for the fiscal year ending in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (July 22, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/arts/design/qatar-uses-its-riches-to-buy-art-treasures.html "Qatar Uses Its Riches to Buy Art Treasures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213115617/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/arts/design/qatar-uses-its-riches-to-buy-art-treasures.html |date=2017-02-13 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the museum is required to list in its annual report the total cash proceeds from art sales each year and to itemize any deaccessioned objects valued at more than $50,000 each. It must also sell those pieces at auction and provide advance public notice of a work being sold if it has been on view in the last ten years. These rules were imposed by the [[New York State Attorney General]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news| first=Robin| last=Pogrebin| date=January 26, 2011| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html| title=The Permanent Collection May Not Be So Permanent| work=The New York Times| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025181727/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html| archivedate=October 25, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, under the directorship of [[Thomas Hoving]], the Met revised its [[deaccessioning (museum)|deaccessioning]] policy. Under the new policy, the Met set its sights on acquiring "world-class" pieces, regularly funding the purchases by selling mid- to high-value items from its collection.&lt;ref name="ThomasHoving" /&gt; Though the Met had always sold duplicate or minor items from its collection to fund the acquisition of new pieces, the Met's new policy was significantly more aggressive and wide-ranging than before, and allowed the deaccessioning of items with higher values which would normally have precluded their sale. The new policy provoked a great deal of criticism (in particular, from ''[[The New York Times]]'') but had its intended effect.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Many of the items then purchased with funds generated by the more liberal deaccessioning policy are now considered the "stars" of the Met's collection, including [[Diego Velázquez]]'s ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'' and the [[Euphronios krater]] depicting the death of [[Sarpedon]] (which has since been repatriated to the Republic of Italy). In the years since the Met began its new deaccessioning policy, other museums have begun to emulate it with aggressive deaccessioning programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=James| last=Bone| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1851184,00.html |title=Brimful museums put art under the hammer| work=[[The Times]]| date=October 31, 2005| accessdate=2012-06-11| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met has continued the policy in recent years, selling such valuable pieces as [[Edward Steichen]]'s 1904 photograph ''[[The Pond-Moonlight]]'' (of which another copy was already in the Met's collection) for a record price of $2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4715106.stm| title=Rare photo sets $2.9m sales record| work=[[BBC News]]| date=2006-02-15| accessdate=2013-02-18| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131215727/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4715106.stm| archivedate=2009-01-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most serious challenges to the Metropolitan Museum's reputation has been a series of allegations and lawsuits about its status as an institutional buyer of looted and stolen antiquities. Since the 1990s the Met has been the subject of numerous investigative reports and books critical of the Met's ''laissez-faire'' attitude to acquisition.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders&gt;Peter Watson, Cecilia Todeschini (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlcPcCuicKQC&amp;q=Morgantina%20Met%20OR%20Metropolitan ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215012119/https://books.google.com/books?id=jlcPcCuicKQC&amp;q=Morgantina%20Met%20OR%20Metropolitan |date=2017-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Silver, ''The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for a Priceless Masterpiece''.

'''MIM''' stands for Music Industry Manual. It was founded in 1996 by James Robertson and in its first year was called The Promoter's Handbook. The Promoters Handbook was a reference manual for the [[dance music]] industry including [[DJ]]s agents, [[nightclub]]s and unusual venues, promoters, flyer designers. The following year its title was changed to give it a broader appeal.

It still caters for the dance music industry, but is now fully international with over 100,000 contacts from countries as remote as [[Azerbaijan]] to developed nations. Whilst the focus is still on DJ and club culture it has over 100 categories including bar designer, music lawyers, event management.

'''Museology''' or '''museum studies''' is the study of [[museum]]s. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including [[Curator|curating]], [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation]], public programming, and [[Museum education|education]].

== Terminology ==
The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while “museology” is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (muséologie), Spanish (museología), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) – while English speakers more often use the term “museum studies” to refer to that same field of study. When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the [[Latin]] “museographia” (French: muséographie, Spanish: museografía, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term “museum practice” or “operational museology”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|title=Key Concepts of Museology|last=International Council of Museums|first=|date=2009|website=icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the field ==
The development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early [[Collecting#History|collectors]] and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during [[Age of Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]] anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed [[Natural history museum|natural history]]  and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers’ [[colonization]] of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in [[Western Europe]]an [[Western European colonialism and colonization|colonial projects]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecomuseums: A Sense of Place|last=Davis|first=Peter|publisher=Continuum International Publishing: London.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and “civilize” the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though [[World's fair|World’s Fairs]], such as [[The Great Exhibition|The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London or the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World’s Fair]], were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization in the West|last=Kishlansky|first=M.|last2=Geary|first2=P.|last3=O’Brien|first3=P.|publisher=Pearson Education.|year=2008|isbn=|edition=7|volume=C|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums. For instance, The Field Museum in Chicago grew out of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/history|website=The Field Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Museums Association]], the first professional membership organization for those working in the museum field, was established in London in 1889. In 1901, they developed [[Museums Journal]], the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museum’s]] Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association|last=Lewis|first=G.|publisher=Quiller Press.|year=1989|isbn=1-870948-37-8|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto.|last=Shelton|first=A.|publisher=Museum Worlds|year=2013|isbn=|volume=5 |issue=1|location=|pages=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Mensch|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Magpies on Mount Helicon. Museum and Community|url=|journal=ICOFOM Study Series|volume=25|pages=133–138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One attempt to re-envision museums’ role was the concept of [[Ecomuseum]]s, first proposed publicly at ICOM’s 9th International Conference in France (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory.|last=Sánchez Laws|first=Ana Luisa|publisher=Berghahn Books.|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecomuseum]]s proliferated in Europe – and still exist around the world today – challenging traditional museums and dominant museum narratives, with an explicit focus on community control and the development of both heritage and sustainability. In 1988, Robert Lumley’s book The Museum Time Machine “expressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operations”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or “old” field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by [[The Sunday Times]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Museology|last=Vergo|first=Peter|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies.&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Lavine|first2=Steven D.|title=Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|date=1991|publisher=Smithsonian Press|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kreamer|first2=Christine Mullen|last3=Lavine|first3=Steven|title=Museums and Communities: The Politics of Public Culture|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who are engaged in various “new” museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend “officially” began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of “radical reassessment of the roles of museums within society”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Critical theorists like [[Michel Foucault]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed – often adding the term “critical” to their new titles (i.e. [[critical race theory]]) – a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features – so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stam|first=D.|date=1983|title=The Informed Muse: The Implications of 'The New Museology' for Museum Practice|url=|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=12|pages=267–283|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some of which are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others that are more traditional and less critical.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Operational museology ==
Operational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]]), and its [[Exhibit design|exhibitions]] and programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Critical museology==

=== Overview of the field ===
Critical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology. It is a broad field of study that engages critically with museums, calling into question the foundation assumptions of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=Anthony|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto|journal=Museum Worlds|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curatorial Dreams: Critics Imagine Exhibition|last=Lehrer|first=Erica|last2=Butler|first2=Shelley Ruth|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates critical museology’s close connection to New Museology, which also challenges foundational assumptions in museology. Critical museology may also extend beyond the traditional [[museum]] to include [[Cultural center|cultural centres]], [[Historic site|heritage sites]], [[memorial]]s, [[Art museum|art galleries]], and so on.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics|last=Bennett|first=Tony|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity|last=Canclini|first=Nestor Garcia|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the field ===
Given that museums are historically linked to [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and European [[missionary]] work, they have a morally and politically problematic past. While some of the objects museums hold were purchased – though not always fairly and often to the exclusive benefit of the collector – a large proportion of museum collections were taken as spoils of war, or otherwise removed without the consent of the people or community that owned them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=Steven|date=1991|title=Resonance and Wonder|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures: Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|volume=|pages=44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums, along with their collections – and collectors – played a key role in establishing and reiterating the dominance of colonial Europe and narratives of cultural superiority. Critical museology was developed through questioning the foundational assumptions of museum studies and museums, including their history, architecture, display, programming, and the provenance of their objects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Carol|date=|title=Art Museums and the Ritual of Citizenship|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures. Smithsonian Institution|volume=|pages=88–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also analyzed exhibition design to show how the diverse media combined in exhibitions communicate and shape visitors' interpretations and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne A.|title=The Ones That Are Wanted: Communication and the Politics of Representation in a Photographic Exhibition|date=2002|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne|title=Rhetorics of Value: Constituting Worth and Meaning through Cultural Display|journal=Visual Anthropology|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=21–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[anthropologist]]s and the field of [[anthropology]] were actively engaged in problematic collecting practices for two centuries, anthropologists have also been central to the emergence of critical museology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorente|first=J. P.|date=2015|title=From the White Cube to a Critical Museography: The Development of Interrogative, Plural and Subjective Museum Discourses|url=|journal=From Museum Critique to the Critical Museum|publisher=Routledge|volume=|pages=80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kratz|first2=Corinne|editor1-last=Silverman|editor1-first=Raymond|title=The Interrogative Museum|journal=Museum as Process: Translating Local and Global Knowledges|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has included reconstructing and analyzing those collection histories and the relationships that grew around them, as in the Pitt Rivers Museum's "Relational Museum" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gosden|first1=Chris|title=The Relational Museum|url=http://www.materialworldblog.com/2009/01/the-relational-museum/|website=Material World|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also led interdisciplinary working groups that developed new approaches to globalizing processes in critical museology, as foregrounded in Museum Frictions, a third innovative volume co-edited by Ivan Karp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kratz|first2=Corinne|last3=Szwaja|first3=Lynn|last4=Ybarra-Frausto|first4=Tomas, et al|title=Museum Frictions: Public Cultures/ Global Transformations|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, anthropologists have spearheaded recent methodological and pedagogical developments in critical museology including “curatorial dreaming”, curating labs like the [http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/ Making Culture Lab] at [[Simon Fraser University]], the [http://capsl.cerev.ca/ Curating and Public Scholarship Lab] at [[Concordia University]], and the [http://www.carmah.berlin/ Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage] (CARMAH) in Berlin, as well as courses like the [https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html International Field School in Critical Museology].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In other contexts, historians have been at the forefront of interventions in critical museology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witz|first1=Leslie|last2=Minkley|first2=Gary|last3=Rassool|first3=Ciraj|title=Unsettled History: Making South African Public Pasts|date=2017|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decolonizing and indigenizing museums ===
In North America, Australia, and New Zealand in particular, critical museology attempts to address the problematic colonial pasts of museums through the decolonization and Indigenization of museums.

Once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, decolonizing is now recognized – particularly in Canada – as a long-term process that involves dismantling the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological legacies of colonial power &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huygens|first=Ingrid|date=2011|title=Developing a Decolonisation Practice for Settler Colonisers: A Case Study from Aotearoa New Zealand|url=|journal=Settler Colonial Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=53–81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Honouring_the_Truth_Reconciling_for_the_Future_July_23_2015.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Final Report – Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no agreed upon end-goal of decolonization, the process of decolonizing the museum is aimed at “assist[ing] communities in their efforts to address the legacies of historical unresolved grief by speaking the hard truths of colonialism and thereby creating spaces for healing and understanding”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Collaboration, consultation, and [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriation]] are key components of decolonizing museums. Australian museums have been leaders in developing repatriation processes, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities, beginning in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Des|last2=Paroissien, eds.|first2=Leon|title=Understanding Museums:  Australian museums and museology|url=http://nma.gov.au/research/understanding-museums/_lib/pdf/Understanding-Museums_Indigenous_people_and_museums.pdf|website=National Museum Australia|publisher=National Museum Australia|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects involving collaboration and consultation with source communities have taken many forms, ranging from developing traveling exhibits, revising collection catalogues, to establishing community cultural centers and working with photographic collections together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luo Visual History Project|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/Luo/luo/page/home/|website=Pitt Rivers Museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverman, ed.|first1=Raymond|title=Museum as Process: Translating Local and Global Knowledges|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, collaboration and consultation were first formally suggested by the 1994 Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, and are now seen by many museums as being an essential practice for any institution that holds collections belonging to [[Indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|title=Task Force Report on Museums and First People|last=Assembly of First Nations &amp; Canadian Museums Association|first=|date=1994|website=museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, and around the world, some of the objects in those collections – particularly sacred objects or human remains – have been [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] or returned to their communities of origin. [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)]] formalized the process of [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriating]] Indigenous cultural objects in the United States. While Canada does not have a formal policy around repatriation, many museums have their own internal policies and many objects have been returned to Indigenous communities that way. Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success.

A newer concept, the I[[Indigenization|ndigenization]] of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s 2016 appointing of [[Wanda Nanibush]] as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2016/07/22/wanda-nanibush-named-agos-first-curator-of-indigenous-art.html|title=Wanda Nanibush Named AGO’s First Curator of Indigenous Art|last=Whyte|first=Murray|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood Land School’s takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2b2fa6_8f2b4b9eece24189920c7ab3031744f0.pdf|title=Inside a Year-Long Experiment in Indigenous Institutional Critique.|last=Hampton|first=John|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=An Indigenous curator for Indigenous artefacts: South Australia breaks new ground|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/sep/03/an-indigenous-curator-for-indigenous-artefacts-south-australia-breaks-new-ground|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djon Mundine|url=https://www.boomerangfestival.com.au/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=113|website=Boomerang Festival|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laura McBride|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/staff/laura-mcbride|website=Australian Museum|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWO FIRST NATIONS CURATORS FROM MCA AUSTRALIA CHOSEN FOR VENICE BIENNALE|url=https://www.mca.com.au/press/2017/05/04/two-first-nations-curators-mca-australia-chosen-venice-biennale/|website=Museum of Contemporary Art Australia|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the [[Musqueam Indian Band]], the [[Sto:lo Nation|Sto:lo Nation Tribal Council]], the U’mista Cultural Centre, and the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrncommunity.org/pages/about|title=Reciprocal Research Network|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the [[Indians of Canada Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]]’; The [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation|Lubicon Cree]]’s boycott of [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games#Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.2C AB|The Spirit Sings]], a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] sponsored exhibition at the [[Glenbow Museum]] [[Glenbow Museum|i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n 1[[Glenbow Museum|9]]8[[Glenbow Museum|8]], and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]]’[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|s]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|2]]0[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|1]]5 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|date=2012|title="No History of Colonialism": Decolonizing Practices in Indigenous Arts|url=|journal=Decolonize Me|publisher=ABC Art Books Canada.|volume=|pages=19–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museology (Lecture)|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=International Field School in Critical Museology Lecture, Concordia University.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsford|first=Stephen|last2=MacDonald|first2=George|date=1995|title=Canadian Museums and the Representation of Culture in a Multicultural Nation|url=|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=15–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== New methodologies ==

=== Museum interventions ===
Interventions in museums were [[Art intervention|first employed by artists]] like [[Marcel Duchamp]], who were looking to challenge both established elite art traditions and the expectations of museum visitors. By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups – including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves – as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.

==== Artist interventions ====
A central aspect of [[Institutional Critique]], some artist’s interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves – like [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]’s Mining the Museum (1992) at the [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas|Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas]]’ Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC’s [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]], or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists' Interventions|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/artists|website=Pitt Rivers museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – while others have been done without explicit permission, like [[Andrea Fraser]]’s Museum Highlights (1989) at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Fred|last2=Halle|first2=Howard|date=1993|title=Mining the Museum|jstor=25007622|journal=Grand Street|issue=44|pages=151–172|doi=10.2307/25007622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmoreart.com/2017/05/how-mining-the-museum-changed-the-art-world.html|title=How Mining the Museum Changed the Art World – BmoreArt  {{!}}  Baltimore Contemporary Art|website=www.bmoreart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fred Wilson: Objects and Installations 1979-2000.|last=Berger|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland: Center for Art and Visual Culture.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levell|first=N.|date=2013|title=Site-Specificity and Dislocation: Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas and His Haida Manga Meddling|url=|journal=Journal of Material Culture|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=93–116.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/kbunn/Manga.pdf|title=Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas: Meddling in the Museum.|last=UBC MOA|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Andrea Fraser – Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fraser-museum-highlights-a-gallery-talk-t13715|journal=Tate: Art &amp; Artists.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/30/fraser-art-institutional/|title=Spotlight: Andrea Fraser {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known artist interventions in a museum is [[James Luna]]’s ''Artifact Piece'', which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at ''The Decade Show'' in New York in 1990. Luna, a [[Luiseño]] artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/james-luna-30545878/|title=James Luna. Smithsonian Magazine.|last=K. R.|first=Fletcher|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists – Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Coco Fusco – developed a traveling performance art piece called [[Couple in The Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West|The ''Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West'']] that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including [[Covent Gardens]], the [[Walker Art Center]], the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[Australian Museum|Australia Museum]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannheim|first=Bruce|last2=Behar|first2=Ruth|date=1995|title=In Dialogue: The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odessy|url=|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=118–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activist interventions ====
While there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements – through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections – to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guerrillagirls.com|title=Guerrilla Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] cancelled [[Corcoran Gallery of Art#Mapplethorpe scandal|''The Perfect Moment'']], an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe’s explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe’s photos on the exterior of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html|title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|date=1989-07-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protests occurred when [[David Wojnarowicz]]’s film [[David Wojnarowicz#.22A Fire in My Belly.22 controversy|''A Fire in My Belly'']] was removed from the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)#Hide.2FSeek controversy|''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'']] exhibit at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/09/AR2010120905895.html|title='Fire' man: Wojnarowicz, censored by Smithsonian, sounded an alarm in dire times|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Museum hack ====
Museum interventions have also become increasingly popular through companies such as Museum Hack, which offers unconventional tours of large museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] or the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. These tours depart from traditional methods of museum interpretation by using humor and technology to appeal to younger generations or non-typical museum audiences. Museum Hack functions with permission from the institutions in which they work, rather than providing unsolicited tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museumhack.com/|title=Museum Hack - Team Building Activities &amp; Museum Tours|website=Museum Hack|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal institutional interventions ====

While most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called ''Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 – Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/804-messing-with-moma-critical-interventions-at-the-museum-of-modern-art-1939-now|title=Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, 1939–Now|last=Tobias|first=Jennifer|date=May 26, 2016|website=post.at.moma.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/messingwithmoma/|title=Moma.org {{!}} Interactives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Messing With MoMA|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geismar|first1=Haidy|title=he Art of Anthropology: Questioning Contemporary Art in Ethnographic Display|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=2|issue=10|pages=183–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curatorial dreaming ===
Curatorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions. It is intended as “an alternative mode of critical, intellectual practice – a form of ‘theorizing in the concrete’”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Curating workshops, courses and labs ===
{{external links|section|date=January 2018}}
Over the last three decades there has been a proliferation of curating workshops, courses, and labs that engage with New Museology and critical museology in museum spaces, in universities, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Radar|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2014/08/22/14-curatorial-training-programmes-in-north-america/|website=14 Curatorial Training Programmes|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/ Bard Center for Curatorial Studies] in New York was founded in 1990 and began offering a graduate program in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CSS|url=http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/|website=CSS Bard|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the [http://www.carmah.berlin/ Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage] is engaging with the social, cultural, and political issues facing contemporary museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmah.berlin/our-centre/|title=CARMAH – Our Centre|website=www.carmah.berlin|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, two of the most innovative curating labs are the [http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/ Making Culture Lab] at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Vancouver and the [http://capsl.cerev.ca/ Curating and Public Scholarship Lab] at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, which offered its inaugural [https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html International Field School in Critical Museology] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/|title=Making Culture Lab|website=hennessy.iat.sfu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capsl.cerev.ca/|title=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|website=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html|title=Curatorial Dreams|website=www.concordia.ca|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies] in Cape Town includes a curatorial module within a comprehensive diploma and M.A. program that engages critically with museum and heritage studies, the leading program on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies|url=https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx|website=UWC APMHS|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''New Labour, New Life For Britain''''' was a political [[manifesto]] published in 1996 by the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. The party had recently rebranded itself as [[New Labour]] under [[Tony Blair]]. The manifesto set out the party's new "Third Way" centrist  approach to policy, with subsequent success at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab97.htm new Labour because Britain deserves better] - Political Science Resources. Access date: 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1997 general election produced the biggest Labour majority in the history of the party's existence. They won 418 seats, with a majority of 179.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm 1997: ''Labour landslide ends Tory rule''] - [[BBC News]]. Last updated: 15 April 2005, Access date: 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They delivered on the main aims of the manifesto including introducing a [[minimum wage]], increasing [[National Health Service]] (NHS) spending and reducing class sizes in schools.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' rule was over after eighteen years; under the leadership of [[John Major]] they suffered their worst defeat since the 1906 general election, losing 178 seats, including the unseating of seven Conservative Cabinet Ministers and the loss of all their Scottish and Welsh representation; becoming the official opposition with 165 seats. This election was the start of a Labour government following an 18-year spell in opposition and continued with another landslide victory in 2001 and a third consecutive victory in 2005. In 2010, they became the official opposition with 258 seats.
The new Leader of the Labour Party, [[Ed Miliband]], completely abandoned the New Labour branding in 2010 after being elected, moving the party's political stance slightly further to the left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ed-miliband-ditches-new-labour-110754 ''Ed Miliband ditches New Labour''] - [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]. Published: 15 February 2012, Access date: 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as leader in 2015, and was succeeded by [[Jeremy Corbyn]] at the September 2015 Labour Leadership election, who has further distanced the party from brand.

==Pledge card==
During the 1997 campaign, a pledge card with five specific pledges was issued and detailed in the manifesto too. The pledges were:&lt;ref name="manifesto" /&gt;
* Cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5, 6 and 7-year-olds by using money from the assisted places scheme.
* Fast-track punishment for persistent young offenders by halving the time from arrest to sentencing.
* Cut [[National Health Service|NHS]] waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients as a first step by releasing £100,000,000 saved from NHS red tape.
* Get 250,000 under-25s off benefits and into work by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities.
* No rise in income tax rates, cut [[VAT]] on heating to 5% and inflation and interest rates as low as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">In '''''Peri-Urban Areas Health Board v Munarin''''', an important case in South African law, the issue concerned the liability of the employer of an independent contractor for damages arising from the death of a third party who was injured in consequence of the dangerous operations being performed by the contractor. In the course of his judgment, in terms of which the employer's liability was confirmed, Holmes JA said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Negligence is the breach of a duty of care. In general, the law allows me to mind my own business. Thus, if I happen to see someone else's child about to drown in a pool, ordinarily I do not owe a legal duty to anyone to try to save it. But sometimes the law requires me to be my brother's keeper. This happens, for example, when the circumstances are such that I owe him a duty of care; and I am negligent if I breach it. I owe him such a duty if a ''diligens paterfamilias'', that notional epitome of reasonable prudence, in the position in which I am in [''sic''], would—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) foresee the possibility of harm occurring to him; and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) take steps to guard against its occurrence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Foreseeability of harm to a person, whether he be a specific individual or one of a category, is usually not a difficult question, but when ought I to guard against it? It depends upon the circumstances in each particular case, and it is neither necessary nor desirable to attempt a formulation which would cover all cases. For the purposes of the present case it is sufficient to say, by way of general approach, that if I launch a potentially dangerous undertaking involving the foreseeable possibility of harm to another, the circumstances may be such that I cannot reasonably shrug my shoulders in unconcern but have certain responsibilities in the matter—the duty of care.&lt;ref&gt;373E-H.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]] (England and Wales, Scotland)
* [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]] (United States, Canada)
* [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross]] (Australia, Japan)

==Name==

"Personal ordinariate" is the term used for each of the three existing ordinariates in the decree that established them: the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20110115_decree-erection-walsingham_en.html|title=Decree of Erection of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20120101_chair-of-st-peter_en.html|title=Decree of Erection of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, 1 January 2012|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross]]. It is also the collective name given to all three in the official yearbook of the Holy See&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (''Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013'' {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 1034&lt;/ref&gt; and is a name the ordinariates themselves use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chairofpeter.org/|title=Quo Vadis: Notes from the Ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ordinariate.org.au/|title=Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/liturgy-anglican-use Liturgy - Anglican Use] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115341/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/liturgy-anglican-use |date=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ordinariates for former Anglicans" is a term sometimes used by the ordinariates themselves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://usordinariate.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=7 "Ordinariate Questions and Answers"], Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ordinariate.org.au/resources/ "Resources"], Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross website.&lt;/ref&gt; by news sources (but not official documents) of the Holy See&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/first-liturgical-texts-for-ordinariates-for-former "First liturgical texts for Ordinariates for former Anglicans"], Vatican news network website&lt;/ref&gt; and episcopal conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130719085416/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1303017.htm "Pope opens ordinariates for former Anglicans to baptized Catholics"], ''Catholic News Service'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology, however, does not mean that an ordinariate's membership exclusively comprises former Anglicans. The head of the North American ordinariate has said that "ordinariates for former Anglicans must be a bridge to Christian unity and a force for true ecumenism" and the members must "build and rebuild our relationships with confreres who have stayed behind in the Anglican Church".&lt;ref name=Gyapong&gt;[http://bcc.rcav.org/component/content/article/1-latest-news/3392-ordinariates-must-be-a-bridge-to-christian-unity-ordinary-says "Ordinariates must be a bridge to Christian unity, ordinary says"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220114711/http://bcc.rcav.org/component/content/article/1-latest-news/3392-ordinariates-must-be-a-bridge-to-christian-unity-ordinary-says |date=20 December 2013 }}, ''BC Catholic'', 18 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Anglican ordinariates" is often used by newspapers, such as the ''[[Church of England Newspaper]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchnewspaper.com/32084/archives "Anglican Ordinariate secure, leaders say"], ''The Church of England Newspaper'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Canadian ''[[The Catholic Register|Catholic Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicregister.org/news/canada/item/13535-hopes-fade-for-canadian-anglican-ordinariate "Hopes Fade for Canadian Anglican Ordinariate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219022318/http://www.catholicregister.org/news/canada/item/13535-hopes-fade-for-canadian-anglican-ordinariate |date=19 December 2013 }}, ''Catholic Register'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used by communities belonging to the ordinariates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasmorechurch.ca/|title=The Catholic Parish of St. Thomas More|work=The Catholic Parish of St. Thomas More}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usordinariate.org/index.cfm?load=org&amp;org=28 "Anglican Ordinariate Society of the Ozarks"] on the website of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/document.doc?id=77|title=Newsletter of the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth Group, hosted on the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham website|author=|date=|website=ordinariate.org.uk|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234957/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/document.doc?id=77|archive-date=30 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://charlestonordinariate.org/about/ Corpus Christi Community, speaking, with quotation marks, of "the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter (the 'Anglican Ordinariate')"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102559/http://charlestonordinariate.org/about/ |date=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name does not imply that the members of an ordinariate are still Anglicans. While those who have been Anglicans "bring with them, into the full communion of the Catholic Church in all its diversity and richness of liturgical rites and traditions, aspects of their own Anglican patrimony and culture which are consonant with the Catholic Faith", they are "Catholics of the Latin Rite, within the full communion of the Catholic Church ... no longer part of any other communion".&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The apostolic constitution was a response by the [[Holy See]] to requests coming from [[Continuing Anglican]] churches, particularly the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]]; and from [[Anglo-Catholic]] sections of the [[Anglican Communion]], such as those involved with [[Forward in Faith]],&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt; and, within the Catholic Church, from the [[Anglican Use]] parishes which have existed since the early 1980s when, at the request of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[Pope John Paul II]] granted the [[Pastoral Provision]] allowing the creation, within the territorial [[Latin Church]] dioceses of the United States, of parishes in which the liturgy would be celebrated in an approved form of the Anglican tradition and with a married clergy composed of former Anglican priests who were ordained in the Catholic Church on joining it. Many of these Anglican Use Catholics had left the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] because of [[women's ordination]] especially to the episcopate, revisions of the liturgy, and changes in its moral teaching. These changes evidenced also in the consecration of a partnered homosexual man as a bishop and the blessing of same-sex couples have provoked serious tensions within the composite Anglican world, as Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]] said in 2009, leading to the requests to which the apostolic constitution was a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1341020?eng=y|title=Anglicans and Orthodox. Cardinal Kasper Between a Rock and a Hard Place|author=Elemedia S.p.A. - Area Internet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussions that led to the granting of the 1980 pastoral provision raised some of the ideas that came to fruition in the decision of 2009. One was the setting up of a structure for former Anglicans similar to the [[military ordinariate]], an idea that was not then acted on because of the small number of Anglicans involved at that time.&lt;ref&gt;See the history of the pastoral provision by the Reverend Jack D. Barker has given in the article ''The Pastoral Provision for Roman Catholics in the U.S.A.'' available on the website of the [http://www.stmarythevirgin.org/ Catholic Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Arlington, Texas.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 the Traditional Anglican Communion presented to the Holy See a petition for full union in corporate form (i.e., as a body, not merely as individuals) with the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/01/text-of-the-tac-petition-to-the-holy-see/|title=Text of the TAC Petition to the Holy See|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worldwide grouping, under a single primate, of churches of Anglican tradition but outside of communion with the see of Canterbury, was founded in 1991. It was formed over a number of issues, including [[liturgy|liturgical]] revisions, the ordination of women and open homosexuals as priests, the [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|sanctioning of homosexuality]] and the importance of [[tradition]].

On 5 July 2008, Cardinal Levada responded to the formal request for "full, corporate and sacramental union" with the Roman Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancatholic.ca/bishlett/200710-ad_clerum_rome.pdf Anglican Catholic Church of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164634/http://www.anglicancatholic.ca/bishlett/200710-ad_clerum_rome.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving written assurance that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was giving serious attention to the prospect of "corporate unity" raised in that request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicani.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/from-the-primate-of-the-tac-unity-with-the-holy-see/#more-73 Facsimile of Cardinal Levada's letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725154946/http://anglicani.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/from-the-primate-of-the-tac-unity-with-the-holy-see/ |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The request thus became a basis for the decision, announced by Cardinal Levada on 20 October 2009, to issue the apostolic constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicism.about.com/od/organization/p/Catholic_Anglican_Relations_and_Differences.htm|title=Differences Between the Anglican and Catholic Churches|author=Scott P.

===Announcement and enactment===
The decision to institute personal ordinariates for Anglicans who join the Catholic Church was announced on 20 October 2009 by Cardinal [[William Levada]] at a press conference in Rome&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|last=Richert|first=Scott P.|title=Pope Benedict to Anglicans: Come Home to Rome|url=http://catholicism.about.com/b/2009/10/20/pope-benedict-to-anglicans-come-home-to-rome.htm|work=About.com Catholicism|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=34677|title=Bridge Over Troubled Tiber: Holy See Welcomes Anglican Christians into Catholic Church|author=Catholic Online|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011155730/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=34677|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], and the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], [[Vincent Nichols]], at a simultaneous press conference in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1340591?eng=y|title=Knock, and It Shall Be Opened to You.

The apostolic constitution enacting the introduction of personal ordinariates for former Anglicans was released on 9 November 2009, together with supplementary norms for the ordinariates, allowing former Anglicans to enter full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving elements of the distinctive Anglican spiritual and liturgical patrimony. Provision was made for ordination as Catholic priests of married former Anglican clergy, but for historical and [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] reasons married men could not be ordained as bishops. The ordinary, who will usually be appointed from among former Anglican clergy, can therefore be either a priest or a bishop. Seminarians in the ordinariate were to be prepared alongside other Catholic seminarians, though the ordinariate might establish a house of formation to address the particular needs of formation in the Anglican patrimony.&lt;ref name=Note/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cf.ac.uk/clr/research/Doe_%20The%20Apostolic%20Constitution%20Anglicanorum%20Coetibus_An%20Anglican%20Juridical%20Perspective.pdf Norman Doe, "The Apostolic Constitution ''Anglicanorum coetibus'': An Anglican Juridical Perspective", pp. 4-8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rhidian/&gt;

In December 2009, Cardinal Levada responded to each of the bishops of the Traditional Anglican Communion who signed the October 2007 petition for corporate union with the Catholic Church, stating that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had completed its long and detailed study with the aim of making available a suitable and viable model of organic unity for their group "and other such groups". The Traditional Anglican Communion then undertook discussions with those other groups and with representatives of the Catholic episcopal conferences and planned to give a formal response after a meeting of their bishops in Eastertide 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/01/statement-of-archbishop-hepworth-on-response-from-holy-see/|title=Statement of Archbishop Hepworth on Response from Holy See|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance by some Anglican groups===
A number of Anglican groups soon petitioned the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for acceptance into ordinariates.

* On 3 March 2010, in Orlando, Florida, the eight members of the House of Bishops of the [[Anglican Church in America]] voted unanimously to become part of the Catholic Church along with 3,000 fellow communicants in 120 parishes in four dioceses across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weatherbe |first=Steve |title=Anglo-Catholic Bishops Vote for Rome |publisher=National Catholic Register |date=14 March 2010 |url=http://www.ncregister.com/register_exclusives/anglo-catholic_bishops_vote_for_rome/ |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313174543/http://www.ncregister.com/register_exclusives/anglo-catholic_bishops_vote_for_rome/ |archivedate=13 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the vote, the bishops and the [[Pastoral Provision]] parishes sent a joint petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith requesting the establishment of an ordinariate in the United States and making some suggestions about how that could be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/04/text-of-joint-acaanglican-use-petition-for-usa-ordinariate/|title=Text of Joint ACA/Anglican Use Petition for USA Ordinariate|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 12 March 2010, the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]] formally requested the erection of an ordinariate in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicancatholic.ca/documents/2010-03-12-petition-cardinal-levada.pdf The petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821182806/http://anglicancatholic.ca/documents/2010-03-12-petition-cardinal-levada.pdf |date=21 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The denomination subsequently split into two jurisdictions, one of which then detached and joined the ordinariate, when several congregations decided not to join the Catholic Church due to various unforeseen difficulties.
* The [[Anglican Catholic Church in Australia]] (a province of the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]]) and [[Forward in Faith|Forward in Faith Australia]], mostly members of the [[Anglican Church of Australia]], jointly applied for an ordinariate in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/04/text-of-acca-petition-for-an-australian-personal-ordinariate/|title=Text of ACCA Petition for an Australian Personal Ordinariate|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two congregations later left the denomination over the issue.
* The [[Church of Torres Strait]], another province of the Traditional Anglican Communion in Australia, covering parts of Northern Queensland and the Torres Strait, also applied for a separate ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicanusenews.blogspot.com/2010/05/church-of-torres-strait-to-request.html|title=The Anglican Use of the Roman Rite|author=Steve Cavanaugh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A majority of the 17 clergy of the Traditional Anglican Church (the Traditional Anglican Communion Province for England, Scotland and Wales) supported a petition for acceptance into the Roman Catholic ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetraditionalanglicanchurch.org.uk/dossier180510rev.pdf|title=The Traditional Anglican Church|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306234152/http://www.thetraditionalanglicanchurch.org.uk/dossier180510rev.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2010, under the leadership of some [[Church of England]] bishops, the [[Society of St Wilfrid and St Hilda]], a new grouping which intends to stay within the Church of England, was founded for Anglicans who do not accept the ministry of the Pope at least "as presently exercised",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswsh.com/origins.html|title=The Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to keep Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England.

==Purpose==
The structure of an ordinariate enables [[Anglicans]] to enter into full communion with the [[Pope]] while preserving some degree of corporate identity and autonomy from the geographical [[diocese]]s for other Catholics of the [[Latin Church]] (also known as the "Latin Rite") and maintaining distinctive elements of their Anglican "theological, spiritual and liturgical patrimony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usordinariate.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=167|title=Anglican Patrimony in the Catholic Church|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinariates integrate these groups in such ways as "to maintain the liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions of the Anglican Communion within the Catholic Church, as a precious gift nourishing the faith of the members of the Ordinariate and as a treasure to be shared",&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/page.aspx?pid=410 Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham: "Frequently Asked Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412072030/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/page.aspx?pid=410 |date=12 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicherald.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/02/16/rome-expected-to-take-five-years-to-approve-personal-ordinariate-liturgy/ "Rome expected to take five years to approve Personal Ordinariate liturgy"], ''Catholic Herald'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apostolic Constitution"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html Apostolic Constitution], III&lt;/ref&gt; is part of "the Latin Rite, within the full communion of the Catholic Church and professes all that church's doctrine on faith and morals."&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott /&gt;&lt;ref name="content.yudu.com"&gt;[http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1o7o1/TheRecordPetertide20/resources/12.htm Same talk as published in the newsletter of the Church of England parish of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, Petertide 2010, p. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224122036/http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1o7o1/TheRecordPetertide20/resources/12.htm |date=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal ordinariates were originally envisaged for former Anglican communities and clergy seeking to become Catholic, enabling them to retain many aspects of their Anglican liturgy and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usordinariate.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=7 "Ordinariate Questions &amp; Answers"], Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter website.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the ordinariates identify as Anglican culturally, but as Catholic theologically and ecclesiologically. Membership in the ordinariates, however, is not restricted exclusively to former Anglicans.

==Anglican patrimony==
In a letter in September 2013, Archbishop Vincent Nichols, President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, explained that, through the canonical structure of the ordinariate, "Anglicans who wish to enter the full communion of the Catholic Church, bringing with them some of the traditions and beauty of the Anglican heritage in which they were nurtured, may do so."&lt;ref name=Sept2013A&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/09/19/archbishop-urges-catholics-to-support-the-ordinariate/ "Archbishop urges Catholics to support the ordinariate"], ''Catholic Herald'', 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/document.doc?id=111 "To All Parishes in the Dioceses of England and Wales"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030022743/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/document.doc?id=111 |date=30 October 2013 }}, Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rites of the ordinariates are characterised by revisions of Anglican rites approved by the Holy See for their use. While the Roman Rite is also permitted for the ordinariates, their official Divine Worship missal was adapted from the ''[[Book of Divine Worship]]'' that parishes of the United States' [[Pastoral Provision]] were already using before the ordinariates were instituted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/liturgy-anglican-use "Liturgy - Anglican Use"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115341/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/liturgy-anglican-use |date=24 December 2013 }}, Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham website.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sarah|Cardinal Sarah]] has praised the [[Anglican Use]] liturgy of the ordinariate: "Certainly, cultures and other Christians bring gifts with them into the Church - the liturgy of the Ordinariates of Anglicans now in full communion with the Catholic Church is a beautiful example of this."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/318230482/Cardinal-Robert-Sarah-s-Address-to-Sacra-Liturgia-UK-London-5-July-2016-English-Final-Text "Towards an Authentic Implementation of Sacrosanctum Concilium"], Address of His Eminence, Robert Cardinal Sarah, Sacra Liturgia UK 2016, London, England, 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospective members==

===Anglicans===

Through the ordinariates, "Anglicans who wish to enter the full communion of the Catholic Church, bringing with them some of the traditions and beauty of the Anglican heritage in which they were nurtured, may do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/09/19/archbishop-urges-catholics-to-support-the-ordinariate/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » Archbishop urges Catholics to support the ordinariate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anglicans who join the Catholic Church are not obliged to become members of an ordinariate and can choose to belong to the Latin diocese of residence.&lt;ref name=Baura/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In either form they are received by individual profession of faith. The rite of reception would normally also include the sacraments of Confirmation and Eucharist.&lt;ref name=Norms5-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20091104_norme-anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html|title=Complementary Norms for the Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum coetibus|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglicans who join the local Latin dioceses, either before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/01/26/all-former-anglicans-can-join-ordinariate-says-bishop/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » All former Anglicans can join ordinariate, says bishop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or after&lt;ref name=POCSP&gt;[http://usordinariate.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=164 North American ordinate website], "A person is eligible for membership if they, their spouse, or any member of their family is or ever has been Anglican, Episcopalian, Methodist, or [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME]]. This applies even if the person or their spouse has already become a Roman Catholic"&lt;/ref&gt; the erection of an ordinariate, are permitted to join an ordinariate. Monsignor Jeffrey Steenson is an example of someone who first became a member of a Latin diocese before later being a member of an ordinariate.

===Non-Anglicans===
Ordinariate membership as an entry to [[full communion]] with the Catholic Church is not limited solely to members of churches in the Anglican Communion. The founding document of personal ordinariates stated that their members would either be people "originally belonging to the Anglican Communion and now in full communion with the Catholic Church" (former Anglicans) or those "who receive the Sacraments of Initiation within the jurisdiction of the Ordinariate".&lt;ref&gt;''Anglicanorum coetibus'', 1 §4&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[sacraments of initiation]] are [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], and [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacraments of the Christian initiation|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Moreover, the personal ordinariates have extended the meaning of the word "Anglican" in this context to include members of any "Protestant Church linked to the Church of England, such as the [[Lutheran]] or [[Methodist]] Church" in [[Great Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dioceseofsalford.org.uk/the-ordinariate|title=Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford|work=Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227234939/http://www.dioceseofsalford.org.uk/the-ordinariate|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to anyone who has ever been an "Anglican, Episcopalian, Methodist, or [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME]]" in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name=POCSP/&gt; Therefore, many individuals who have never formally been part of a church in the Anglican Communion may become Catholic through an ordinariate, just as they might through any diocesan [[parish]].

The complementary norms issued at the same time added that "those who have received all of the Sacraments of Initiation outside the Ordinariate are not ordinarily eligible for membership", but indicated that by exception "members of a family belonging to the Ordinariate" can become members also.&lt;ref name=Norms5-1/&gt; Such people, not belonging to either of the other two categories of members, are thus a third class.

The same three categories of members are listed in the decree of erection of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter: "It includes those faithful, of every category and state of life, who, originally having belonged to the Anglican Communion, are now in full communion with the Catholic Church, or who have received the sacraments of initiation within the jurisdiction of the Ordinariate itself, or who are received into it because they are part of a family belonging to the Ordinariate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20120101_chair-of-st-peter_en.html|title=Decree of Erection of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, 1 January 2012|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 modification of the norms governing personal ordinariates made it clear that membership of an ordinariate is open to those who are Catholics by baptism but have not received both of the other two sacraments of initiation, if evangelising by an ordinariate brings them back to the faith and practice of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, article 5 §2 as revised on 31 May 2013 (cf. [http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/anglicanesimo-anglicanism-anglicanesimo-26374/ Andrea Tornielli, "Francis makes key amendment giving Ordinariates important role in new evangelisation"])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-says-catholics-seeking-confirmation-can-join-anglican-ordinariate/|title=Pope says Catholics seeking confirmation can join Anglican ordinariate|work=Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they lack an Anglican background, they acquire membership of an ordinariate by receiving within it some of the sacraments of initiation. Other Catholics cannot "for purely subjective motives or personal preference" be enrolled in an ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ordinariate.org.uk/news?ncs2704=0|title=Index of /news|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130706181059/http://www.usordinariate.org/membership_norms_amended.html "Amendment to Apostolic Constitution Complementary Norms Emphasizes Mission to Evangelize"], Personal Chair of Saint Peter website.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all Catholics may regularly attend and receive communion at ordinariate services, as they can in any Latin or Eastern Catholic parish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4N.HTM Code of Canon Law], canon 1248 §1, Holy See website.&lt;/ref&gt;

If membership by reception of the sacraments of initiation within an ordinariate is open not only to the Catholics mentioned in the 2013 amendment but to others also who have no Anglican background - something on which no express statement has been issued - anyone who has not yet received all three sacraments of initiation may join. This includes non-Christians, those who, in the view of the Catholic Church, do not have valid baptism&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archbalt.org/evangelization/worship/rcia/upload/Validity-of-Baptisms-and-Confirmation.pdf Archdiocese of Baltimore, "Valid/Invalid Baptisms &amp; Confirmations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228055836/https://www.archbalt.org/evangelization/worship/rcia/upload/Validity-of-Baptisms-and-Confirmation.pdf |date=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as Mormons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html|title=Response on the validity of baptism conferred by «mormons»|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who, again in the view of the Catholic Church, have valid baptism but not valid confirmation or Eucharist.&lt;ref name=Huels&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qpQ2y8532nMC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=valid+holy+orders+Polish+National&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gke_UqqDDIe27QbyhYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=valid%20holy%20orders%20Polish%20National&amp;f=false John Huels, ''The Catechumenate and the Law: A Pastoral and Canonical Commentary for the Church in the United States'' (Liturgy Training Publications, 1994), p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant]]s in general are seen as lacking valid confirmation, but the Eastern churches and some Western ones, such as some [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] churches and the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], are recognized as having valid sacraments.&lt;ref name=Huels/&gt;

Latin Rite priests can receive Orthodox Christians, who then belong not to the Latin Church but to the respective Eastern Catholic [[particular Church#autonomous particular Churches or Rites|particular church]]. To be ascribed to the Latin Church (e.g. if the person intended to join the ordinariate), or to an Eastern Catholic church ''[[sui iuris]]'' other than the one of the same rite as the non-Catholic Eastern church from which the [[Christian]] arrives, permission of the [[Apostolic See]] may be necessary, although it may also occur with the permission of the respective Eastern and Latin [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]] who have jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcgary.org/pdf/Reception-Orthodox-Christian.pdf|title=Reception of an Orthodox Christian into the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=dcgary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests of a personal ordinariate are not excluded from this authority: "Anyone who is not already a Catholic can be received into the Catholic Church through the Ordinariate."&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.dioceseofsalford.org.uk/the-ordinariate Diocese of Salford, "Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227234939/http://www.dioceseofsalford.org.uk/the-ordinariate |date=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2010, three serving and two retired bishops of the [[Church of England]] announced their intention to join the Roman Catholic Church. The serving bishops were [[provincial episcopal visitors]] [[Andrew Burnham (priest)|Andrew Burnham]] of Ebbsfleet, [[Keith Newton (prelate)|Keith Newton]] of Richborough, along with suffragan [[John Broadhurst]] of Fulham, all of whom declared their intention to resign from the offices they held with effect from 31 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2010/11/08/five-anglo-catholic-bishops-resign/=News|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » Does Francis want priests to marry?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retired bishops were [[Edwin Barnes]], formerly of Richborough, and [[David Silk (bishop)|David Silk]], formerly of Ballarat in Australia and an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Exeter. 

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, announced that he had with regret accepted the resignations of Bishops Burnham and Newton. The [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] gave assurance of a warm welcome for those who wished to be part of an ordinariate.&lt;ref name=BBC101108&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11709148|title=Five Anglican bishops join Catholic Church|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pastoral letter concerning his resignation as Bishop of Richborough, Newton stressed that he had done so not for "negative reasons about problems in the Church of England but for positive reasons in response to our Lord's prayer the night before he died, [that] 'they may all be one'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richborough.org.uk/index.php/news/24/15|title=Richborough Episcopal Area|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Gledhill]], religious affairs correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'', said that the announcement could prompt "hundreds, possibly thousands" of lay ministers to follow the bishops' example. She added: "It's quite significant as it means the ordinariate – that quite a few people have been saying might not get off the ground – could be a force to be reckoned with.".&lt;ref name=BBC101108/&gt;

On 19 November 2010, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales announced that work was proceeding with a view to establishing an ordinariate in January 2011. It also said that the five Anglican bishops would receive ordination to the Catholic diaconate and priesthood at about the same time and would then assist in the reception of other Anglicans probably in [[Holy Week]], followed during Eastertide by diaconal ordinations and priestly ordination around Pentecost of those former Anglican clergy whose requests for ordination would have been accepted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Bishops' Statement on Anglican Ordinariate|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31007?l=english|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Zenit|date=November 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000635/http://www.zenit.org/article-31007?l=english|archivedate=31 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31007?l=english|title=UK Bishops' Statement on Anglican Ordinariate|work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000635/http://www.zenit.org/article-31007?l=english|archivedate=31 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2011, Broadhurst, Burnham and Newton, their wives (except Burnham's wife, who is Jewish) and three former Anglican nuns of a convent at Walsingham, were received into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2011/01/history-being-made/=Eyewitness Account on Blog '' The Anglo-Catholic'']&lt;/ref&gt; The three men were ordained to the Catholic diaconate on 13 January and to the priesthood on 15 January.

The first personal ordinariate for former Anglicans, the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, was established on 15 January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London: first anniversary celebrations for Ordinariate |url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=19624 |accessdate=8 March 2012 |newspaper=Independent Catholic News|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Keith Newton appointed as the first ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Newton Appointed the First Ordinary of the ‘Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham’ by Pope Benedict XVI|url=http://www.catholicezine.com/news-articles/news.pl?aid=82481|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=CatholicEzine.com|date=2011-01-16|agency=Catholic Communications Network|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423051923/http://www.catholicezine.com/news-articles/news.pl?aid=82481|archivedate=23 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Easter 2011, about 900 laity and about 60 former Anglican clergy (many retired from active ministry) joined the Catholic Church as members of the ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = BBC News| title = More Anglicans to convert to Catholicism at Easter | date = 21 April 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13153316 | accessdate = 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Monsignor Keith Newton, the ordinary, admitted that the ordinariate had not grown as much as was hoped. It had not yet aroused broad interest among Anglican clergy, who had not welcomed it. To revive interest among Anglican upholders of traditional Christian doctrine, the ordinariate's members, he suggested, should "communicate our message more fully and with more vigour and enthusiasm".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=21158&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=2&amp;searchid=1310563 "Leader of Anglican ordinariate admits interest has waned" (''Catholic World News'', 17 April 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2012, the ordinariate for the United States was established with the name of the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]]. [[Jeffrey N. Steenson]], a former bishop of the Episcopal Church, was named as its first ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-01-01/vatican-anglicans/52321430/1|title=Anglicans have U.S. home in Catholic church – USATODAY.com|work=USATODAY.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, the ordinariate was given extended jurisdiction over Canada through the newly established Canadian [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter#Deanery of St John the Baptist|Deanery of St John the Baptist]]. Lee Kenyon, the first Anglican ordinariate priest ordained for service in Canada, was appointed as the first dean.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith appointed Cardinal [[Donald Wuerl]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington#Prelature|Archbishop of Washington]], as its delegate for the implementation of an ordinariate in the United States. Wuerl also led a liaison committee of three bishops of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] for implementation of the ordinariate.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith also appointed Thomas Collins, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto|Archbishop of Toronto]], as its delegate for implementation of an ordinariate in Canada. Collins also led a liaison committee of bishops of the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]].

In November 2010, the Parish of Our Lady of the Atonement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Duane Alexander|title=Anglicanorum Coetibus and the Church of Our Lady of the Atonement, the Founding Parish of Anglican Use in the Roman Catholic Church|journal=Anglican and Episcopal History|date=September 2011|volume=80|issue=3|pages=296–305|url=https://www.academia.edu/1502874/Anglicanorum_Coetibus_and_the_Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Atonement_the_Founding_Parish_of_Anglican_Use_in_the_Roman_Catholic_Church_Feast_of_St_David_of_Wales_1_March_2011|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in San Antonio, Texas, the first [[Anglican Use]] parish under the [[Pastoral Provision]], hosted a seminar called "Becoming One" to build relationships and to disseminate information about the possibility of establishing a personal ordinariate in the United States. It was well attended by interested parties from the United States and Canada. In March 2011 a similar conference was held in Mississauga, Ontario, for those interested from across Canada. Christopher Phillips, one of the guest speakers at the conference, celebrated the first Anglican Use Mass in Canadian history at St Joseph's Streetsville for the Feast of the Annunciation.

A pastoral letter dated 30 November 2010 from [[John Hepworth]], primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion, stated that announcements similar to those for England and Wales and for Australia were expected to be issued soon concerning Canada and the United States. He also stated that [[Robert Mercer (priest)|Robert Mercer]], a retired bishop resident in England who had been the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland and then a bishop in the [[Anglican Catholic Church of Canada]] (a [[Continuing Anglican]] church), intended to join the ordinariate for England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicusanglicanus.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/pastoral-statement-from-the-primate/ Pastoral Statement of the Primate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210045758/http://catholicusanglicanus.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/pastoral-statement-from-the-primate/ |date=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most of the "continuing" Anglican Church in America (TAC) drew back from joining the ordinariate.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Of the Anglican Church in America parishes, St. Barnabas Church of Omaha, Nebraska accepted the offer of the Holy See and became part of the ordinariate.

In May 2011, preparations for members of the Traditional Anglican Communion in Canada to join an ordinariate were put on hold in view of reports about intended announcements by Collins that those intending to join the ordinariate would have to close their Traditional Anglican parishes and attend a Catholic parish for four to six months and that the dossiers submitted by the clergy concerned showed that their training was inadequate, requiring them to attend a Catholic seminary for an unspecified time. Archbishop denied the reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/05/12/ordinariate-talks-stall-in-canada/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » Ordinariate talks stall in Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2011, in advance of the report that Wuerl was due to present to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on interest shown in joining an ordinariate, a 100-member Episcopal parish in Bladensburg, Maryland was reported to have become the first in the United States to ask to be received into the Catholic Church while keeping aspects of its Anglican traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/episcopal-church-in-bladensburg-to-convert-to-roman-catholic-parish/2011/06/06/AGLsiIKH_story.html|title=Episcopal church in Bladensburg to convert to Roman Catholic parish|author=Michelle Boorstein|date=6 June 2011|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts give Mount Calvary Church in Baltimore as the first, and the Bladensburg church as the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5o1xB_TflI|title=US Episcopal Churches gaining momentum to form Ordinariate|date=10 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2010/09/mount-calvary-church-baltimore/|title=Mount Calvary Church, Baltimore|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his report to the bishops' conference, Wuerl stated that the Holy See had indicated its wish to establish an ordinariate in the United States before the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2011/06/text-of-cardinal-wuerls-report/|title=Text of Cardinal Wuerl's Report|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the next meeting of the Bishops Conference, on 15 November, he announced that, with the approval of Pope Benedict XVI, 1 January 2012 would be the date of establishment of the new ordinariate for former Anglicans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ordinariateportal.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/full-text-of-cardinal-wuerls-address-to-usccb/|title=Full text of Cardinal Wuerl’s address to USCCB - Ordinariate Portal|work=Ordinariate Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that of 67 petitions by United States Anglican clergy for ordination as Catholic priests 35 had already received the [[nihil obstat]] of the Holy See and would be examined locally for possible acceptance. He also said that two Anglican communities had already entered into full communion with the Catholic Church, one in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth|Diocese of Fort Worth]], the other in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archdiocese of Washington]].

The ordinariate dedicated its [[Diocesan chancery|chancery]] building February 1, 2015, behind and adjacent to its principal church, the Church of [[Our Lady of Walsingham]] in Houston, Texas, at which time it also celebrated the publication of the new [[Anglican Use#Divine Worship or Ordinariate Use liturgy|Divine Worship]] [[missal]] for use in its public worship.&lt;ref name = "Chancery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usordinariate.org/news/new-chancery-building-dedication|title=Dedication of New Chancery Building|date=19 Jan 2015|accessdate=3 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "missal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chairofpeter.org/?p=188|title=Visiting the New Chancery|date=4 Jul 2014|accessdate=3 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November 2010, Peter Elliott, an auxiliary bishop in [[Melbourne, Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=35363|title=Bishop Elliott Explains the Anglican Ordinariate: 'United in Communion But Not Absorbed'|author=Catholic Online|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210103145/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=35363|archivedate=10 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the Australian bishops intended to follow the example of England and Wales so that an initially "very small" ordinariate could be established in that country, with specific churches designated for its use, by Pentecost 2011. A former Anglican layman, Elliott is designated as the delegate of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and a liaison to the [[Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference]]. He expected that, once established, the proposed Australian ordinariate would attract "a much larger number of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31122?l=english|title=Ordinariate to Be Established Down Under by Easter|work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207055006/http://www.zenit.org/article-31122?l=english|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian ordinariate implementation committee was formed in mid-December 2010.

A national Australian ordinariate festival was held in February 2011 at [[Coomera]] in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themessenger.com.au./MessengerPDFs/OrdinariateMediaRelease.pdf|title=Media Release|author=|date=|website=au.|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was hosted by Elliott and Archbishop [[John Hepworth]] of the [[Anglican Catholic Church in Australia]].

People from the Catholic Church attended, as well as members of the [[Anglican Church of Australia]], the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia, the [[Church of Torres Strait]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], as well as some Anglican religious who wish to be part of the ordinariate. The implementation committee had its inaugural meeting after the conference.

The consensus of the festival was that unity can be achieved while also preserving the distinctive Anglican heritage of the churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsoftheanglicanordinariate.com/NEWS/PRCoom01.html|title=一瞬で勉強にとりかかれる頑張らずに成功するブログ|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321173441/http://www.friendsoftheanglicanordinariate.com/NEWS/PRCoom01.html|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliott said that membership in the ordinariate by interested persons is sought by a formal application in writing. All clergy transferring to the ordinariate will require a Catholic priest as sponsor and ordination within the Catholic Church.

In a radio discussion on 20 February 2011, Hepworth said that some 800 people of his own church, the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia, were committed to joining an ordinariate and that he believed, once implemented, it would grow strongly. The possibility of the Church of Torres Strait (some 9,000 people) joining was also discussed on the radio program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s3143760.htm|title=The Anglican ordinariate of the Roman Catholic church in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conference and synod of the Church of Torres Strait, held from 3 to 5 June 2011, decided unanimously to accept the idea of the church becoming a Catholic ordinariate and set a target date of the First Sunday in Advent in 2011 for its implementation after first finding out how many of its membership wish to join the ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themessenger.com.au./News/20110606.htm|title=Ordinariate Conference – Church of Torres Strait, TAC, Australia|author=|date=|website=au.|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his address to an ordinariate information day in Melbourne on 11 June 2011, Elliott said that the Australian ordinariate was expected to be established in 2012. He also confirmed that the petition of the Church of Torres Strait had been sent to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2011/06/a-catholic-welcome-for-anglicans/|title=A Catholic Welcome for Anglicans|work=The Anglo-Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Hepworth, a former Catholic priest who has been married twice, could not be an ordained bishop of the proposed ordinariate.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/vatican-reveals-plan-welcome-disaffected-anglicans John L.

As announced by the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference on 11 May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org.au/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=1256 Australian Catholic Bishops Conference - Media Release 11 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] established the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross on 15 June 2012. The 72-year-old [[Harry Entwistle]], who had been the Western Regional bishop (based in [[Perth, Western Australia]]) of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia was appointed the first ordinary and was ordained a priest in the Catholic Church on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29361.php?index=29361&amp;lang=en#Erezione dell’Ordinariato personale di Our Lady of the Southern Cross e nomina del primo Ordinario, Bulletin of the Holy See Press Office, 15 June 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130114051242/http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29361.php?index=29361&amp;lang=en |date=14 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the ordinariates==

The Anglican ordinariates are intended to integrate groups of Anglicans into the life of the Catholic Church in such a way as "to maintain the liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions of the Anglican Communion within the Catholic Church, as a precious gift nourishing the faith of the members of the Ordinariate and as a treasure to be shared".&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicherald.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apostolic Constitution"/&gt; An ordinariate is part of "the [[Latin Rite]], within the full communion of the Catholic Church and professes all that church's doctrine on faith and morals."&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100028730/anglican-catholics-bishop-peter-elliott-of-melbourne-sets-me-right/|title='Anglican Catholics': Bishop Peter Elliott of Melbourne sets me right|work=News - Telegraph Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="content.yudu.com"/&gt;

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] establishes, in consultation with the [[episcopal conference]] concerned, personal ordinariates for former Anglicans within the episcopal conference's area. There may be more than one personal ordinariate, delimited geographically or otherwise, within the territory of the same episcopal conference. Each ordinariate, composed of lay faithful, clergy, and members of [[religious institute]]s originally belonging to the Anglican Communion and now in [[full communion]] with the Catholic Church, is juridically comparable to a [[diocese]]. The ordinary of each ordinariate, who may be either a bishop or a priest, chosen on the basis of a [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|terna]] of names presented by the governing council of the ordinariate,&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, art. 4 §1&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law|canonically equivalent to a diocesan bishop]] and an ''ex officio'' member of the respective episcopal conference.,&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, art. 2 §2&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordinariate shall have a governing council composed of at least six priests&lt;ref name=tb /&gt; and chaired by the ordinary, that exercise the combined functions of the [[Presbyteral Council]] and the [[Consultor|College of Consultors]] of a diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, X §2; complementary norms, art. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Each ordinariate is also to have a finance council&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, X §3&lt;/ref&gt; and a pastoral council to perform the same functions as the respective bodies in a diocese.&lt;ref&gt;complementary norms, art. 13&lt;/ref&gt; An ordinariate also may establish its own tribunal to process marriage and other cases, though the local diocesan tribunals retain jurisdiction if the ordinariate does not set up a tribunal of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, Art. XII&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinary cannot be a bishop if married or with dependent children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Anglican ordinariate established in Britain|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=8913|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Catholic Culture.org|date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, while not having episcopal [[holy orders]], in particular the power to ordain to the diaconate, priesthood and episcopacy, he has the powers and privileges of other prelates who are canonically equivalent to diocesan bishops, such as [[territorial prelate]]s. It is he who by issuing [[dimissorial letters]] admits candidates to holy orders, having first obtained the consent of the governing council.&lt;ref name="complementary norms, art. 4 §3"/&gt; As an ordinary, he may personally install such candidates in the preliminary [[minor orders|ministries]] of [[lector (liturgy)|lectorate]] and [[acolyte|acolytate]]. Like other equivalents of diocesan bishops, he is a full member of the [[episcopal conference]] and may use certain episcopal symbols, such as mitre, crosier, ring, pectoral cross, zucchetto, choir dress with purple cassock.

After having heard the opinion of the local diocesan bishop, the ordinary may, with the consent of the governing council and of the Holy See, erect "deaneries", each supervised by a "delegate", that encompass multiple parishes of the ordinariate.&lt;ref name="complementary norms, art. 4 §3"&gt;complementary norms, art. 4 §3&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinary may also establish and suppress parishes and houses of formation and approve programs of formation with the consent of the governing council.&lt;ref name="complementary norms, art. 4 §3"/&gt;

Like diocesan bishops, the ordinary must make an ''[[ad limina]] apostolorum'' visit to Rome every five years.  During this visit, the ordinary presents a report on the status of his ordinariate to the Pope through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and in consultation with the [[Congregation for Bishops]] and the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].&lt;ref name=Rhidian&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Brih6nlXgugC&amp;pg=PA170 Rhidian Jones, ''The Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England'' (Continuum International Publishing Group 2011] {{ISBN|9780567616418}} ), Appendix IV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, Art. XI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine Worship or Ordinariate Use liturgy===
The ordinariates use [[Anglican Rite|Anglican ritual]] and have full faculties to celebrate the [[Eucharist]] and the other sacraments, the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] and other liturgical functions in accordance with the liturgical books proper to Anglican tradition, in revisions approved by the Holy See, so as to maintain the Anglican liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions. This faculty does not exclude liturgical celebrations according to the [[Roman Rite]].&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, Art. III&lt;/ref&gt;

The Complementary Norms clearly envision considerable pastoral collaboration between the clergy of parishes of personal ordinariates and the clergy of the dioceses within which they would be  located.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, Art. 8 and Art. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The Complementary Norms also specifically grant faculties to the pastor of a geographical parish that has a parish of a personal ordinariate within its boundary to supply liturgical and pastoral services consistent with the needs of the congregation of a parish of an ordinariate that does not have a parochial vicar assigned in the event of the death, incapacity, or unexpected absence of its pastor.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, Art. 14, §2&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ordinariate liturgies followed the [[Anglican Use]] of the [[Book of Divine Worship]], practiced among parishes of the [[Pastoral Provision]], incorporating "the sacral language of the Book of Common Prayer... and many elements of the English Missal."&lt;ref name=Gyapong/&gt; In Advent 2013, however, all three Anglican ordinariates adopted a newly revised [[Order of Mass]], approved by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and the [[Congregation for Divine Worship]], which "decided on the generic title 'Divine Worship' for the entire liturgical provision for the Personal Ordinariates, though the term 'Ordinariate Use' may still be used as shorthand."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/news/OrdinariateNews.php?New-Liturgical-Book-for-the-Personal-Ordinariates-195 Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham 20 March 2014, "New Liturgical Book for the Personal Ordinariates".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican religious institutes===
The apostolic constitution provides a juridical framework within which an Anglican religious community may join the Catholic Church as a group: “Institutes of Consecrated Life originating in the Anglican Communion and entering into full communion with the Catholic Church may also be placed under his (the ordinary's) jurisdiction by mutual consent.”&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic constitution, VII&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinary may also erect new societies of apostolic life and institutes of consecrated life with the permission of the Holy See.

===Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy===
The Catholic Church does not recognise the validity of Anglican ordination (see ''[[Apostolicae curae]]''), so all who were ordained in the Anglican Communion must receive ordination in the Catholic Church to continue their ministry.  The Apostolic Constitution reaffirms in principle the discipline of [[clerical celibacy]] for clergy of the [[Latin Church]], but allows ordination of married former Anglican clergy to the orders of deacon and priest in the service of an ordinariate: "Those who ministered as Anglican deacons, priests, or bishops, [...] may be accepted by the Ordinary as candidates for Holy Orders in the Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic constitution VI §1&lt;/ref&gt; "In consideration of Anglican ecclesial tradition and practice, the Ordinary may present to the Holy Father [the Pope] a request for the admission of married men to the presbyterate in the Ordinariate".&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, 6 §1; cf. Apostolic constitution, VI §2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This request is granted on a case-by-case basis,&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, 6 §2&lt;/ref&gt; not as a matter of course but by exception: "The norms established in the Encyclical Letter of Pope Paul VI ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_24061967_sacerdotalis_en.html Sacerdotalis coelibatus]'', n. 42 and in the Statement ''In June'' are to be observed."&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, 6 §1. The first document cited declares: "While, on the one hand, the law requiring a freely chosen and perpetual celibacy of those who are admitted to Holy Orders remains unchanged, on the other hand, a study may be allowed of the particular circumstances of married sacred ministers of Churches or other Christian communities separated from the Catholic communion, and of the possibility of admitting to priestly functions those who desire to adhere to the fullness of this communion and to continue to exercise the sacred ministry. The circumstances must be such, however, as not to prejudice the existing discipline regarding celibacy." The second, which is quoted in [http://www.usccb.org/seia/an16.pdf press release] of the United States Catholic Conference of 12 January 1982, states: "In accepting former Episcopal clergy who are married into the Catholic priesthood, the Holy See has specified that this exception to the rule of celibacy is granted in favor of these individual persons, and should not be understood as implying any change in the Church's conviction of the value of priestly celibacy, which will remain the rule for future candidates for the priesthood from this group." Furthermore, article 6 §2 of the complementary norms excludes exercise of sacred ministry in the ordinariates by those who were ordained in the Catholic Church and later became Anglicans.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of objective criteria determined by the ordinary in consultation with the episcopal conference and approved by the Holy See, the ordinary may petition the Pope, on a case-by-case basis, to admit married men to the priesthood as a derogation of canon 277 §1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PX.HTM canon 277 §1], Code of Canon Law. Retrieved 2009-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Code of Canon Law]], but the general rule is that the ordinariate will admit only celibate men.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, VI §2; complementary norms, 6 §1&lt;/ref&gt;  No married man may be ordained a bishop.

===Provisions for former Anglican bishops===
Ordination of married men to the episcopacy is excluded in the Catholic tradition, but the apostolic constitution's complementary norms include provisions which take into account the position of married former Anglican bishops.

* A married former Anglican bishop may be ordained as a priest, in the same manner as a married former Anglican priest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Apostolic Constitution, Art. VI. §1&lt;/ref&gt;
* A former Anglican bishop may be appointed as the ordinary and thus exercise ecclesiastical governance equivalent to that of a bishop.  If married, he will be ordained as a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, Art. 11 §1&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinary is, ''ex officio'', a full member of the [[episcopal conference]] regardless of the degree of holy orders to which he is ordained.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, Art. 2, §2&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ordinary may call upon a former Anglican bishop who is a member of the ordinariate to assist in its administration.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, article 11 §3&lt;/ref&gt;  This provision could encompass a role analogous to that of an auxiliary bishop within a diocese or as the "delegate" in charge of a "deanery".
* Any former Anglican bishop who is a member of an ordinariate may be invited to participate in the meetings of the [[episcopal conference]], with the status of a retired bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary Norms, article 11 §3&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition, a former Anglican bishop who has not been ordained a bishop in the Catholic Church may nonetheless receive permission to use episcopal insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Complementary norms, article 11 §4&lt;/ref&gt; This has precedent in the Catholic Church with cases of unordained abbots and abbesses.

Overall, these provisions provide considerable flexibility to preserve both the dignity of office and the opportunity for comparable pastoral leadership of former Anglican bishops who are not eligible for episcopal ordination in the Catholic Church.  Note that a former Anglican "diocese" with a married bishop could in fact remain intact as an "ordinariate" with its former bishop, ordained as a priest but granted permission to wear episcopal insignia, serving as its "ordinary".

==Similar institutions==
The personal ordinariates that the apostolic constitution envisages are similar to [[military ordinariate]]s for the pastoral care of members of armed forces in that membership is on a personal rather than a territorial basis; but they differ in many aspects, as can be seen by a comparison of ''Anglicanorum coetibus'' with the apostolic constitution ''Spirituali militum cura'' of 21 April 1986 by which [[Pope John Paul II]] restructured the military ordinariates, which were previously called military vicariates.&lt;ref&gt;The full text is available at [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19860421_spirituali-militum-curae_lt.html ''Spirituali militum cura'']&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the military ordinariates must be headed by a bishop and lack structures such as the "governing council" of the ordinariates for former Anglicans.&lt;ref name=Arrieta/&gt;&lt;ref name=ab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archtoronto.org/ordinariate/ac.htm The Implementation of ''Anglicanorum Coetibus'' in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108172112/http://www.archtoronto.org/ordinariate/ac.htm |date=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal ordinariates for former Anglicans differ also from [[personal prelature]]s (the only one existing now being [[Opus Dei]])&lt;ref name="Vatican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P10.HTM|title=Personal Prelatures cann. 294–297|date=|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which, according to canon law, "are composed of deacons and priests of the [[secular clergy]]"&lt;ref name="intratext.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PZ.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text - IntraText CT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; , to whose apostolic works lay people can dedicate themselves by way of agreements made with the prelature.&lt;ref name="intratext.com"/&gt; with no mention of members of [[religious institute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viana|first=A.|title=Personal Ordinariates and Personal Prelatures. Notes on a Doctrinal Dialogue|journal=Ius Canonicum|date=2012|volume=104|pages=481–520|url=http://prelaturaspersonales.org/personal-ordinariates-and-personal-prelatures-notes-on-a-doctrinal-dialogue/|issn=0021-325X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major difference between a "personal ordinariate" and a "personal prelature" is that ordinariates (both personal and military) may erect parishes and those who inscribe themselves in the apposite register effectively become transients in their geographic diocese (no accumulative membership).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=9164 Note of the CDF about personal ordinariates for Anglicans entering the Catholic Church], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of a personal ordinariate for former Anglicans extends to "lay faithful, clerics and members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, originally belonging to the Anglican Communion and now in full communion with the Catholic Church, or those who receive the Sacraments of Initiation within the jurisdiction of the Ordinariate".&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, I §4&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more similar are the eight [[ordinariate for the faithful of eastern rite|ordinariates for the faithful of eastern rite]], which are listed in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' together with the seventeen [[Exarch#Apostolic exarchates|apostolic exarchates]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), pp. 1029-1033&lt;/ref&gt; immediately before the ordinariates for former Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012, p. 1034&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ordinariates for the faithful of eastern rite, four (in Argentina, Brazil, France and Poland) are generically for all Eastern Catholics who lack an ordinary of their own rite with jurisdiction for the particular country and who are therefore entrusted to the care of a Latin archbishop in the country. The one in Austria is for Catholics belonging to any of the fourteen [[particular Church]]es that use the [[Byzantine Rite]]. The other three ([[Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Eastern Europe|Eastern Europe]], [[Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Greece|Greece]] and [[Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania|Romania]]) are for members of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. Such ordinariates have been in existence for a century, having been introduced by the apostolic letter ''Officium supremi Apostolatus'' of 15 July 1912.

===Comparisons with the Eastern Catholic churches===
While the personal ordinariates preserve a certain corporate identity of Anglicans received into the Catholic Church, they are canonically within the Latin Church and share the same theological emphasis and in this way differ from the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches, which are autonomous [[particular church]]es.&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;

The Latin Church, as a rule, restricts ordination to the priesthood to celibate men – and also to the diaconate except when, by decision of the episcopal conference, married men "of more mature age" (at least 35 years old) may be ordained to the diaconate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19670618_sacrum-diaconatus_en.html Motu proprio ''Sacrum diaconatus ordinem'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this also the ordinariates for former Anglicans differ from those Eastern Catholic churches in which priesthood and diaconate are open to married men as well as to celibates. The Holy See may grant exceptions for the ordinariates to the general rule on a case by case basis for married former Anglican clergy but not for married laymen.

===Prospect of personal ordinariates for Lutherans===
On 30 October 2012, Cardinal [[Kurt Koch]], President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]], said in an interview that if Lutherans express a wish for an arrangement similar to the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans, the Catholic Church will have to reflect on it, but that the initiative must come from Lutherans.&lt;ref name="Cardinal Koch Interview: Progressives and Traditionalists are in same hospital (German)"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Gerhard Ludwig Müller]], [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], commented on 11 January 2013 that, while the situation of Lutherans is different from that of Anglicans, the Holy See might consider an ordinariate for those among them who might wish to become members of the Catholic Church while retaining "the legitimate traditions they have developed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lutheran World Federation]] General Secretary, Martin Junge, expressed concern at the idea, saying that it would create further difficulties in ecumenical dialogue and discourage the commitment of Lutherans to celebrate in 2017 the 500th anniversary of the [[Protestant Reformation]] "in a spirit of ecumenical understanding and cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/lwf/index.php/gen-sec-on-lutheran-ordinariate-rcc.html LWF General Secretary on a Lutheran ordinariate within the Roman Catholic Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125012658/http://www.lutheranworld.org/lwf/index.php/gen-sec-on-lutheran-ordinariate-rcc.html |date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinariates have also been suggested for other communities in the Catholic Church, such as [[Hebrew Catholics]].

The '''reverse post-material thesis''' or '''reverse post-materialism thesis'''&lt;ref&gt;Carrolll, W. (2014) ''Far Right Parties and Movements in Europe, Japan, and the Tea Party in the U.S.: A Comparative Analysis, Journal of Power, Politics &amp; Governance, June 2014, Vol. 2, No. 2, p 220&lt;/ref&gt; is an academic theory used to explain support for [[far-right politics|far-right]] political parties and populist political parties. The thesis is modelled on the post-material thesis from sociology that has been used to explain the shift in Western societies from traditional economic interests towards issues such as environmentalism and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Pisoiu, D. and Ahmed, R. (2016), 'Capitalising on Fear: The Rise of Right-Wing Populist Movements in Western Europe', OSCE Yearbook 2015, Baden-Baden 2016, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Core premise==
The thesis begins from the premise that, during the 1970s and 1980s, mainstream{{when defined as|date=March 2018}} political parties embraced a [[postmaterialism|post-material agenda]], with less concern for traditional class and economic interests and greater concern for issues such as [[feminism]], [[environmentalism]], liberal internationalist values, and [[LGBT rights]] and other sexual freedoms. 

The reverse post-material thesis argues that individuals support such{{which|date=March 2018}} parties because they{{who|date=March 2018}} reject the post-material positions adopted by mainstream political parties, particularly centre-left{{when defined as|date=March 2018}} and progressive{{when defined as|date=March 2018}} political parties. According to this thesis, this post-material agenda, while more likely to appeal to the young and the more educated voters, is seen as irrelevant to material concerns, particularly of working-class unskilled males.&lt;ref&gt;Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel and Weinberg state that the material concerns of these voters will, if anything, have increased against a backdrop of [[globalisation]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Criticism==
[[Roger Eatwell]] argues that the reverse post-material thesis is insufficient to explain local variations in support for extreme-right parties — for instance, to explain why the [[British National Party]] did well in [[Oldham]] at the 2001 General Election but relatively poorly in neighbouring [[Blackburn]].&lt;ref&gt; See Eatwell, R. (2017) 'Ten Theories of the Extreme Right' in 'The Populist Radical Right: A Reader', Mudde, C. (ed), Routledge: Abingdon, pp. 409-410&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that, in Europe, post-material values are strongest in [[Germany]], [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Netherlands]], but as the extreme-right{{when defined as|date=March 2018}} is generally weaker in these countries,{{according to whom|date=March 2018}} the post-material thesis is insufficient on its own as an explanation for far-right support.&lt;ref&gt;Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Pisoiu and Ahmed argue tht the French National Front and Flemish Interest ([[Vlaams  Belang]]) in fact have an anti-materialist philosophy that prioritises political issues over economic concerns. &lt;ref&gt;Pisoiu, D. and Ahmed, R. (2016), 'Capitalising on Fear: The Rise of Right-Wing Populist Movements in Western Europe', OSCE Yearbook 2015, Baden-Baden 2016, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"&gt;Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010). The story of social identity. In T. Postmes &amp; N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theory assumes that the self can be categorized at various levels of abstraction. In other words, humans may categorize the self as a singular “I”(personal identity), or as a more inclusive “we”(social identity). In the latter case the self is cognitively grouped as identical and interchangeable to other stimuli within that category.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; It is argued that it is this variation in self categorization that underpins many intergroup phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; including those described in social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;

To demonstrate the notion of varying [[Principle of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and inclusiveness, three types of self category are often given as examples.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; The lowest level of abstraction is given as a personal self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “I”. A higher level of abstraction corresponds to a social self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “we” in comparison to a salient outgroup (them). A highest level of abstraction is represented by ''we humans'', where the salient outgroup is animals or other non-humans. A common misconception is that these three example categories represent ''the'' self categories that humans use. Instead, the theory posits that there are innumerable self categories that a perceiver may use (see, [[Self-categorization theory#Online category formation|online category formation]]), and in particular that there are a myriad of different personal and social identities that a perceiver may invoke in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds &amp; Turner (2006)."/&gt; The misconception may also be attributable to the early writing of Turner where a singular social identity was contrasted against a singular personal identity.&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Turner| first1=J.C.| editor-last  =Tajfel| editor-first =H.| year=1982| title=Toward a cognitive redefinition of the social group| journal=Social Identity and Intergroup Relations| pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however predates the formal statement of self-categorization theory.

====Accentuation====
In self-categorization theory, categorizing people does not simply involve the redescription of characteristics and categories present in social stimuli. Rather, salient ''social categories'' form the basis of a social world that is enriched with meaning. This is achieved through a non-conscious process of accentuation, where ''differences between'' social categories are accentuated along with the ''similarities within''  social categories.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = J. C. | last4 = McGarty | first4 = C. | year = 1995 | title = Social categorization and group homogeneity: Changes in the perceived applicability of stereotype content as a function of comparative context and trait favourableness | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 139–160 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1995.tb01054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting augmentation of social content allows the perceiver to interact with others with greater confidence and ease.

The accentuation component of self-categorization theory stems from prior research that demonstrated an [[accentuation effect]] for categorized non-social stimuli.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt; A prototypical example of non-social accentuation came from Tajfel and Wilkes, who found that when a categorization scheme corresponded to line length participants would view lines belonging to different categories as more different than if no categorization scheme was present.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Wilkes (1963)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajfel|first1=H.|last2=Wilkes|first2=A. L.|title=Classification and quantitative judgement|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1963|volume=54|issue=2|pages=101–114|pmid=13980241|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1963.tb00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the idea that an efficient cognitive system would, where possible, use the same systems regardless of the social or non-social nature of the stimuli,&lt;ref name="Van rooy et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Rooy | first1 = D. | last2 = Van Overwalle | first2 = F. | last3 = Vanhoomissen | first3 = T. | last4 = Labiouse | first4 = C. | last5 = French | first5 = R. | year = 2003 | title = A recurrent connectionist model of group biases | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 536–563 | pmid = 12885114 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.3.536| citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.3496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theorists have demonstrated similar effects for social stimuli. For example, Haslam and Turner found that a perceiver would describe another person as more or less similar to themselves as a function of the likely categorization scheme.&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | year = 1992 | title = Context-dependent variation in social stereotyping 2: The relationship between frame of reference, self-categorization and accentuation. | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 251–277 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depersonalization and self-stereotyping ===
According to self-categorization theory, depersonalization describes a process of [[Self-Stereotyping|self-stereotyping]]. This is where, under conditions of social category [[Self-categorization theory#Determinants of categorization|salience]] and consequent accentuation, “people come to see themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others”.&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt; Under these conditions a perceiver directly bases their behaviour and beliefs on the [[norm (social)|norms]], goals and needs of a salient ingroup.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981)."&gt;Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981). Interpersonal and intergroup behaviour. In J. C. Turner &amp; H. Giles (Eds.), Intergroup Behaviour (pp. 33-65). Oxford: Blackwell..&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person's salient self-category becomes 'army officer' then that person is more likely to act in terms of the norms associated with that category (e.g. to wear a uniform, follow orders, and distrust an enemy) and less likely to act in terms of other potential self-categories.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; Here the person can be said to be accentuating the similarities between his or herself and other members of the 'army officers' category.

Turner and colleagues stress that depersonalization is not a loss of self, but rather a ''redefinition'' of the self in terms of group membership.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; A depersonalized self, or a social identity, is every bit as valid and meaningful as a personalized self, or personal identity.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt; A loss of self is sometimes referred to using the alternative term [[deindividuation]]. Further, although the term [[depersonalization]] has been used in [[clinical psychology]] to describe a type of disordered experience, this is completely different from depersonalization in the sense intended by self-categorization theory authors.

The concept of depersonalization is critical to a range of group phenomena including social influence, social [[Stereotype|stereotyping]], in-group [[cohesiveness]], [[ethnocentrism]], intragroup [[cooperation]], [[altruism]], emotional [[empathy]], and the emergence of [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

===Determinants of categorization===
In self-categorization theory the formation and use of a social category in a certain context is predicted by an interaction between [[Self-categorization theory#Perceiver readiness|perceiver readiness]] and category-stimulus  fit. The latter being broken down into [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative fit]] and [[Self-categorization theory#Normative fit|normative fit]].&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voci|first=Alberto|title=Relevance of social categories, depersonalization and group processes: two field tests of self-categorization theory|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=73–90|doi=10.1002/ejsp.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; This predictive interaction was heavily influenced by [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner’s]] accessibility and fit formula.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruner (1957)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruner | first1 = J. S. | year = 1957 | title = On perceptual readiness | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 123–152 | pmid = 13420288 | doi=10.1037/h0043805}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social category that is currently in use is called a ''salient'' social category, and in the case of a self category is called a ''salient social identity''.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; The latter should not be confused with ''level of identification'', which is a component of perceiver readiness.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C. (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGarty | first1 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 173–176 | pmid = 11446223 | doi=10.1348/014466601164777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perceiver readiness====
Perceiver readiness, which Turner first described as ''relative accessibility'',&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; “reflects a person’s past experiences, present expectations, and current motives, values, goals and needs”.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; It is the relevant aspects of cognition that the perceiver brings to the environment. For example, a perceiver who categorizes frequently on the basis of nationality (e.g., “we [[Americans]]”) is, due to that past experience, more likely to formulate a similar self category under new conditions. Accordingly, ''social identification'', or the degree to which the group is valued and self-involving, may be  thought of as an important factor that affects a person’s readiness to use a particular social category.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;

====Comparative fit====

In Context 1 Amy and Beth self-categorize in terms of lower-level personal identities that accentuate their differences from each other. However, in Context 2 the comparative is extended to include more different others (here men), and Amy and Beth are now more likely to define themselves in terms of a higher-level social identity. They hence appear more similar to each other. The main theoretical point here is that as comparative context is extended, people tend to self-categorize at a more inclusive, higher level of abstraction.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;]]Comparative fit is determined by the meta-contrast principle—which states that people are more likely to believe that a collection of stimuli represents an entity to the degree that the differences between those stimuli are less than the differences between that collection of stimuli and other stimuli.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; For predicting whether a group will categorize an individual as an ingroup or outgroup member, the meta-contrast principle may be defined as the ratio of the average similarity of the individual to outgroup members over the average similarity of the individual to ingroup members. The meta-contrast ratio is dependent on the context, or frame of reference, in which the categorization process is occurring.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1999)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1999). Current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, &amp; B. Doosje (Eds), Social identity: Context, commitment, content (pp. 6-34) Oxford, UK. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the ratio is a comparison based on whichever stimuli are cognitively present. For example, if the frame of reference is reduced such that potential outgroup members are no longer cognitively present, ingroup members regard the individual as less similar to the group and are less likely to categorize that individual as belonging to that group.

====Normative fit====
Normative fit is the extent that the perceived behaviour or attributes of an individual or collection of individuals conforms to the perceiver’s knowledge-based expectations.&lt;ref name="Oakes, et al. (1994)"&gt;Oakes, P. J., Haslam, S. A. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1994). Stereotyping as social reality. Oxford, UK and Cambridge, MA:  Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, normative fit is evaluated with reference to the ''perceiver readiness'' component of the categorisation process.&lt;ref name="Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002)."&gt;Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002). The role of theories in the formation of stereotype content. In C. McGarty, V. Y. Yzerbyt &amp; R. Spears (Eds), Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the role of normative fit in categorization, although a collection of individuals may be categorized as an entity on the basis of ''comparative fit'', they are only labelled using the specific social category of “science students” if perceived as hard working. That is, they fit the normative content of that category.

===Online category formation===
Self-categorization theorists posit “self-categorization is comparative, inherently variable, fluid and context dependent.”&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; They reject the notion that self concepts are stored invariant structures that exist ready for application.&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1990)"/&gt; Where stability is observed in self perception this is not attributed to stored stable categories, but rather to stability in both the perceiver and the social context in which the perceiver is situated.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;McGarty, C. (1999). Categorization in social psychology. Sage Publications: London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; This variability is systematic and occurs in response to the changing context in which the perceiver is situated. As an example, the category of [[psychologists]] can be perceived quite differently if compared to [[physicists]] as opposed to [[artists]] (with variation perhaps on how [[Scientific method|scientific]] psychologists are perceived to be).&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; In self-categorization theory contextual changes to the salient social category are sometimes referred to as shifting [[Self-categorization theory#Prototypicality|prototypicality]].

Although the theory accepts that prior categorization behaviour impacts present perception (i.e., as part of perceiver readiness), self-categorization theory has key advantages over descriptions of social categorization where categories are rigid and invariant cognitive structures that are stored in comparative isolation prior to application. One advantage is that this perspective removes the [[implausibility]] of storing enough categorical information to account for all the nuanced categorization that humans use daily.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; Another advantage is that it brings social cognition in line with a [[Connectionism|connectionist approach]] to cognition.&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt; The connectionist approach is a neurologically plausible model of cognition where semantic units are not stored, but rather semantic information forms as a consequence of network pattern activation (both current and prior).&lt;ref name="Smith, E. R. (1996)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. R. | year = 1996 | title = What do connectionism and social psychology offer each other? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 893–912 | pmid = 8656338 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, E.

===Prototypicality===
In social psychology a category [[prototype]] may be thought of as a “representative exemplar” of a category.&lt;ref name="Billig, M. (1987)"&gt;Billig, M. (1987). Arguing and thinking: A rhetorical approach to social psychology: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization theory predicts that what is prototypical of a category is contingent on the context in which the category is encountered.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; More specifically, when the [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]] changes (i.e., the psychologically available stimuli change) this has implications for how the self category is perceived and the nature of subsequent [[Self-categorization theory#Depersonalization and self-stereotyping|depersonalization]].  Self-categorization theory predicts that individuals adopt the features of a salient self category (self-stereotyping), and the content of the category they adopt depends on the present comparative context.

An individual’s degree of prototypicality also varies in relation to changes in the comparative context, and self-categorization theory expects this to have direct implications for interpersonal phenomenon. Specifically, prototypicality plays an important role in the social identity approach to [[Social identity approach#Leadership|leadership]],&lt;ref name="Platow, M. J. et al. (1997)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platow | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Hoar | first2 = S. | last3 = Reid | first3 = S. Harley | last4 = Morrison | first4 = D. | last5 = Morrison | first5 = Dianne | year = 1997 | title = Endorsement of distributively fair and unfair leaders in interpersonal and intergroup situations | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 465–494 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199707)27:4&lt;465::aid-ejsp817&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; influence, and [[interpersonal attraction]]. For example, on interpersonal attraction, self-categorization theory states that "self and others are evaluated positively to the degree that they are perceived as prototypical (representative, exemplary, etc.) of the next more inclusive (positively valued) self-category of which they are being compared".&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

Levels of individual prototypicality may be gauged using the meta-contrast principle, and indeed it is this purpose the meta-contrast ratio is more often used for.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; Furthermore, although prototypicality is most often discussed in relation to the perception of individuals within a group, groups may also be assessed in terms of how prototypical they are of a superordinate category.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, M. (2012). Group status is related to group prototypicality in the absence of social identity concerns. ''Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 386–389. doi: 10.1080/00224545.2011.614648''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2011.614648 [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Social influence===
{{main|social influence}}

Self-categorization theory provides an account of social influence.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This account is sometimes referred to as the theory of ''referent informational influence''.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt; According to self-categorization theory, as social identities become salient, and depersonalization and self-stereotyping occurs, people adopt the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of fellow ingroup members. They also distance themselves from the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of comparison outgroup members. When someone observes a difference between themselves and a fellow ingroup member that person will experience subjective uncertainty. That uncertainty can be resolved by either a) recategorizing people or the situation to reflect those perceived differences, or b) engaging in a social influence process whereby one person makes changes to become more similar to the other. Which person adopts the views or behaviors of the other (i.e. who influences who) is predicted to be that person who is most prototypical of the ingroup. In other words, the person who exemplifies the norms, values, and behaviors of the ingroup the most. The self-categorization theory account of social influence has received a large amount of empirical support.&lt;ref name="McGarty &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = McGarty|first1 = C.|last2=Turner|first2=J.

Self-categorization theory’s account of social influence differs from other social psychological approaches to social influence. It rejects the traditional distinction between [[informational influence]] and [[normative influence]],&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | editor1-last = McGarty | editor1-first = C. | editor2-last = Haslam | editor2-first = S. A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The Message of Social Psychology | pages = 355–373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where informational influence involves the assessment of social information based on its merit and normative influence involves public compliance to the expectations of group members. For self-categorization theory social information does not have merit independent of self-categorization. Instead, information is perceived as valid to the extent that it is perceived to be a normative belief of the ingroup. Normative influence, on the other hand, is not normative at all. Rather, it is counter-normative influence based compliance to expectations of psychological outgroup members. In a similar vein self-categorization theory also challenges the distinction between objective reality testing and social reality testing (e.g. the [[elaboration likelihood model]]).&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Reynolds (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakes|first1=P. J.|last2=Reynolds|first2=R. J.|title=Asking the accuracy question: is measurement the answer?|journal=The Social Psychology of Stereotyping and Group Life|year=1997|pages=119–143|editor1-first=R.|editor1-last=Spears|editor2-first=P.J.|editor2-last=Oakes|editor3-first=N.|editor3-last=Ellemers|editor4-first=S.A.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Haslam}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that there is no such thing as objective reality testing isolated from social reality testing. Sensory data is always interpreted with respect of the beliefs and ideas of the perceiver, which in turn are bound up in the psychological group memberships of that perceiver.

===Out-group homogeneity===
{{main|Out-group homogeneity}}

Outgroup homogeneity can be defined as seeing the outgroup members as more homogeneous than ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization accounts for the outgroup homogeneity effect as a function of perceiver motivation and the resultant [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]],&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; which is a description of the psychologically available stimuli at any one time. The theory argues that when perceiving an outgroup the psychologically available stimuli include both ingroup and outgroup members. Under these conditions the perceiver is more likely to categorize in accordance with ingroup and outgroup memberships and is consequently naturally motivated to [[Self-categorization theory#Accentuation|accentuate]] intergroup differences as well as intragroup similarities. Conversely, when perceiving an ingroup the outgroup members may not be psychologically available. In such circumstances there is no ingroup-outgroup categorization and thus no accentuation. Indeed, accentuation of intragroup differences may occur under these circumstances for the same sense making reasons.

In line with this explanation it has been shown that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup is perceived as more homogeneous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup is perceived as comparatively [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1996)."&gt;Halsam, S. A., Oakes, P. J., Turner, J. C., &amp; McGarty, C. (1995). Social identity, self-categorization and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: the interaction between social motivation and cognition. In R. M. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Handbook of Motivation and Cognition (Vol. 3, pp. 182-222). New York: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; This is also congruent with depersonalization, where under certain circumstances perceivers may see themselves as interchangeable members of the ingroup.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title= Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=1 August 2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-categorization theory eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Meta-theoretical debate===
The social identity approach explicitly rejects the metatheory of research that regards limited information processing as the cause of social stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McGarty|first= C. |year= 2002|title= Stereotype formation as category formation |journal= Stereotypes as Explanations |pages= 16–37 |editor1-first= C.|editor1-last= McGarty |editor2-first= V.Y. |editor2-last= Yzerbyt |editor3-first= R. |editor3-last= Spears }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oakes | first1 = Penny | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | editor-last = Stroebe | editor-first = Wolfgang | editor-link1= Wolfgang Stroebe|editor2-last = Hewstone | editor2-first = Miles | year = 1990 | title = Is limited information processing capacity the cause of social stereotyping? | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 111–135 | doi=10.1080/14792779108401859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, where other researchers adopt the position that stereotyping is second best to other information processing techniques (e.g.,  individuation), social identity theorists argue that in many contexts a stereotypical perspective is entirely appropriate. Moreover, it is argued that in many intergroup contexts to take an individualistic view would be decidedly maladaptive and demonstrate ignorance of important social realities.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."/&gt;

===Category hierarchies===
Self-categorization theory emphasises the role of category hierarchies in social perception.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; That is, much like a biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], social groups at lower [[Self-categorization theory#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] are subsumed within social groups at higher levels of abstraction. A useful example comes from the world of [[team sport]]s, where a particular social group such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] [[Fan (person)|fans]] may be an ingroup for a perceiver who may compare with a relevant outgroup (e.g., [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans). However, at a higher level of abstraction, both social groups may be subsumed into the singular category of [[Association football|football]] fans. This is known as a superordinate category, and in this context those Liverpool fans once considered outgroup members are now considered fellow ingroup members. The new salient outgroup might instead be [[Rugby union|rugby]] fans. Awareness of category hierarchies has led to the development of the [[common ingroup identity]] model. This model suggests that conflict at one level of abstraction (e.g., between Manchester United fans and Liverpool fans) might be ameliorated by making salient a more inclusive superordinate ingroup.&lt;ref name=" (1993)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaertner | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dovidio | first2 = J. F. | last3 = Anastasio | first3 = P. A. | last4 = Bachman | first4 = B. A. | last5 = Rust | first5 = M. C. | year = 1993 | title = The common ingroup identity model: Recategorization and the reduction of intergroup bias | url = | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1080/14792779343000004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted, however, that very few social groups can be described in hierarchical terms. For example, [[Catholics|Catholic people]] in [[Germany]] cannot be always considered a subordinate category of Germans, as there are Catholic people throughout the globe. McGarty proposes that the theory's use of hierarchies as an organizing principle must be relaxed. The alternative proposition is that social psychologists should look to [[Venn diagram|Venn]]-like structures for descriptions of social structure.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C.

In R. J. Crisp and M. Hewstone (Eds.), Multiple Social Categorization: Processes Models and Applications (pp. 25-49). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The awareness of crossed cutting social categories has allowed for the development of further intergroup conflict reduction strategies.&lt;ref name=" (2006)."&gt;Dovidio.

Multiple social categorization: Processes, models and application (pp, 65-89). . New York: Psychology Press. .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation in the theory===
Brewer and Brown describe self-categorization theory as a “version of social identity theory” that is heavily cognitive and is not attentive to many motivational and affective processes.&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Brown (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Brown | first2 = R. J. | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = D. T. | editor2-last = Fiske | editor2-first = S. T. | editor3-last = Lindzey | editor3-first = G. | year = 1998 | title = Intergroup relations | journal = The Handbook of Social Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 554–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Reynolds, in response to this style of commentary, counter that describing self-categorization theory as a replacement to social identity theory is an error, and that self-categorization theory was always intended to complement social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Turner | first1 = John C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 =Katherine J. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = Rupert  | editor2-last = Gaertner | editor2-first = Sam L. | year = 2001 | chapter = The Social Identity Perspective in Intergroup Relations: Theories, Themes, and Controversies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNZHf3K4xzMC&amp;pg=PA133 | title = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNZHf3K4xzMC | volume = 3 | issue = 1 |isbn=978-0-470-69270-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Reynolds also argue that such commentary unreasonably discounts the motivational concerns that are articulated in self-categorization theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt; For example, the motivation to maintain positive self categories and the motivation to achieve ingroup consensus.&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Smith's Bible Dictionary''''', originally named ''A Dictionary of the Bible'', is a 19th-century [[Bible]] dictionary containing upwards of four thousand entries that became named after its editor, [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]. Its popularity was such that condensed dictionaries appropriated the title, "Smith's Bible Dictionary".

The original dictionary was published as a three-volume set in 1863, in London and [[Boston, USA]]. This was followed by ''A Concise Dictionary of the Bible'' (1865), intended for the general reader and students, and ''A Smaller Dictionary of the Bible'' (1866), for use in schools. ''A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible'' (1868), was published simultaneously in London and New York, and a four-volume ''Dictionary of the Bible'' (1871), was published in Boston, amongst other things incorporating the appendices of the first edition into the main body of the text.

In the UK, a corresponding second edition of the first volume in two parts, edited by Smith and [[J. M. Fuller]], was published in 1893.

The original publications are now in the [[public domain]]; some derivative, commercial versions are still in copyright.

One of the contributors to the dictionary was [[George Edward Post]] (of the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB)).&lt;ref&gt; Robert E. Thompson. {{Google books|KV6vCwAAQBAJ|A History of the Presbyterian Churches in the United States|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stock photography''' is the supply of [[photographs]], which are often licensed for specific uses.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; The stock photo industry, which began to gain hold in the 1920s,&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; has established models including traditional macrostock photography,&lt;ref name="imacrostock"/&gt; midstock photography,&lt;ref name="hgrunbaum"/&gt; and [[microstock photography]].&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; Conventional stock agencies charge from several hundred to several thousand [[United States dollar]]s per image, while microstock photography may sell for around USD 25 cents.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; Professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a [[Commission (remuneration)|contractual basis]],&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; while stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers through online submission.&lt;ref name="lstockphoto"/&gt;

Themes for stock photos are diverse, although Megan Garber of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote in 2012 that "one of the more wacky/wondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which, as a genre, they've developed a unifying editorial sensibility. To see a stock image is... to ''know'' you're seeing a stock image."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto"/&gt; Historically notable traditional stock photo agencies have included [[RobertStock]], the [[Bettman Archive]] in New York,&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; and the [[Hulton Archive]] in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="getty"/&gt; among many others.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; In the 1990s companies such as [[Photodisc]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] began selling [[CD ROM]]s with packs of images, pioneering the [[royalty free]] licensing system at a time when [[rights managed]] licensing was the norm in the stock industry.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt;  There was a great amount of consolidation among stock photo agencies&lt;ref name = Howto16/&gt;&lt;ref name="page8MichaelHeron"/&gt; between 1990 and the mid-2000s, particularly through [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]] and [[Getty Images]].&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; The early microstock company [[iStockphoto]] was founded in May 2000,&lt;ref name="ST-05-28-07"/&gt; followed by companies such as [[Dreamstime]],&lt;ref name="Microstock Insider"/&gt; [[fotoLibra]],&lt;ref name="news:picture_perfect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news:new_approach"/&gt; [[Can Stock Photo]],&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; [[Shutterstock]], and [[Fotolia]].&lt;ref name="CNN Money"/&gt;

==History==

===First stock photo companies (1920-1930s)===
[[File:1911 Solvay conference.jpg|thumb|A stock photograph, now in the archive of [[Getty Images]], showing the 1911 [[Solvay Conference]] in [[Belgium]]. Many stock photos document historical events.]]

Newspapers and magazines were first able to reproduce photographs instead of [[line art]] in the mid-1880s with the invention of the [[half-tone]] and its use on a [[printing press]].&lt;ref name = Howto13/&gt;  Initially starting with staff photographers, eventually, independent free-lance photographers took over.&lt;ref name = Howto13/&gt; One of the first examples of a stock photo was circa 1920 when American photographer [[Retrofile|H. Armstrong Roberts]] ensured the people photographed in "Group in Front of Tri-Motor Airplane" all signed model releases. This allowed the photograph and others like it to be commercially viable.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; In an effort to save the cost of hiring photographers for commission-based [[photo shoots]], publishers and advertisers began to consider stock photos as a less risky alternative.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; One of the [[RobertStock|first major stock photography libraries]]&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; was founded in 1920 by H. Armstrong Roberts.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The [[Bettman Archive]] in New York is an example of an early traditional stock agency,&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; with the company delivering photos upon 24-hour request to magazines such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; Founded in 1936 by [[Otto Bettmann]], a [[Germany|German]] [[curator]] who emigrated to the United States in 1935,&lt;ref name="journalfilmquarl"/&gt; the Bettman Archive began with Bettmann's personal collection of 15,000 images which he brought with him in suitcases when he escaped from [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="ah-goodbye"/&gt; He actively expanded his collection by placing ads in magazines for stills and photos.&lt;ref name="journalfilmquarl"/&gt; A different early pioneer with the stock industry was photographer Tony Stone, whose portfolio of mountain scenes proved popular with chocolate advertisers. Stone's stock library eventually reached 20,000 images, each selected for its likelihood to sell multiple copies.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt;

===New indexing systems and growth (1940s-1980s)===
Known as a stock resource for newspapers and magazines, the [[Hulton Archive]] started as the photographic archive of ''[[Picture Post]]''. As the archive expanded through [[World War II]], it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives were becoming an important historical documentary resource. In 1945, [[Edward George Warris Hulton|Sir Edward Hulton]] set up the Hulton Press Library as a semi-independent operation and commissioned [[Charles Gibbs-Smith]] of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications. The Gibbs-Smith system claims to be the world’s first indexing system for pictures, and it was eventually adopted by the [[British Museum]] collections.&lt;ref name="getty"/&gt;

===Expansion and transition online (1980s-1990s)===

By the 1980s, stock photography had become a specialty in its own right, with the stock industry advancing quickly.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; As photo libraries transitioned from physical [[archive]]s to servers in the mid-1990s, "stock libraries" were increasingly called "stock agencies."&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; The archives also began to rely increasingly on [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] for sorting and retrieving photographs.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; In 1991 [[Photodisc]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] began selling [[CD ROM]]s with packs of images. Unlike their competitors, Photodisc licensed the image packs as [[Royalty Free]]. In contrast to the [[Rights Managed]] system, royalty free allowed the purchaser of a CD ROM to use the images as many times as they liked without paying further fees.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt;

There was a great amount of consolidation among stock photo agencies&lt;ref name = Howto16/&gt;&lt;ref name="page8MichaelHeron"/&gt; between 1990 and the mid-2000s, with [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]] notably acquiring the massive [[Bettmann Archive]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; After [[Photodisc]] went online in 1995,&lt;ref name="photodisconline"/&gt; in September 1997, PhotoDisc agreed to combine with [[London]]-based Getty Communications to form the Seattle-based [[Getty Images]].&lt;ref name="imagiseverything"/&gt; In 1996, the [[Picture Post#Hulton Press Library|Hulton Picture Collection]] was bought by Getty Images for £8.6 million.&lt;ref name="image-ethics"/&gt;

[[Alamy]] (registered as Alamy Limited) is a privately owned stock photography agency launched in 1999. Alamy maintains an online archive of over hundred million still [[image]]s, illustrations and hundreds of thousands of videos contributed by agencies and independent photographers or collected from news archives, museums and national collections. Its suppliers include both professional and amateur [[photographers]], stock agencies, news archives, museums and national collections. Its clients are from the [[photography]], publishing and advertising industries and the general public.

===Recent developments (2000-present)===
The early microstock company [[iStockphoto]] was founded in May 2000. Originally a free stock imagery website, it transitioned into its current [[micropayment]] model in 2001.&lt;ref name="ST-05-28-07"/&gt; [[iStockphoto]] co-founders [[Bruce Livingstone]] and Brianna Wettlaufer then went on to start [[Stocksy United]] in 2013. Helping pioneer the subscription-based model of stock photography,&lt;ref name="Smart Money 02-04-2009"/&gt; [[Shutterstock]] was founded in 2003 with a monthly subscription fee.&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013"/&gt; Online since 2000 as a [[Royalty-free|royalty free]] stock photography website, in 2004 [[Dreamstime]]&lt;ref name="Microstock Insider"/&gt; was founded as new microstock agency.&lt;ref name="CNN Money"/&gt; Other stock agencies with new business models around this time included [[fotoLibra]], which opened to the public in 2005,&lt;ref name="news:picture_perfect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news:new_approach"/&gt; and [[Can Stock Photo]], which debuted in 2004.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; By 2007 Dreamstime was competing with Istockphoto, [[Fotolia]] and Shutterstock, all expanded into major microstock companies.&lt;ref name="CNN Money"/&gt; In March 2013 microstock company [[Depositphotos]] launched Clashot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selling-stock.com/Article/depositphotos-launches-clashot-mobile-applica|title=Depositphotos Launches Clashot: Mobile Application|last=|first=|date=15 March 2016|website=Selling Stock|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a service that allows smartphone users instantly upload photos to the photobank from their devices following by [[Fotolia]] that launched very similar Fotolia Instant &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/07/stock-photos-site-fotolia-launches-fotolia-instant-an-app-for-selling-your-smartphone-photos/|title=Stock Photos Site Fotolia Launches Fotolia Instant, An App For Selling Your Smartphone Photos|last=|first=|date=7 October 2013|website=Techcrunch|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; later that year.

Between the 1990s and the mid-2000s, [[Bill Gates]]' [[Corbis Images]] and Getty Images combined purchased more than 40 stock photo agencies.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; iStockphoto, or iStock.com, was acquired by Getty in 2006.&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; In February 2009,&lt;ref name="getty-feb"/&gt; [[Jupitermedia Corporation]] sold their online stock images division, Jupiterimages, to Getty Images for $96 million in cash,&lt;ref name="reuters-jupiter"/&gt; including the sites [[stock.xchng]] and [[StockXpert]].&lt;ref name="getty-feb"/&gt; In 2005 [[Scoopt]] started a photo news agency for [[citizen journalism]] enabling the public to upload and sell breaking news images taken with cameraphones. In 2007 Scoopt was purchased by Getty Images, which closed it in 2009.&lt;ref name="shuttingscoopt"/&gt; In 2012 Shutterstock became the first microstock agency to complete an [[initial public offering]],&lt;ref name="shutterstock-ipo"/&gt; with the company's shares reaching a $2.5 billion market value by late 2013.&lt;ref name="Forbes-10-28-2013"/&gt; The stock photo company [[Fotolia]] announced that it would be acquired by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] for $800 million on December 11, 2014.&lt;ref name="cfotoliaacquired"/&gt;

==Description==
Stock photography refers to the supply of [[photographs]], which are often licensed for specific uses such as magazine publishing or pamphlet-making.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', as of 2005, "most" book cover designers prefer stock photography agencies over photographers in efforts to save costs. Publishers can then purchase photographs on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.&lt;ref name="gmorethanapage"/&gt;

Established models of stock photography include:
# Macrostock: High-priced and exclusive stock photography, also known as traditional stock photography&lt;ref name="imacrostock"/&gt;
# Midstock: Stock photography priced between micro stock and macro stock which is often used online&lt;ref name="hgrunbaum"/&gt;
# [[microstock photography|Microstock]]: Low-priced and inclusive stock photography. In competition to traditional agencies, microstock photography is a relatively new model of stock photography which is available through agencies that sell images for lower prices but in greater volume.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', conventional stock agencies charge from several hundred to several thousands American dollars per image, and "base fees on the published size of an image, circulation and other factors." Microstock photos may sell for as little as USD 25 cents.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; Professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis, with a defined commission basis and specified contract term. The industry standard is purportedly 30 to 50 percent to the photographer, although at the start of the stock photography industry, fees were typically cut half and half between the agency and artist.&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; Other stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers through online submission.&lt;ref name="lstockphoto"/&gt;

Some online photo websites have created unique software to search for fitting stock photos, for example searching for complicated keyword combinations, color, shapes, and "moods."&lt;ref name="bestentrej"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kpopsi"/&gt; Other search engines may seek to quantify the best photos by looking for elements as diverse as "bright lights," "evidence of emotional connections between people," and the tilt of faces.&lt;ref name="aforhtemost"/&gt;
&lt;!--

Some stock photography sites{{who|date=September 2015}} offer low-resolution photography free for the purpose of preparing advertising [[comprehensive layout|comps]] to demonstrate a design. If the advertiser decides to use the image, the rights to use the high-resolution image then can be negotiated or purchased directly from the website. Most comps are [[digital watermarking|watermarked]] with the name of the photo agency in question (usually either across the image, covering the image in a grid, or in the top left or bottom right of the image). The point is that the watermark cannot be removed with traditional photo-editing programs and removing it would cost more than buying the image. However, the photo agency [[Thinkstock]] uses 'image packs' - groups of high-resolution, watermarkfree, low-priced (all the images - an unlimited number - cost as much as one image conventionally costs) images chosen by one user for use by them. As Thinkstock mostly consists of images from [[Getty Images]], [[iStock]], [[Comstock (library)|Comstock]], [[PhotoDisc]], [[Photos.com]] and other Thinkstock sister agencies, these images are easily available for image packs.{{OR|date=October 2015}}

Professional stock photographers place their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis, with a defined commission basis, and for a specified contract term. Some photographers{{who|date=September 2015}} fund their own photo shoots or develop imagery in cooperation with an agency, while others{{who|date=September 2015}} submit photographs originally produced as part of editorial (magazine) or commercial assignments.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
--&gt;

===Styles and trends===

Traditional stock photo agencies have large catalogues that may include press archives and works by notable photographers such as [[Bert Hardy]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Weegee]] and [[Ernst Haas]].&lt;ref name="hulton_archive"/&gt; More recent trends in [[microstock photography]] include "lifestyle" photographs of people "at work and play,"&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; food, sports, and fashion.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; Other stock photo themes may include [[stereotype]]s, expressing common emotions and [[gesticulation]]s, [[pet]]s,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and images related to travel and tourism.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the early 1990s, the stock industry focused on "[[conceptual photography|conceptual images]]," which could encapsulate themes such as "global communication, success, and teamwork."&lt;ref name="dalamaybrief"/&gt; After the consolidation of many stock photo agencies in the 1990s and early 2000s, new companies began focusing on "niche collections" including "medical, science, minorities, gay and lesbian lifestyles, aviation, maps, [[panoramic]], historical, sports, and celebrity homes."&lt;ref name="fbookonstockphotography"/&gt; Opined Megan Garber of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2012, "one of the more wacky/wondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which, as a genre, they've developed a unifying editorial sensibility. To see a stock image is, [[Potter Stewart]]-style, to ''know'' you're seeing a stock image. And while stock images' stockiness may be in part due to the common visual tropes that give them their easy, cheesy impact - prettiness, preciousness, pose-iness -  there's part of it that's more ephemeral, too. Though they have little in common, shots of a [[German Shepherd]] typing on a laptop and a man contemplating the sunset can both be, in their special way, stocky."&lt;ref name="lstockphoto"&gt;

==Types of stock photo licenses==

===Public domain (PD)===
{{main|Public domain image resources}}
[[File:Downtown Chicago Marina City CornCob Sky Scrapers.jpg|thumb|Example of a public domain stock photo, showing the Marina City building complex in [[Chicago]].]]
In relation to photography and graphics, [[public domain]] (PD) means the image is free to use without purchasing a license, and can be used for commercial or personal purposes. Works in the public domain are those whose [[Exclusive right|exclusive]] [[intellectual property]] rights have expired,&lt;ref name="Boyle 2008 38"/&gt; have been forfeited,&lt;ref name="Graber 2008 173"/&gt; or are inapplicable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/unprotected.html unprotected] on bitlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royalty-free (RF)===
{{main|Royalty-free}}
In photography and the [[illustration]] industry, royalty-free (RF) refers to a [[copyright]] license where the user has the right to use the picture without many restrictions based on one-time payment to the licensor. The user can, therefore, use the image in several projects without having to purchase any additional licenses. RF licenses cannot be given on an exclusive basis. In stock photography, RF is one of the common licenses sometimes contrasted with [[Rights Managed]] licenses and often employed in [[Subscription business model|subscription-based]] or [[microstock photography|microstock]] photography business models.&lt;ref name="focalgoogle353"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Due to confusion with those definitions, the name is often considered misleading/[[false advertising]].{{OR|date=October 2015}} --&gt;
&lt;!--
* Pay a one-time fee to use the image multiple times for multiple purposes (with limits).
* No time limit on when the buyer can use an image.
* No one can have exclusive rights of a Royalty-free image (the photographer can sell the image as many times as he or she wants).
* A royalty-free image usually has a limit to how many times the buyer can reproduce it. For example, a license might allow the buyer to print 500,000 brochures with the purchased image. The amount of copies made is called the [[print run]]. The buyer is required to pay a fee per brochure, usually 1 to 3 cents, for additional prints. Magazines with a large print run cannot use a standard royalty-free license and therefore they either purchase images with a rights-managed license or have in-house photographers.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
--&gt;

===Rights-managed (RM)===
{{main|Rights Managed}}
Rights Managed (RM) in the stock photo industry (sometimes called "licensed images") refers to a [[copyright]] license which, if purchased by a user, allows the one-time use of the photo as specified by the license. If the user wants to use the photo for other uses an additional license needs to be purchased. RM licenses can be given on a non-exclusive or exclusive basis. In stock photography RM is one of the two common license types together with [[royalty-free]], subscription and [[microstock photography]] being business models often confused as separate license types (both use the [[royalty-free]] license type).&lt;ref name="microstockfocalenc"/&gt;
&lt;!--
* The value of a license is determined by the use of the image, which is generally broken down along these lines;
**'''Usage:''' (e.g. Advertising, corporate or editorial)
**'''Specific use:''' (e.g. Billboard, annual report, newspaper article)
**'''Duration:''' (e.g. One month, two months, one year, two years etc.)
**'''Print run:''' (e.g. up to 10,000, up to 1m)
**'''Territory:''' (e.g.; USA, Europe, UK, Germany, or whatever combination of territories are required)
**'''Size:''' (how big is the image to be used - 1/4 page, 1/2 page, full page, or double page spread)
**'''Industry:''' (Industry type - e.g. consumer electronics, marine engineering, financial services)
**'''Exclusivity:''' (Exclusive or non-exclusive)
* The terms of the license are clearly defined and negotiated so that the purchaser receives maximum value, and is protected in their purchase by a certain level of exclusivity.
* Rights-managed licenses provide assurance that an image will not be used by someone else in a conflicting manner. The agreement can include exclusivity and usually recognizes that this represents added value. Not all rights-managed licenses are exclusive, that must be stipulated in the agreement.
* A rights-managed image usually allows a much larger print run per image than a royalty-free license.
* Editorial is a form of rights-managed license when there are no releases for the subjects. Since there are no releases the images cannot be used for advertising or to depict controversial subjects, only for news or educational purposes.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
--&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In March 2015, [[Vince Vaughn]] and the cast for the film ''[[Unfinished Business (2015 film)|Unfinished Business]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] and several stock photo agencies teamed up to create press material that satirized the stereotypical style of business-themed stock photos.&lt;ref name="bvinceunfished"&gt;People often use stock photos in memes because of what is perceived as sadness in sarcasm depicted on the model's face.

==History==

===Identity and communication===
The Jester first appeared on Twitter, where he announced his attack on the Taliban website alemarah.info on January 1, 2010.  On June 26, 2010, he established his [[WordPress]] blog "Jester's Court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://th3j35t3r.wordpress.com/2010/06/26/maybe-i-might-setup-a-blog-here/ |title=Maybe I might setup a blog here?? |author=th3j35t3r |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jester also communicates via his [[I2P]] [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel #jester and cautions these are the only three authentic methods of communication from him:  "As per usual, because of the large amount of imposters trying to pass themselves off as me I will only speak in THREE places, here via this blog, my twitter and the i2p IRC network outlined above where my nick (th3j35t3r) is registered to myself. If you see a ‘jester’ anywhere else it’s not me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://th3j35t3r.wordpress.com/irc-channel/ |title=IRC Channel |author=th3j35t3r |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of 2017 Jester set up an instance of the [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon social networking server]], named Counter Social, where he continues to use the alias @th3j35t3r.

===Military service===
The Jester had stated that he was a former soldier and had served in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt; A former defense operative claimed that The Jester was a former military contractor involved in [[United States Special Operations Command|US Special Operations Command]] projects.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; On April 10, 2012, The Jester gave a live chat interview to a class of Computer Science students at the [[University of Southern Maine]] where he confirmed his military service and stated he served four "operational tours".&lt;ref name="infosecisland5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcript: Patriot Hacker th3j35t3r Addresses USM Students |url=http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/20975-Transcript-Patriot-Hacker-th3j35t3r-Addresses-USM-Students.html |newspaper=Infosec Island |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===XerXeS and other tools===
The Jester claims to have originally developed his [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS script]] as a means to test and [[Hardening (computing)|harden]] servers.&lt;ref name="infosecisland1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jester Unveils XerXeS Automated DoS Attack |first=Anthony M. |last=Freed |url=https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/2882-Jester-Unveils-XerXeS-Automated-DoS-Attack.html |newspaper=Infosec Island |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After learning from an article that Jihadists were using the Internet to recruit and coordinate terror [[clandestine cell system|cells]], The Jester resolved to disrupt online communications between Jihadists.&lt;ref name="infosecisland2"&gt;{{cite news |title=More Talks with Anti-Jihadi Hacker The Jester |first=Anthony M. |last=Freed |url=https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/2805-More-Talks-with-Anti-Jihadi-Hacker-The-Jester.html |newspaper=Infosec Island |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He weaponized his script and created a front-end known as "XerXeS"&lt;ref name="sourcecode"&gt;{{cite news |title=XerXeS source code |first=Laurelai |last=Bailey |url=http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jul/94 |newspaper=SecLists.Org Security Mailing List |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to solve the script's usability problems.&lt;ref name="infosecisland1"/&gt;

===Hacking history===
On January 1, 2010, The Jester began a campaign against [[Jihadist]] websites. His first target was alemarah.info, which was the [[Taliban]]'s website at the time.&lt;ref name="welt1"&gt;{{cite interview |subject=th3j35t3r |interviewer=Florian Flade |title=Hacker macht Jagd auf Online-Dschihadisten |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article8236634/Hacker-macht-Jagd-auf-Online-Dschihadisten.html |date=2010-06-30 |work=[[Die Welt]] |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=th3j35t3r |interviewer=Florian Flade |title=Unredacted Original Interview with Newspaper ‘Die Welt’ |url=http://th3j35t3r.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/unredacted-original-interview-with-die-welt-english/ |date=2010-06-30 |work=th3j35t3r.wordpress.com |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60T0NE20100130 |title=Afghan Taliban deny meeting U.N. envoy |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2010, The Jester posted several tweets claiming to be responsible for the downtime WikiLeaks was experiencing.&lt;ref name="dailycaller1"/&gt; He justified his alleged attacks by claiming that WikiLeaks was "attempting to endanger the lives of our [US] troops, 'other assets' &amp;amp; foreign relations."&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; In retaliation to The Jester's reported efforts, hacktivists including a group named [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] in support of WikiLeaks were reported as [[Operation Payback|temporarily disrupting the website of MasterCard]] as well as attacking websites of Amazon and PayPal.&lt;ref&gt;David Leigh, Luke Harding [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/02/wikileaks-cyber-attacks-tango-jester WikiLeaks cyber attacks: a tango with the Jester] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2010, someone claiming to be The Jester stated that he had been raided by the U.S. and attempted to solicit money for legal fees. The Jester purported that the person was an impostor, though writers at InfoSecIsland believe the hoax was created by The Jester himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/9970-Did-WikiLeaks-Hacker-The-Jester-Pull-Police-Raid-Hoax.html |title=Did WikiLeaks Hacker The Jester Pull Police Raid Hoax? |publisher=Infosecisland.com |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Bob |url=http://redtape.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/07/6345517-wikileaks-hacker-a-villain-or-a-hero |title=Red Tape - WikiLeaks hacker a villain or a hero? |publisher=Redtape.msnbc.msn.com |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2010, a DoS attack targeted [[4chan|4chan.org]]. On that same day, The Jester tweeted "4chan.org&amp;nbsp;— that looks like a TANGO DOWN (not) maybe you guys pissed off the wrong person trying to (wrongly) ID me?"&lt;ref name="dailycaller1"/&gt; This tweet is believed to be a reference to claims by 4chan users that The Jester was a man from [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="dailycaller1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="praetorianprefect1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous Turns Operation Payback Toward "The Jester" |author=Prefect |url=http://praetorianprefect.com/archives/2010/12/anonymous-turns-operation-payback-toward-the-jester/ |newspaper=Praetorian Prefect |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2011, The Jester began a DoS attack on several sites belonging to the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] for celebrating the death of homosexual U.S. service men.&lt;ref&gt;(2011-03-24) [https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12683-Hacktivist-Maintains-Attack-on-Westboro-Baptist-Church.html "Hacktivist Maintains Attack on Westboro Baptist Church"] Retrieved 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, The Jester employed a different style of attack by using an [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]] vulnerability to make it appear as if fabricated articles were inserted online Libyan newspapers ''The Malta Independent Online'' and the ''Tripoli Post''. On March 28, 2011, he tweeted links to the forged articles. The articles were not visible in search, or to viewers of those websites, and viewable only via the inserted links. These tweets drew the attention of Anthony M. Freed, who examined the articles and discovered they were anomalies not contained in the newspapers' respective archives.&lt;ref name="infosecisland3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Patriot Hacker The Jester's Libyan Psyops Campaign |first=Anthony |last=Freed |url=https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12745-Patriot-Hacker-The-Jesters-Libyan-Psyops-Campaign.html |newspaper=Infosec Island |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further inspection by Freed revealed The Jester left a watermark of his signature Harlequin avatar on the articles he created, which can only be seen by tilting the computer monitor back at an angle. The fabricated articles reported degradation in troop morale among fighters loyal to [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and incidents of his soldiers abandoning their posts. Freed concluded The Jester's objective was a "psyops campaign aimed at breaking the spirit of the troops loyal to Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi."&lt;ref name="infosecisland3"/&gt; The Jester confirmed this in a subsequent interview later the same year.&lt;ref name="infosecisland4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacktivist "The Jester" Draws Crowd at Hacker Halted |url=https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/17784-Hacktivist-The-Jester-Draws-Crowd-at-Hacker-Halted.html |newspaper=Infosec Island |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 The Jester vowed to find and expose members of [[LulzSec]].&lt;ref name=damon&gt;{{cite news |last=Poeter |first=Damon |title=Will LulzSec's Hit on Arizona Cops be its Last Hurrah? |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387566,00.asp |accessdate=25 June 2011 |newspaper=[[PC Magazine]] |date=24 June 2011 |agency=[[Ziff Davis]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zh16iRcx |archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to obtain and publish [[personally identifiable information]] of key members within group, whom he described as "childish".&lt;ref name=enemies&gt;{{cite news |last=Halliday |first=Josh |title=LulzSec: the members and the enemies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/24/lulzsec-members-and-enemies |accessdate=25 June 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 June 2011 |agency=[[Guardian Media Group]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zh27Q4f6 |archivedate=25 June 2011 |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, 2011, he claimed to have revealed the identity of LulzSec leader Sabu as Xavier Kaotico, an [[Information technology consulting|information technology consultant]] possibly from [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chapman |first=Stephen |title=LulzSec's leader, Sabu, revealed? |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/lulzsecs-leader-sabu-revealed/8905 |accessdate=25 June 2011 |newspaper=[[ZDNet]] |date=24 June 2011 |agency=[[CBS Interactive]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zh1hqAmI |archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of the same year he falsely accused Hugo Carvalho, a Portuguese IT professional, of also being Sabu, leaving The Jester's outing claims to be considered suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/quest-unmask-ringleader-anonymous/39977/ |title=The Quest to Unmask the Ringleader of Anonymous - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a post on his blog in November 2011, The Jester retracted his prior identifications for "Sabu", issued an apology and correctly identified "Sabu" as Hector Xavier Monsegur, 28, of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagenseil |first=Paul |title=Despite Being Anonymous, Hacktivist Sabu Wasn't Hard to Find |url=http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/1602-sabu-identity-surprise.html |accessdate=13 March 2012 |newspaper=[[Security News Daily]] |date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabu's identity was confirmed on March 6, 2012, when Monsegur was arrested by the FBI and it was revealed that he had been acting as an FBI informant in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5 'Anonymous' hackers busted after one becomes FBI informant |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/5-anonymous-hackers-busted-after-one-becomes-fbi-informant-1.3582817 |newspaper=Newsday |date=March 6, 2012 |agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldman |first=David |title=Anonymous in disarray after major crackdown snares leaders |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/06/technology/anonymous_arrests/ |newspaper=CNN |date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, at the [[Hacker Halted#Hacker Halted USA|Hackers Halted USA]] conference, The Jester gave a surprise live presentation and fielded questions through an online chat with presenter Jeff Bardin.&lt;ref name="infosecisland4"/&gt; His identity was authenticated via his Twitter account. Jester answered questions about XerXeS and other tools in development, and discussed his motivations for attacking militant jihadi recruiting websites. On August 26, 2012, Bardin hosted a similar presentation at [[Utica College]] for the college's Cybersecurity Master's program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/th3j35t3r/status/239733994005086208 |title=th3j35t3r: BIG shout-out to Mr H.Cooper |publisher=Twitter |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late November 2011, th3j35t3r claimed to take down multiple jihadist sites permanently, with his newest tool known as 'Saladin'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=jihadunspun.com - TANGO DOWN - PERMANENTLY (yes forever) |url=https://twitter.com/th3j35t3r/status/140916218864472064 |publisher=Twitter |author=ʇuıɐs ʞɔopuooq™ |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=muslimdefenseforce.islamicink.com - TANGO DOWN - PERMANENTLY |url=https://twitter.com/th3j35t3r/status/140919855149879296 |publisher=Twitter |author=ʇuıɐs ʞɔopuooq™ |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=falojaa.net - TANGO DOWN - PERMANENTLY |url=https://twitter.com/th3j35t3r/status/140919628263211008 |publisher=Twitter |author=ʇuıɐs ʞɔopuooq™ |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin is claimed to be similar to other 'Apache Killer' tools used by hackers.

On May 14, 2012 The Jester's Twitter account (@th3j35t3r) appeared to have been deleted, along with all posts on his WordPress blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2012/05/patriotic-hacktivist-the-jester-unmasked-or-maybe-its-a-big-troll/ |title="Patriotic hacktivist" The Jester unmasked—or maybe it's a big troll |publisher=Ars Technica |date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Twitter account and WordPress blog were merely temporarily deactivated and were subsequently restored May 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://th3j35t3r.wordpress.com/2012/05/16/not-totally-sure-what-just-happened-but-damn-its-getting-out-of-hand-now/ |title=Not totally sure what just happened, but damn it's getting out of hand now |author=th3j35t3r |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2013, the Jester took responsibility for a series of DoS cyberattacks against the [[Ecuador]]ean stock exchange and the country's tourism website, and promised to attack any other governments considering granting asylum to [[National Security Agency|NSA]] leaker [[Edward Snowden]]. In a June blog post, he wrote that Snowden "is not a goddam hero, here to save Americans from 'the government' because of privacy infringements and breaches of the 4th amendment, he is a traitor and has jeopardized all our lives." In tweets, the Jester also alluded to a plan to seize control of the fire alarms at the Ecuadorean embassy in [[London]], which would force WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] to set foot on UK soil and face potential extradition to [[Sweden]] to face sexual assault charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/07/hacker-jester-targets-assange-snowden-ecuador Snowden and Assange Targeted by Mysterious Hacker "The Jester"], ''Mother Jones'', 2 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2016, the Jester took responsibility for defacing the official website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jesterscourt.cc/2016/10/23/soviet-russia-get-get-propagandered-guy-jingly-hat/ |title=In Soviet Russia, we get out-propagandered by a guy in a jingly hat |website=Jesterscourt.cc |date=October 23, 2016 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hack" was in retaliation for a series of [[October 2016 Dyn cyberattack|DDOS attacks earlier in the week]] that targeted major [[Domain Name System|DNS]] provider [[Dyn (company)|Dyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/22/technology/russian-foreign-ministry-hacked/index.html |title=American vigilante hacker sends Russia a warning |work=CNN Money |first=Jose |last=Pagliery |date=October 24, 2016 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SANS report: "The Jester: A Lesson in Asymmetric Warfare"==
In December 2011, T. J. O'Connor, a research analyst in the Information Technology and Operations Center (ITOC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.usma.edu/webs/people/oconnor/ |title=Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science - Home |publisher=Eecs.usma.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced a comprehensive report for the [[SANS Institute]] detailing the history of The Jester's hacking campaigns titled "The Jester Dynamic: A Lesson in Asymmetric Unmanaged Cyber Warfare".&lt;ref name="Oconnor2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/attacking/jester-dynamic-lesson-asymmetric-unmanaged-cyber-warfare_33889 |title=The Jester Dynamic: A Lesson in Asymmetric Unmanaged Cyber Warfare |publisher=SANS Institute |first=T. J. |last=O'Connor |date=December 30, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper examines the history, motives and impact of two years worth of The Jester's hacking, and provides a detailed analysis of the timeline of his attacks, a speculative analysis of the tools he may use, and review of his use of social media and public relations through his blog.&lt;ref name="Oconnor2011" /&gt;

==QR code attack==
On March 5, 2012, The Jester changed his Twitter account @th3j35t3r avatar from his signature Jester icon to a [[QR code]] without comment or explanation.&lt;ref name=msncom&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagenseil |first=Paul |title=Anti-Anonymous hacker threatens to expose them |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46716942/#.T1-7pPX1lX8 |newspaper=MSNBC |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning a QR code redirects a browser to a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Is A QR Code And Why Do You Need One? |url=http://searchengineland.com/what-is-a-qr-code-and-why-do-you-need-one-27588 |newspaper=Search Engine Land |date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning The Jester's icon led to a URL where he had an image of his signature Jester icon and an embedded, hidden code that allegedly exploited a vulnerability that affects [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] browsers.&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt; "When anyone scanned the original QR code using an [[iPhone]] or Android device, their device would silently make a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] shell connection back to my remote server," The Jester wrote. "Like a phone call, if you like."&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt;&lt;ref name=snd /&gt;

Apparently, once connected to the Jester's server, the network diagnostic tool [[Netcat]] checked the connecting mobile device to see if it had Twitter software installed.&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt; Twitter account information was then harvested and checked against a list that The Jester allegedly maintains of known Twitter accounts associated with the hacking groups [[Anonymous Operation|Anonymous]], [[LulzSec]] or [[Operation AntiSec|AntiSec]], with Wikileaks, Al Qaeda and Islamic Jihadi recruiting sites.&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt; Twitter accounts that did not hit a match to the list were ignored. Possibly, when a Twitter account registered a hit on the list, the account permissions were transferred to The Jester, he elevated his permissions to allow him to exploit the entire mobile device. It is possible that in this manner The Jester was able to obtain access to [[Short Message Service|SMS]] text messages, voicemail, call logs, and email on the phone.&lt;ref name=snd&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagenseil |first=Paul |title=Pro-American Hacker's Attack Threatens to Expose Anonymous |url=http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/1613-jester-qr-code-twitter-anonymous.html |newspaper=Security News Daily |date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ullrich |first=Johannes |title=An Analysis of Jester's QR Code Attack.

The Jester's QR code ran quietly for five days before a Twitter user going by the moniker @RootDial noticed the embedded code and mentioned it.&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt; In those five days, The Jester wrote "Over 1,200 curious netizens scanned the QR code . . . Of those, over 500 devices reverse-shelled back to the listening server. Of those, a significant number were on the '[hit]-list' and as such treated as valid targets."&lt;ref name=msncom /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://th3j35t3r.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/curiosity-pwned-the-cat/ Curiosity pwned the cat] th3j35t3r.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, The Jester posted an encrypted file containing the data harvested from his QR code.&lt;ref name=snd /&gt; In a private communication, SecurityNewsDaily asked The Jester why he'd encrypted the information rather than post it in regular, plain text. "I encrypt my [data] dumps as a matter of course because I am not the same as my detractors who drop personal info all the time," he replied. "The right people have the plain text dump. It would be highly irresponsible of me to be dropping anything in the open."&lt;ref name=snd /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4289">'''''The John Bohlen Lectureship''''' was a series of lectures on a subject relating to the Christian religion, delivered annually in the city of Philadelphia.

==History and Endowment==
John Bohlen, who died in [[Philadelphia]] on 26 April 1874, bequeathed to trustees $100,000, to be distributed to religious and charitable objects in accordance with the well-known wishes of the testator.

By a deed of trust, executed 2 June 1875, the trustees transferred and paid over to "The Rector, Church Wardens, and Vestrymen of the Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia," in trust, a sum of money for certain designated purposes, out of which fund the sum of $10,000 was set apart for the endowment of '''The John Bohlen Lectureship''', upon stated terms and conditions.

The conditions provided for the appointment of a qualified person, whether clergyman or layman, to deliver and allow to be published two or more lecture sermons, delivery to be in the city of Philadelphia. The subject was to be matters connected with or referring to the Christian religion.

The lecturer was appointed annually in May, by a committee consisting of:
*the Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Diocese in which is the Church of the Holy Trinity
*the Rector of said Church
*the Professor of Biblical Learning in the Divinity School of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia
*the Professor of Systematic Divinity in said School
*the Professor of Ecclesiastical History in said school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5425">'''Thomas L. Knauff''' (born 1938) is an American writer, [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] pilot, [[flight instructor]], [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA)  Designated Pilot Examiner, and a member of the U.S. [[Soaring Hall of Fame]]. He was an early pioneer of [[ridge soaring]] in the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] in the 1960s, ultimately setting five world records flying gliders there. He was the stunt pilot in the 1999 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1809084341 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522073642/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1809084341 |date=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knauff was the first glider pilot to fly 750&amp;nbsp;km and 1000&amp;nbsp;km triangle course flights in the [[United States]], and was the first to fly 1000&amp;nbsp;km with a passenger. His 1,647&amp;nbsp;km (1,023&amp;nbsp;mi) out-and-return flight in 1983 was the world's longest glider flight at the time, stood as a world record for nearly 20 years, and is still a U.S. national record. He has set more than 50 other U.S. National soaring records.

His glider flight training manuals, ''Glider Basics from First Flight to Solo'' and ''Glider Basics from Solo to License'' are the most popular in the U.S., and he is one of the most respected glider flight instructors in the world. He is one of the few FAA designated pilot examiners who are authorized to issue initial flight instructor certificates. 

Knauff currently lives near [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Pennsylvania]] with his wife [[Doris Grove]], another hall of fame glider pilot. They own and operate the [[Ridge Soaring Gliderport]] in [[Julian, Pennsylvania]], which they founded in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Doris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69934">A '''trading card''' (or '''collectible card''') is a small card, usually made out of [[paperboard]] or thick [[paper]], which usually contains an image of a certain person, place or thing (fictional or real) and a short description of the picture, along with other text (attacks, statistics, or trivia).&lt;ref name=ccbaseball&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Card History, News, and Reviews|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/baseball/baseball-card/|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B2gy4wCw?url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/baseball/baseball-card/|archivedate=29 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide variation of different types of cards. Modern cards even go as far as to include swatches of game worn memorabilia, autographs, and even DNA hair samples of their subjects.

Trading cards are traditionally associated with [[sport]]s; [[baseball card]]s are especially well-known. Cards dealing with other subjects like ''[[Pokémon]]'' are often considered a separate category from sports cards, known as [[non-sports trading card]]s. These often feature [[cartoon]]s, [[comic book]] characters, [[television series]] and film stills. In the 1990s, cards designed specifically for playing games became popular enough to develop into a distinct category, [[collectible card game]]s. These games are mostly [[fantasy]]-based [[gameplay]]. [[Fantasy art cards]] are a subgenre of trading cards that focus on the [[artwork]].

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[Trade cards]] are the ancestors of trading cards. Some of the earliest [[Prize (marketing)|prizes]] found in retail products were [[cigarette cards]] — [[trade cards]] advertising the product (not to be confused with trading cards) that were inserted into paper packs of cigarettes as stiffeners to protect the contents. [[Allen and Ginter]] in the U.S. in 1886, and British company [[W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills]] in 1888, were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements.&lt;ref name="axeman"&gt;[http://www.tradingcardcentral.com/history.php Trading Card Central]. 2007. 29 Jan. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A couple years later, lithograph pictures on the cards with an encyclopedic variety of topics from nature to war to sports — subjects that appealed to men who smoked - began to surface as well.&lt;ref name="stevetalbot.com"&gt;[http://www.stevetalbot.com/cards/history.php The History of Cartophily] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114000/http://www.stevetalbot.com/cards/history.php |date=2013-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. Children would stand outside of stores to ask customers who bought cigarettes for the promotional cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Cigarette-Cards-Cartophily/|title=Cigarette Cards and Cartophily|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of cigarette cards, trade cards were produced by manufacturers of other products and included in the product or handed to the customer by the store clerk at the time of purchase.&lt;ref name="stevetalbot.com"/&gt; World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources, and after the war cigarette cards never really made a comeback. After that collectors of prizes from retail products took to collecting [[Tea culture#Tea cards|tea cards]] in the UK and bubble gum cards in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Cigarette-Card-Guide-Collectibles-History-and-Grading_W0QQugidZ10000000000792783|title=Cigarette Card Guide (Collectibles) History and Grading|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early baseball cards ===
The first [[baseball cards]] were trade cards printed in the late 1860s by a sporting goods company, around the time baseball became a professional sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cycleback.com/1800s/trade.htm Early Trade Cards]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the baseball cards around the beginning of the 20th century came in candy and tobacco products. It was during this era that the most valuable baseball card ever printed was produced - the infamous [[T206 Honus Wagner|T206 tobacco card featuring Honus Wagner]].&lt;ref name=honuswag&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the T206 Honus Wagner Baseball Card|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/card-t206-honus-wagner|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.cardboardconnection.com/t206-white-borders-baseball-cards T206 Set], distributed by the [[American Tobacco Company]] in 1909, is considered by collectors to be the most popular set of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/treasure/autont005.shtml|title=Tobacco Baseball Cards|website=www.baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Goudey|Goudey Gum Company]] of Boston issued baseball cards with players biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psacard.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=3886&amp;type=1 The History of Goudey Gum Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125202/http://www.psacard.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=3886&amp;type=1 |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 Goudey set remains one of the most popular and affordable vintage sets to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 Goudey Baseball Cards|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/baseball-cards/1933-goudey-baseball-cards|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bowman Gum]] of Philadelphia issued its first baseball cards in 1948.

=== Modern trading cards ===
Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., now known as [[The Topps Company, Inc.]], started inserting trading cards into bubble gum packs in 1950 — with such topics as TV and film cowboy [[Hopalong Cassidy]]; "[[Bring 'Em Back Alive (book)|Bring 'Em Back Alive]]" cards featuring [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]] on big game hunts in Africa; and All-American football cards. Topps produced its first baseball trading card set in 1951, with the resulting design resembling that of playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1951 Topps Baseball Cards|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/1951-topps-blue-backs-baseball-cards-2|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topps owner and founder [[Sy Berger]] created the first true modern baseball card set, complete with playing record and statistics, the following year in the form of 1952 Topps Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1952 Topps Baseball Cards|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/1952-topps-baseball-cards-2|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the most popular sets of all time, due in large part to the fact that it contained Mickey Mantle's rookie card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mickey Mantle's Rookie Card Guide|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/mickey-mantle-baseball-cards-rookie-cards-checklist-and-buying-guide|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topps purchased their chief competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topps.com/abouttopps/history.html Topps History]&lt;/ref&gt; Topps was the leader in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980, not only in sports cards but in entertainment cards as well. Many of the top selling [[Non-sports trading card|non-sports cards]] were produced by Topps, including [[Wacky Packages]] (1967, 1973–1977), ''[[Star Wars canon|Star Wars]]'' (beginning in 1977)&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars Super Collector's Wish Book Identification and Values'', Geoffrey T. Carlton, Collector Books, Paducah, KY, {{ISBN|1-57432-289-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Garbage Pail Kids]] (beginning in 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/garbage_pail_kids/|title=Barren AARON's GPK World|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topps inserted baseball cards as [[Prize (marketing)|prize]]s into packs of gum until 1981, when cards were sold without the gum. Collectors were delighted, since the oil from the gum was ruining an otherwise pristine or valuable card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Topps-Company-Inc-Company-History.html|title=History of The Topps Company, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital trading cards ===
{{Advert|section|date=October 2012}}
In an attempt to stay current with technology and digital trends, existing and new trading card companies started to create digital trading cards that lives exclusively online or as a digital counterpart of a physical card. In 2000, [[Topps]] established themselves in the digital space by launching a new brand of sports cards, called [[etopps]]. These cards are sold exclusively online through individual IPO's (initial player offering) in which the card is offered for usually a week at the IPO price. The quantity sold depends on how many people offer to buy but is limited to a certain maximum. After a sale, the cards are held in a climate-controlled warehouse unless the buyer requests delivery, and the cards can be traded online without changing hands except in the virtual sense. In January 2012, Topps announced that they would be discontinuing their eTopps product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eTopps Brand Retired|url=http://etopps.com/ipomarketplace/jan2012faq.asp|work=etopps.com|publisher=Topps|accessdate=16 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207151720/http://www.etopps.com/ipomarketplace/jan2012faq.asp|archive-date=2012-02-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital collectable card games were estimated to be a $1.3B market in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Card Games Report|url=http://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/digital-card-games/|publisher=Superdata|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tech start-ups have attempted to establish themselves in this space, notably Stampii (Spain, 2009), Fantom (Ireland, 2011), Deckdaq (Israel, 2011), and 2Stic (Austria, 2013). These companies have struggled with two challenges: the high cost of digital licensing of quality brand content, and the difficulty of monetizing Internet content particularly in an 8- to 12-year-old demographic. The only successful business model unlocked has been B2B, licensing the tech to sales promotion companies and sports franchises as digital inventory generators. The bulk of the revenue generated digitally is by US and Japanese games companies such as Wizards of the Coast, with deeper game play and their own intellectual property.

The dominant paper-based card companies continue to experiment slowly with digital, being careful not to cannibalize their print markets.

Panini launched their [[Adrenalyn XL]] platform with an NBA and NFL trading card collection. [[Connect2Media]] together with [[Winning Moves]], created an [[iPhone]] Application to host a series of trading card collections, including Dinosaurs, James Bond - 007, Celebs, Gum Ball 3000, European Football Stars and [[NBA]]. In 2011, mytcg Technologies launched a platform that enabled content holders to host their content on.

On July 1, 2011, Wildcat Intellectual Property Holdings filed a lawsuit against 12 defendants, including [[Topps]], [[Panini Group|Panini]], [[Sony]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Konami]], [[Pokémon]], [[Zynga]] and [[Nintendo]], for allegedly infringing Wildcat's "Electronic Trading Card" patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.priorsmart.com/wildcat-intellectual-property-holdings-v-4kids-entertainment-l4zv/#Complaintl|title=Wildcat Intellectual Property Holdings Lawsuit|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216160019/http://news.priorsmart.com/wildcat-intellectual-property-holdings-v-4kids-entertainment-l4zv/#Complaintl|archive-date=2017-02-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Topps]] also launched their first phone application. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501040947/http://bunt.topps.com/ Topps Bunt] is an app that allows users to connect with other fans in a fantasy league type game environment wherein they can collect their favorite players, earn points based on how well they play and trade &amp; compete with other fans.

In 2015 [[Topps]] launched a digital experiment in Europe (geotargeted to exclude the USA) with its Marvel Hero Attax, using digital as an overlay to its physical product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvel Avengers Hero Attax Series 4|url=http://swapstick.com/swaps.nsf/Albums+By+Title/Marvel%20Avengers%20Hero%20Attax%20Series%204%202015|publisher=Swapstick|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common functionalities that are shared between new and emerging digital trading card platforms include collection, live auctions, virtual shops, multiplayer gaming, a mobile- web- or [[Facebook]] application, [[Digital Rights Management]], card tracking, and embedded content.

==Value==
Today, the development of the Internet has given rise to various online communities, through which members can trade collectible cards with each other. Cards are often bought and sold via [[eBay]] and other online retail sources. Many websites solicit their own "sell to us" page in hopes to draw in more purchase opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danscardz.com/servlet/the-template/Sell/Page |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823095108/http://www.danscardz.com/servlet/the-template/Sell/Page |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of a trading card depends on a combination of the card's condition, the subject's popularity and the scarcity of the card. In some cases, especially with older cards that preceded the advent of card collecting as a widespread [[hobby]], they have become [[Collectible|collectors' items]] of considerable value. In recent years, many sports cards have not necessarily appreciated as much in value due to overproduction, although some manufacturers have used limited editions and smaller print runs to boost value. Trading cards, however, do not have an absolute monetary value. Cards are only worth as much as a collector is willing to pay.&lt;ref name="MLBFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/nbbcd/pop_faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Major League Baseball |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condition===
Card condition is one aspect of trading cards that determine the value of a card. There are four areas of interest in determining a cards condition. Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches and tears, when determining a trading cards value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading Card Grading Guide|url=http://www.cardboardconnection.com/comprehensive-guide-card-grading|work=CardboardConnection.com|publisher=The Cardboard Connection|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cards are considered poor to pristine based on their condition, or in some cases rated 1 through 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.beckett.com/estore/helpsys/viewarticle.aspx?ArticleId=47 |title=Grading Cards - BGS |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608224950/http://www.beckett.com/estore/helpsys/viewarticle.aspx?ArticleId=47 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A card in pristine condition, for example, will generally be valued higher than a card in poor condition.

===Popularity===
Popularity of trading cards is determined by the subject represented on the card, their real life accomplishments, and short term news coverage as well as the specifics of the card.&lt;ref name="MLBFAQ" /&gt;

===Scarcity===
While vintage cards are truly a scarce commodity, modern day manufacturers have to artificially add value to their products in order to make them scarce. This is accomplished by including serial numbered parallel sets, cards with game worn memorabilia, autographs, and more. Time can also make cards more scarce due to the fact that cards may be lost or destroyed.&lt;ref name=honuswag /&gt;

==Terminology==
&lt;!-- I don't know how to add a citation to literacy, but all these abbreviations can be read from Beckett's annual book. At issue #11 they are in pages 20-26 (lot more terms)--&gt;

==Sports cards==
Sports card is a generic term for a trading card with a sports-related subject, as opposed to [[non-sports trading card]]s that deal with other topics. Sports cards were among the earliest forms of [[collectible]]s. They typically consist of a picture of a player on one side, with statistics or other information on the reverse. Cards have been produced featuring most major sports, especially those played in [[North America]], including, but not limited to, [[association football]] (soccer), [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[Gridiron football|American football]] (gridiron), [[golf]], [[Ice hockey|hockey]], [[racing]] and [[tennis]].

The first stage in the development of sports cards, during the second half of the 19th century, is essentially the story of [[baseball card]]s, since baseball was the first sport to become widely professionalized. Hockey cards also began to appear early in the 20th century. Cards from this period are commonly known as [[cigarette card]]s or [[tobacco cards]], because many were produced by [[tobacco]] companies and inserted into [[cigarette]] packages, to stiffen cigarette packaging and advertise cigarette brands. The most expensive card in the hobby is a cigarette card of [[Honus Wagner]] in a set called 1909 T-206. The story told is that Wagner was against his cards being inserted into something that children would collect. So the production of his cards stopped abruptly. It is assumed that less than 100 of his cards exist in this set. The 1909 T-206 Honus Wagner card has sold for as much as $2.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3007893 |title=Honus Wagner card sells for record $2.8 million |publisher=EPSN |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sets of cards are issued with each season for major professional sports. Since companies typically must pay players for the right to use their images, the vast majority of sports cards feature professional athletes. Amateurs appear only rarely, usually on cards produced or authorized by the institution they compete for, such as a [[college]].

Many older sports cards (pre-1980) command a high price today; this is because they are hard to find, especially in good quality condition. This happened because many children used to place their cards in bicycle spokes, where the cards were easily damaged. Rookie cards of Hall of Fame sports stars can command thousands of dollars if they have been relatively well-preserved.

In the 1980s, sports cards started to get produced in higher numbers, and collectors started to keep their cards in better condition as they became increasingly aware of their potential investment value. This trend continued well into the 1990s. This practice caused many of the cards manufactured during this era to stay low in value, due to their high numbers.

The proliferation of cards saturated the market, and by the late 1990s, card companies began to produce scarcer versions of cards to keep many collectors interested. The latest trends in the hobby have been "game used memorabilia" cards, which usually feature a piece of a player's jersey worn in a real professional game; other memorabilia cards include pieces of bats, balls, hats, helmets, and floors. Authenticated autographs are also popular, as are "serially numbered" cards, which are produced in much smaller amounts than regular "base set cards".

Autographs obtained by card manufacturers have become the most collected baseball cards in the hobby's history. This started in 1990 in baseball when [[Upper Deck]] randomly inserted autographs of Reggie Jackson into boxes. They are commonly referred to as "Certified Autographed Inserts" or "CAI's". Both the athlete's and card company's reputations are on the line if they do not personally sign these cards. This has created the most authentic autographs in existence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These cards all have some form of printed statements that the autographs are authentic, this way, no matter who owns the autograph there is no question of its authenticity. CAI's have branched out into autographs of famous actors, musicians, Presidents, and even Albert Einstein. Mostly these autographs are cut from flat items such as postcards, index cards, and plain paper. Then they are pasted onto cards. In 2001, a company called Playoff started obtaining autographs on stickers that are stuck on the cards instead of them actually signing the cards. There is strong opposition against these types of autographs because the players never even saw the cards that the stickers were affixed to.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The competition among card companies to produce quality sports cards has been fierce. In 2005, the long-standing sports card producer [[Fleer]] went bankrupt and was bought out by [[Upper Deck]]. Not long after that, [[Donruss]] lost its MLB baseball license.

===Association football===
The first [[Association football]] (soccer) cards were produced in 1898 by Marcus &amp; Company Tobacco in Manchester, [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;International Soccer Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The set consisted of over 100 cards and was issued under the title of "Club Colours". They featured illustrated images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement on the back of the card. Many other cigarette companies quickly created their own series, beginning with Kinner in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football Cigarette Cards |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Fcigarette.htm |website=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later series of cards was produced in 1934 by Ardath, which was a 50-card set called ''Famous Footballers'' featuring images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement and short biography of the player on the back of the card.

Modern Association football trading cards were sold with bubble gum in the United Kingdom from 1958 to 1975 by A&amp;BC, and later by [[Topps#Topps_Europe_Ltd_Products|Topps, UK]] from 1975 to 1981. Similar smaller sized cards were issued in Spain and Italy beginning in the late 1940s. Cards have been produced from 1981 to present, save 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref name="soccer1970"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/NavView/Nav.aspx?Ntt=Soccer&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=382+27&amp;Ntk=Default |title=Soccer 1970s |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccer1980"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/NavView/Nav.aspx?Ntt=Soccer&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=382+36&amp;Ntk=Default |title=Soccer 1980s |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccer1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/NavView/Nav.aspx?Ntt=Soccer&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=382+37&amp;Ntk=Default |title=Soccer 1990s |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccer2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/NavView/Nav.aspx?Ntt=Soccer&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=382+38&amp;Ntk=Default |title=Soccer 2000s |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under its ''Merlin'' brand, since 1994 Topps has held the licence to produce stickers for the [[Premier League]] [[sticker album]].&lt;ref name="Topps PL"&gt;{{cite news |title=Topps |url=https://www.premierleague.com/partners/topps |accessdate=5 October 2018 |agency=Premier League.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched by Topps in the 2007–08 season, Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK – with around 1.5m collectors in the UK – and with global sales it is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.&lt;ref name="Topps PL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Impressive sales figures show Topps Match Attax to be an immediate hit |url=https://www.talkingretail.com/products-news/impressive-sales-figures-show-topps-match-attax-to-be-an-immediate-hit-22-10-2009/ |accessdate=6 October 2018 |agency=Talking Retail.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations of football products exist, such as marbles, cut-outs, coins, stamps and [[sticker]]s, some made of light cardboard and attached with glue or stickers, into [[sticker album]]s specifically issued for the products. Forming a partnership with [[FIFA]] in 1970, [[Panini Group|Panini]] first produced a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] sticker album for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brand collaborations |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/licensing/brand-collaborations.html |accessdate=8 September 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini World Cup 2018 stickers: When is the iconic sticker album release date?

Panini’s football trading card game [[Adrenalyn XL]] was introduced in 2009. In 2010 Panini released a [[UEFA Champions League]] edition of Adrenalyn XL, containing 350 cards from 22 of the competing clubs, including defending champions [[FC Barcelona]].

===Baseball===
{{Main article|Baseball card}}

Baseball cards will usually feature one or more [[baseball]] players or other baseball-related sports figures. The front of the card typically displays an image of the player with identifying information, including, but not limited to, the player's name and team affiliation. The reverse of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. Cards are most often found in the [[United States]] but are also common in countries such as [[Canada]], [[Cuba]], and [[Japan]], where baseball is a popular sport and there are professional leagues.

The earliest baseball cards were in the form of [[trade cards]] produced in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cycleback.com/1800s/trade.htm |title=Early Trade Cards |first=David E. |last=Rudd |publisher=Cycleback |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They evolved into [[tobacco card]]s by 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cycleback.com/1800s/tobacco1.htm |title=Tobacco Era Part I: Introduction |first=David E. |last=Rudd |publisher=Cycleback |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cycleback.com/1800s/tobacco2.htm |title=Tobacco Era Part 2 |first=David E. |last=Rudd |publisher=Cycleback |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century other industries began printing their own version of baseball cards to promote their products, such as bakery/bread cards, caramel cards, dairy cards, game cards and publication cards. Between the 1930s and 1960s the cards developed into trading cards, becoming their own product. In 1957, [[Topps]] changed the dimensions of its cards slightly, to 2-1/2&amp;nbsp;inches by 3-1/2&amp;nbsp;inches, setting a standard that remains the basic format for most sports cards produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Cesar |last1=Brioso |first2=Mike |last2=Dodd |title=Topps facts |publisher=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/stories/2001-03-27-cards-facts.htm |date=March 27, 2001 |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
{{Main article|Basketball card}}
Basketball cards will feature one or more players of the [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], [[Olympic basketball]], [[Women's National Basketball Association]], [[Women's Professional Basketball League]], or some other basketball related theme. The first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as ''College Athlete Felts B-33''. The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30-cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette redemption premium by Egyptiene Cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3005624/Basketball-Set/Collection/1910-College-Athlete-Felts-B-33/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1910 College Athlete Felts B-33 Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 13, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of cigarette packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.

The next series of basketball cards were issued in 1911, in two separate series; ''T6 College Series'', measuring approximately 6" by 8", and ''T51 College Series'', measuring approximately 2" by 3". These series included a variety of sports, with only 4 cards being associated with basketball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~dan/T51/gosports.html?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=College Series T51 * Card Collection |publisher=Vintage Non-Sports Cards |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one card from the T6 series and three cards from the T51 series. Both series were produced in two variations, one variation reading "College Series", the other, "2nd Series". The cards were acquired in trade for fifteen Murad cigarette coupons. The offer expired June 30, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3005659/Basketball-Set/Collection/1911-Murad-College-Series-T51-/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1911 Murad College Series T51 * Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 13, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basketball cards were not seen again until 1932, when C.A. Briggs Chocolate issued a 31-card set containing multiple sports. In exchange for a completed set of cards, Briggs offered baseball equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3005667/Basketball-Set/Collection/1932-C-A-Briggs-Chocolate-/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1932 C.A.Briggs Chocolate * Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 13, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of basketball cards in the set is not known.

===Boxing===
According to Tallent, one of the first boxing cards on record in "America's Greatest Boxing Cards", and encyclopedia and check-list of boxing cards, was of John C. Heenan issued by Charles D. Fredericks in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Tallent. (Sunday Jun 14, 2009). The History Of Boxing Cards. In The Sweet Science. Retrieved August 19, 2010, from http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/6908/history-boxing-cards/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828214652/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/6908/history-boxing-cards |date=2010-08-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gridiron football===
{{Main article|Football card}}
A gridiron football card is a type of collectible trading card typically printed on paper stock or card stock that features one or more [[American football]], [[Canadian football]] or [[World League of American Football]] players or other related sports figures. These cards are most often found in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] where the sport is popular.

Most football cards features [[National Football League]] players. There are also [[Canadian Football League]] and [[college football]] cards. Player cards normally list the player's statistics.

===Golf===
Golf cards were first introduced in 1901 by Ogden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3423582/Golf-Set/Collection/1901-Ogden-s-Guinea-Gold-Cigarettes/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1901 Ogden's Guinea Gold Cigarettes Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 9, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
{{Main article|Hockey card}}
The first hockey cards were included in cigarette packages from 1910 to 1913. After [[World War I]], only one more cigarette set was issued, during the 1924-25 season by Champ's Cigarettes. [[National Hockey League|NHL]] player [[Billy Coutu]]'s biography includes an example of one of the 40 cards issued at that time.

During the 1920s, some hockey cards were printed by food and candy companies, such as Paulin's Candy, Maple Crispette, Crescent, Holland Creameries and La Patrie.

Through 1941, [[O-Pee-Chee]] printed hockey cards, stopping production for [[World War II]]. Presumably, the 1941 involvement of the US in the war affected the hockey card market, since Canada had been in the war since 1939.

Hockey cards next appeared during 1951-52, issued by [[Shirriff|Shirriff Desserts]], York Peanut Butter and Post Cereal. Toronto's Parkhurst Products Company began printing cards in 1951, followed by Brooklyn's Topps Chewing Gum in 1954-1955. [[O-Pee-Chee]] and Topps did not produce cards in 1955 or 1956, but returned for 1957-58. Shirriff also issued "hockey coins."

===Racing===
Racing cards consist of a card stock with stats and pictures on it. Sometimes it shows the car, sometimes it shows the driver's face, and sometimes both. It also shows the endorsing companies for the car.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''''Uralsky Sovremennik''''' ({{lang-rus|Уральский современник}}, lit. "contemporary Ural"), later known as simply '''''Ural''''' ({{lang-rus|Урал}}), was a literary [[almanac]] published in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1938 to 1957. The magazine was based in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alib.ru/5_uralnmnskij_sovremennik_alnmnmanah_sverdlovskogo_otdeleniya_soyuza_pisatelej_sssr_n3_33_w1t702c3664e009d091c765c75af598ac947fe.html|title=Уральский современник.

Краеведение России: Сибирь, Дальний Восток |publisher=Alib.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly published the works of the authors from the [[Ural (region)|Ural region]].&lt;ref name="belinsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.uraic.ru/events/2008/01/0/533|title=Памятная дата из истории края|date=January 2008|work=Calendar of events|publisher=Sverdlovsk Regional Research Library of V. G. Belinsky|language=Russian|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The almanac was operated by the Sverdlovsk department of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]].&lt;ref name="okryljajushhemu"/&gt;

The almanac was founded as ''Uralsky Sovremennik'' in 1938 by [[Klavdiya Rozhdestvenskaya]], the [[editor-in-chief]] of the [[Sverdlovsk Publishing House]].&lt;ref name="okryljajushhemu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rozhdestvenskaya|first=Yelena |year=2005|title=Moemu neizmenno okryljajushhemu redaktoru: vspominaja Pavla Petrovicha Bazhova |script-title = ru:Моему неизменно окрыляющему редактору: вспоминая Павла Петровича Бажова | trans-title =To my always inspiring editor: remembering Pavel Petrovich Bazhov|journal=Ural|location=Yekaterinburg |volume=1|url= http://magazines.russ.ru/ural/2005/1/r16.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed under that title until 1956, with 33 volumes released. Among editors of the almanac were Klavdiya Rozhdestvenskaya herself, the famous Ural writer [[Pavel Bazhov]], N. Popova, V. A. Starikov. Pavel Bazhov's fairy tales, such as "[[The Stone Flower]]", "[[The Malachite Casket (fairy tale)|The Malachite Casket]]", "[[Silver Hoof]]" , were published in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazhov|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Bazhov|editor=Valentina Bazhova |editor2=[[Alexey Surkov]] |editor3=Yevgeny Permyak|title=Sobranie sochinenij v trekh tomakh|trans-title= Works.

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] it published the works of the evacuated writers. After some debate the Union of Soviet Writers decided to reorganize the magazine to expand the number of authors and "its circle of topics".&lt;ref name="belinsky"/&gt; In 1957 a new editorial board was hired, ''Uralsky Sovremennik'' was renamed to ''Ural''. Only 4 volumes (1/34—4/37) were published under that title. It was shut down the same year.&lt;ref name="belinsky"/&gt;
