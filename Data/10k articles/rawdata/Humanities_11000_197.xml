{{Pre-Islamic Arabian deities}}

==Sacrifices==
The name implies a holy place or an altar, but its Arabic root also means "to dye". It is implied that many sacrifices (which may include children) were offered to the idol, staining it with blood.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jordan (2004, 1993), ''Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Second Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''A Day in Beaumont'''" is the first segment of the twenty-fourth episode of the first season (1985–86) of the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Plot==
It's 1955 and Kevin and Faith Carlson are travelling through the country when they see a meteorite strike over the next hill. Upon investigation, they discover an alien spacecraft manned by [[insectoid]] beings. The Carlsons race to the nearest town to report what they've seen but the local sheriff insists that a military plane has crashed. The sheriff takes Kevin and Faith back to the impact site where they find a team of U. S. Army scientists combing through a wrecked airplane. Kevin notices that the hands of the army personnel are all deformed in the same unusual way and so are the sheriff's. He and Faith quietly leave the site and return to town but they cannot convince anyone that something strange is happening.

They attempt to leave the town but they are stopped by the combined efforts of the alien spacecraft and the townspeople. The townspeople reveal that they and the Carlsons are aliens and that this is a training simulation of an invasion of Earth. However, some of the aliens suffered memory loss and forgot their roles. Kevin and Faith were among those, so the sheriff says he will get the pair back on track.

Later, a young man is traveling along the same country road and also sees an alien spacecraft. He races to the nearest town to report it but is dissuaded by the local sheriff, who claims that it was only a military aircraft. The sheriff has the face of Kevin Carlson.

==Note==
{{original research|section|date=May 2014}}
The name of the town is an homage to [[Charles Beaumont]], writer of many of the original Twilight Zone episodes.  There are also other references scattered throughout the episode, such as saying the meteor was near Willoughby, which is a reference to [[A Stop at Willoughby|an original Twilight Zone episode]].  There's another reference to a town named Matheson, for [[Richard Matheson]], a noted science fiction author and frequent contributor to the original Twilight Zone.

The term "Bradbury rays" honors sci-fi author [[Ray Bradbury]], and a line about "giant ants and tarantulas" brings to mind the movies ''[[Them!]]'', ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'' and ''[[Earth vs. the Spider]]''. ''Them!'' is referenced again in the name of the general store: Johnson's; in ''Them!'', Gramps Johnson was an early victim of the giant ants. Other classic alien-invasion movie tropes abound: as they depart their saucer, the aliens are carrying large seed pods, an obvious reference to ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.

As the couple enter the diner, the sign reads "It's been a pleasure...serving you," a reference to the classic Twilight Zone episode "To Serve Man."  
When in human form, their inability to bend their pinky finger is reminiscent of the 1960s television series ''[[The Invaders]]''. Even the character of the astronomer Dr. Carlson could be taken to refer to the astronomer John Putnam played by [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] in ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'' (who also witnessed a UFO crash-landing in the desert).

The character H.G. Orson is a reference to [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Orson Welles]], who wrote the [[The War of the Worlds|novel]] and created the [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio broadcast]] ''The War of the Worlds'', respectively. The part is played by [[Jeff Morrow]] who starred in [[This Island Earth]].

'''''A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles''''' is a [[dictionary]] of English words and phrases that originated in the United States. The two-volume dictionary was edited by [[Mitford M. Mathews]] and was published in 1951 by [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathews  derived much of the book from ''A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles'' edited under the direction of Sir William Craigie at the University of Chicago (1934-1944).  Its 1911 pages of entries provides an important view of American culture as it evolved from its beginnings to the mid-20th century. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814531,00.html "Made in U.S.A."], ''Time'' magazine. April 02, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work should not be confused with [[John Russell Bartlett]]'s work, ''Dictionary of Americanisms"

'''Afro-Seminole Creole''' (ASC) is a dialect of [[Gullah language|Gullah]] spoken by [[Black Seminoles]] in scattered communities in Oklahoma, Texas, and Northern Mexico.&lt;ref name="kreol#1"&gt;[https://kreolmagazine.com/culture/history-and-culture/creoles-in-texas-the-afro-seminoles/#.Ws7wBFLMygQ "Creoles in Texas – 'The Afro-Seminoles'.” ''Kreol Magazine''.

It was first identified as a distinct language in 1978 by [[Ian Hancock]], a [[linguist]] at the [[University of Texas]]. The Creole developed when Black Seminoles and [[Seminoles]] lived together in Florida in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="kreol#1"/&gt;

Present-day speakers of Afro-Seminole Creole live in [[Seminole County, Oklahoma]], and [[Brackettville, Texas]], in the [[United States]] and in [[Nacimiento de los Negros]], [[Coahuila]], in [[Mexico]]. The language is considered threatened with extinction. There are about 200 speakers of the language.&lt;ref name="kreol#1"/&gt; A majority of the living speakers are descendants of Black Seminoles who once lived at Fort Clark and are at least 65 years old.

==Career==

===Theatre===
At the beginning of her career, Smith appeared in a wide range of stage productions, including the role of [[Mistress Quickly]] in an [[Off-Broadway]] production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' with the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=How many liberties can you take with the Bard?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0721/072102.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=July 21, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], set in [[New Orleans]] in post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America. For the role, Smith transformed herself into a "Cajun voodoo woman," an indication of the actress' transformational power that would manifest itself in her future work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Haire|first=Patricia|title="Wives of Windsor" make merry in city parks|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=July 26, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5778">'''Anne Elisabeth Holtsmark''' (21 June 1896 – 19 May 1974) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Philology|philologist]].

==Personal life==
She was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], the second of five children of [[Gabriel Gabrielsen Holtsmark]] (1867–1954) and Margrete Weisse (1871–1933), and grew up in Kristiania and [[Ås, Akershus|Ås]]. She was a maternal granddaughter of [[Johan Peter Weisse]], a paternal granddaughter of [[Bent Holtsmark]], a niece of [[Bernt Holtsmark|Bernt]] and [[Torger Holtsmark]], and a sister of [[Johan Peter Holtsmark|Johan]] and [[Karen Holtsmark]]. She herself never married.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Anne Holtsmark|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Eyvind Fjeld|last=Halvorsen|authorlink=Eyvind Fjeld Halvorsen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Anne_Holtsmark/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lier.kommune.no/liers-historie/holtsmark.htm|title=Holtsmark|publisher=Lier municipality|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Holtsmark was educated in business schools and worked at the [[Oslo Sparebank|Christiania Sparebank]] from 1913 to 1915 before taking the [[examen artium]] at [[Oslo Cathedral School|Kristiania Cathedral School]] in 1917. In 1927, she graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] with a [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1924. She majored in Norwegian and minored in French and history, and also worked part-time as a tutor and keeping accounts at the [[Oslo Commerce School]], where her father was the director.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Holtsmark became the first female professor in [[Old Norse]] at the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almamatersdotre.no/3548/HoltsmarkAnne Anne Holtsmark] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002131506/http://www.almamatersdotre.no/3548/HoltsmarkAnne |date=October 2, 2011 }}, Alma Maters døtre 1882-1982: Kvinner ansatt i vitenskaplig stilling på Universitetet i Oslo 1900 – 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked at the [[University Library of Oslo]] until 1930, except for 1925&amp;ndash;26, when she was a [[docent]] in Norwegian at the [[University of Hamburg]] for a year. In 1931 she was hired as a docent in Norse [[philology]] at the University. She took the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1936 with the thesis ''En islandsk scholasticus fra det 12. århundre'', and in 1949 was promoted to professor, succeeding [[Magnus Olsen]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

She had to retire in 1960 because of [[multiple sclerosis]], which confined her to a [[wheelchair]] from the 1950s onwards. She died in Oslo in May 1974.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Publications==
Holtsmark published several translations from [[Old Norse]] into Norwegian: ''[[Heimskringla]]'' (with [[Didrik Arup Seip]], two volumes, 1934); the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (1950); ''[[Legendary Saga of St. Olaf|Helgisaga Óláfs konungs Haraldssonar]]'' (1956); ''[[Sverris saga]]'' (1961), ''[[Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar]]'' (1964); and ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'' (1970). She wrote her master's thesis on the ''[[Glymdrápa]]'', and also published on the ''[[Haustlöng]]''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; From 1938 to 1949 she led the Old Norse dictionary project ''Gammelnorsk ordboksverk''.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Anne Holtsmark |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Anne_Holtsmark |language=Norwegian |accessdate=15 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published numerous articles, including many contributions to the ''Kulturhistorisk leksikon for nordisk middelalder''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Her book on [[Norse mythology]], ''Norrøn mytologi: Tru og mytar i vikingtida'' (1970) was republished and translated several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr97-9170 Holtsmark, Anne 1896-1974], Identities, [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frequency of letters''' in text has often been studied for use in [[cryptanalysis]], and [[frequency analysis]] in particular.

No language has an exact letter frequency distribution, as all writers write slightly differently. As a rule texts in different languages using the [[Arabic script]] (e.g. [[Arabic]], [[Old Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]) will have different letter frequencies, most obviously in the case of letters which are only used in some languages (e.g. the Persian letters پ, چ, گ, which are not used to write in Arabic).

Methods encoding the most frequent letters with the shortest symbols were pioneered by telegraph codes, and are used in modern data-compression techniques such as [[Huffman coding]].

== What gets counted in input Arabic text? ==

The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 primary letters, these are letters 1 to 28 in Table 1. The eight modified letters listed in positions 29 to 36 in the same table are used just the same{{what|date=August 2016}}. If these 8 modified forms are folded into the primary list based on shape or phonetic similarity, the outcome then is as shown in Table 2. For accurate frequency analysis, each of the 36 letters of Table 1 gets its frequency counted independently.

The ordering of the alphabet shown in the tables is more logical{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} than is used by the [[Unicode]] standard.

[[File:IntellarkChars.png|thumb|Figure 1: Arabic characters that can be produced using the [[Arabic Letter Keyboard Intellark]].]]
[[File:ArabicLetters-36.png|thumb|Table 1: The Arabic alphabet. Letters 1 to 28 are the primary letters. Letters 29 to 36 are the modified letters.]] 
[[File:ArabicLetters-28.png|thumb|Table 2: The Arabic alphabet, with modified letters lumped onto their primary forms.]]

Although the full set of Arabic characters includes about ten diacritics as shown in the Figure 1, frequency analysis of Arabic characters is only concerned with computing the frequency of alphabet letters shown in Table 2.

== Sources with over five million letters ==

The following famous Arabic sources are used to generate an acceptable amount of data on which frequency statistics are conducted.

* The first seven volumes of the series البداية والنهاية (''The Beginning and The End'')&lt;ref&gt;

Collectively, these sources add up to 3,378 pages, with 1,297,259 words, and 5,122,132 letters.

"In 1292 the book-trade of Paris consisted of 24 copyists, 17 bookbinders, 19 [[parchment]] makers, 13 [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators]], 8 dealers in [[manuscripts]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]] |location=London |chapterurl= https://archive.org/stream/chamberssency02lond#page/310/mode/1up |volume=2 |chapter= Book-trade |year=1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris in 1470, Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger, and [[Ulrich Gering]] produced the [[Incunable|first printed book]] in France, ''Epistolae'' (letters), by [[Gasparinus de Bergamo]].{{sfn|Claudin|1898}} In 1476 in [[Lyon]] appeared one of the first printed French-language books, ''La Légende Dorée'' ([[Golden Legend]]) by [[Jacobus da Varagine]].

The French royal library began at the [[Louvre Palace ]] in 1368 during the reign of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], opened to the public in 1692, and became the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in 1792. The [[Centre National du Livre]] (Center for the Book) formed in 1946. The {{illm|Salon Livre Paris|fr}} began in 1981.

The history of the book in France has been studied from a variety of cultural, economic, political, and social angles. Influential scholars include [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], and [[Henri-Jean Martin]].

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of the United States.svg|150 px]]}}
'''Corruption in the United States''' is the act of a local, state or federal official using some form of influence or being influenced in some way, typically through [[bribery]]. Corruption is used to the advantage of the government official and a person or group of people.

The [[United States|U.S.]] is the 18th least [[corrupt]] country in the world, according to the 2016 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] by [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Corruption Perceptions Index 2016 | publisher = Transparency International | date = January 25, 2017 | accessdate = April 10, 2017 | url = http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cymer Abbey''' (Welsh: ''Abaty Cymer'') is a ruined [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] near the village of [[Llanelltyd]], just north of [[Dolgellau]], [[Gwynedd]], in north-west [[Wales]], United Kingdom.

== History ==

It was founded in 1158-9 and dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the patronage of [[Maredudd ap Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd]] (d. 1212), Lord of Merioneth (grandson of [[Owain Gwynedd]]), and of his brother, [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]], prince of N. Wales (d. 1200).   It was a daughter house of [[Abbeycwmhir]] in Powys.

The remains of the church and west tower are very plain, but substantial with walls surviving about nave archway height.  It is a simple nave with aisles, lacking northern and southern transepts, and the choir and presbytery are incorporated into the nave.  The abbey has buff sandstone dressings and some red sandstone carvings, but is primarily of local rubble construction.  The foundations  of the cloister and other monastic buildings are visible to the south. The abbot's house remain to the west of the site and have been extensively remodelled as a farmhouse.

Like other Cistercian communities in Wales, Cymer Abbey farmed sheep and bred horses, supplying them to [[Llywelyn ap Iorwerth]], Llewelyn the Great. Llewelyn gifted the Abbey mining rights in 1209. However, despite this the Abbey was not prosperous: it lacked much arable land and had limited fishing rights . In 1291 annual income was  £28 8s 3d. The Welsh Wars of [[Edward I]] (1276–77 and 1282-3) probably contributed to the abbey's relative poverty, for instance the failure to build the usual Cistercian central tower is one indication of this. While Alun John Richards argues that the cooler climate of the 14th century unduly affected the Abbey's lands which were largely mountainous.

The Abbey was a base for the troops of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1275 and 1279. In 1283 Edward I occupied the Abbey and a year later gave the Abbey compensation of £80 for damage caused in the recent wars.

By 1388 the monastery was home to no more than five monks and it seems that there was a marked decline in the standard of religious observance. In the survey of 1535, the annual income of the house was valued at little over £51 and the abbey was dissolved with the smaller monasteries in 1536-7, most likely in March 1537. The monastery was small and relatively unimportant. However, Cymer did possess a fine, thirteenth century silver gilt chalice and paten (Eucharist plate), which must have been hidden  at the Dissolution; rediscovered in 1898,under a stone at Cym-y-mynach, they are now in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff.

A small stream runs south of the cloister, and the site is on the banks of the River Mawddach and lies just above the confluence of the  River Wnion with the Mawddach Cymer; and therefore the monastery was given the full title of Kymer deu dyfyr, which means ‘the meeting of the waters’. It was sited at the lowest ford across the Mawddach.

It is now in the care of [[Cadw]].  As with other monastic sites in England and Wales, the abbey did not survive the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]] of the 1530s, and parts of the fabric were recycled for their dressed stone. Situated next to the surviving farm, the remaining ruins are open to the public on most days of the year.

'''''De Natura Deorum''''' ('''''On the Nature of the Gods''''') is a philosophical dialogue by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] written in 45 BC. It is laid out in three books, each of which discusses the theology of different Roman and [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]. The dialogue uses a discussion of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and [[Platonism|skeptical (Platonist)]] theories to examine fundamental questions of [[theology]].

==Writing==
''De Natura Deorum'' belongs to the group of philosophical works which Cicero wrote in the two years preceding his death in 43 BC.&lt;ref name="brooks1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states near the beginning of ''De Natura Deorum'' that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of [[Julius Caesar]], and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].&lt;ref name="brooks1"/&gt;

The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of [[Gaius Aurelius Cotta]].&lt;ref name="brooks4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue he appears as pontiff, but not as consul.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt; He was made pontiff soon after 82 BC, and consul in 75 BC, and as Cicero, who is present at the dialogue as a listener, did not return from Athens till 77 BC, its fictional date can be set between the years 77 and 75 BC, when Cicero was about thirty years of age, and Cotta about forty-eight.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt;

The book contains various obscurities and inconsistencies which demonstrate that it was probably never revised by Cicero, nor published until after his death.&lt;ref name="brooks5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the content, Cicero borrowed largely from earlier Greek sources.&lt;ref name="brooks5"/&gt; However, the hasty arrangement by Cicero of authorities who themselves wrote independently of one another means that the work lacks cohesion,&lt;ref name="brooks7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and points raised by one speaker are sometimes not countered by subsequent speakers.&lt;ref name="brooks6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The dialogue is on the whole narrated by Cicero himself, though he does not play an active part in the discussion. [[Gaius Velleius]] represents the Epicurean school, [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] argues for the Stoics, and [[Gaius Cotta]] speaks for Cicero's own [[Academic skepticism]]. The first book of the dialogue contains Cicero's introduction, Velleius' case for the Epicurean theology and Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism. Book II focuses on Balbus' explanation and defense of Stoic theology. Book III lays out Cotta's criticism of Balbus' claims. Cicero's conclusions are ambivalent and muted, "a strategy of civilized openness";&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', 2011:69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he does, however, conclude that Balbus' claims, in his mind, more nearly approximate the truth (3.95).

===Book 1===
In Book 1 Cicero visits the house of Cotta the [[Pontifex Maximus]], where he finds him with Velleius &amp;ndash; a Senator and Epicurean, and Balbus supporter of the Stoics. Cotta himself is an Academic, and he informs Cicero that they were discoursing on the nature of the gods. Velleius had been stating the sentiments of [[Epicurus]] upon the subject.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius is requested to go on with his arguments after recapitulating what he had already said.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"/&gt; The discourse of Velleius consists of three parts: a general attack on [[Platonist]] and Stoic cosmology; a historical review of the earlier philosophers; and an exposition of Epicurean theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rackham|first=H.|title=Cicero: De Natura Deorum; Academica|page=xvi|publisher=Loeb Classical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius raises the difficulty of supposing the creation of the universe to have taken place at a particular period of time, and questions the possible motive of a God in undertaking the work.&lt;ref name="brooks6"/&gt; The historical section (10-15), is full of inaccuracies and mis-statements, of which it is likely that Cicero himself was ignorant, since he has Cotta later praise this account.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; The purpose however is for Velleius to show that the Epicurean idea of God as a [[Divine happiness|perfectly happy]], [[God and eternity|eternal being]], possessed of reason, and in human form, is the only tenable one, and the other differing opinions is regarded as proof of their worthlessness.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; In the remainder of the book, Cotta attacks the positions of Velleius with regard to the form of the gods, and their exemption from creation and providence.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 2===
In Book 2, Balbus gives the Stoics position on the subject of the gods.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; He alludes to the magnificence of the world, and the prevalence of belief, and refers to the frequent appearance of the gods themselves in history.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; After referring to the practice of [[divination]], Balbus proceeds to the "four causes" of [[Cleanthes]] as to how the idea of the gods is implanted in the minds of people: (1) a pre-knowledge of future events; (2) the great advantages we enjoy from nature; (3) the terror with which the mind is affected by thunder, tempests, and the like; (4) and the order and regularity in the universe. Balbus further contends that the world, or universe itself, and its parts, are possessed of reason and wisdom.&lt;ref name="dunlop246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally discusses the creation of the world, the [[Divine providence|providence]] of the gods, and denies "that a world, so beautifully adorned, [[Teleological argument|could be formed by chance]], or by a fortuitous concourse of atoms."&lt;ref name="dunlop246"/&gt; The problem of [[Problem of evil|how to account for the presence of misery]] and disaster in a world providentially governed is only hurriedly touched upon at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="brooks8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 3===
In book 3 Cotta refutes the doctrines of Balbus.&lt;ref name="dunlop247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of this book, probably more than one third, has been lost.&lt;ref name="brooks8"/&gt; Cotta represents the appearances of gods as idle tales.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a gap in the text, following which Cotta attacks the four causes of Cleanthes.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"/&gt; Cotta refutes the Stoic ideas on reason attributed to the universe and its parts.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten chapters (16-25) are devoted to a disproportionately lengthy discussion of [[mythology]], with examples multiplied to an inordinate extent.&lt;ref name="brooks9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows another major gap in the text, at the end of which Cotta is seen attacking the doctrine of providential care for humans.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooks9"/&gt; Cicero states "The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta were the truest, but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability."&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Christian writers [[Tertullian]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Lactantius]], and [[Augustine]] were acquainted with ''De Natura Deorum'', and their arguments against polytheism were largely borrowed from it.&lt;ref name="brooks10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, alongside ''[[De Officiis]]'' and ''[[De Divinatione]]'', was highly influential on the [[philosophes]] of the 18th century. [[David Hume]] was familiar with the work and used it to style his own ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=Thomas|title=Spectres of Fasle Divinity: Hume's Moral Atheism|year=2010|page=28|publisher=Oxford Universoty Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] described ''De Natura Deorum'' and the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' as "the two most beautiful books ever produced by the wisdom of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;'Les deux plus beaux ouvrages qu’ait jamais écrits la sagesse qui n’est qu’humaine' [Voltaire, "Cicéron", ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764); ''Œuvres complètes'' (Garnier) 18:181]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 a fourth book was 'discovered' and published by one 'P. Seraphinus' in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="farrer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farrer|first=James Anson|title=Literary Forgeries|pages=10-12|year=1907|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this forgery Cicero asserts many points compatible with Christian and Catholic dogma, and even argues in favour of an authority equivalent to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="farrer"/&gt;

==Scholarship==
This work, although not written by an orthodox Epicurean or Stoic, is important because it supplements the scant primary texts that remain from Epicureans and Stoics discussing their views on religion and theology. In particular, heated scholarly debate has focused on this text's discussion at 1.43-44 of how the Epicurean gods may be said to "exist"; David Sedley, for example, holds that Epicureans, as represented in this text and elsewhere, think that "gods are our own graphic [[Ideal (ethics)|idealization]] of the life to which we aspire",&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sedley]], ''Epicurus’ Theological Innatism.'' In Fish and Saunders 2011: 29-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas David Konstan maintains that "the Epicurean gods are real, in the sense that they exist as atomic compounds and possess the properties that pertain to the concept, or prolēpsis, that people have of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Konstan]], ''Epicurus on the Gods''. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 53-71&lt;/ref&gt;

* There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so. (''{{lang|la|Res enim nulla est, de qua tantopere non solum indocti, sed etiam docti dissentiant; quorum opiniones cum tam variae sint tamque inter se dissidentes, alterum fieri profecto potest, ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest, ut plus una vera sit}}'') (I, 5)

* For time destroys the fictions of error and opinion, while it confirms the determinations of nature and of truth. (''{{lang|la|Opinionis enim commenta delet dies, naturae iudicia confirmat}}'') (II, 2)
* Because all the sick do not recover, therefore medicine is not an art. (''{{lang|la|Ne aegri quidem quia non omnes convalescunt, idcirco ars nulla medicina est}}'') (II, 12)

* Just as it is better to use no [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] whatever in the [[Ancient Rome and wine#Medical uses|treatment of the sick]], because it is rarely beneficial and very often injurious, than to rush upon evident calamity in the hope of an uncertain recovery, so, I incline to think, it would have been better for the human race that that swift movement of thought, that keenness and shrewdness which we call reason, since it is destructive to many and profitable to very few, should not have been given at all, than that it should have been given so freely and abundantly. (''{{lang|la|Ut vinum aegrotis, quia prodest raro, nocet saepissime, melius est non adhibere omnino quam spe dubiae salutis in apertam perniciem incurrere, sic haud scio, an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, sollertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sit multis, admodum paucis salutaris, non dari omnino quam tam munifice et tam large dari.}}'') (III, 69)

Co-authored with [[Stephen Gilson]], DePoy developed Explanatory Legitimacy Theory. They analyze how population group membership is assigned, is based on political purpose, and is met with formal responses that serve both intentionally and unintentionally to perpetuate segregation, economic status quo, and inter-group tension. This theory explains disability as an interactive “ill-fit” between bodies (broadly defined) and environments (broadly defined).

== Biographical informatione ==
DePoy was born in 1950 and grew up in New York. She earned a BS in 1972 and PhD in 1988 from the University of Pennsylvania. She has been teaching in higher education since then in several universities throughout the U.S. 

== Other professional work ==
She is    a principle in ASTOS Innovations, a non-profit corporation devoted to improving equality of access to community resources in local, national, and global environments.  

== Publications ==
In her initial book on disability theory''Rethinking Disability'' (2004, with co-author   [[Stephen Gilson]], she  discussed the essentialist nature of current diversity categories with a particular focus on disability, showing the value foundation and political and economic purpose of “disability category” assignment and social, professional and community response. Her subsequent works, also co-authored with Gilson, include ''The Human Experience'' (2007), applying legitimacy theory to understanding theories of human description and explanation and their purposive, political use in diverse “helping professional” and engineering worlds.

In her most recent writin  she andGilson, apply design theory and practice to the analysis of diversity categories, their membership, and their maintenance. She argues that current approaches to understanding and responding to diversity are grand narratives that advantage the market and professional economy while perpetuating difference and inter-group struggle, truncating social justice and limiting equality of opportunity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2071">'''Foredge shelving''' (or '''fore-edge shelving''') is a [[Bookcase#Library shelving|book shelving]] technique. Books are typically shelved upright with the [[bookbinding|spines]] facing outwards.  However, when a book is too tall to stand upright on a shelf it may be shelved horizontally, i.e., flat, or with the spine resting on the shelf ([[spine shelving]]), or alternatively with the foredge, i.e., the part of the book opposite the spine, resting on the shelf, (foredge shelving).

Foredge shelving may damage the spine and joints of a book. A possible reason for doing it was that leaving the spine facing up makes it easier to see the [[call number]], which is usually located on the spine.

The [[Northeast Document Conservation Center]] (NEDCC) recommends that books should never be stored on the foredge. Instead, it is recommended that either the shelves should be rearranged to accommodate the books standing upright, or the books should be moved to other shelves that can accommodate the books standing upright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.1-storage-methods-and-handling-practices Storage Methods and Handling Practices].

[[File:Francis Hutcheson plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque to Francis Hutcheson on the Guildhall, Saintfield]]
'''Francis Hutcheson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|tʃ|ɪ|s|ən}}; 8 August 1694 – 8 August 1746) was an Irish philosopher born in [[Ulster]] to a family of Scottish [[Presbyterians]] who became known as one of the founding fathers of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. He is remembered for his book "''A System of Moral Philosophy''".

Hutcheson took ideas from [[John Locke]], and he was an important influence on the works of several significant Enlightenment thinkers, including [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].

==Early life==
He is thought to have been born at Drumalig in the parish of [[Saintfield]], [[County Down]], in [[Northern Ireland]]. He was the "son of a Presbyterian minister of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scottish]] stock, who was born in Ireland."&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]] (2011-02-24) [https://mises.org/daily/4942/Francis-Hutcheson-Teacher-of-Adam-Smith Francis Hutcheson: Teacher of Adam Smith], ''[[Mises Institute]]'' (excerpted from ''[[An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Hutcheson was educated at [[Killyleagh]], and went on to Scotland to study at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he spent 1710 to 1718 in the study of philosophy, classics and general literature, and afterwards in the study of [[theology]], receiving his degree in 1712. While a student, he worked as tutor to the [[William Boyd, 3rd Earl of Kilmarnock|Earl of Kilmarnock]].

==Return to Ireland==
Facing suspicions about his "Irish" roots and his association with [[New Licht]] theologian [[John Simson]] (then under investigation by Scottish ecclesiastical courts), a ministry for him in Scotland was unlikely to be a success, so he returned to Ireland to pursue a career in academia. He was induced to start a private academy in [[Dublin]], where he taught for 10 years, also studying philosophy and produced during 1725 ''Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue''. This writing is written as two treatises; the subject of the first is aesthetics (''Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design''), and the second, morality (''Concerning Moral Good and Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/hutcheson.htm Ulster History Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511012538/http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/hutcheson.htm |date=11 May 2012 }} Retrieved 2012-05-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dh0vlzDNNwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue: In Two Treatises 1.Concerning Beauty,Order,Harmony,Design  2.Concerning Moral Good and Evil] J. and J. Knapton, 1729. Retrieved 2012-05-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Oxford%20Companion%20to%20Philosophy&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions The Oxford Companion to Philosophy] Oxford University Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0198661320}} Retrieved 2012-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; In Dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants. Among these was [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] and [[Most Reverend|Most Rev.]] [[Doctor (title)|Dr]] [[William King (archbishop)|William King]], the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Lord Archbishop of Dublin]], who refused to prosecute Hutcheson in the Archbishop's Court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence. Hutcheson's relations with the clergy of the established church, especially with Archbishop King and with [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] and [[Most Reverend|Most Rev.]] [[Doctor (title)|Dr]] [[Hugh Boulter]], [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Lord Archbishop of Armagh]], seem to have been cordial, and his biographer, speaking of "the inclination of his friends to serve him, the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotion",{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} etc., probably refers to some offers of preferment, on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination.

In 1725 Hutcheson married his cousin Mary, daughter of Francis Wilson of Longford. Her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of Drumnacross, Garrinch, and Knockeagh, in County Longford. They had seven children of whom only one survived, also called [[Francis Hutcheson (songwriter)|Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Biography, "Francis Hutcheson" by James Moore, retrieved 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in Dublin, Hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known: ''Inquiry concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony and Design'', and ''Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil'', in 1725, the ''Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections'' and ''Illustrations upon the Moral Sense'' in 1728. The alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in 1726. To the period of his Dublin residence are also to be referred the ''Thoughts on Laughter'' (1725) (a criticism of [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and the ''Observations on the Fable of the Bees'', being in all six letters contributed to ''Hibernicus' Letters'', a periodical that appeared in Dublin (1725–1727, 2nd ed. 1734). At the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the ''London Journal'' with Gilbert Burnet (probably the [[Gilbert Burnet (pamphleteer)|second son]] of [[The Right Reverend|The Rt. Rev.]] [[Doctor (title)|Dr]] [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Bishop of Salisbury|Lord Bishop of Salisbury]]) on the "True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness". All these letters were collected in one volume (Glasgow, 1772).

==Chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow==
In 1729, Hutcheson succeeded his old master, [[Gershom Carmichael]], in the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|Chair of Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], being the first professor there to lecture in English instead of Latin.&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt; It is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously, but their authorship appears to have been well known. In 1730, he entered on the duties of his office, delivering an inaugural lecture (afterwards published), ''De naturali hominum socialitate'' (About the natural fellowship of mankind). He appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies; "''non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem Academiam me, suum olim alumnum, in libertatem asseruisse audiveram''."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} (I was, therefore, moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when I had heard that my [[alma mater]] had delivered me, its one time [[alumnus]], into freedom.) Yet the works on which Hutcheson's reputation rests had already been published. During his time as a lecturer in Glasgow College he taught and influenced [[Adam Smith]], the economist and philosopher. "[T]he order of topics discussed in the economic portion of Hutcheson’s System [of Moral Philosophy, 1755] is repeated by Smith in his Glasgow Lectures and again in the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Scott | first = William Robert | contribution = Hutcheson's economics and his relation to Adam Smith | editor-last = Scott | editor-first = William Robert | title = Francis Hutcheson: his life, teaching and position in the history of philosophy | pages = 234–35 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1900 | isbn = 9780559151927 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was likely something other than Hutcheson's written work that had such a great influence on Smith. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents of Glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations. His roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures, which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives (appropriately acquiring the epithet, preacher of philosophy). Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson", a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend [[David Hume]] and influential mentor, Hutcheson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = William Robert | title = The never to be forgotten Hutcheson: excerpts from W.R.

==Other works==
In addition to the works named, the following were published during Hutcheson's lifetime: a pamphlet entitled ''Considerations on Patronage'' (1735); ''Philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria, ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens'', lib. iii. (Glasgow, 1742); ''Metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens'' (Glasgow, 1742). The last work was published anonymously. After his death, his son, [[Francis Hutcheson (songwriter)|Francis Hutcheson]] published much the longest of his works, ''A System of Moral Philosophy, in Three Books'' (2 vols.. London, 1755). To this is prefixed a life of the author, by Dr [[William Leechman]], professor of divinity in the University of Glasgow. The only remaining work assigned to Hutcheson is a small treatise on Logic (Glasgow, 1764). This compendium, together with the ''Compendium of Metaphysics'', was republished at Strassburg in 1722.

Thus Hutcheson dealt with [[metaphysics]], [[logic]] and [[ethics]]. His importance is, however, due almost entirely to his ethical writings, and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in Dublin. His standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect; he is in strong opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Bernard de Mandeville|Mandeville]], and in fundamental agreement with [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays. Obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue, the functions assigned to the moral sense, the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature, and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare.

==Ethics==
According to Hutcheson, man has a variety of senses, internal as well as external, reflex as well as direct, the general definition of a sense being "any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will, and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain" (Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, sect. 1). He does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these "senses," but, in various parts of his works, he specifies, besides the five external senses commonly recognized (which he hints might be added to):
# consciousness, by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind (''Metaph. Syn. pars'' i. cap. 2)
# the sense of beauty (sometimes called specifically "an internal sense")
# a public sense, or ''sensus communis'', "a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery"
# the moral sense, or "moral sense of beauty in actions and affections, by which we perceive virtue or vice, in ourselves or others"
# a sense of honour, or praise and blame, "which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure, and their dislike, condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame"
# a sense of the ridiculous. It is plain, as the author confesses, that there may be "other perceptions, distinct from all these classes," and, in fact, there seems to be no limit to the number of "senses" in which a psychological division of this kind might result.

Of these "senses," the "[[moral sense theory|moral sense]]" plays the most important part in Hutcheson's ethical system. It pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections, approving those that are virtuous, and disapproving those that are vicious. "His principal design," he says in the preface to the two first treatises, "is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue, to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions, and accordingly to regulate its conduct. The weakness of our reason, and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature, are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent, and their contraries pernicious. The Author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine, by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies. He has made virtue a lovely form, to excite our pursuit of it, and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action."

Passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage, as well as the assumption that the "moral sense" has had no growth or history, but was "implanted" in man exactly as found among the more civilized races (an assumption common to both Hutcheson and [[Joseph Butler|Butler]]), his use of the term "sense" tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement. For, as established by [[David Hume|Hume]], this act consists of two parts: an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good, and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad. By the intellectual part of this process, we refer the action or [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] to a certain class; but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of (apparently) the same class excited in us on former occasions.

Even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous, uniform and exempt from error, the former is not. All mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good, but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits. Hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action, and does not ignore it, even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action. Nonetheless, Hutcheson, both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation, has done much to favour that loose, popular view of morality which, ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection, encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements.

The term "moral sense" (which, it may be noticed, had already been employed by Shaftesbury, not only, as [[William Whewell]] suggests, in the margin, but also in the text of his ''Inquiry''), if invariably coupled with the term "moral judgement," would be open to little objection; but, taken alone, as designating the complex process of moral approbation, it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors. For, if each person's decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense, why be at any pains to test, correct or review them? Or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible? And how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies, and the observable changes in a person's own views? The expression has, in fact, the fault of most metaphorical terms: it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest.

But though Hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately, he does not, like Butler, conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard. The test or criterion of right action is with Hutcheson, as with Shaftesbury, its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind. He thus anticipates the utilitarianism of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]—and not only in principle, but even in the use of the phrase "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" (''Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil'', sect. 3). Hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle. Intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results, and Hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption. Connected with Hutcheson's virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra, proposed for the purpose of "computing the morality of actions." This calculus occurs in the ''Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil'', sect. 3.

Hutcheson's other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the "benevolent theory" of morals. Hobbes had maintained that all other actions, however disguised under apparent sympathy, have their roots in [[self-love]]. Hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions, but, by a not unnatural recoil, that it is the only source of those actions of which, on reflection, we approve. Consistently with this position, actions that flow from self-love only are morally indifferent. But surely, by the common consent of civilized men, prudence, temperance, cleanliness, industry, self-respect and, in general, the personal virtues", are regarded, and rightly regarded, as fitting objects of moral approbation.

This consideration could hardly escape any author, however wedded to his own system, and Hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system, and may thus be, in part, an object of his own benevolence (Ibid), a curious abuse of terms, which really concedes the question at issue. Moreover, he acknowledges that, though self-love does not merit approbation, neither, except in its extreme forms, did it merit condemnation, indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of self-love is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society. To press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task.

The vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in Hutcheson's professedly ethical works. But, in the ''Synopsis metaphysicae'', he touches on it in three places, briefly stating both sides of the question, but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the Stoics, in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the Peripatetics. This is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by Hobbes and [[John Locke|Locke]] (to the latter of whom Hutcheson refers in a note), namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind, and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will, not the liberty of willing as we will. Though, however, his leaning is clear, he carefully avoids dogmatising, and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise.

It is easy to trace the influence of Hutcheson's ethical theories on the systems of Hume and [[Adam Smith]]. The prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes, is undoubtedly due to the influence of Hutcheson. To a study of the writings of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson we might, probably, in large measure, attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by Hume, and, if this be the case, the name of Hutcheson connects itself, through Hume, with the names of [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[William Paley|Paley]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]. [[Joseph Butler|Butler]]'s ''Sermons'' appeared in 1726, the year after the publication of Hutcheson's two first essays, and there are parallels between the "conscience" of the one writer and the "moral sense" of the other.

==Death==

Francis Hutcheson spent time in Dublin, and died while on a visit to that city in 1746. He is buried in the churchyard of Saint Mary’s, which is also the final resting place of his cousin William Bruce. Today Saint Mary’s is a public park located in what is now Wolfe Tone Street. Many United Irishmen would have revered the memory of Francis Hutcheson. Some of the leaders of the Dublin United Irishmen are remembered in the street and place-names of the city.
Most Dubliners can direct a visitor to Wolfe Tone Street, Oliver Bond Street, Russell Street, Lord Edward Street and Emmet Road. ‘Never to be forgotten Hutcheson’ lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the Dublin he loved and ‘where his best work was done’.

==Mental philosophy==

In the sphere of mental philosophy and logic Hutcheson's contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy. They are interesting mainly as a link between Locke and the Scottish school. In the former subject the influence of Locke is apparent throughout. All the main outlines of Locke's philosophy seem, at first sight, to be accepted as a matter of course. Thus, in stating his theory of the moral sense, Hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas (see, for instance, ''Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil'', sect. I ad fin., and sect. 4; and compare ''Synopsis Metaphysicae'', pars i. cap. 2). At the same time he shows more discrimination than does Locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression, and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine (''Syn. Metaph.'' pars i. cap. 2).

All our ideas are, as by Locke, referred to external or internal sense, or, in other words, to sensation and reflection. It is, however, a most important modification of Locke's doctrine, and connects Hutcheson's mental philosophy with that of [[Thomas Reid|Reid]], when he states that the ideas of extension, figure, motion and rest "are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses"; that the idea of self accompanies every thought, and that the ideas of number, duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever (see ''Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions'', sect. i. art. I; ''Syn. Metaph''. pars i. cap. 1, pars ii. cap. I; Hamilton on Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;124, note). Other important points in which Hutcheson follows the lead of Locke are his depreciation of the importance of the so-called laws of thought, his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies, the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things ("''intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae''"), though they excite various ideas in us, and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas (''Syn. Metaph''. pars i. cap. I), though, at the same time, we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas.

Hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct (''Syn. Metaph''. pars i. cap. 1). Of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves God alone can be assigned as the cause. This similitude has been effected by Him through a law of nature. "''Haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio, sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur, non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur, quam ipse Deus, qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit, Ut notiones, quae rebus praesentibus excitantur, sint ipsis similes, aut saltem earum habitudines, si non veras quantitates, depingant''" (pars ii. cap. I). Locke does speak of God "annexing" certain ideas to certain motions of bodies; but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by Hutcheson, which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of [[Nicolas Malebranche]] as of those of Locke.

Amongst the more important points in which Hutcheson diverges from Locke is his account of the idea of personal identity, which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness. The distinction between body and mind, ''corpus'' or ''materia'' and ''res cogitans'', is more emphatically accentuated by Hutcheson than by Locke. Generally, he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body, though, in the posthumous work on ''Moral Philosophy'', he expressly states that we know mind as we know body" by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown (bk. i. ch. 1). The distinction between perception proper and sensation proper, which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out (see Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics, – Lect. 24).

Hamilton's edition of [[Dugald Stewart]]'s Works, v. 420 (the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes, the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty) (severely criticized in Sir W Hamilton's ''Lectures on Metaphysics'' Lect. xii.) and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which Hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of Locke. The last point can hardly fail to suggest the "common-sense philosophy" of Reid.

Thus, in estimating Hutcheson's position, we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to Locke, but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his Scottish successors.

The short ''Compendium of Logic'', which is more original than such works usually are, is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains. In these parts of the book Hutcheson mainly follows Locke. The technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over, and the book is readable. It may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgment-proposition, that he constantly employs the word "idea," and that he defines [[logical truth]] as "''convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis''" (or "''propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis''," ''Syn. Metaph.'' pars i. cap. 3), thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic.

==Aesthetics==

Hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics. His speculations on this subject are contained in the ''Inquiry concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony and Design'', the first of the two treatises published in 1725. He maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty, harmony and proportion. This is a reflex sense, because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing. It may be called an internal sense, both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing, and because "in some other affairs, where our external senses are not much concerned, we discern a sort of beauty, very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects, and accompanied with like pleasure" (''Inquiry'', etc., sect. 1, XI). The latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths, in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions. Thus, the analogy between beauty and virtue, which was so favourite a topic with Shaftesbury, is prominent in the writings of Hutcheson also. Scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing. But to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that Hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application, insisting on there being "a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects, antecedent to all custom, education or example" (see Inquiry, etc., sects. 6, 7; Hamilton's ''Lectures on Metaphysics'', Lect. 44 ad fin.).

Hutcheson's writings gave rise to much controversy. To say nothing of minor opponents, such as "Philaretus" (Gilbert Burnet, already alluded to), Dr John Balguy (1686–1748), prebendary of Salisbury, the author of two tracts on "The Foundation of Moral Goodness", and Dr John Taylor (1694–1761) of Norwich, a minister of considerable reputation in his time (author of ''An Examination of the Scheme of Amorality advanced by Dr Hutcheson''), the essays appear to have suggested, by antagonism, at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of English ethics—Butler's ''Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue'', and [[Richard Price]]'s ''Treatise of Moral Good and Evil'' (1757). In this latter work the author maintains, in opposition to Hutcheson, that actions are – in themselves right or wrong, that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis, and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding. We thus see that, not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth, the system of Hutcheson, or at least the system of Hutcheson combined with that of Shaftesbury, contributed, in large measure, to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics.

==Later scholarly mention==
References to Hutcheson occur in histories, both of general philosophy and of moral philosophy, as, for instance, in pt. vii. of Adam Smith's ''Theory of Moral Sentiments''; [[James Mackintosh|Mackintosh]]'s ''Progress of Ethical Philosophy''; [[Victor Cousin|Cousin]], ''Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale du XVIII' siècle''; Whewell's ''Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy in England''; [[Alexander Bain|A Bain]]'s ''Mental and Moral Science''; [[Noah Porter]]'s Appendix to the English translation of [[Ueberweg]]'s ''History of Philosophy''; [[Sir Leslie Stephen]]'s ''History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Gentury'', etc. See also [[James Martineau|Martineau]], ''Types of Ethical Theory'' (London, 1902); WR Scott, ''Francis Hutcheson'' (Cambridge, 1900); Albee, ''History of English Utilitarianism'' (London, 1902); T Fowler, ''Shaftesbury and Hutcheson'' (London, 1882); [[James McCosh|J McCosh]], ''Scottish Philosophy'' (New York, 1874). Of Dr Leechman's Biography of Hutcheson we have already spoken. [[John Veitch (poet)|J. Veitch]] gives an interesting account of his professorial work in Glasgow, ''Mind'', ii. 209–12.

The '''Hayford ellipsoid''' is a [[geodesy|geodetic]] [[reference ellipsoid]], named after the US [[geodesist]] [[John Fillmore Hayford]] (1868-1925), which was introduced in 1910. The Hayford ellipsoid was also referred to as the '''International ellipsoid 1924''' after it had been adopted by the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] IUGG in 1924, and was recommended for use all over the world. Many countries retained their previous ellipsoids.

The Hayford ellipsoid is defined by its [[semi-major axis]] '''a = 6,378,388.000''' and its [[flattening]] '''f = 1:297.00'''. Unlike some of its predecessors, such as the [[Bessel ellipsoid]] (a = 6,377,397 m, f = 1:299,15), which was a European ellipsoid, the Hayford ellipsoid also included measurements from [[North America]], as well as other continents (to a lesser extent). It also included [[Statically indeterminate|isostatic]] measurements to reduce [[plumbline]] divergences. Hayfords ellipsoid did not reach the accuracy of [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|Helmerts]] ellipsoid published 1906 (a = 6378 200 m ; Erdabplattung f = 1 : 298.3).

It has since been replaced as the "International ellipsoid" by the newer [[Lucerne ellipsoid]] (1967), [[GRS 80]] (1980) and [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]] (1984).

'''Henry Jenner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA}} (8 August 1848 – 8 May 1934) was a British scholar of the [[Celtic languages]], a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] cultural activist, and the chief originator of the [[Cornish language]] revival.

Jenner was born at [[St Columb Major]] on 8 August 1848. He was the son of [[Henry Lascelles Jenner]], who was one of two curates to the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[St. Columb Major]], and later consecrated though not enthroned as the first [[Anglican Diocese of Dunedin#Jenner controversy|Bishop of Dunedin]] and the grandson of [[Herbert Jenner-Fust]].&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news | title = Obituary: Mr. Henry Jenner (transcription) | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1934/Obituary/Henry_Jenner | publisher = [[The Times]] | location = London | page = 19; col A | date =  Thursday, 10 May 1934; Issue 46750 | accessdate = 20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 Jenner became a clerk in the Probate Division of the High Court and two years later was nominated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Primate at Canterbury]] for a post in the Department of Ancient Manuscripts in the [[British Museum]], his father then being the Rector of [[Wingham, Kent|Wingham]], a small village near Canterbury.

==Interest in the Cornish language==
His earliest interest in the [[Cornish language]] is mentioned in an article by [[Robert Morton Nance]] entitled "Cornish Beginnings",&lt;ref&gt;page 368, ''Old Cornwall'', Volume V, Number 9'' published in 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|When Jenner was a small boy at [[St. Columb Major|St. Columb]], his birthplace, he heard at the table some talk between his father and a guest that made him prick up his ears, and no doubt brought sparkles to his eyes which anyone who told him something will remember. They were speaking of a Cornish language. At the first pause in their talk he put his query... 'But is there really a Cornish Language?' and on being assured that at least there had been one, he said 'Then I'm Cornish—that's mine!'}}

[[File:Jennerplaque.jpg|thumb|200px|Plaque at St Columb Major, on the site of the old vestry where his father worked (now called Bond House, in Market Square)]]
In 1874 Henry Jenner continued his interest in [[Celtic languages]], and in 1875 he read a paper to the [[Philological Society]] in London, his subject being the [[Manx language]]. The following year he read another paper on the subject of the [[Cornish language]] at [[Mount's Bay]]. In 1877 he discovered, whilst working in the [[British Museum]], forty two lines of a [[medieval]] play written in Cornish around the year 1450.

In 1903 he was made Bard of the [[Goursez Vreizh|Breton Gorsedd]], and along with [[L.C.R. Duncombe-Jewell]] he jointly founded the first Cornish language society, "Cowethas Kelto-Kernuak". The following year Jenner and Duncombe-Jewell took Cornwall's application for membership of the [[Celtic Congress]], then meeting in [[Caernarfon]]. His [[Bardic name]] was ''Gwas Myghal'' ('Servant of Michael').

Shortly afterwards he published ''A Handbook of the Cornish language'' and the [[Cornish language revival]] began. His version of Cornish was based upon the form of the language used in West Cornwall in the 18th century, although his pupil [[Robert Morton Nance]] would later steer the language revival towards mediaeval Cornish.

At a time when many people thought the Cornish language had died Jenner observed&lt;ref&gt;''Rebuilding the Celtic languages'' By Diarmuid O'Néill (Page 222)&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|'' There has never been a time when there has been no person in Cornwall without a knowledge of the Cornish language …  The reason why a Cornishman should learn Cornish, the outward and audible sign of his separate nationality, is sentimental, and not in the least practical, and if everything sentimental were banished from it, the world would not be as pleasant a place as it is.''}}

In 2010, [[Michael Everson]] published a new edition entitled ''Henry Jenner's Handbook of the Cornish Language'', which contains modern [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic transcriptions to make clear to modern readers what phonology Jenner was recommending. The book also contains three essays written by Jenner thirty years prior to the 1904 publication, as well as some examples of a number of Christmas and New Years cards sent out by Jenner containing original verse by him in Cornish and English.&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Henry. 2010.

==Family==
Jenner married Kitty Lee Rawlings in 1877 (she was a novelist and author of non-fiction under the name Kitty Lee).&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. B. (1974) ''The Cornish Language''. London: Routledge; pp. 144, 223&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of Henry and Katherine, including much information about the context in which their work appeared, was published in 2004 by Derek R. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Derek R., editor.

London: Francis Boutle. {{ISBN|978-1-903427-19-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political leanings==
Jenner was a [[Tory]] and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]. He and his wife supported the Order of the White Rose (OWR), a society of [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] sympathizers of which he was chancellor. He also actively supported ''The Royalist'', a journal which ran from 1890 to 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|title=Henry Jenner|author=P. W. Thomas|date=May 2005|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75066|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

[[File:DSCN1082JennerPlaque.jpg|thumb|Commemorative Plaque on the home of the Jenners in Hayle]]

Thomas, "Jenner, Henry (1848–1934)", [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], online edn,[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75066], (accessed 19 August 2007), for more information on both Henry and Kitty Jenner.&lt;/ref&gt; retired to [[Hayle]], his wife's home town, and in January 1912 he was elected as the Librarian of the [[Morrab Library]], a post he held until 1927. He also served as President of both the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]] and of the [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Thomas, 'Jenner, Henry (1848–1934)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], online edn, Oxford University Press, May 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75066  accessed 15 Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner had married Kitty Lee Rawlings, herself a novelist and writer on art,&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=oQLMSCLDlc9km9UmmpFj8g&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=20 December 2008|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 8 May 1934 and is buried in [[St. Uny's Church, Lelant]].

Before he died, he said: "The whole object of my life has been to inculcate into Cornish people a sense of their Cornishness."

He contributed to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] with articles on [[Catholic Liturgical Rites]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;Articles on the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04479a.htm Liturgical use of Creeds], the [[Celtic Rite]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03493a.htm], [[Mozarabic Rite]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10611a.htm], [[East Syrian Rite]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14413a.htm], [[Ambrosian rite|Ambrosian Liturgy and Rite]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01394a.htm], the [[Gallican Rite]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06357a.htm] at the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10375">The '''International Congress on Medieval Studies''' is an annual [[academic conference]] held for [[scholars]] specializing in, or with an interest in, [[medieval studies]]. It is sponsored by [[Western Michigan University]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] and is held during the first half of May. The Congress is the largest annual gathering in the field, regularly attracting over three thousand registered participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kristen | last = Shamus | title = Education in every direction| publisher = [[Detroit Free Press]]| date = June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Meehan | last = Chris | title = Medievalists make annual Kalamazoo pilgrimage | publisher = [[Kalamazoo Gazette]] | date = May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 50th annual conference took place in 2015.

== History ==
In 1962, the newly established Institute for Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University organized a biennial gathering known as the Conference on Medieval Studies. By 1970, participation had grown significantly and the gathering was made an annual affair. Unusual for the time, the organizers issued [[call for papers|calls for papers]] which were open to all in the field who were interested, including graduate students (see '''Scope and Participation''', below).&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/about-us/history.html | accessdate = June 18, 2007 | title = A Brief History of the Medieval Institute | publisher = Western Michigan University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719105950/http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/about-us/history.html | archivedate = July 19, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the program of the 50th Congress, John Sommerfeldt reminisces about the inception of the humble conference as a place where "bright young scholars could be heard."&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeldt, John (2015), "A Remembrance," ''50th International Congress on Medieval Studies'' Western Michigan University (xxii).&lt;/ref&gt; The torch, as Sommerfeldt puts it, has been carried respectably by subsequent directors of the Medieval Institute of Western Michigan University, with increasing numbers of participants and insightful new approaches to medieval studies. The directors, following John Sommerfeldt, include [[Otto Gründler]], [[Paul E. Szarmach]], [[James M. Murray]], and the newly appointed [[Jana Schulman]].

In 1973, the Institute for [[Cistercian]] Studies was established at Western Michigan, and began to hold its annual Cistercian Studies Conference as a sub-set of the International Congress on Medieval Studies.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

The [[Medieval Academy of America]] has held its annual meetings at the Congress in 1974 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medievalacademy.org/annualmeetings/annualmeetingpast.htm | publisher = Medieval Academy of America | accessdate = June 18, 2007 | title = Medieval Academy of America Past Annual Meetings | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192204/http://www.medievalacademy.org/annualmeetings/annualmeetingpast.htm | archivedate = September 27, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy began sponsoring a [[plenary session]] in 1992 and maintains a committee for this purpose.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.medievalacademy.org/committees/committee_kalamazoo.htm | publisher = Medieval Academy of America | accessdate = June 18, 2007 | title = Medieval Academy of America Kalamazoo Program Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The Congress is typically held during the first or second week of May, and runs from Thursday morning through Sunday afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/ | title = International Congress on Medieval Studies | accessdate = June 14, 2007 | work = Medieval Institute | publisher = [[Western Michigan University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most events are held on the West Campus of Western Michigan University.

An [http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/Assets/pdf/congress/Thurs07.pdf excerpt]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the schedule of the 42nd International Congress on Medieval studies, held in May 2007, illustrates the structure and events of the Congress as described below.

=== Sessions ===
Sessions form the bulk of the activity at the Congress.&lt;ref name = "Schedule"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/Assets/pdf/congress/Thurs07.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = June 14, 2007 | title = 42nd International Congress on Medieval Studies Schedule for May 9th and 10th | publisher = Western Michigan University}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main types of sessions:
*The vast majority of sessions are '''presentations of research'''. These sessions typically consist of between two and four presentations given by scholars in the field who present papers or other updates on the findings of their current research. Each of these sessions is organized around a theme under which the constituent presentations fit.
*A minority of sessions are organized as '''roundtable discussions''', in which a discussion on a predetermined topic takes place in at least a partially spontaneous manner. Short, prepared presentations are sometimes given as part of the roundtable.
*A few sessions are organized as '''workshops''', in which attendees are active participants. These focus on the teaching and practice of new skills.

Many sessions have a sponsoring group, although individuals or the Congress may organize sessions. Many of the sessions are sponsored by academic associations, universities, or publishers, while others are arranged by ''ad hoc'' groups which are interested in a particular topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/Assets/pdf/congress/Sponsor_Index.pdf |title=42nd International Congress on Medieval Studies Index of Sponsoring Organizations |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |publisher=Western Michigan University |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately six hundred sessions are held across twelve different time slots during the four days. Each session is scheduled to last ninety minutes.

=== Plenary Lectures ===
Two plenary lectures are given during the conference, at the beginning of the day on Friday and Saturday.

=== Exhibits Hall ===
The exhibits hall is open during the length of the Congress, and is composed primarily of book publishers selling their latest titles in the field of medieval studies. A minority of the hall also features handcrafts, music, and foodstuffs for sale. In 2007, approximately seventy exhibitors participated.&lt;ref name="WMUNews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2007/05/010.html | title = More than 3,000 expected to attend medieval congress | work = WMU News | publisher = Western Michigan University | accessdate = June 14, 2007 | date = May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meetings ===
The Congress serves as a rare chance for international societies of medieval specialists to gather in person, and dozens of business meetings are conducted during breaks between sessions. Many groups use the opportunity to plan for their presentations later in the summer at the [[International Medieval Congress]] held at [[Leeds University]].

=== Entertainment and Attractions ===
The Congress typically features a film festival, screening movies which have a medieval setting or theme. There are also performances of medieval music and theater.&lt;ref name=WMUNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2004/0404/0304-359.html | title = Medieval congress draws scholars from around world| work = WMU News | publisher = Western Michigan University | accessdate = June 18, 2007 | date = April 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WMUNews2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2003/0305/0203-329.html  | title = Medievalists make annual pilgrimage to Kalamazoo| work = WMU News | publisher = Western Michigan University | accessdate = June 18, 2007 | date = May 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some participating organizations sponsor social gatherings in the form of wine hours or open bar receptions.

There are also demonstrations, to foster an understanding of material culture, that vary from year to year. Past demonstrations have included a trebuchet, a longboat, and most recently, a demonstration of blacksmithing.

The annual meeting of medievalists corresponds with the nesting of swans at Goldsworth pond, located at the very heart of the conference. Most years Congress ends before the eggs have hatched, but the 50th Congress was late enough that medievalists got to enjoy watching the cygnets get their sea legs. [[File:Swan nest.JPG|thumb|Swan nest at Goldsworth Pond.]] [[File:Swans and cygnets.JPG|thumb|Swans and cygnets at the 50th International Congress on Medieval Studies.]]

== Scope and Participation ==
The Congress is very broad in scope, being open to all topics related to the medieval period and to participants from any background. This has served to set it apart from other meetings in the field.&lt;ref name=WMUNews2 /&gt; Topics may range from discussions of [[mysticism]], [[numismatics]], and medieval [[Latin]], to modern medieval-themed video games, the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and the teaching of medieval studies in the classroom.

Such being the case, participants come from a broad variety of educational backgrounds. Most are professors and graduate students, but a significant minority is composed of architects, monks, undergraduate students, fiction authors, and other independent scholars and enthusiasts. Presenters are not necessarily experts in medieval history; scholars of literature, theater, religion, and art frequently give presentations.&lt;ref name=Schedule /&gt;

* [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] Society,
* [[Methodist Church in India|Methodist Church of South Asia]] Society,
* [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] Society,

* [[Church of India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon]] Society, Diocese of [[Diocese of Nandyal|Nandyal]]&lt;ref&gt;The Diocese of Nandyal was under the ecclesiastical purview of the Anglican Church and later the Church of North India at the time of formation of the College.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=O_hq6JUSLToC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=diocese%20of%20nandyal%20church%20of%20north%20india&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=diocese%20of%20nandyal%20church%20of%20north%20india&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society

The Commission Report was tabled before the Board of Governors of the College Society which eventually led to the building&lt;ref&gt;James A. Bergquist, P. Kambar Manickam, ''The Crisis of Dependency in Third World Ministries: A Critique of Inherited Missionary Forms in India'', Christian Literature Society, Madras, 1976, pp. 50, 63.[https://books.google.com/books?id=HPEcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kretzmann+commission&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kretzmann]&lt;/ref&gt; up of curriculum-intensive courses&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; and the equipping of the [[Seminarians]] with capacities to lead the [[Christian Church|Church]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  Theological education took an upward rise with the Kretzmann Commission Report.  The Kretzmann Commission was enabled with the assistance of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]] and the Board of World Missions of the [[Lutheran Church in America]].&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  The Secretary of the Board of Governors, [[W. D. Coleman]] on behalf of the Board of Governors published a 1,000&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; copies to be circulated among the Churches in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].

A couple of years before the Kretzmann Commission was constituted, [[Seminarians]] deliberated on the Church's mission with special reference to [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  In 1966, a graduate thesis was undertaken by a candidate studying at [[Serampore College]], [[Serampore]] entitled ''The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in [[Andhra Pradesh]]''&lt;ref&gt;G.

* [[The Right Reverend|The Rt. Rev.]] C. S. Sundaresan, [[Bishop]] - in - [[Diocese of Rayalaseema|Rayalaseema]], [[Church of South India]]

==Findings==
The Commission members met during various points of time during the latter half of 1969,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; first on 25 October 1969 to draw up a plan and again a month later during 26–29 November to summarize its findings.  The members of the Commission met at different places for visitation and consultation.  As part of field visits,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; the members had been to,

* [[St. John's Regional Seminary|St. John's Regional Seminary (Theologiate)]], [[Ramanthapur]],
* [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]],
* Lutheran Bible Training Institute, [[Rajahmundry]].

In addition, the members of the Commission also had special consultations&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; with [[Canon Emani Sambayya]], [[Dr.]] P. David [[Ph.D.]] ([[Yale University|Yale]]) and [[The Reverend|Rev.]] Erik W. Nielsen.  As for the background material, the Commission members accessed scholarly action reports relating&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society, especially the papers of [[B. V. Subbamma]], [[S. W. Schmitthenner]], [[W. P. Peery]] and James A. Bergquist, the papers of the [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], the [[National Council of Churches in India]] and other papers.  The Commission took cognizance of the concerns of the Church in [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telangana]] included).

The Commission also devised a structured questionnaire&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; for use among two kinds of respondents, the Church Leaders and the Old Students, during field visits.

==Outcome==
At the very outset, the Commission recommended for [[Indian people|Indian]] Teachers&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to be placed in Seminaries to take up theological curriculum, especially for the core subjects in theology.  The Commission further recommended that theological education broaden its horizons in keeping up with the changing times.  Based on the recommendations of the Commission, the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] did away with the erstwhile [[Licentiate in Theology]] programme and embarked on two graduate programmes,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; namely, the [[Bachelor of Theology]] and the [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degrees.  As part of the curruculum study, the Commission Members foresaw the need to include [[Worship]], Social Analysis, [[Inter-faith]], [[gender]] concerns, [[inculturation]], [[Psychology]], Language [[Usability]], personal devotion, [[Sociology]] and many other inter-disciplinary courses.&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  In the ensuing [[decade]], the Faculty Members were able to upgrade their academics at national and international [[Universities]] and returned to teach in the College who include,&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ACTC tower.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Bell Tower of the Protestant Regional Theologiate in [[Hyderabad]], the present campus of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].]] --&gt;

Many of these Teachers also played a role at the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] and subsequent curriculum revisions at the University level.  In 1985, a [[Content analysis]] of theological [[syllabi]] being taught at the [[Seminaries]] in the country was undertaken by the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, [[Bangalore]].

[[File:Bode Museum marfil bizantino. 22.JPG|thumb|The Virgin crowning an Emperor, assisted by the archangel Gabriel]]
The '''Leo Scepter''' is a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[ivory]] work of art, usually and erroneously identified as a scepter tip.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, Anthony. "The Hand of The Master: Craftsmanship, Ivory, and Society in Byzantium (9th-11th Centuries)" ''Princeton University Press''. Princeton, NJ. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally accepted to be from the 9th century, the piece is now part of the collection of the [[Berlin State Museums]]. It must be added that the date and identification of this ivory, although probable, are not indisputable. Various historians have suggested that the piece, carved with religious [[iconographies]] and inscriptions, such as the name of an [[Emperor]] Leo, had been made during the reign of [[Leo VI the Wise]] ({{reign|886–912}}), and was probably handled in public ceremonies as a symbol of imperial and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Kathleen. "The Ivory Scepter of Leo VI: A Statement of Post-Iconoclastic Imperial Ideology". The Art Bulletin, Vol.60, No.3. 1978. Pp 407-416. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Weitzmann]] on the other hand proposed that this ivory may have been made during the reign of [[Leo V the Armenian]] ({{reign|813–820}}). However, a recent analysis of the content of its inscriptions has shown that the connection with the coronation of Leo V is unjustified.&lt;ref name="Cutler200"&gt;Cutler, Anthony."The Hand of The Master: Craftmanship, Ivory, and Society in Byzantium (9th-11th centuries)" p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original function==
Scholars have argued about the original function of this ivory, whether it was the tip of a scepter, or the grip on the lid of a casket containing a crown. However, recent scholars have argued that the ivory was in fact a ceremonial comb made probably for the Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Paul. "Byzantine World". New York. ed. Routledge. 2010. p. 305. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Leo Ivory is the largest known ivory work of art made under the [[Macedonian Renaissance]]. It measures 10.2 x 10.0 x 2.1 centimeters, and it is carved in all four sides. The piece contains a dowel hole measuring 3.2 centimeters into its base, which some experts have suggested  was perhaps attached to something else, and was designed to be handled.&lt;ref name="Cutler200"/&gt;

==Manufacture==
While references in Byzantine texts to ivory after the sixth century are few, various historians have suggested that early Christian ivories such as the ivory plaque with the coronation of Emperor Leo VI's son, [[Constantine VII]] Prophyrogenitos, were made in an urgent effort to erase their peasant origins from the public memory, to legitimate the power of the Macedonian dynasty, and to communicate to the Byzantine society the ideology that their kingship was the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, Robin. "Byzantine Art". Oxford History of Art. Oxford University Press. 2000. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The scarcity of ivory in the area, and its significance in the art of the Byzantine Empire and Church certainly encouraged its production.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Harold and Antonia Bostrom. "Ivories". ''The Oxford Companion to western Art''. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. ''Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
The iconography carved in the front of the comb represents Christ in the center, surrounded by St. [[Saint Peter|Peter]] on his left and St. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] on his right. The iconography on the back represents the Virgin [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] crowning an Emperor, probably Leo VI, and assisted by the angel [[Gabriel]]. By this image of coronation, various experts have suggested the explicit willingness to show the divine approval of the imperial power on earth. Others have suggested that the ceremonial comb was made perhaps in order to celebrate the coronation of the Emperor Leo VI. However, due to the significance of the [[Psalms]] in the [[Byzantine liturgy]] of [[Pentecost]], the three inscriptions bearing the Psalms 20 and 44 suggest that the comb was made perhaps for the celebration of [[Pentecost]]. The arches, niches, and windows carved on the ivory suggest a striking resemblance with the interior architecture of the east end of the [[Hagia Sophia]] cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Helen C. and William D. Wixom. "The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of The Middle Byzantine Era'. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York. 1997.p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miquela Sousa''', better known as '''Lil Miquela''', is a fictional character created by [[Yung Skeeter|Trevor McFedries]] and Sara Decou as a digital art project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/brud.fyi/|title=Brud (@brud.fyi) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7964899/virtual-instagram-miquela-controversy-interview|title=Virtual It-Singer Miquela Says 'Controversy Doesn't Mean Anything': Interview|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Highsnobiety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorsler|first1=Fabian|title=Meet Lil Miquela: Fashion’s First Virtual Instagram Influencer|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-virtual-influencer-instagram/?format=amp|website=Highsnobiety|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPEBEAST"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Isaac|title=Miquela Sousa Is Fashion's First Computer Generated Influencer|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/miquela-sousa-first-computer-generated-fashion-influencer?amp=1|website=HYPEBEAST|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Samantha|title=This Instagram Influencer Is Not Even Human|url=http://footwearnews.com/2018/influencers/technology/miquela-sousa-instagram-virtual-influencer-491637/amp/|website=FN|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miquela is an [[Instagram]] model and music artist claiming to be from [[Downey, California]].

The project began in 2016 as an [[Instagram]] profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lilmiquela-instagram_uk_57c94056e4b085cf1ecdc0af|title=Instagram's Latest 'It' Model Is Confusing The Hell Out Of Everyone|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also details a fictional narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and Decou.

In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7898117/miquela-virtual-singer-instagram-not-mine-song-stream|title=Virtual Singer &amp; Internet Star Miquela Shares Debut Single 'Not Mine'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pivot into a music has been compared to virtual musicians [[Gorillaz]] and [[Hatsune Miku]].&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Origins==
Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick for ''[[The Sims]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Online presence==
Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including [[Diplo]], [[How to Dress Well]], killerandasweetthang founder Eileen Kelly, [[Molly Soda]], [[Nile Rogers]], and [[Samantha Urbani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/|title=*~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and BBC.com.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a [https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI phone interview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shane|title=CONSPIRACY THEORIES &amp; INTERVIEW WITH LIL MIQUELA|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She appeared on the cover of High Snobiety in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-cover-story-issue-16/|title=Meet Lil Miquela, the AI Influencer on the Cover of Our New Print Issue|website=High Snobiety|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Miquela did an Instagram takeover for Prada as part of Milan Fashion Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/prada-instagram-gifs-lil-miquela|title=Prada Launches Instagram GIFs With Help From a Fictional It Girl|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online narratives===
In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving [https://www.instagram.com/blawko22 @Blawko22], and [https://www.instagram.com/bermudaisbae/ @BermudaIsBae], two other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhuruzXHetm/?taken-by=bermudaisbae|title=Bermuda on Instagram: "More emotional than I thought it would be. Despite it all, there’s only three of us out there and we need to stick together. We talked it…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkjEPEuFdp0/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So I pull up to the trail and there she is. No rattlesnakes. No hiking. Just a robot sitting on the curb in skinny jeans and wedges.  She said it’s the only way she could get my attention since I haven’t answered her texts since we went to the mall a couple weeks back.  She just wanted to hang out.  So here we are 'hanging out.'"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BjvhTbylRcD/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So, Brud programmed my memories, claiming I’m from a place called Downey.  It’s right in-between Los Angeles and Disneyland.  Even though that sounds like a dream to me, I had to come check it out for myself..."|website=Instagram|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Miquela has released several singles since her debut with "Not Mine," including "You Should be Alone," "Over You," and a collaboration with [[Baauer]] titled "Hate Me." Her musical style is characterized by the use of [[auto-tune]] and [[trap music|trap]]-influenced production. Her music has been released on [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]]. Miquela's sound is purportedly based off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, [[Evil Dead]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="992">A '''''longa''''' ({{lang-ar|'''لونجا'''}}) is a Turkish / Eastern European dance, that was later introduced into [[Arabic music]] and is often performed at the end of a ''[[muwashshah]]''.

It generally uses an ''[[iqa']]'' equivalent to 2/4, with several sections called ''khanat''&lt;!--need Arabic script; is it خانت?--&gt; (singular ''khana''),&lt;!--Is the Arabic خانة?--&gt; each followed by a ''[[taslim]]'' ([[refrain]]). The last ''khana'' is generally in 3/4.

A common form of ''longa'' is ''longa Riad in Nahawand scale'' ('''لونجا نهاوند''') which is composed by Riad el-Sonbaty in the ''[[Arabic maqam|maqam]] Nahawand''.

'''Mahmutbey Mosque''' is a historical mosque in [[Kasaba, Kastamonu|Kasaba]]  village in [[Kastamonu Province]], [[Turkey]]

Kasaba was once an important settlement in Kastamonu Province. Now it is a small village about {{convert|18|km}} to [[Kastamonu]]. But the historical mosque of the village  at {{coord|41|28|48|N|33|41|17|E}} is an important cultural building of the province.
==The mosque==
It was commissioned by Mahmut Bey, a member of [[Isfendiyarids|Candarid]] house in 1366. The mosque is unique in its building style for no cement is used in the construction (except for the [[mihrab]]). The roof too was constructed without using any metal element. (In fact it is also known as ''Çivisiz camii'' meaning "mosque without nail") &lt;ref name="KT"/&gt;The plan of the mosque is rectengular. It is one of the first wood columned and wood roofed mosques in Anatolia. The exterior of mosque was constructed by hewn stone. Ceiling of the building stands on four pillars. Inside of the mosque all the wood surfaces decorated with plant-dye ornaments called ''kalem işi'' (literally "pencil work"). &lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;The portal of the mosque which was a masterpiece of art however is now kept in the Kastamonu Museum.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;[http://www.kastamonukultur.gov.tr/TR,93964/mahmutbey-camii.html Ministry of Culture page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; A replica of the original portal has been mounted in its place.

==World Heritage Site status==
The mosque was added to the tentative list in the cultural category of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] on April 15, 2014.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5904/ Unesco page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Friedländer''' (April 29, 1833 – December 10, 1910) was an [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and principal of [[Jews' College]], [[London]].  He is best known for his [[English language|English]] translation of [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'', which was the most popular such translation until the more recent work of [[Shlomo Pines]], and still remains in print.

==Biography==
Friedländer was born at [[Jutrosin|Jutroschin]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]].  His early secular education was at a local [[Catholic school]], and his Jewish education came from attendance of a [[Cheder]], and from his father, who was a [[talmudist]] and [[Hebrew grammarian]].  He then attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], while continuing his Jewish studies under Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph Oettinger]] and Rabbi [[Elchanan Rosenstein]].

In 1856, he began studies in classical languages and mathematics at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Halle/Saale]] (Ph.D. 1862), and concurrently with his university studies he pursued [[Talmudic]] learning. Settling in Berlin, he was appointed principal of the Talmud school, which position he resigned in 1865 to accept that of principal of Jews' College, London, in succession to [[Barnett Abrahams]].  There he taught theology, biblical and rabbinical exegesis, Talmud, Jewish history, mathematics, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

He retired from this position in 1907, and died on December 10, 1910.  His son-in-law was [[Moses Gaster]] (1856–1939), the [[Hakham]] of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese congregation]], [[London]], and a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Linguistics|linguist]].

==Works==
[[Image:Freidlander perplexed.png|thumb|200px|Title page of ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' by Moses Maimonides, translated from the original Arabic text by '''M. Friedländer''', Ph.D., Pardes Publishing House, 1946.]]

Friedländer displayed considerable literary activity. He authored a few dozen articles for the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]. As a member of the [[Society of Hebrew Literature]] he published under its auspices:
*''The Commentary of [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]'', translated into English with extensive annotations (available on Google Books)
*''An [[Essay]] on the Writings of Ibn Ezra''
*A translation from the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]], with notes, of [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Guide of the Perplexed]]'' (1881).
*''The Jewish Religion'' (1890, American edition: 1946)
*[[German language|German]] commentary upon the [[Song of Songs]] (1867).

He also edited a ''Jewish Family Bible'' in English and Hebrew, compiled a ''Handbook of the Jewish Religion,'' made calculations on the [[Hebrew calendar]], and contributed articles to the ''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]],'' the ''Dictionary of National Biography,'' and other publications. Numerous papers read by him at Jews' College and elsewhere have been published.

'''New England French''' ({{lang-fr|français de Nouvelle-Angleterre}}) is a variety of [[Canadian French]] spoken in the [[New England]] region of the United States.&lt;ref name=Ammon&gt;{{cite book |title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties |last= Ammon|first= Ulrich|authorlink= |author2=International Sociological Association |year= 1989|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|location= |isbn= 0899253563|pages= 306–308|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New England French is one of the major forms of the [[French language]] that developed in what is now the United States, the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly extinct [[Missouri French]], [[Muskrat French]] and [[Métis French]].

The dialect is the predominant form of French spoken in New England (apart from standard French), except in the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John Valley]] of northern [[Aroostook County, Maine]], where [[Acadian French]] predominates.

The dialect is endangered, but its use is supported by bilingual education programs in place since 1987.&lt;ref name=Ammon/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

== Literary ==
[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]
{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human’s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

====Examples====
The first verse of ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]];
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The first four lines of ''[[On the Ning Nang Nong]]'' by [[Spike Milligan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/190291.stm |title=Top poetry is complete nonsense |publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
On the Ning Nang Nong
Where the cows go Bong!
and the monkeys all say BOO!
There's a Nong Nang Ning
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The first verse of ''Spirk Troll-Derisive'' by [[James Whitcomb Riley]];&lt;ref name="ANA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8nons10.txt|title=A Nonsense Anthology|date=1 November 2005|publisher=|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
The Crankadox leaned o'er the edge of the moon,
And wistfully gazed on the sea
Where the Gryxabodill madly whistled a tune
To the air of "Ti-fol-de-ding-dee."
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The first four lines of ''The Mayor of Scuttleton'' by [[Mary Mapes Dodge]];&lt;ref name="ANA"/&gt;
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
The Mayor of Scuttleton burned his nose
Trying to warm his copper toes;
He lost his money and spoiled his will
By signing his name with an icicle quill;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly'' by [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]]; a creation of [[Douglas Adams]]
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturations are to me
As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts
With my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter’s book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.

'''Singapore''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Singapore.ogg|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|(|g|)|ə|p|ɔːr}}), officially the '''Republic of Singapore''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: {{Native name|ms|Republik Singapura|paren=omit}}; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{Native name|zh|新加坡共和国|italics=off|paren=omit}}; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: {{Native name|ta|சிங்கப்பூர் குடியரசு|italics=off|paren=omit}}), is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[city-state]] and [[island country]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. It lies one degree ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], at the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]], with [[Indonesia]]'s [[Riau Islands]] to the south and [[Peninsular Malaysia]] to the north. Singapore's territory consists of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]] along with [[List of islands of Singapore|62 other islets]]. Since independence, extensive [[land reclamation]] has increased its total size by 23% ({{Convert|130|km2|disp=or}}). The country is known for its transition from [[Third World|third world]] to [[First World|first world]] in a single generation, under the leadership of its founding father, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=His fighting spirit helped S'pore leap from Third World to First |url= https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/his-fighting-spirit-helped-spore-leap-third-world-first |work=Today |location= Singapore |date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stamford Raffles]] founded [[Founding of modern Singapore|colonial Singapore]] in 1819 as a trading post of the [[British East India Company]]. After the company's [[Sepoy Rebellion of 1857|collapse]] in 1858, the islands were ceded to the [[British Raj]] as a crown colony. During the [[Second World War]], Singapore was [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupied by Japan]]. It gained independence from the UK in 1963 by federating with other former British territories to form [[Malaysia]], but separated two years later over [[Singapore in Malaysia|ideological differences]], becoming a sovereign nation in 1965. After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]] and despite lacking natural resources and a [[hinterland]], the nation developed rapidly as an [[Asian Tiger]] economy, based on external trade and its [[workforce]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of Singapore}}
The English name of Singapore is an [[anglicisation]] of the native [[Malay language|Malay]] name for the country, ''{{lang|ms|Singapura}}'', which was in turn derived from [[Sanskrit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411060419/http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 April 2001 |title=Singapore |publisher=bartleby.com |accessdate=14 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[wikt:सिंहपुर|सिंहपुर]], &lt;small&gt;[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]&lt;/small&gt;: ''Siṃhapura''; ''siṃha'' is "lion", ''pura'' is "town" or "city"), hence the customary reference to the nation as the ''Lion City'', and its inclusion in many of the nation's symbols (e.g., its coat of arms, Merlion emblem). However, it is unlikely that [[lion]]s ever lived on the island; [[Sang Nila Utama]], the [[Srivijaya]]n prince said to have founded and named the island ''Singapura'', perhaps saw a [[Malayan tiger]]. There are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name is firmly established.&lt;ref name="turnbull"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819–2005 |author= C.M.

This was itself a transliteration from the [[Malay language|Malay]] name ''"[[Pulau Ujong]]"'', or "island at the end" (of the [[Malay Peninsula]]).&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web| title = Singapore: History, Singapore 1994  | url = http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/singapore/Singapore-History.html | publisher=Asian Studies @ University of Texas at Austin | accessdate =7 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070323095958/http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/Singapore/Singapore-History.html |archivedate = 23 March 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stamford Raffles|Raffles]] arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port.  The island was then nominally ruled by the [[Sultan of Johor]], who was controlled by the Dutch and the [[Bugis]]. However, the [[Sultanate]] was weakened by factional division and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman's elder brother [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Tengku Long]] who was living in [[exile]] in [[Riau Islands|Riau]]. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore.

Singapore was not much affected by [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–18), as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia.  The only significant event during the war was a [[1915 Singapore Mutiny|mutiny]] by the [[Muslim]] [[sepoys]] from British India who were garrisoned in Singapore, which occurred in 1915.  After hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was a Muslim state, the soldiers rebelled. They killed their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-Muslim troops arriving from [[Johore]] and [[Burma]].

After the First World War, the British built the large [[Singapore Naval Base]] as part of the defensive [[Singapore strategy]]. Originally announced in 1923, the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931. When completed in 1939, at the very large cost of $500 million, it boasted what was then the largest [[dry dock]] in the world, the third-largest [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]], and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns stationed at [[Fort Siloso]], [[Fort Canning]] and Labrador, as well as a [[Royal Air Force]] airfield at [[Tengah Air Base]]. [[Winston Churchill]] touted it as the "[[Gibraltar]] of the East" and military discussions often referred to the base as simply "[[East of Suez]]". Unfortunately, it was a base without a fleet. The [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. However, after [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BH88kpvyrdYC&amp;pg=PA90|title=Marshall of Singapore: A Biography|author=Kevin Tan |isbn=978-9812308788|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] invaded [[British Malaya]], culminating in the [[Battle of Singapore]]. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 February 1942, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called the defeat "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/15/newsid_3529000/3529447.stm|title=On This Day&amp;nbsp;– 15 February 1942: Singapore forced to surrender|accessdate=1 May 2007|work=BBC News|date=15 February 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; British losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured, in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in Malaya.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}} About 5,000 were killed or wounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-singapore |title=Battle of Singapore |publisher=World History Group |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which Australians made up the majority.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=248}} Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}}{{refn|The break down of British Empire losses included 38,496 United Kingdom, 18,490 Australian, 67,340 Indian and 14,382 local volunteer troops.

After the [[Japanese surrender]] to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for [[Southeast Asia Command]], returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General [[Itagaki Seishiro]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including harbor facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]]. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.&lt;ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"&gt;{{cite web

The failure of Britain to successfully defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. The decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the slogan ''[[Merdeka]]'', or "independence" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.&lt;ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/&gt; On 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled in the following year.&lt;ref name="micaSelfGovernment"&gt;{{cite web | title = Towards Self-government | url = http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm  | publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate =18 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, Chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the [[Malayan Emergency]]. The [[1954 National Service Riots]], [[Chinese middle schools riots]], and [[Hock Lee bus riots]] in Singapore were all linked to these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/12405/19.htm |title=Communism |website=Thinkquest |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082203/http://library.thinkquest.org/12405/19.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], pro-independence leader of the [[Labour Front]], won Singapore's first general election in 1955.

During the [[Singaporean general election, 1959|May 1959 elections]], the People's Action Party won a landslide victory. Singapore became an internally self-governing state within the Commonwealth, with [[Lee Kuan Yew]] as its first Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="yewnyt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Headliners; Retiring, Semi|date=2 December 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD123DF931A35751C1A966958260|accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the 1959 general elections were the first after full internal [[History of Singapore#Self-government (1955–1963)|self-government]] was granted by the British authorities. Singapore was not yet fully independent, as the British still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations. However, Singapore was now a recognised [[nation-state|state]]. [[Governor of Singapore|Governor]] Sir [[William Allmond Codrington Goode]] served as the first [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]] (Head of State), and was succeeded by [[Yusof bin Ishak]].&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

===Campaign for merger===
[[File:Lee Kuan Yew.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the first Prime Minister, is also recognised as Singapore's founding father.]]

Despite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya due to strong ties between the two nations. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries, thus solving the ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} This is because the ruling party of Malaya, [[United Malays National Organisation]], was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. UMNO, who were initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the PAP government and were concerned that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended, changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists. On 27 May 1961, Malaya's Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], made a surprise proposal of a [[Federation of Malaysia]], comprising existing [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]] and the British Borneo territories of [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA: Wipe out extremists |date=18 February 1959 |newspaper= Singapore Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.&lt;ref name=countrystudies10/&gt; The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appeal To Singapore |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19620328-1.2.70.1?ST=1&amp;AT=advanced |newspaper=The Straits Times |location= Singapore |page=10 |date=28 March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|1962 Merger Referendum]] provided options for a merger with Malaysia, but no option for avoiding the merger. As a result, on 16 September 1963 [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore]] joined with the [[Federation of Malaya]], the [[Crown Colony of Sarawak]] and the [[Crown Colony of North Borneo]] to form the new federation of [[Malaysia]] under the terms of the [[Malaysia Agreement]]. Given Singapore's limited size and lack of natural resources, it was felt integrating with Malaya would provide a route to stronger economic development. The merger would also give the PAP legitimacy, and remove the threat of communist government over Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/1dab53ea-788c-461c-acfb-ca625b974c9c |title=Singapore becomes part of Malaysia |publisher=HistorySG |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after the merger, the Singapore state government and the Malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues, and communal strife culminated in the [[1964 race riots in Singapore]].

There were many [[People's Action Party–United Malays National Organisation relations|heated ideological conflicts between the two governments]], even on the economic front. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. Because of this, on 7 August 1965, the then [[Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Road to Independence"&gt;{{cite news |title=Road to Independence |url= http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/merger.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131013002423/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/merger.html |archivedate=13 October 2013 |publisher= [[AsiaOne]]|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 (with Singaporean delegates not present) to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for Singapore to separate from the Federation of Malaysia.

Because of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and [[amphibious warfare]] is often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access. This also avoids risk to the main island and the city. However, large-scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area, and since 1975 have been performed in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="country-data" /&gt; Training is also held in about a dozen other countries.

===Reclamation===
{{main|Land reclamation in Singapore}}

Ongoing [[land reclamation]] projects have increased Singapore's land area from {{convert|581.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the 1960s to {{convert|721.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2018, an increase of some 23% (130&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="sand1"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21645221-asias-mania-reclaiming-land-sea-spawns-mounting-problems-such-quantities-sand |title=Such quantities of sand |date=28 February 2015 |work=The Economist |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is projected to grow to {{convert|766|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}} by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MND Land Use Report |url=https://www.mnd.gov.sg/landuseplan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more functional islands, as has been done with Jurong Island.&lt;ref name="earthshots.usgs.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/earthshots/node/11#ad-image-20 |title=Earthshots: Satellite Images of Environmental Change: Singapore |publisher=Earthshots |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of sand used in reclamation is found in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. In 2010 Singapore imported almost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to Singapore in recent years. As a result, in 2016 Singapore switched to using [[polder]]s - a [[Netherlands]] solution - to reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped dry.

===Climate===
Singapore has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Af'') with no distinctive seasons, uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. Temperatures usually range from {{convert|22|to|35|°C|°F}}. While temperature does not vary greatly throughout the year, there is a wetter [[monsoon]] season from November to January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/weather-climate/climate/weather-statistics|title=Singapore National Environment Agency Weather Statistics|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July to October, there is often [[Southeast Asian haze|haze]] caused by [[bush fire]]s in neighbouring Indonesia, usually from the island of [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=12078 |title=Singapore enveloped by Sumatran smog |last=Bond |first=Sam |work=Edie newsroom |date=2 October 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Singapore does not observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST), it follows the GMT+8 time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/timezone.html |title=Why is Singapore in the 'Wrong' Time Zone? |author=Mok Ly Yng |publisher=National University of Singapore |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused the sun to rise and set particularly late during January and February periods, where the sun rises at 7:20am and sets around 7:25pm. During July, the sun sets at around 7:15pm, similar to other cities at much higher latitudes such as [[Taipei]] and [[Tokyo]]. The earliest the sun sets and rises is October and November, when the sun rises at 6:45am and sets at 6:50pm.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Singapore}}
Singapore has a highly developed [[market economy]], based historically on extended [[entrepôt]] trade. Along with [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]], Singapore is one of the original [[Four Asian Tigers]], but has surpassed its peers in terms of GDP per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

===Information and communications===
Information and communications technologies (ICT) is one of the pillars of Singapore's economic success. However, Singapore's mass communications networks, including television and phone networks, have long been operated by the government. When Singapore first came online, Singaporeans could use Teleview to communicate with one another, but not with those outside of their sovereign city-state. Publications such as ''The Wall Street Journal'' were censored.&lt;ref name="sandfort"/&gt;

As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle's market value, and bid for a Singaporean [[Certificate of Entitlement]] (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade. The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would buy a [[Porsche Boxster]] in the United States. Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="BloombergBMW"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-16/bmw-3-series-costs-260-000-as-singapore-tax-keeps-cars-for-rich.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220044725/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-16/bmw-3-series-costs-260-000-as-singapore-tax-keeps-cars-for-rich.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 February 2011 |title=BMW Costing $260,000 Means Cars Only for Rich in Singapore as Taxes Climb |work=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York |accessdate=2 July 2011 |first=Kristine |last=Aquino |date=17 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most Commonwealth countries, vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatsingapore.com/content/view/1147|title=Once you're here: Basic Road Rules and Regulations|publisher=Expat Singapore|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Singapore}}

Access to water is universal, affordable, efficient and of high quality.
Integrated water management approaches such as the reuse of [[reclaimed water]],
the establishment of protected areas in urban rainwater catchments and the use of estuaries as freshwater reservoirs have been introduced along with seawater [[desalination]] to reduce the country's dependence on water imported from neighbouring Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/singaporewaterstory |title= Singapore Water Story |author= Public Utilities Board |date= 2018 |access-date= 17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure, but it also emphasises proper legislation and
enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development.&lt;ref name="Luan"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ivy Ong Bee Luan |title= Singapore Water Management Policies and Practices |journal= International Journal of Water Resources Development |year= 2010 |volume= 26 |issue=1 |pages= 65–80 |doi= 10.1080/07900620903392190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1819, it served as a trading port for British ships on their way to India. Being a major trading hub and its close proximity to its neighbour Malaysia, Singapore was prone to many foreign influences, both from Britain and from other Asian countries. Chinese and Indian workers moved to Singapore to work at the harbour. The country remained a British colony until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultire in Singapore|url=https://www.internations.org/singapore-expats/guide/16085-culture-shopping-recreation/local-customs-and-culture-in-singapore-16077|website=InterNations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the Peranakans who pledged their loyalties to Singapore, most of the labourers' loyalties lay with their respective homelands of Malaysia, China and India.

The ''literature of Singapore'' or ''SingLit'' comprises a collection of literary works by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country's four official languages: [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. It is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works has been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal ''Singa'', published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including [[Edwin Thumboo]] and [[Koh Buck Song]], as well as in multilingual anthologies such as ''Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry'' (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each into the three languages. A number of Singaporean writers such as [[Tan Swie Hian]] and [[Kuo Pao Kun]] have contributed work in more than one language, although such cross-linguistic fertilisation is becoming increasingly rare.

The city-state has a burgeoning food scene ranging from hawker centres (open-air), food courts (air-conditioned), coffee shops (open-air with up to a dozen hawker stalls), cafes, fast food, simple kitchens, casual, celebrity and high-end restaurants.&lt;ref name=streetfood/&gt; Every day, 2 new restaurants open daily in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two new restaurants open daily in Singapore: ACRA|url=http://sbr.com.sg/food-beverage/news/two-new-restaurants-open-daily-in-singapore-acra|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious dietary strictures exist - Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef, and there is also a significant group of vegetarians. For most events, organisers will be mindful of them and cater food that is acceptable to all or provide choices for the ethnic minorities. The [[Singapore Food Festival]] which celebrates Singapore's cuisine is held in July annually.

====Hawker Centres====
Prior to the 1980s, [[street food]] were mainly sold by immigrants from China, India and Malaysia to other immigrants seeking a familiar taste. In Singapore, street food has long migrated into [[hawker centre]]s with communal seating areas. Typically, these centres have a few dozen to hundreds of food stalls, with each specialising in a single or a number of related dishes. The choices are almost overwhelming even for locals.&lt;ref name=fodor&gt;{{cite news|last=Fieldmar|first=James|title=Singapore's Street Food 101|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/street-food-in-singapore-6276.html|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=Fodor's|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=streetfood&gt;{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Rowena|title=Singapore's best street food ... just don't order frog porridge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/10204790/Singapores-best-street-food-...-just-dont-order-frog-porridge.html|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cooked food that originates from or still sold on streets can be found in many countries, the variety and reach of centralised hawker centres that serve heritage street food in Singapore is unmatched elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hawker2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kong |first1=Lily |title=Singapore Hawker Centres : People, Places, Food |date=2007 |publisher=SNP |location=Singapore |isbn=978-9812481498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, there are 114 hawker centres spread across the city centre and heartland housing estates. They are maintained by the [[National Environment Agency]], which also grade each food stall for hygiene. The largest hawker centre is located on the second floor of Chinatown Complex with over 200 stalls.&lt;ref name="Hawker2007" /&gt; The complex is also home to the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world - a plate of soya-sauce chicken rice or noodles for S$2 (US$1.50). Two street food stalls in the city are the first in the world to be awarded a Michelin star each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Singapore |title=Michelin star for Singapore noodle stall where lunch is half the price of a Big Mac |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/04/michelin-star-for-singapore-noodle-stall-where-lunch-is-half-the-price-of-a-big-mac |work=the Guardian |date=4 August 2016 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local food items generally belong to a particular ethnicity - Chinese, Malay and Indian; but diversity of cuisine has increased further by the "hybridisation" of different styles (e.g., the [[Peranakan cuisine]], a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion can also be noted when traditionally Malay hawker stalls also sells Tamil food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. This continues to make the cuisine of Singapore significantly rich and a cultural attraction.&lt;ref name="Foodways" /&gt;

====Fine-Dining====
At the high-end of the fine dining scene are a dozen international [[celebrity chef]] restaurants, many located within the [[integrated resort]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The top celebrity chef restaurants to visit in Singapore |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/celebrity-chefs-opening-restaurants-in-singapore-three-more-to-look-out-for |website=sg.asia-city.com |location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport and recreation===
{{Main|Sport in Singapore}}

The development of private sports and recreation clubs began in the 19th century colonial Singapore, such as the Cricket Club, Singapore Recreation Club, Singapore Swimming Club, Hollandse Club and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/sports-education/history-of-singapore-sports|title=History of Singapore Sports|website=Sport Singapore|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's table tennis women team reached their peak as silver medalists at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. They were also world champions in 2010 when they beat China at the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Russia, breaking the latter's 19-year winning streak. Weightlifter [[Tan Howe Liang]] was Singapore's first Olympic medalist, winning a silver at the 1960 Rome Games.

Singapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being overly regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name="freedomhouse_a" /&gt; Self-censorship among journalists is said to be common.&lt;ref name="BBC Media" /&gt; In 2014, Singapore dipped to its lowest ranking ever (153rd of 180 nations) on the [[Press Freedom Index]] published by the French [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://index.rsf.org/#!/index-details|title= 2015 World Press Freedom Index|year= 2015|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media Development Authority]] regulates Singaporean media, claiming to balance the demand for choice and protection against offensive and harmful material.&lt;ref name="Mica"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mica.gov.sg/mica_business/b_media.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060910233826/http://www.mica.gov.sg/mica_business/b_media.html|archivedate=10 September 2006 |title= Media: Overview|date=16 March 2005|publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private ownership of TV satellite dishes is banned.&lt;ref name="BBC Media" /&gt; In 2016, there were an estimated 4.7&amp;nbsp;million internet users in Singapore, representing 82.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Users by Country (July 2016 estimate)|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/|website=Internet Live States|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=July 2016|quote=Elaboration of data by International Telecommunication Union (ITU), United Nations Population Division, Internet &amp; Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), World Bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://opennet.net/research/profiles/singapore|title=Singapore|publisher=OpenNet Initiative|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it maintains a list of one hundred websites—mostly pornographic—that it blocks as a "symbolic statement of the Singaporean community's stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_622871.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119042223/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_622871.html |archivedate=19 January 2011|title=Impossible for S'pore to block all undesirable sites|author=Wong, Tessa |work=The Straits Times |location =Singapore |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the block covers only home internet access, users may still visit the blocked websites from their office computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.asiaone.com/Digital/News/Story/A1Story20080523-66562.html |title= MDA bans two video-sharing porn sites |date=23 May 2008 |author= Chua Hian Hou |work=The Straits Times |location =Singapore |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524215638/http://www.asiaone.com/Digital/News/Story/A1Story20080523-66562.html |archivedate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Statue of A'a from Rurutu''' is a famous wooden sculpture of the god A'a that was made on the [[Pacific]] island of [[Rurutu]] in the [[Austral Islands|Austral archipelago]]. In the early nineteenth century, the sculpture was given by the islanders to the [[London Missionary Society]] to mark their conversion to Christianity. Following this, it was brought back to England to be displayed, first in the museum of the LMS and then in the British Museum. The figure of A'a is famous as one of the finest surviving pieces of Polynesian sculpture, and in the twenty-first century the sculpture is, according to Julie Adams, curator of the Oceania collection at the British Museum "an international celebrity".{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=19}}

==Description==
The statue of A'a is a wooden [[anthropomorphic]] figure, 117&amp;nbsp;cm high and 36&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name=BM-Aa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=502783&amp;partId=1|title=A'a|publisher=British Museum|access-date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, in the estimation of [[Alfred Gell]], "arguably the finest extant piece of Polynesian sculpture".{{sfn|Gell|1998|p=137}} The figure is hollow, and has a removable back panel allowing access to the interior.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=34}} The sculpture's arms are carved in high relief; its legs are separated and slightly bent.{{sfn|Lavondès|1996|p=314}} The figure has no feet or base, and it is unknown if it did when it was created. The lower legs, right buttock, and left arm of the sculpture are damaged, and the penis has been broken off completely. While the other damage could be the result of deterioration over time, the severing of the figure's penis appears to have been deliberate, though it is not known whether it was by British missionaries or Polynesian converts.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=30}}

Thirty smaller figures are carved on the surface of the statue.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=34}} Many of these are positioned to mark features on the human body, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, though some do not obviously correspond with any human feature.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=38}} The figures are carved in two distinct styles; sixteen of the figures are upright with arms over the torso, while fourteen lie spread-eagled, with arms and legs outstretched. Possibly these two distinct styles of figure are intended to represent male and female forms respectively.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=35–36}} These figures are symmetrically distributed across A'a, with the exception of those on the lower abdomen, where there is an upright figure on the right side of A'a and a splayed figure on the left. It is not clear whether this asymmetry was deliberate.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=39}}

==History==
The earliest records of A'a date to 1821, when the statue was presented to the missionaries of the LMS on [[Ra'iatea]], the second largest of the [[Society Islands]] in French Polynesia.{{sfn|Hooper|2007|p=134}} It had been brought there from Rurutu, where it was made.{{sfn|Hooper|2007|p=131}} The sculpture itself could be much older: [[radiocarbon dating]] carried out in 2015 suggests that A'a was created between 1591 and 1647.&lt;ref name=BM-Aa/&gt; According to Rurutuan tradition, A'a is made from the wood of the [[pua keni keni]] (''Fagraea berteriana'') that is native to islands in the eastern Pacific, though tests conducted in 2015 suggested that the figure is in fact made from [[sandalwood]], possibly ''Santalum insulare''.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=24}} A'a was probably made using stone-bladed tools, though if it was made after the arrival of Europeans to Polynesia in the 1760s iron tools may also have been used in its construction. Ray or shark skin rasps, breadfruit leaves, cowrie shells and coconut oil would have been used to finish and polish the statue.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=32–33}}

According to a Rurutuan tradition, A'a was carved by Amaiterai, who had visited London and encountered the Christian god there. The cavity originally, according to this story, held three figures, representing the three elements of the [[Trinity]] – God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Gell|1998|p=137}} It has been suggested that Amaiterai in this story was in fact [[Omai]], who in 1774 had become the second Pacific Islander known to visit Europe. The name "Amaiterai", the legendary creator of A'a, may be a corruption of "Omaiterai", or "Omai the Great".{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=22–23}}

In 1821, A'a was given to missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] based on the island of Ra'iatea, as a symbol of the islanders' conversion to Christianity.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=10–14}} It was sent back to London by these missionaries, and became part of the collection of the LMS museum. From 1890, the LMS loaned much of their collection of [[Oceanic art|Polynesian art]], including A'a, to the British Museum; in 1911 the Museum acquired the sculpture.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=15–16}} It is not currently on display in the museum, but since the 1980s has been exhibited around the world, including in New York, Canberra, Paris, and London.&lt;ref name=BM-Aa/&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Cook Islands carved wood figure, British Museum.jpg|thumb|Other Polynesian god figures, including this one from Rarotonga, have the same large heads, rounded bellies, and smaller human figures on the torso that are distinctive characteristics of A'a.]]
The works acquired by the British Museum from the London Missionary Society make up some of the best-known works of Polynesian art, including A'a.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=15}} A'a itself, though part of a corpus of Polynesian god-figures with features such as the smaller figures on the body, large head, and rounded stomach, is according to Julie Adams "recognized by experts as a unique figure in Polynesian art".{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=9}} A [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|god figure from Rarotonga]], also in the collection of the British Museum, has three male humanoid figures carved in high relief on its torso, similar to those which cover A'a.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=36}}

==Purpose==
When A'a was brought to the LMS missionaries in 1821, 24 "small gods" were found inside its cavity. It has long been believed that A'a was originally constructed to hold these small gods.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=42}} However, the size and shape of the cavity suggest that it was originally created to hold some other objects – an assortment of small gods could have equally been housed in a much simpler cavity.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=44–45}} Anthropologist Steven Hooper argues that in fact A'a was originally created as a casket to house the bones of a revered ancestor; the small gods were only placed into A'a for ease of transport to Ra'iatea.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=46}}

==Identification==
[[File:The Rev. John Williams, the Martyr of Erromanga, with a landscape of the Mission House and grounds of Rarotonga.jpg|alt=portrait|thumb|[[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], who witnessed the presentation of the sculpture to the LMS, identified it as the god A'a.]]
[[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], one of the missionaries who witnessed A'a being presented to the LMS on Ra'iatea, identified the sculpture as representing the god "Aa", both in a letter of 1822 to the directors of the LMS informing them that the sculpture was being delivered, and in his 1837 book about his experiences in Polynesia.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=57}} [[Lancelot Threlkeld]] – another missionary, whose boat brought the gods of Rurutu to Raiatea – likewise described the figure as "the great god Aa".{{sfn|Gunson|2014|p=502–503}} However, in 1824 the LMS' publication ''Missionary Sketches'' referred to the sculpture as "Taaroa Upoo Vahu", under which name the sculpture was also recorded in the 1826 LMS museum catalogue.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=57}} According to Julian Harding, "there is little or no evidence" for Ellis' identification of the figure as Ta'aroa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harding|first=Julian|title=A Polynesian God and the Missionaries|journal=The World of Tribal Arts|date=Winter 1994|volume=1|issue=4|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "A'a" is not otherwise known in Polynesian cosmology,{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=59}} but [[Ta'aroa]] was a Polynesian creator-god, though not one known from the indigenous traditions of Rurutu: possibly because the local cult of A'a had displaced it.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=57–58}} Anthropologist Anne Lavondès suggests that "A'a" was a general term for this type of god-figure, rather than the specific name of the god itself,{{sfn|Lavondès|1996|p=318}} while Dr. Niel Gunson, who specialises in Pacific history, identifies A'a with the father god [[Avatea]].{{sfn|Gunson|2014|p=502}}
==Copies==
After the statue of A'a had been loaned to the British Museum, the museum made a cast of A'a to be displayed at an exhibition at the museum of the LMS.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=15}} A number of other casts were subsequently made at the request of museums around the world.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=16}} Copies of the figure have also been acquired by individual collectors, including the artists [[Roland Penrose]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Henry Moore]], and a cast of A'a is today displayed in the mayor's office on Rurutu.{{sfn|Adams|Hooper|Nuku|2016|p=7–22}}

'''''The Tables of the Law''''' (''Das Gesetz'') is a 1944 [[novella]] by German writer [[Thomas Mann]]. It is a dramatic retelling of the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Moses]] contained in the [[Book of Exodus]], although some of the laws which Moses proscribes for his followers are taken from [[Leviticus]]. It was the only story that Mann was ever commissioned to write, and he finished it in just eight weeks, beginning on January 18, 1943, and ending on March 13, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Armin L. Robinson, believing the [[Ten Commandments]] to be the basis on which civilization was founded, wanted to make a movie detailing the [[Nazism|Nazi]]'s "desecration of the Mosaic Decalogue."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he settled on a book, entitled ''The Ten Commandments: Ten Short Novels of Hitler's War Against the Moral Code,'' with ten authors, one for each commandment.  Mann's novella, which he was paid $1000 to write, was originally meant to be the introduction to the volume, but Robinson liked it so much that he decided to make it the first story, under the heading "[[You shall have no other gods before me|Thou Shalt Have No Other God Before Me]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mann considered his story to be greatly superior to that of his fellow contributors, and he considered the overall book a "failure".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from the Bible Story ==
Mann's story, while broadly faithful to the account given in Exodus, differs from it in several important ways:
* Instead of being the true son of [[Amram]] and [[Jochebed]], Moses is portrayed as the son of the pharaoh's daughter and a passing Hebrew laborer.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sitting in her garden, the pharaoh's daughter sees the laborer and is overcome with desire. She orders him brought to her, and after having sex with him, she has him killed. It is only so as not to arouse the suspicion of her father that she places Moses in the care of his Biblical parents. Moses' half-Hebrew ethnicity plays an important role in the book, as Mann uses it to explain why [[God]] chose him for his task.
* Moses' lack of speaking ability is portrayed as deriving from his peripatetic lifestyle growing up. Mann writes, "[Moses] wasn't really at home in any language and when speaking would cast about in three: Aramaic Syro-Chaldean, which his father's blood kin spoke and which he had learned from his parents, had been overlaid by Egyptian, which he had had to acquire at school, and in addition Midianite Arabic, which he had spoken for many years in the desert."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many of Moses' miracles are given a secular explanation, and God's supernatural powers are never explicitly validated; at times Mann merely refers to certain occurrences as mysterious. For example, in explaining the miracle of turning a rod into a snake, Mann writes, "[[Aaron]] was accomplished in certain sleights-of-hand, which they hoped would make an impression at court to the glory of [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]]. He could make a cobra stiff as a rod by pressing on its neck; but if he then cast the rod to the ground, it would curl and 'transform itself into a serpent'."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mann stipulates that Moses took a mistress while in the desert. She is simply referred to as "the [[Ethiopia]]n," but is said to be from [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some textual evidence in the Bible for this, as Moses is described to have had an Ethiopian or Kushite wife, depending on the translation, in {{bibleverse||Numbers|12:1|KJV|}}, but this may simply refer to his wife [[Zipporah]].
* [[Joshua]], portrayed as Moses' most loyal follower, visits Moses when he is on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] and brings him food.
* Moses is not given the tablets containing the Ten Commandments by God. Instead, God tells him the laws, and Moses inscribes them in stone himself. This proves problematic as he does not want to write the Commandments in a written language which is inextricably linked to its (non-Hebrew) spoken counterpart. Instead, he invents a new system of writing (presumably [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) which he describes as [[alphabetic]], and inscribes the laws in this new script.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moses coats the lettering in his own blood, "pierc[ing] his strong arm with the graver and carefully smear[ing] the dripping blood into the letters so that they gleamed reddish in the stone."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Just as in the Bible story, the first tablets break and Moses is forced to write them again.  However, instead of merely dropping them, he smashes them in anger in an effort to destroy the [[golden calf]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
In his afterword to the book, [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]] suggests that Mann was not as fully devoted to Robinson's project as others. Wood begins by explaining that Robinson first wanted to put together the volume on the Ten Commandments when he heard that [[Adolf Hitler]] had ranted against the idea of commandments one evening to two of his associates, [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Julius Streicher]]. Wood argues that in fact by having his character Moses present the commandments as a black-and-white ethical code, Mann was disagreeing with Moses, and expressing a position that was not necessarily opposed to Hitler's. Wood writes, "[Mann's story] disturbingly echoes and complicates rather than simply refutes Hitler's views. Mann had read his [[Nietzsche]] too - and had read a lot more [[Freud]] than Hitler had.

It is doubtful, though, that Hitler read any Freud though it's not beyond reason to suppose that the genocidal dictator had read Nietzsche, though presumably read him differently than Mann. 
"&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Thomas. ''The Tables of the Law''. trans. Marion Faber and Stephen Lehmann. Philadelphia: Paul Dry Books, 2010, pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vinyl Cafe''' was an hour-long [[radio]] [[variety show]] hosted by [[Stuart McLean]] that was broadcast on [[CBC Radio]] and was syndicated to approximately 80 U.S. public radio stations through [[Public Radio International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/programming/radio/vinyl-cafe The Vinyl Cafe]. [[Canadian Communications Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on Sunday at noon EST and Tuesday at 11:00 pm EST on [[CBC Radio One]] and Saturday at 9 am EST on [[CBC Radio 2]]. The program is also available as a [[podcast]], although the podcasts are usually just McLean's stories for studio episodes because of copyright restrictions on recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinyl Cafe with Stuart McLean - Official Website|url=http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/home.php|publisher=CBC|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC Radio also currently airs a weekday afternoon program, under the title '''Vinyl Cafe Stories''', which consists of two previously recorded Dave and Morley stories per episode.

The show was produced independently by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season had approximately 22 new episodes. Half of those were recorded in the studio and the other half were done with live audiences in theatres across Canada and the United States. One episode was recorded onboard [[VIA Rail]]'s transcontinental passenger train ''[[Canadian (train)|The Canadian]]'' from the dome observation car, complete with an audience of passengers and featured a [[rail travel]] theme. The musical guest was singer songwriter [[Reid Jamieson]].

''The Vinyl Cafe'' stopped touring and producing new episodes following McLean's diagnosis with [[melanoma]] in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stuart McLean cancels Vinyl Cafe Christmas tour due to melanoma|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/stuart-mclean-vinylcafe-tour-cancelled-melanoma-1.3329413|accessdate=December 13, 2016|work=CBC News|date=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLean announced on December 13, 2016 that he required a second round of treatment, meaning further delay in producing new episodes, and that repeats of past shows would stop airing on [[CBC Radio One]] effective January 2017 to "make room for others to share their work on the radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Stuart|title=A message from Stuart McLean|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/blogs/a-message-from-stuart-mclean-1.3881671|website=CBC Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLean died on February 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sumanac-Johnson |first=Deana |date=February 15, 2017 |title=Stuart McLean, CBC Radio host and award-winning humorist, dead at 68 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/stuart-mclean-dead-obit-1.3984826|newspaper=CBC |location= |access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The show featured essays, fiction and music; while frequently humorous, the weekly programs were also often wistfully nostalgic. The live episodes often began with Stuart reciting a complimentary description of the venue's community about its character and history.  The show also endeavoured to introduce listeners to new Canadian musical talent, through playing recordings in studio episodes and performances in the live audience ones.

A major feature of many of McLean's shows were the "Dave and Morley Stories", which featured a fictional Toronto family. The name "Vinyl Cafe" referred both to the show's musical content and the fictional record shop owned by McLean's character Dave. This aspect of the show had spawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings.  Another feature was "The Vinyl Cafe Story Exchange", where listeners were invited to send in personal true stories to the producers who read selections on air.  The series also presented an annual set of awards that were called the "Arthur Awards", which were intended to commend various people who had performed extraordinary good deeds in the preceding year.

Every episode ended with McLean's signature sign-off, "I'm Stuart McLean, so long for now" and followed by the show's folksy guitar theme song, "Happy Meeting In Glory" (as performed by [[Ry Cooder]]). The show was produced by Jess Milton.  Meg Masters was the "long-suffering" story editor and the show's founding producer was Dave Amer. Julie Penner was the musical director.

Since 2012 the show has also aired a "best of" spin-off series under the new title of '''Vinyl Cafe Stories'''.  It features previously recorded stories about Dave and Morley and organized around a common theme, and with one or two studio-recorded musical tracks, but without the live music or local introductions typical of the original run of the show.

=== Dave and Morley Stories ===
{{Main|List of Dave and Morley stories}}
Although they are not featured in every episode of ''The Vinyl Cafe'', the "[[List of Dave and Morley stories|Dave and Morley Stories]]" were by far the show's most famous segment. The stories, written and read by McLean, himself, described the many misadventures of Dave, his wife Morley, their children and pets, as well as friends and neighbours.

For his live performances, McLean often altered his more well-known stories to keep his audience engaged.

'''''Thom Pain (based on nothing)''''' is a 2004 [[one man show]] written by [[Will Eno]].  It is a rambling [[monologue]] in which the protagonist, who has suffered a lot in his life, tells the story of a bee sting, a boy with a dog that died, and his experience with a woman. 

==Production history==
The play started as a reading at the [[Soho Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Ernio. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/91725-Eno-Play-Thom-Pain-based-on-nothing-Published-by-TCG-for-April-Release "Eno Play 'Thom Pain (based on nothing)' Published by TCG for April Release"] playbill.com, March 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and was then performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 2004. The play next opened in London at the Soho Theatre, running from 3 to 24 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, Terri. [http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/reviews/08-2004/thom-pain_24828.html "Reviews. 'Thom Pain' "] whatsonstage.com, 23 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It received the First [[Edinburgh Fringe|Fringe]] Award.&lt;ref name="Pegasus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2007/oct/11/firestarter-productions-presents-thom-pain/|title=Firestarter Productions presents Thom Pain (based on nothing) for one night only on October 12|last=Parikh|first=Shawn|date=2007-10-11|work=Pegasus News|publisher=Fisher Communications|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thom Pain (based on nothing)'' premiered in the United States [[Off-Broadway]] at the DR2 Theatre on February 1, 2005 and closed on September 4, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/theater/show/7845/Thom-Pain-based-on-nothing-/overview "Overview"] ''The New York Times'', accessed January 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The original production starred [[James Urbaniak]], and was directed by Hal Brooks. Urbaniak was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Solo Performance for his portrayal of Thom Pain.&lt;ref name="MnC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/arts/news/article_8185.php/Drama_Desk_Award_Winners|title=Drama Desk Award Winners|last=Somensky|first=Amy|date=2005-05-23|work=Monsters and Critics|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived at the Off-Broadway [[Signature Theatre Company]] on October 23, 2018 (previews), starring [[Michael C. Hall]] and directed by Oliver Butler.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, Olivia. [http://www.playbill.com/article/thom-pain-based-on-nothing-starring-michael-c-hall-begins-at-signature-off-broadway# " 'Thom Pain (based on nothing)', Starring Michael C. Hall, Begins at Signature Off-Broadway"] Playbill, October 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has been translated into over a dozen languages, and since 2005 has been produced regularly around the U.S. and the world. Some notable American productions have been presented at Seattle Rep, the Dallas Theater Center, Theatre Wit, Hyde Park Theatre, Actor's Express, among many more. Worldwide the play has appeared in Finland, France, Israel, Holland, Norway, Portugal, China, Mexico, Germany and elsewhere.

The play was a finalist for the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]],&lt;ref name="PBill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/92095.html|title=John Patrick Shanley's Doubt Wins 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama|authorlink1=Robert Simonson|last=Simonson|first=Robert|date=2005-04-04|work=Playbill News|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=2008-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829120952/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/92095.html|archivedate=2008-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was won by ''Doubt, A Parable'' by [[John Patrick Shanley]].

==Critical reception==
The play received enthusiastic reviews. The ''Theatre Journal'' wrote: "Why did this production receive some of the strongest reviews of the season and a twice-extended run in the heart of New York City?

David Gritten of the ''Telegraph '' wrote, "It's hard to imagine more dazzling writing on any stage in Edinburgh this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/3622069/Edinburgh-reviews-mesmerised-by-an-invisible-man.html|title=Edinburgh reviews: mesmerised by an invisible man|work=telegraph.co.uk|first=David|last=Gritten|date=11 August 2004|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Isherwood, in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "It's one of those treasured nights in the theater - treasured nights anywhere, for that matter - that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Speechless, in any case."&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/theater/reviews/02pain.html?_r=0 "Theater Review. 'Thom Pain (Based On Nothing)' "] ''The New York Times'', February 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theatremania.com critic wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;At its conclusion, audience members may not know exactly what they just saw or what it was supposed to mean. Is Thom Pain a meditation on disappointment? An exercise in futility? Perhaps both. One thing is certain, however. Even if the piece is based on nothing, as its subtitle proclaims, its unconventional style makes it far more interesting than many other plays that are currently on the boards.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalzo, Dan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1607">'''''Too Much To Know: Managing Scholarly Information before the Modern Age''''' ([[Yale University Press]], 2010) is a bestselling book by the American intellectual historian [[Ann M. Blair]]. The book deals with the concept of [[information overload]]. Blair argues that the feeling of being overwhelmed by information is not unique to the [[digital age]]. Instead it has existed since antiquity and in many cultures.

==Reception==

''[[The New Yorker]]'' named the book as one of the best books of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2011/12/19/111219crbn_brieflynoted?currentPage=all newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also praised by the ''[[Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/12/AR2011011207505.html washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Rorotoko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rorotoko.com/interview/20110706_blair_ann_too_much_to_know_managing_information_before_modern_age/ rorotoko.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''[[Times Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=415024 timeshighereducation.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belarus ==
[[File:2009. Stamp of Belarus 34-2009-11-02-bl.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamp]] from [[Belarus]] inspired by Vytynanky.]] 
Vycinanka is also known as vyrazanka or vystryhanka, Viačaslaŭ Dubinka was key in reviving in Belarus the folk art of paper cutting images with scissors.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"&gt;http://kurjer.info/2010/05/12/vyachasla%D1%9E-dubinka-%E2%80%9Cvycinanka-lichylasya-durykami-a-ne-mastactvam%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/2124897.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==
[[Image:Wystroj-chaty-kurpie.JPG|thumb|Wycinanki from [[Kurpie]]]]

Polish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskiinternet.com/english/info/artpaper.html "Polish folk art -  Paper Cutout / Wycinanki," PolskiInternet, retrieved 2010-09-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wycinanki originated with [[shepherd]]s cutting designs out of [[tree bark]] and leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheldonbrown.org/joyce/wycinanki.html Wycinanky, Madelyn Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.

Wycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the [[Kurpie]] region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the [[Łowicz]] region are multicolored.  Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as ''nalepianki'' in which multiple layers are glued together.

Subject matter includes [[peacock]]s, [[rooster]]s, and other birds; circular or star-shaped [[medallion]]s (''gwiazdy''); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki.  Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.

The [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Poland|Polish Pavilion]] at the [[2010 World Expo]] in [[Shanghai]] is based on a wycinanki design.

== Ukraine ==
Historical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth [[century]], but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian [[countryside]].&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

The word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of [[people]], [[animals]] and [[plants]]. [[Ethnographer]]s and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional [[pottery]], [[embroidery]], [[carpet|rugs]] and other items.&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

Vytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “[[tree of life|trees of life]].”&lt;ref name=index2.php&gt;[http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20084/62 Vytynanka — an art of decorative paper cutting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White magic''' has traditionally referred to the use of supernatural powers or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for selfless purposes. With respect to the philosophy of [[left-hand path and right-hand path]], white magic is the benevolent counterpart of malicious [[black magic]]. Because of its ties to traditional [[Paganism]] (nature worship), white magic is often also referred to as "natural magic".

==History==

===Early origins===
{{see also|Western esotericism}}
In his 1978 book, ''A History of White Magic'', recognised occult author [[Gareth Knight]] traces the origins of white magic to early adaptations of [[paleolithic religion]] and early religious history in general, including the polytheistic traditions of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the later monotheistic ideas of [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name=knight&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WF2F5M9SPTgC&amp; ''A History of White Magic''] by [[Gareth Knight]] (Skylight Press, 2011 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In particular, he traced many of the traditions of white magic to the early worship of local "gods and goddesses of fertility and vegetation who were usually worshipped at hill-top shrines" and were "attractive to a nomadic race settling down to an agricultural existence".&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; He focuses in particular on the nomadic [[Hebrew]]-speaking tribes and suggests that early Jews saw the worship of such deities more in terms of [[atavism]] than evil. It was only when the polytheistic and pagan [[Roman Empire]] began to expand that Jewish leaders began to rally against those ideas.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

===During the Renaissance===
{{see also|Renaissance magic}}
By the late 15th century, natural magic "had become much discussed in high-cultural circles".&lt;ref name=zambelli&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tp6PhNsz43EC&amp; ''White Magic, Black Magic in the European Renaissance''] by Paola Zambelli ([[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; "Followers" of [[Marsilio Ficino]] advocated the existence of spiritual beings and spirits in general, though many such theories ran counter to the ideas of the later [[Age of Enlightenment]]. While Ficino and his supporters were treated with hostility by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Church itself also acknowledged the existence of such beings; such acknowledgement was the crux of campaigns against [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name=zambelli/&gt; Ficino, though, theorised a "purely natural" magic that did not require the invocation of spirits, malevolent or malicious. In doing so, he came into conflict with [[Johannes Trithemius]] who refused to believe in Ficino's theory but created [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] and [[incantations]] of his own related to beneficial communication with spirits. His works, including the ''Steganographia'', were not published until the 17th century and were then immediately placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' where they remained until the 20th century. Trithemius' "disciple" [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] was responsible for publishing some of his work and in turn created his own.&lt;ref name=zambelli/&gt; His work included the ''[[De occulta philosophia libri tres]]'' which contained an outline of, among other things, [[classical element]]s, [[numerology]], [[astrology]] and [[kabbalah]] and detailed ways of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, [[scrying]], [[alchemy]] and rituals and ceremonies. [[Giambattista della Porta]] expanded on many of these ideas in his ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qZxtq29LYSQC&amp; ''The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance: A Study in Intellectual Patterns''] by Wayne Shumaker ([[University of California Press]], 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the coming-together of these ideas - early "natural" religions and later philosophical thinking - that Knight suggests is "at the root of the Western tradition of white magic".&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; Also at the root of white magic are [[symbol]]s and [[religious symbolism]] in particular. The [[star]], Knight gives as example, was of critical importance to Jewish tradition and then to early Christians (like the [[Star of David]]) and to later [[Freemason|Masonic]] tradition and [[Neo-pagan]]ism.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; It continues to be of importance of white magic practitioners in the form of the [[pentagram]] and night-time ritual.

Zambelli goes further and suggests that white magic - though then not specifically distinct from its counterpart black magic - grew as the more acceptable form of occult and pagan study in the era of the [[Inquisition]] and anti-witchcraft sentiment.&lt;ref name=zambelli/&gt; If black magic was that which involved Trithemius' invocation of demons, Ficino's "purely natural" white magic could be framed as the study of "natural" phenomena in general with no evil or irreligious intent whatsoever. Zambelli places academics like [[Giordano Bruno]] in this category of "clandestine" practitioners of magic.&lt;ref name=zambelli/&gt;

==Modern interpretations==

In his 2009 book, ''Magic and Alchemy'', [[Robert M. Place]] provides a broad modern definition of both black and white magic, preferring instead to refer to them as "high magic" (white) and "low magic" (black) based primarily on intentions of the practitioner employing them.&lt;ref name=place&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2rD9r0kFY20C&amp; ''Magic and Alchemy''] by [[Robert M. Place]] ([[Infobase Publishing]], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His modern definition maintains that the purpose of white magic is to "do good" or to "bring the practitioner to a higher spiritual state" of enlightenment or consciousness.&lt;ref name=place/&gt; He acknowledges, though, that this broader definition (of "high" and "low") suffers from prejudices as good-intentioned [[folk magic]] may be considered "low" while [[ceremonial magic]] involving expensive or exclusive components may be considered by some as "high magic", regardless of intent.&lt;ref name=place/&gt;

According to Place, effectively all prehistoric [[shaman]]istic magic was "helping" white magic and thus the basic essence of that magic forms the framework of modern white magic: curing illness or injury, divining the future or [[dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]], finding lost items, appeasing spirits, controlling weather or harvest and generating [[good luck]] or well-being.&lt;ref name=place/&gt;

==Goddess worship==
{{main|Mother goddess}}
Though not exclusively a female pursuit, modern white magic is often associated with stereotypically feminine concepts like that of a Mother goddess, [[faerie|fae]], nature spirits, oneness with nature and goddess worship.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oRAFAAAACAAJ&amp; ''White Magic''] by [[Marian Green]] ([[Southwater]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern stories or fairy tales, the idea of "white witchcraft" is often associated with a kindly grandmother or caring motherly spirit. The link between white magic and a Mother Earth is a regular theme of practitioner [[Marian Green]]'s written work.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;
