{{Esperanto sidebar|expanded=Services}}
The '''Akademio de Esperanto''' ('''AdE'''; [[English language|English]]: '''Academy of Esperanto''') is an independent body of language scholars who steward the evolution of the language [[Esperanto]] by keeping it consistent with ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' in accordance with the [[Declaration of Boulogne]]. Modeled somewhat after the [[Académie française]], the Akademio was proposed by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of Esperanto, at the first [[World Esperanto Congress]], and was founded soon thereafter under the name ''Lingva Komitato'' (Language Committee). This Committee had a "superior commission" called the ''Akademio''. In 1948, within the framework of a general reorganization, the Language Committee and the Academy combined to form the Akademio de Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.lernu.net/enkonduko/pri_esperanto/movado.php "About Esperanto: Movement: Organizations: Akademio de Esperanto (Academy of Esperanto)" ''lernu.net''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130061036/http://en.lernu.net/enkonduko/pri_esperanto/movado.php |date=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akademio consists of 45 members and has a president, vice presidents, and a secretary. The corresponding address including e-mail is at the secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akademio-de-esperanto.org/faktoj/estraro.html Estraro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219194120/http://akademio-de-esperanto.org/faktoj/estraro.html |date=December 19, 2009}} (in Esperanto)&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by a subsidy from the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] and by donations.

===Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] of Commerce degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|title=Bachelor Of Commerce (Bcom) - Varsity College|website=www.varsitycollege.co.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131853/https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). 
Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, business management, human resources, marketing, and economics; some programs also require [[Business statistics|(business) statistics]], [[Business mathematics#University level|(introductory) calculus]] and information systems. 
Depending on the institution, a formal [[academic major]] may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

For a comparison with other business degrees, see [[Business education#Undergraduate education]].

===Honours Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Honours degree|Honours]] Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com. (Hons) or B.Comm. (Hons) or H.B.Com. or H.B.Comm.) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|title=Bachelor of Commerce Degree (Bcom)- University Canada West|website=ucanwest.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044341/https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoit.ca/ac-calendar/0506/EN/main/programs/103887/bcom_hons_92.html|title=Commerce - Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)|first=The University of Ontario Institute of|last=Technology|website=www.uoit.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year [[Bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105318/http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched [[thesis]] component; the one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|title=Qualifications|website=www.unisa.ac.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065503/http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|archivedate=2014-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126230943/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours|title=BCom Students - Faculty of Business and Economics|website=bcom.unimelb.edu.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005629/http://www.bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours/|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Master of Commerce]] (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degrees.

===Duration===
The [[curriculum]] generally lasts three years in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Malta]], [[South Africa]], some parts of [[Canada]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The curriculum requires four years of study in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the majority of [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In [[Nepal]], the duration of the program can be three years.

In [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and some universities in [[India]], the B.Com. (Hons) degree is considered an additional [[postgraduate]] qualification, whereas in [[Malta]], an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In [[Pakistan]], [http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/22/Hailey-College-of-Commerce] the B.Com. degree lasts two years, the B.Com. (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree.

==History==
:''See: [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|Birmingham Business School#History and background]].''&lt;!--{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}} --&gt;
The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the [[University of Birmingham]]. The [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|University's School of Commerce]] was founded by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], an Englishman from [[Oxford University]], who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Toronto]]. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at [[Harvard University]], and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce.  Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other B.Com. degree programs throughout the [[British Empire]].

Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in Commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

In employment, a '''blacklist''' or [[blacklisting ]] refers to denying people employment for either political reasons (due to actual or suspected political affiliation), due to a history of [[trade union]] activity, or due to a history of [[whistleblowing]], for example on safety or corruption issues. Blacklisting may be done by states (denying employment in state entities) as well as by private companies.

The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and [[company town]]s, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike.&lt;ref name="Weir2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Weir|title=Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Feb0w1622soC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-718-5|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===United States===
The 1901 Report of the [[Industrial Commission]] stated "There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it." It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: "Wherever he went the blacklist was ahead of him".&lt;ref name="CommissionMeyer1901"&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States Industrial Commission|author2=Balthasar Henry Meyer|author3=Roswell Cheney McCrea|title=Report of the Industrial Commission on Transportation, including testimony, review and topical digest of evidence, and special reports on railway legislation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3ZMAAAAMAAJ|year=1901|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 gave employees the right to organize and bargain collectively. and numerous strikes occurred until the Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935, and organized labor sought relief from employers who had able to blacklist union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=National Labor Relations Act (1935) (print-friendly version) | website=Welcome to OurDocuments.gov | date=8 March 2017 | url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/print_friendly.php?flash=false&amp;page=&amp;doc=67&amp;title=National+Labor+Relations+Act+(1935) | accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported [[trade union]]s or criticised their employers, the practice remained common.&lt;ref name="Weir2013" /&gt; A U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics report published in 1938 noted that "Closely related to discrimination and the employer's right to discharge is the blacklist." Employees who had been fired had no recourse to legal action against the employer, but "most States have statutes which make criminal the establishment of a blacklist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Characteristics of Company Unions, 1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tYRYPRzLIEC&amp;pg=PA215|year=1938|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist.&lt;ref name="Weir2013" /&gt;

====Hollywood blacklist====
{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}
In American history, one of the most famous examples of blacklisting stemmed from an investigation launched in 1947 by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) into [[Communist]] influence on the motion picture industry. The first in the industry to be blacklisted, as a result of their refusal to provide evidence to HUAC, were a group known as the [[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|Hollywood Ten]], most of them [[screenwriters]], who had at one time or another been members of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]]. Today, the best known of the Hollywood Ten are the writers [[Ring Lardner, Jr.]] and [[Dalton Trumbo]], who was barred from openly working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for over a dozen years as a result of his defiance of HUAC. (He continued to work under [[pseudonyms]] and "fronts" until the revelation in 1960 that he had written the script for ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.) Actor [[John Garfield]] was one of the more famous Hollywood performers to have been blacklisted by major American film studios as a direct result of HUAC investigations and hearings.

Blacklisting sometimes consisted of [[guilt by association]], as in the case of radio actress [[Madeline Lee Gilford|Madeline Lee]]. Both Lee and her husband, actor [[Jack Gilford]], were blacklisted after it was revealed that Lee had given a party in her house to raise funds for a group later labeled as a [[Communist front]]. Though there was no suspicion that she had ever been involved in any putatively "subversive" political causes (and though her real name was spelled differently), Lee became the target of thousands of protest phone calls to her network. Another actress, [[Camila Ashland]], who appeared on the television show ''Danger'', physically resembled Madeline Lee; though she had no political past, her network too became the target of protest phone calls. Madeline Pierce, a 20-year veteran of radio, who again had no political past, was also ultimately blacklisted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====US real estate appraisers====
On October 16, 2008, Capitol West Appraisers filed a class action lawsuit against [[Countrywide Financial]] Corp. (now owned by Bank of America) alleging Countrywide blacklisted appraisers who refused to appraise real estate at inflated prices.&lt;ref name=countrywide&gt;{{citation | url = http://appraisalnewsonline.typepad.com/appraisal_news_for_real_e/files/Capitol_West_vs_Countrywide.pdf | title = Class Action Complaint: Capitol West v. Countrywide| format = PDF | date = 16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Capitol West v. Countrywide Financial Corp., Capitol West Appraisals alleges Countrywide pressured appraisers to set the value of a property at the selling price rather than setting the value based on an inspection of the property and comparable market prices in the area as required by appraisal standards. Misrepresenting the value of a property allowed Countrywide to lend more money to more buyers at higher risks with less collateral. Countrywide could then make more money off the loans by selling them on secondary markets as mortgage backed securities.

Appraisers who refused to misrepresent property values were put in a "do not use" or "Field Review List" data base, in essence a blacklist. When an appraisal was submitted by an appraiser on the "do not use" database it was flagged for "field review". A field review is a review of the original appraisal. All field reviews were conducted by Landsafe, a subsidiary of Countrywide, who would consistently shoot holes in any appraisal from a blacklisted appraiser. Mortgage Brokers were then required to get a second appraisal from another appraiser. Since independent mortgage brokers did not want to pay for two appraisals and did not know which lender they would ultimately use, and since Countrywide was the biggest home mortgage lender in the U.S., brokers simply would not use anyone on the Field Review List.

As of Aug. 28, 2008, more than 2,000 names were on the Field Review List, Countrywide's blacklist, which it sends to mortgage brokers who hire appraisers across the United States.&lt;ref name=countrywide/&gt;

===European union===
====UK Blacklisting of trade union members====
{{main|Consulting Association|Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010}}
Blacklisting is today illegal in the UK under the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] and the [[Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010]].

Trade union members, and workers who raised health and safety and other concerns in the [[United Kingdom]] have been blacklisted by employers. They used the services of the [[Economic League (United Kingdom)|Economic League]], which operated between 1919 and 1993, and [[Consulting Association|The Consulting Association]], which, until it was closed down in February 2009, took over this role within the UK construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=6 March 2009 |url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/tca_release_060309.pdf |title=Press release |publisher=Office of the Information Commissioner |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124346/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/tca_release_060309.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Minutes – Management Board, 27 April 2009 | date = 27 April 2009 | url = http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/corporate/notices/20090427_management_board_minutes.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Information Commissioner's Office | page = 5 | quote = 8.8. March also saw the ICO investigation into the Consulting Association, which has operated an unregistered database (effectively a ‘blacklist’) of construction industry workers. The Consulting Association was ordered to stop processing the data. The ICO has put in place a system for individuals to check their information. The Board praised the ICO’s joined up work on this matter. }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] was subsequently criticised for failing to take further punitive action against the employers using the blacklist, or carrying out any further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnplus.co.uk/opinion/leader/damning-ico-misses-the-point-on-blacklisting/8637728.article Damning ICO Misses the Point on Blacklisting] from ''CNPlus.co.uk'' accessed 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Scottish Affairs Select  Committee]] subsequently began calling for evidence in relation to blacklisting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee37d03c-1948-11e2-9b3e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Be5U2MVn Builders face blacklist damages claims] from ''Financial Times'' accessed 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; producing an interim report in March 2013&lt;ref name=interimreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Affairs Committee - Ninth Report  Blacklisting in Employment: Interim Report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmscotaf/1071/107102.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a final report in 2015. While acknowledging that some positive steps had been taken, it said "many questions in relation to the practice of blacklisting remain unanswered", and recommended a full [[public inquiry]] as a matter of priority.&lt;ref name=SAC2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Affairs - Seventh Report  Blacklisting in Employment: Final Report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmscotaf/272/27202.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Scottish Affairs Committee|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
Blacklisting was used in Norway before the Second World War. Well-known blacklisted trade unionists include [[Thorolf Bugge]].

===Eastern Bloc===
In the [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Bloc, individuals could be [[Wolf ticket (Russia)|blacklisted for political reasons]], particularly to deny them employment in their chosen profession.

'''Chris Adrian''' (born 1970) is an American author.  Adrian's writing styles in short stories vary greatly; from modernist realism to pronounced lyrical allegory.

'''Confucius''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ən|ˈ|f|j|uː|ʃ|ə|s}} {{respell|kən|FEW|shəs}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; 551–479 BC)&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and [[Chinese philosophy|philosopher]] of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]].

The philosophy of Confucius, also known as [[Confucianism]], emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be suppressed in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received [[State religion|official sanction]] and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].

Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.

Confucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle "Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself", the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].

Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}

==Name==
The name "Confucius" is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] "Kǒng Fūzǐ" ({{lang|zh|孔夫子}}, meaning "Master Kong"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name&lt;!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--&gt; was "Kǒng" ({{lang|zh|孔}}; [[Old Chinese]]: {{Old Chinese|kʰˤoŋʔ}}), and his given name was "Qiū" ({{lang|zh|丘}}; OC: {{Old Chinese|kʷʰə}}).  His "capping name", given upon reaching adulthood and by which he would have been known to all but his older family members, was "Zhòngní" ({{lang|zh|仲尼}}; OC: &amp;#42;{{IPA|N-truŋ-s nrəj}}), the "Zhòng" indicating that he was the second son in his family.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}}{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=133}}

Confucius was educated at schools for commoners, where he studied and learned the [[Six Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224536/https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|archivedate=2017-04-16|df=|isbn=9781441196538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius was born into the class of ''[[Four occupations|shi]]'' (士), between the aristocracy and the common people. He is said to have worked in various government jobs during his early 20s, and as a bookkeeper and a caretaker of sheep and horses, using the proceeds to give his mother a proper burial.&lt;ref name=confu/&gt;&lt;ref name=buryl/&gt; When his mother died, Confucius (aged 23) is said to have [[Ancestor veneration in China#Mourning rites|mourned for three years]], as was the tradition.&lt;ref name=buryl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgan|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: Chinese Philosopher and Teacher|date=2008|publisher=Capstone|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vM8GCpBncjEC&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=August 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416230252/https://books.google.com/books?id=vM8GCpBncjEC&amp;pg=PT12|archivedate=April 16, 2017|df=|isbn=9780756538323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
{{double image|right|Confucius, fresco from a Western Han tomb of Dongping County, Shandong province, China.jpg|200|Confucius and Laozi, fresco from a Western Han tomb of Dongping County, Shandong province, China.jpg|220|A [[Western Han]] (202 BC – 9 AD) [[fresco]] depicting Confucius (and [[Laozi]]), from a tomb of [[Dongping County]], [[Shandong province]], China}}

In Confucius's time, the state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] was headed by a ruling ducal house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=274–275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the duke were [[Three Huan|three aristocratic families]], whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy. The Ji family held the position "Minister over the Masses", who was also the "Prime Minister"; the Meng family held the position "Minister of Works"; and the Shu family held the position "Minister of War". In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu—a retainer of the Ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family. However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.&lt;ref name="dubs49-275"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government. Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town. Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.&lt;ref name="dubs49-275-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city—strongholds belonging to the three families. This way, he could establish a centralized government. However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself. In 500 BC, Hou Fan—the governor of Hou—revolted against his lord of the Shu family. Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]]. The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities. Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng. First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.&lt;ref name="dubs49-277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter, Gongshan Furao or Buniu, a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.&lt;ref name="creel49-35-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duuuu46-277-8" /&gt; He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.&lt;ref name="dubs49-277" /&gt; Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered. Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution, the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke. Although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice, Confucius gave up on this idea in the end.&lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.&lt;ref name=creel49-35&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.&lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277–278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.&lt;ref name=creel49-35 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dubs49-278 /&gt;

During the revolt by Gongshan, Zhong You ({{Lang-zh|c=仲由|s=|t=|labels=no}}) had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-278&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278–279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace. Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.&lt;ref name="chin07-30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu. Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt;

The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord. Through Confucius's actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official. Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt;

When it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.&lt;ref name="dubs49-279" /&gt; Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.&lt;ref name="dubs49-279" /&gt;

Later in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280–281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to accounts in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281 /&gt;

===Exile===
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]
The ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.

After Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.

===Return home===
[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]

According to the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by [[Ji Kangzi]], the chief minister of Lu.&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=9781441196538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].

During his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including [[Ji Kangzi]], on matters including governance and crime.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

Burdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72. He died from natural causes. Confucius was buried in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]] which lies in the historical part of [[Qufu]] in the Shandong Province.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The original tomb erected there in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it has a raised brick platform at the front of the memorial for offerings such as sandalwood incense and fruit.

[[File:Dacheng Hall.JPG|thumb|The Dacheng Hall, the main hall of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Qufu]]]]

Although Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese, many argue that its values are secular and that it is, therefore, less a religion than a secular morality. Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|publisher=''The American Interest''|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|soul]]s. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: "Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly".&lt;ref name="Parkers"&gt;[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]

In the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a "transmitter who invented nothing". He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|學}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').

===Ethics===
One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:

::{{lang|zh|廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。}}
::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, "Was anyone hurt?" He did not ask about the horses.''
:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10–13 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])

By not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].

One of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the "[[Silver Rule]]" owing to its negative form:

::{{lang|zh|己所不欲，勿施於人。}}
::''"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others."''

::{{lang|zh|子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。”}}
::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: "Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?" &lt;br /&gt;The Master replied: "How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself."''
:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton

Often overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.

The Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''lǐ'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''lǐ'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''lǐ'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.

In the early Confucian tradition, ''lǐ'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''lǐ'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''lǐ'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.

In Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''yì'' ({{lang|zh|義}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Yì'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''yì'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.

Just as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''yì'', so ''yì'' is linked to the core value of ''rén'' ({{lang|zh|仁}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' consists of 5 basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.&lt;ref name="Bonevac09-40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rén'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as "benevolence" or "humaneness"; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it "Goodness" (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include "authoritativeness" and "selflessness." Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''rén'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''yì''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little.&lt;ref name="Bonevac09-40" /&gt;

===Politics===
Confucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through "rites" (''lǐ'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good." (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|大學}}). This "sense of shame" is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].

Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|天命}}) that could unify the "world" ({{lang|zh|天下}}, "all under Heaven") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.

Confucius did not believe in the concept of "[[democracy]]", which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;lpg=PT123&amp;dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&amp;f=false|isbn =978-0465040575|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=''Ancient History Encyclopedia''|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2018}}
Confucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L. Hall|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=9780824824600|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China, thereby giving Confucianism the first wide-scale test of its [[dogma]].

Two of Confucius's most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings. In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|孟子}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|荀子}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.

This realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.

Under the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.

During the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.

[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese'', published by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.]]
The works of Confucius were first translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] in the 16th century during the late [[Ming dynasty]]. The first known effort was by [[Michele Ruggieri]], who returned to Italy in 1588 and carried on his translations while residing in [[Salerno]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and a team of Jesuits—[[Prospero Intorcetta]], [[Philippe Couplet]], and two others—published a translation of several [[Confucian canon|Confucian works]] and an overview of [[history of China|Chinese history]] in Paris in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus, sive, Scientia Sinensis Latine Exposita ''[''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'']'' |editor-last=Intorcetta |editor-first=Prospero |editor2=Philippe Couplet |editor3=Chrétien Herdtrich |editor4=François Rougemont |display-editors=1 |ref={{harvid|Intorcetta &amp; al.|1687}} |date=1687 |location=Paris |publisher=Daniel Horthemels }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parker77-25&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1977|loc=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]], after failing to persuade [[Pope Clement XI|Clement{{nbsp}}XI]] that [[Chinese ancestral veneration|Chinese veneration of ancestors]] and [[Confucianism|Confucius]] [[Chinese Rites controversy|did not constitute idolatry]], completed the Confucian canon at [[Prague]] in 1711, with more scholarly treatments of the other works and the first translation of the [[Mengzi (book)|collected works]] of [[Mencius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Noël |editor-first=François |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=A0K0bjBLmMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Sinensis Imperii Libri Classici Sex ''[''The Six Classic Books of the Chinese Empire'']'' |location=Prague |publisher=Charles-Ferdinand University Press |date=1711 }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=parker77-25 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobson|2004|loc=194–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era Confucian movements, such as [[New Confucianism]], still exist, but during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Confucianism was frequently attacked by leading figures in the [[Communist Party of China]]. This was partially a continuation of the condemnations of Confucianism by intellectuals and activists in the early 20th century as a cause of the ethnocentric close-mindedness and refusal of the [[Qing Dynasty]] to modernize that led to the tragedies that befell China in the 19th century.

Confucius's works are studied by scholars in many other Asian countries, particularly those in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]], such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Many of those countries still hold the traditional memorial ceremony every year.

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] believes Confucius was a [[Prophets of Islam|Divine Prophet]] of God, as were [[Lao-Tzu]] and other eminent Chinese personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ahmad|n.d.|loc=[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_3.html online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[7853 Confucius|Asteroid 7853]], "Confucius", was named after the Chinese thinker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=7853IAU IAU Minor Planet Center].

===Disciples===
[[File:The Classic of Filial Piety (開宗明義章 畫).jpg|thumb|[[Zengzi]] (right) kneeling before Confucius (center), as depicted in a painting from the ''Illustrations of the [[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', [[Song dynasty]]]]
{{main article|Disciples of Confucius}}

There is not much known of Confucius's disciples, and a little over half of them had their surnames recorded in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.&lt;ref name=creel49-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Analects]]'' records 22 names that are most likely Confucius's disciples, while the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' records 24 names, although it is quite certain that there have been many more disciples whose name were not recorded.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Most of Confucius's disciples were from the [[Lu (state)|Lu state]], while others were from neighboring states.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; For example, Zigong was from the [[Wey (state)|Wey state]], and Sima Niu was from the [[Song (state)|Song state]].&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Confucius's favorite disciple was Yan Hui, most probably one of the most impoverished of them all.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Sima Niu, in contrast to Yan Hui, was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Under Confucius's teachings, the disciples became well-learned in the principles and methods of government.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history, poetry, and ritual.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen, in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence.&lt;ref name=creel49-32&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices, the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; In fact, the disciple Zilu even died defending his ruler in Wei.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt;

Yang Hu, who was a subordinate of the Ji family, had dominated the Lu government from 505 to 502 and even attempted a coup, which narrowly failed.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; As a likely consequence, it was after that that the first disciples of Confucius were appointed to government positions.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; A few of Confucius's disciples went on to attain official positions of some importance, some of which were arranged by Confucius.&lt;ref name=creel49-31&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Confucius was 50 years old, the Ji family had consolidated their power in the Lu state over the ruling ducal house.&lt;ref name=creel49-33&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Ji family had practices with which Confucius disagreed and disapproved, they nonetheless gave Confucius's disciples many opportunities for employment.&lt;ref name=creel49-33 /&gt; Confucius continued to remind his disciples to stay true to their principles and renounced those who did not, all the while being openly critical of the Ji family.&lt;ref name=creel49-32-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual portraits===
No contemporary painting or sculpture of Confucius survives, and it was only during the [[Han Dynasty]] that he was portrayed visually. Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with [[Laozi]]. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher. The oldest known portrait of Confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the [[Han dynasty]] ruler [[Marquis of Haihun]] (died 59 BC). The picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |title=Confucius depicted on mirror |date= |language=English |website=The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=22 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222200723/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In former times, it was customary to have a portrait in [[Temple of Confucius|Confucius Temple]]s; however, during the reign of [[Hongwu Emperor]] (Taizu) of the [[Ming dynasty]], it was decided that the only proper portrait of Confucius should be in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] in his home town, [[Qufu]] in Shandong. In other temples, Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].

===Memorials===
[[File:First Entrance Gate of the Temple of Confucius, Ching-hai.jpg|thumb|left|First entrance gate of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Zhenhai]]]]

Soon after Confucius's death, [[Qufu]], his home town, became a place of devotion and remembrance. The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.

Followers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|祭孔}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|周禮}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the twentieth century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.

In Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (祭孔) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.

In [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.

===Descendants===
{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}

Confucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] thirty-five times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] forty-two times from the [[Tang dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of "Duke Wenxuan" on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation. In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of "[[Duke Yansheng]]" on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation.

During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou in Zhejiang, while the newly established [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |title=Descendants and Portraits of Confucius in the Early Southern Song  |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913134503/http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas2.asian-studies.org/absts/1995abst/china/csess45.htm |title=AAS Abstracts: China Session 45 |first=B.

In [[1351]], during the reign of Emperor [[Toghon Temür]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]], 93rd-generation descendant Kong Huan (孔浣)'s 2nd son Kong Shao (孔昭) moved from China to Korea during the [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]], and was received courteously by [[Queen Noguk|Princess Noguk]] (the Mongolian-born wife of the future king [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]]). After being naturalized as a Korean citizen, he changed the [[hanja]] of his name from "昭" to "紹" (both pronounced ''so'' in Korean),&lt;ref&gt;Due to a [[naming taboo]] regarding the birth name of the 4th king of Goryeo [[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Gwangjong]], born "Wang So" ({{Korean|왕소|王昭}}).&lt;/ref&gt; married a Korean woman and bore a son (Gong Yeo ({{Korean|공여|孔帤}}), 1329–1397), therefore establishing the Changwon Gong clan ({{Korean|창원 공씨|昌原 孔氏}}), whose ancestral seat was located in [[Changwon]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]].

Because of the huge interest in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known family members of the collateral branches in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ministry of Commerce of the PRC|2006|loc=[http://ye2.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/chinanews/200606/20060602462372.html online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/171840.htm | title=DNA Testing Adopted to Identify Confucius Descendants | publisher=China Internet Information Center | date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in China who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent. However, in 2009, many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to DNA testing.&lt;ref name=seedmagazine&gt;{{Harvnb|Qiu|2008|loc=[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/inheriting_confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Sykes]], professor of genetics at Oxford University, understands this decision: "The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance," he said. "It's not just a scientific question."&lt;ref name=seedmagazine /&gt;  The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose family record books were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandao|2007|loc=[http://eng.bandao.cn/newsdetail.asp?id=4644 online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main branch of the family which fled to Taiwan was never involved in the proposed DNA test at all.

'''Education policy in Brazil''' has been given importance by the federal and local governments since 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Country Analysis Report: Brazil - In-depth PESTLE Insights|journal=DataMonitor|date=May 2010|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the government of President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of Education]] began to pursue three areas of national [[education policy]]:
* education finance equalization;
* [[conditional cash transfer]]s; and
* education results measurement.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"&gt;{{cite web|author=Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office |title=Achieving World Class Education in Brazil: The Next Agenda |url=http://www.iepecdg.com.br/uploads/livros/1012achieving_world.pdf |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=3 April 2011 |date=21 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706152918/http://www.iepecdg.com.br/uploads/livros/1012achieving_world.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]], these national education policies have tracked with global best practice, and implementation has been sustained and effective in improving performance and outcomes of [[education in Brazil]]. Though Brazil has made significant strides in improving labor force skills, Brazil is below average with respect to learning levels, secondary completion rates, and student flow efficiency, when compared to [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and other middle-income countries.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; In addition, non-attendance rates and drop-out rates have also been on the increase. Moreover, these factors are especially high in lower income areas where the quality of education largely remains below the expected levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Country Analysis Report: Brazil - In-depth PESTLE Insights|journal=DataMonitor|date=May 2010|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been the recent targets of education policy.

&lt;!--Still needs some work. I need to add a summary about the impacts of the policies, once I get that information into the rest of the article.--&gt;

== Constitutional rights to education ==
The Brazilian federal government legislates direction for national education, develops national educational plans, and provides technical and financial assistance to the [[States of Brazil|states]], the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]], and to [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] for the development of [[Education#Systems of formal education|educational systems]].&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web|title=BRAZIL - EDUCATION |author=United Nations |url=http://www.un.int/brazil/brasil/brazil-education.htm |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425230610/http://www.un.int/brazil/brasil/brazil-education.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution of Brazil]] outlines the educational rights of Brazilian citizens in Title VIII, Chapter III, Section 1.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Constitution of Brazil (English Translation), Title VIII|url=http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleVIII.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Education is the right of all and a duty of both the State and families, in cooperation with general society. The aim of education is defined as the full development of a person, qualification for work, and participation as a citizen (article 205).
* Education will be provided on the basis of I. equal conditions for access to school; II. freedom to learn, teach, research and express thought, art and knowledge; III. pluralism of ideas and coexistence of public/private schools; IV. free public education; V. appreciation of teaching professionals with minimum salaries based on exams and credentials; VI. democratic administration; and VII. guarantee of quality (article 206).
* Universities are given significant autonomy but have the requirement to comply with non-dissociation of teaching, research and extension (article 207).{{clarify|date=April 2011}}
* The state will fulfill its educational duty by ensuring I. mandatory and free elementary education; II. progressively universal high school education; III. specialized schooling for the handicapped; IV. assistance for early childhood education; V. access to higher education, research and the arts; VI. regular night courses; assistance through supplementary programs for school material, transportation, food, and health (article 208).
* Teaching is open to private enterprise as long as they comply with rules of national education and are authorized and evaluated by the government (article 209).
* Minimum curricula will be established for elementary schools to ensure common national education. However, some topics such as religion are optional and Indian communities are able to use their own language and learning methods (article 210).
* The Union, states, Federal District and municipalities will cooperate to organize educational activities; each governing body will take on a different role (article 211).
* A minimum percentage of tax revenues &amp;ndash; 18% from the Union and 25% from the states, Federal District and municipalities &amp;ndash; is to be used towards education through distribution process set out in law. Donations from companies for education are permitted (article 212).
* Public resources will be allocated to schools and other community, religious or philanthropic schools that channel funds to education, scholarships, or research (article 213).
* The law will establish a multi-year national educational plan to work towards the eradication of illiteracy, universal school assistance, improved quality, professional training, and humanistic, scientific, and technological advances (article 214).

&lt;!--==Education challenges in the 1990's==
While the Federal Constitution gave responsibility for crèche and preschool services to municipalities and secondary education to states, responsibility for primary education remains divided between states and municipalities. Primary education consisted of a mix of state and municipal schools that were geographically proximate but had differing levels of per-student resources and quality.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; UNICEF rated Brazil's basic education system as last in world ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Facts|title=Brazil History|url=http://worldfacts.us/Brazil-history-2.htm|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early and mid 1990's, Brazil faced a variety of educational challenges:
* 18 % of Brazilians over fifteen years of age could not read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Facts|title=Brazil History|url=http://worldfacts.us/Brazil-history-2.htm|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Close to 70 % of the labor force had not completed secondary school.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;
* The average schooling level of the labor force in 1990 was 3.8 years – less than half that of Argentina, Chile, and the OECD. &lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; 
* Less than 40% of children nationally completed the 8 grades of primary school, compared with 70% for the LAC region, and 95% for the OECD. &lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;
* Only 38% of children enrolled secondary school (grades 9-11), compared with over 70% in Argentina and Chile and 91% across the OECD. &lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;
* The child of a father with no formal education would complete only 4 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;
* 60%  of primary teachers nationally had not completed secondary school. 30% had not completed primary school.  Less than 20% had a higher education degree.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; 
* The teacher wage in many rural areas was less than half the minimum wage.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; 
* There were large variations in both schooling coverage and tax revenues across jurisdictions: spending per primary student in municipal schools in parts of Northeast Brazil was less than $Rs 100 per year compared to $Rs 600 or more in state schools in the same region and $Rs 1500 or more per year in state and municipal systems in the Southeast.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;
* There was no national data on student learning.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

== Education finance equalization policies ==

[[File:Agrestina-Escola-Professor-José-Constantino.jpg|thumb|Escola Professor José Constantino]]
To reduce inequality and variation in per student spending between different regions and schools, in 1996, the government introduced and expanded education finance equalization policies, in particular through the creation of FUNDEF (1996&amp;ndash;2006) and FUNDEB (2006&amp;ndash;present), both of which entailed policies about allocation of education funding and increases in overall funding of education.

=== FUNDEF ===
The [[Fund for Maintenance and Development of the Fundamental Education and Valorization of Teaching]] ([[Fundo para Manutenção e Desenvolvimento do Ensino Fundamental e Valorização do Magistério]] (FUNDEF)) was introduced in 1996 to reform the funding of education in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Evaluating the Effects of FUNDEF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Menezes-Filho|first=Naercio|title=Evaluating the Effects of FUNDEF on Wages and Test Scores in Brazil|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/03-02-04-FIL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to make sure that money mandated by the constitution is actually spent on education and to establish a per student spending floor for the whole country.&lt;ref name="The Challenges of Education in Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartzman |first=Simon |title=The Challenges of Education in Brazil |url=http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/files/Simon-Schwartzman-Challenges-of-Education-in-Brazil.pdf |work=Version 3 |date=26 February 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719204722/http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/files/Simon-Schwartzman-Challenges-of-Education-in-Brazil.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy mandated redistribution of funds within states across municipalities, so that all municipalities could reach the per student spending requirement. Additionally, federal government then supplemented spending in states and municipalities that could not afford the national spending floor.&lt;ref name="Educational Attainment: FUNDEF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education attainment in Brazil: the experience of FUNDEF|url=http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/displaydocumentpdf/?cote=eco/wkp(2005)11&amp;doclanguage=en|work=ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT WORKING PAPERS No.424|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=18 April 2011|author=Luiz de Mello|author2=Mombert Hoppe|last-author-amp=yes|date=4 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, FUNDEF required that 60% of spending go towards teacher salaries and 40% go towards school operations.

In 1998, when FUNDEF was implemented, 30.6 billion [[reais]](R$) were redistributed to six different states. Overall spending increased from approximately 2% of GDP in 1995 to 4% of GDP in 2008. Additionally, teacher salaries increased by an average of 70% in the first few years of implementation.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; According to research done by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), FUNDEF played an important role in increasing enrollment rates over that period, particularly in small municipalities.&lt;ref name="Educational Attainment: FUNDEF"/&gt; It was, however, limited in scope, entailing the investment of funds only to elementary education and expiring in September 2006 when it reached 10 years of creation.&lt;ref name="saraivari.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Public Service: External Disclosure for EDITORA SARAIVA |url=http://www.saraivari.com.br/eng/download/IAN/IAN_2007.pdf |date=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154235/http://www.saraivari.com.br/eng/download/IAN/IAN_2007.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FUNDEB ===
On January 24, 2006, the House of Representatives approved the Proposal for Amendment to the Constitution creating the [[Fund for the Development of Basic Education and Appreciation of the Teaching Profession]] ([[Fundo de Manutenção e Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica e de Valorização de Profissionais de Educação]] (FUNDEB)), intended to finance elementary education (kindergarten, preschool, elementary, and high school education).

FUNDEB was made effective for fourteen years and has been gradually implemented. It was formed by allocating 20% of resources from state and federal taxes, and distributed these among each State and Municipality in proportion to the number of students enrolled.&lt;ref name="saraivari.com.br"/&gt; FUNDEB entailed committing R$2 billion in the first year, R$2.9 billion in the second year, R$3.7 billion in the third and R$4.5 billion in the fourth year and successive.&lt;ref name="saraivari.com.br"/&gt; It extended the financing equalization introduced under FUNDEF to secondary school and pre-school education, in order to ensure funding of basic education for all students in Brazil. FUNDEB also explicitly ensured funding for indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; As a result, FUNDEB increased the volume of federal funds committed to basic education by ten times, injecting new funds into all the stages of basic education and allocating resources for programs targeted to youth and adults.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Education - FUNDEB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12407&amp;Itemid=725|title=FUNDEB|work=FUNDEB|publisher=Ministry of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of FUNDEB is to continue to redistribute resources related to education across the country, taking into account the social and economic development of regions.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Education - FUNDEB"/&gt; The federal government provides supplementary funds targeted to regions where the investment per student is below the minimum value for each year, allocating funds according to the number of students in basic education based on school census data from the previous year. Additionally, federal, state, and municipal councils, empowered by the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]], provide monitoring and control of distribution, transfer and use of program resources.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Education - FUNDEB"/&gt;

== Conditional cash transfer policies ==
Brazil offers [[Conditional Cash Transfer]]s (CCTs) to students, and as of January 2011 has one of the largest CCT programs of any country. The transfers are currently paid to 26% of the population.&lt;ref name="Conditional Cash Transfers and the Basic Income"&gt;{{cite web|last=Britto|first=Tatiana and Fábio Veras Soares|title=Conditional Cash Transfers and the Basic Income: Will they ever Merge?|url=http://www.ipc-undp.org/pub/IPCOnePager124.pdf|publisher=International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bolsa Escola ===
[[Bolsa Escola]] is a cash transfer program that provided cash payments to poor families with children ages 6 to 15 in exchange for their enrollment in school and their attendance of at least 85% of school days. The program was first implemented in 1995 by the municipalities of Brasília (the Federal District) and Campinas (in São Paulo State). Within three years, over 50 municipalities in seven states implemented similar programs. After these successful local CCT experiences in the mid-1990s, CCTs gained momentum in [[Congress of Brazil|Congress]],&lt;ref name="Conditional Cash Transfers and the Basic Income"/&gt; prompting President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government to create the Federal Bolsa Escola program in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Paul Glewwe|Glewwe]] |first=[[Paul Glewwe|Paul]] |title=The Impact of Bolsa Escola/Familia Conditional Transfer Program on Enrollment, Dropout Rates and Grade Promotion in Brazil. |url=http://faculty.apec.umn.edu/pglewwe/documents/BrBolsa6.pdf |author2=Anna Lucia Kassouf |date=August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091801/http://faculty.apec.umn.edu/pglewwe/documents/BrBolsa6.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2001, it had been implemented in 98% of the 5,561 Brazilian municipalities, providing stipends to over 8.2 million children from 4.8 million families, at a cost of over US$700 million. In October 2003, [[Lula da Silva|President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva]] unified Bolsa Escola and three other federal cash transfer programs into a single program called [[Bolsa Família]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Janvry|first=Alain|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Safety-Nets-DP/0542.pdf|publisher=The World Bank|author2=Frederico Finan |author3=Elizabeth Sadoulet |author4=Donald Nelson |author5=Kathy Lindert |author6=Benedicte de la Briere |author7=Peter Lanjouw |title=Brazil's Bolsa Escola Program: The Role of Local Governance in Decentralized Implementation|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bolsa Família ===
{{main|Bolsa Família}}
[[File:Bolsa Expansion Table.png|right|448px]]
Bolsa Família (Family Allowance) is a [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] program which provides financial aid to poor Brazilian families. Families must ensure that their children attend school and are [[vaccination|vaccinated]]. The program's dual aims are to reduce short-term poverty by direct [[welfare benefit|cash aid]], and fight long-term poverty by increasing educational and experiential skills among the poor through conditional cash grants.&lt;ref name=LAW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dji.com.br/decretos/2004-005209/2004-005209.htm |title=Decree n° 5.209, de 17 de setembro de 2004 – Regulates a Law-010.836-2004 – Bolsa Família Program. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029081821/http://dji.com.br/decretos/2004-005209/2004-005209.htm |archivedate=2012-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Economist]] described Bolsa Família as an "anti-poverty scheme invented in South America" (which) "is winning converts worldwide."&lt;ref name=HAPPYFAMILIES&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10650663|title=Happy families: An anti-poverty scheme invented in South America is winning converts worldwide.|publisher=The Economist|location=MACEIÓ|date=Feb 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolsa Familia is currently the largest conditional cash transfer program in the world, though the Mexican program [[Oportunidades]] was the first nationwide program of this kind.&lt;ref name=SILENCIOSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/BRAZILEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21444879~isCURL:Y~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:322341,00.html|title=Bolsa Família: Changing the Lives of Millions in Brazil|publisher=The World Bank|date=Aug 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bolsa Familia program has been mentioned as one factor contributing to the reduction of poverty in Brazil, which fell 27.7% during the first term in the [[Lula administration]].&lt;ref name=MISERIA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://txt.estado.com.br/editorias/2007/09/20/eco-1.93.4.20070920.40.1.xml |title=BRANDÃO JR., Nilson Brandão e ARAGÃO, Marianna.

== Educational measurement ==
The [[National Institute of Educational Studies and Research]] ([[Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira]] (INEP)) is the assessment arm of the Ministry of Education. It was created in 1990 to collect, process and analyze data on education in Brazil.&lt;ref name=INEP&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Education|title=Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira INEP|url=http://www.inep.gov.br/basica/saeb/ingles.htm|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The National Assessment of Basic Education and the Prova Brasil ===
The [[National Assessment of Basic Education]] ([[Sistema Nacional de Avaliação da Educação Básica]] (SAEB)) and the ''Prova Brasil'' ("Test of Brazil") are two exams that make up the Evaluation System of Basic Education in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

The SAEB was the first national Brazilian initiative to measure the Brazilian educational system in depth. It was developed in the late 1980s and was first applied in 1990. In 1995, SAEB was restructured to allow for performance comparison from year to year. Since the first assessment, it has provided data on the quality of the educational systems of Brazil as a whole, geographic regions and the federal units (states and Federal Districts).&lt;ref name="The Ministry of Education, Brazil"&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of the ''Prova Brasil'' and SAEB |url=http://provabrasil.inep.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=14 |publisher=The Ministry of Education, Brazil |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114205711/http://provabrasil.inep.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=14 |archivedate=14 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAEB is carried out by INEP / Ministry of Education every two years. Tests on the Portuguese language and mathematics are taken by a sample of students enrolled in the 4th and 8th grades of elementary school and also the 3rd year of high school, in public and private schools located in both urban and rural areas. Results are aggregated for each state of Brazil and for Brazil as a whole.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Ministry of Education, Brazil"/&gt;

The ''Prova Brasil'' assessment was established in 2005, due to a desire for more detail beyond that included in the SAEB. It expanded the range of results providing data not only for Brazil and Brazilian states, but also for each municipality and school participant. The ''Prova Brasil'' assesses all students in public urban education in the 4th and 8th grades of elementary school, public elementary education in state schools, municipal and federal levels of rural and urban schools that have at least 20 students enrolled in the grade assessed{{clarify|This sentence makes my head hurt!|date=April 2011}}.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Ministry of Education, Brazil"/&gt; The methodology of the two evaluations is the same and they have been used in combination since 2007, but students take one or the other and never both.&lt;ref name="The Ministry of Education, Brazil"/&gt;

=== Index of Basic Education Quality ===
[[File:IDEB Target Achievement.jpg|right|320px]]
In 2007, the Brazilian [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]] implemented the Index of Basic Education Quality ([[Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educacao Basica]] (IDEB)) to monitor education progress in every school, municipality, state and region of Brazil. The IDEB builds on the SAEB and the ''Prova Brasil'', combining the results of the ''Prova Brasil'' test with data on student enrollments and rates of repetition and graduation to generate an index of school performance for all but the smallest of Brazil's 175,000 primary and secondary schools, 5,000-plus municipal school systems, 26 state systems and the federal district systems.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; The results of IDEB studies are reported twice a year, and receive media coverage. Based upon the findings, the federal government establishes targets for improvement of primary and secondary education across schools.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

In the initial years of IDEB's implementation, 2007–2009, it was found that over 70% of municipalities either reached or exceeded targets set by the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]] and INEP for early primary education.&lt;ref name="The Right to Learn"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNICEF|title=The Right to Learn: Promoting Progress and Reducing Inequalities - The state of children and adolescents in Brazil 2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/brazil/pt/siab_resumo_en.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational performance and outcomes ==
According to data from the SAEB/Proval Brasil from 1999 to 2007, there is evidence that educational performance is improving in all regions of Brazil. Performance for the lowest income students has also improved. According to the World Bank, Brazil increased PISA scores more for the lowest income groups than the highest income groups. However, gaps in school attendance and learning levels still remain between different income groups.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Center for Scientific Education.jpg|thumb|A Center for Scientific Education in the Central Region (Centro de Educação Cientifica de Serrinha)]]

=== PISA learning outcomes ===
The [[Programme for International Student Assessment|Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)]] test is designed to measure trends in countries' average student scores over time, relative to a mean score of 500 achieved by the [[OECD]] countries as a group in the year 2000.

Brazil has participated in PISA since 2000. Brazil had the strongest improvement in math and 3rd largest improvement overall (after Luxembourg and Chile) between 2000 and 2009 on [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]], but its absolute scores are still low compared to other participants. For example, 60% of students still scored below 400-showing that they lacked basic numeracy skills—compared with 14% across the OECD and 3-5% in top performing countries Shanghai and Korea. Additionally, Brazil falls behind others in the LAC (Latin American and Caribbean) region, including Chile, Uruguay and Mexico; and LAC countries as a whole trail the [[OECD]] average performance.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; According to the World Bank, "The gap in math skills between the average student in Shanghai and the average Brazilian student is approximately 5 school years."&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

=== Student attendance ===
[[File:Colonel Joseph Dominic School.jpg|thumb|Students at a Northeast Municipality School: Escola Coronel José Domingos]]
After the expansion in education policies, enrollment rates in primary and lower-secondary education have increased. The percentage of children who finish primary education has increased from 42% to 71%, and the percentage of children who complete secondary school has increased from 28% to 55%.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt; Additionally, in 1993 secondary education was often attained only when students came from parents who had attained secondary education. As of 2009, students complete between 9 and 11 years of schooling regardless of the schooling level of their parents, which ranges from 0–10 years. According to the 2007 National Household Sample Survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 97.6% of children between 7 and 14 years old are in school, 27 million students. Children that are not in school tend to belong to afro-descendent, [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] and [[quilombola]] or poor communities, as well as children with disabilities or at-risk youth.&lt;ref name="The Right to Learn"/&gt;

Non-attendance in schools is still a concern in parts of the country. As per estimates given by the IBGE, in more wealthy states, 95% of the children enroll from the beginning. However, in lower income regions, the rate of children enrolling at the beginning is recorded between 60% and 80%. According to a [[UNICEF in Brazil|UNICEF]] survey, 35% of children complete fifth grade education in Brazil.{{clarify|Could an age be added here?

== New developments in policy ==

=== Raising teacher quality and training ===
The Ministry of Education has begun to introduce new standards for teachers, federally supported, higher quality teacher training programs and textbook screening and production. Such investment includes programs such as Mais Educacao, and the expansion of the federal technical schools. The federal government has also invested in policies like school-level planning under FUNDESCOLA, multi-grade teaching under Escola Ativa and capacity building for municipal education managers, with PAR.&lt;ref name="Human Development Sector Management Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office 2010"/&gt;

=== Participation of non-governmental organizations ===
There are some examples of Brazilian government officials engaging with non-governmental organizations to support or manage teachers and schools:
* Popular Center for Culture and Development took over the administration of the local Secretariat of Education between August 2003 and late 2004 and implemented a variety of new teaching tools in the rural schools of Araçuaí, a poor municipality in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref name="NGO Partnerships"&gt;{{cite web |last=Osava |first=Mario |title=Public Schools Fend Off Invasion of New Ideas |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48427 |publisher=IPS |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118002840/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48427 |archivedate=18 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Salvador, capital of the northern state of Bahia, Axé Project got permission in 1999 to create the Barbosa Romeo Municipal School, targeting at-risk youngsters like street kids.&lt;ref name="NGO Partnerships"/&gt;

=== Partnerships with Brazilian companies ===
The presidents of several Brazilian companies, including DPaschoal car parts chain, the Gerdau Group and major banks Itaú, Bradesco and Santander, founded [[All for Education]](See [[Todos Pela Educacao]] in Portuguese),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Todospelaeducacao.org.br|url=http://www.todospelaeducacao.org.br|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and developed goals for Brazil's education and monitoring tools with help of U.S. and Brazilian education experts. All for Education engaged academic and media channels to help promote education as a national priority, and according to a poll by CNO/IBOPE education moved from the seventh biggest public concern to second, after crime.&lt;ref name="Education Too Important"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oppenheimer|first=Andres|title=Education too important to be left in government hands|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/10/02/1854183/education-too-important-to-be.html|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PriestleyEssayEducation.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley|Joseph Priestley's]] ''Essay on Education'']]

'''''Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life''''' (1765) is an educational treatise by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]].&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated to the governing board of [[Warrington Academy]] at which Priestley was a tutor, it argues that the education of young people should anticipate their practical needs, something Priestley accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class businessmen. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The board was convinced and in 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its classical curriculum with Priestley's [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of education have argued that this work and Priestley's later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between the 17th-century [[John Locke]] and the 19th-century [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ferenc Krausz.jpg|thumb|Ferenc Krausz]]
'''Ferenc Krausz''' (born 17 May 1962 in [[Mór]], [[Hungary]]) is a Hungarian-[[Austrians|Austrian]] physicist, whose research team has generated and measured the first [[attosecond]] [[pulse (physics)|light pulse]] and used it for capturing [[electron]]s’ motion inside atoms, marking the birth of [[attophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Documents/papers/Reviews_of_Modern_Physics/RMP81_2009.pdf F. Krausz, M. Ivanov, ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' '''81''', 163 (2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180002/http://www.attoworld.de/Documents/papers/Reviews_of_Modern_Physics/RMP81_2009.pdf |date=2015-09-23 }} (PDF; 14,2&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Krausz studied [[theoretical physics]] at [[Eötvös Loránd University]] and [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Technical University of Budapest]] in Hungary. After his [[habilitation]] at the [[Technical University of Vienna]], in Austria, he became professor at the same institute. In 2003 he was appointed director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics]] in Garching and in 2004 became chair of [[experimental physics]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]]. In 2006 he co-founded the Munich-Centre of Advanced Photonics (MAP) and began serving as one of its directors.

== Research ==
Ferenc Krausz and his research team were the first to create and measure a light pulse lasting less than one femtosecond. The researchers used these attosecond light pulses to make the inner-atomic movement of electrons observable in real time. These results marked the beginning of attosecond physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6863/full/414494a.html Y. Silberberg, ''Nature'' '''414''', 494 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencemag.org/content/297/5584/1131.full M. Lewenstein, ''Science'' '''297''', 1131 (2002).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/419789a.html L. F. DiMauro, ''Nature'' '''419''', 789 (2002).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6923/full/421593a.html P. Bucksbaum, ''Nature'' '''421''', 593 (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the groundwork for this landmark was done by Ferenc Krausz and his team with a large number of innovations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#183 T. Brabec &amp; F. Krausz, ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' '''72''', 545 (2000).]&lt;/ref&gt; to the further development of the femtosecond laser technology to its ultimate limits – towards light pulses which carry the major part of their energy in one single oscillation of the electromagnetic field. An indispensable prerequisite for the generation of such short light pulses is the high-precision control of the delay of the different color components of broadband (white) light over one entire octave. Aperiodic multi-layers (chirped mirrors) emerging from a collaboration of Ferenc Krausz and Robert Szipöcs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#177 R. Szipöcs, K. Ferencz, Ch. Spielmann &amp; F. Krausz, ''Opt. Lett.'' '''19''', 201 (1994).]&lt;/ref&gt; made such a control possible and are indispensable in today's femtosecond laser systems.

In 2001, Ferenc Krausz and his group were able for the first time not only to generate but also to measure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#184 M. Hentschel ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''414''', 509 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt; attosecond light pulses (of extreme ultraviolet light) by means of intense laser pulses consisting of one to two wave cycles. With this, they were shortly thereafter also able to trace the movement of electrons on the subatomic scale in real time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#185 M. Drescher ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''419''', 803 (2002). ]&lt;/ref&gt; The control of the wave form of the femtosecond pulse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#186 A. Baltuska ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''421''', 611 (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated by Ferenc Krausz and his team and the resulting reproducible attosecond pulses enabled the establishment of the attosecond measuring technique&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#187 R. Kienberger ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''427''', 817 (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#187 E. Goulielmakis ''et al.'', ''Science'' '''305''', 1267 (2004).]&lt;/ref&gt; as the technological basis for experimental attosecond physics today. Over the past few years, Ferenc Krausz and his coworkers succeeded with these tools to control electrons in molecules&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#189 M. Kling ''et al.'', ''Science'' '''312''', 246 (2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; and – for the first time – observe in real time a large number of fundamental electron processes such as tunneling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#190 M. Uiberacker ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''446''', 627 (2007).]&lt;/ref&gt; charge transport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#190 A. Cavalieri ''et al.'', ''Nature'' '''449''', 1029 (2007).]&lt;/ref&gt; coherent EUV emission,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attoworld.de/Mainpages/Attoworld/Publications/index.html#191 E.

The on-line site also contains a number of highlighted guest interviews with selected individuals, each well established and prominent in their field of science, with the aim being for them to act as inspiration to young students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/events/sciencefair/blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals chosen include [[Mitch Resnick]], [[Spencer Wells]], [[Kevin Warwick]], and [[Mariette DiChristina]].

==2011 winners==

Shree Bose, a 17-year-old girl in Texas, won the grand prize and $50,000 for her research on the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, that is commonly taken by women with ovarian cancer, tackling the problem of cancer cells growing resistant to cisplatin over time.

Naomi Shah of Portland, OR, won the age 15–16 category with a study of the effects of air quality on lungs, particularly for people who have asthma. Ms. Shah recruited 103 test subjects, performed 24-hour air quality measurements at their homes and workplaces and had each blow into a device that measured the force of their breath.

Lauren Hodge of York, PA, won the age 13–14 category for research on whether marinades reduce the amount of cancer-causing compounds produced by the grilling of [[meat]]. She found that [[lemon juice]] and brown sugar cut the level of carcinogens sharply, while [[soy sauce]] increased them.

People around the world (90 countries) had the opportunity to vote for their favorite projects in Google’s online voting gallery. Google has had more than 100,000 votes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/votes-are-in-for-google-science-fair.html |title= The Votes Are in for the Google Science Fair Finalists and People’s Choice Award Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the competition was really tight.

'''Grammarsgate''' was a 2007 dispute within the [[British Conservative Party]] over party policy on [[grammar schools]]. Party leader [[David Cameron]] refused to support the creation of more grammar schools instead backing Labour's policy of [[City academies|City Academies]].

Conservative leader David Cameron referred to supporters of grammars as "inverse class warriors,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the idea of creating more was delusional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23398833-cameron-stages-the-great-grammar-school-u-turn.do&lt;/ref&gt; This angered many traditional Conservative supporters for whom grammar schools were a popular policy.  The Shadow Europe Minister [[Graham Brady]] resigned over disagreements on whether grammar schools boost [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6701877.stm|title=Tory quits post over grammars row|date=2007-05-29|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1922 committee denounced David Cameron's policy as "absurd".

'''Individual Education''' is a school system rooted in the [[individual psychology]] of [[Alfred Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Paul A.|title=Individual Education: Application of Adler's Personality Theory|journal=The Clearing House|date=September 1985|volume=59|issue=1|pages=35–38|jstor=30186457?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by [[Raymond Corsini]], the Individual Education program includes a number of basic principles. The program consists of three components: Academic; Creative/Applied; Socialization. Corsini also outlined disciplinary procedures and a number of other principles to ensure the most productive possible school environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nisan|first=Larry|title=Individual Education International|url=http://www.psychotherapyinstitute.com/pdf/IndividualEducationArticle.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Principles==

The following are the basic principles of the Individual Education School System:

* Children can veto their attendance in a class.
* Children are not in a competition or race; they only compete against themselves.
* Children decide if and when to study and there is no homework unless the child asks for it.
* Children can learn in whatever fashion works for them.
* Feedback regarding their learning is given to children as soon as possible.
* Every child has a teacher-adviser, an in-school parent figure who the child chooses.
* There are only three rules; they are impartially and strictly enforced.
* Children have the opportunity to develop special talents if they wish.
* Children are offered a wide range of creative/applied courses.
* Learning is considered a privilege, not an obligation.
* Teachers have the right to ask a child to leave a classroom or to stay out of their classroom.
* The school day is divided roughly equally between academic, creative/ applied and socialization.
* All evaluations are objective—not subjective.
* Idiosyncratic classroom rules may be established by the teacher for their class, so long as they don't violate Individual Education principles.
* The "GO" and "STOP" signals are the only means of enforcing rules in the classroom.
* Peer teaching is encouraged.
* Academic progress reports are kept on children, but grades are not given out.
* An individualized pace of learning is encouraged.
* Teachers are responsible for teaching; children are responsible for learning.
* The emphasis is on the development of a successful person.
* Community resources are accessed where possible.
* Children may be ''advised'' to study at the growing edge of their abilities, but the level at which they study is no one's choice but theirs.
* Faculty has three jobs: academic teaching, creative/applied teaching, and socialization training/advising.
* Regular full classroom meetings are mandatory.
* Rewards, honors and other extraneous motivators should be avoided.
* Criticisms, warnings, or various other forms of punishment are strictly forbidden.
* The school operates on the basis of natural and logical consequences, using encouragement and intrinsic joy from skill mastery as the primary motivators for learning.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisan|first=Larry|title=Individual Education International|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|date=Summer 2003|volume=59|issue=2|pages=207–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children have the right to go to any other classroom or supervised library or study hall.
* On any given day, children can choose not to learn.
* Teachers have full freedom in teaching the curriculum, but cannot force children to follow it.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Speaking Out: A Clarification Letter to the Editors: A Critique of Clark's "Individual Education"|journal=The Clearing House|year=1987|volume=60|issue=5|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321|doi=10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Four Rs: Responsibility, Respect, Resourcefulness, Responsiveness===

====Responsibility====
A primary goal of Individual Education is to make children self-sufficient, giving them the mean to become a productive member of society; to become mature and self-reliant. Individual Education is against the infantilization of the child. Instead, Individual Education maximizes the child's self-determination.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Individual Education|url=http://www.psychotherapyinstitute.com/documents/IndividualEducationFull.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Respect====
Individual Education is designed to develop in children feeling of respect of the self and of others. Traditional school systems make children feel inferior and make many of them feel unsuccessful. A system based on rewards and punishment, praise and disapproval, is considered morally bankrupt in the Individual Education system. Some children are not born into environments conducive to academics. Some children have strengths not visible in the traditional system. Any system that insults these children is wrong.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Resourcefulness====
Every child has innate talents, and some strengths and weaknesses. Whatever resources the child has, Individual Education permits expression, whether academic or non-academic. If little Michaelangelo wants to paint, let him. If he therefore never learns how to solve square roots, so be it. If little Willy Gates doesn't want to leave his computer alone, let him. If he therefore never reads Shakespeare, so be it. As long as Michaelangelo can do basic math, and Willy can read well, that is enough. For others, a broader program will be necessary. The child will determine the program that best suits him/her. The curriculum will be there when he/she needs it. The teacher will encourage learning of all types of academe, but will not force it.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Responsiveness====
The concept of Social Interest (''Gemeinschaftsgefuhl'' in Adlerian theory) is central to Individual Education. It means responding to the needs of others. It can be seen in school spirit, patriotism, love for family, or elsewhere. This is critical to a child becoming a productive and happy member of society.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt; This goal is not achieved directly, but rather through the achievement of the first 3 Rs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Timothy|title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_199009_evans.pdf|publisher=Educational Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Program ==
The curriculum in the academic component is similar to that in the traditional system.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, Timothy D. |author2=Corsini, Raymond J. |author3=Gazda, George M. |title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|journal=Educational Leadership|date=September 1990|volume=48|issue=1|pages=52|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9107151407/individual-education-4rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language, mathematics, history/geography and science are developed along the mastery model—through a skills list through which children progress from the beginning of school to the end. Children are tested weekly on average but it is the children who request to be tested; teachers cannot demand that tests be written. Instead a Progress Chart shows how far along the child is (80% is considered mastery). The child doesn't have to learn what he/she has already learned—if the child can pass a test without attending class, the Progress Chart is marked identically to that of a child that attended hours of classroom study. A quick learner is offered the next level of curriculum and the opportunity to tutor others. No numerical or letter-based grading system is used.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Creative/Applied Courses==
These courses can be offered in 6-8 week blocks. 1-3 can be chosen out of 9-12 courses offered. Included are topics students want to learn but do not find in traditional curriculum.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; They usually involve some physical activities (e.g. soccer), some artistic ones (visual arts) and some applied (horticulture). Teachers offer courses in areas of their interest. Community resources are used where possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Socialization aspect==
Teachers socialize children through their positions as teachers and advisers. Children can choose their adviser, though the teacher can choose whether to accept that student.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"/&gt;  The adviser is an equal to the child in this environment (unlike during the academic program), and can only enforce the first school rule, related to dangerous behavior (see below). They meet as a group (the adviser with all children who have chosen him or her, or in the absence of a decision by the child, the child is assigned an adviser).Among other things, students learn about problem solving, health maintenance, interpersonal communications and purpose in life.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; The adviser supervises homeroom, which occurs at the beginning and end of the day and is unstructured. At least once a week and sometimes every day, the adviser holds a class meeting during which time the children discuss their various concerns. Rules regarding homeroom and class meetings can only be decided democratically. The teacher can suggest rules but the children decide by a vote.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The adviser is also the liaison between the child and other teachers with whom there may be difficulties, and can act as a mediator. The adviser also liaises with the child's parents but only on rare occasions and only with the child's consent. The child should always be in the room during such discussions if possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The socialization program includes "playtime" for younger children. Other teachers are also free to discuss social matters with children, as equals.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Disciplinary Procedure==
Individual Education schools have only three school rules:&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;
# Never do anything that could be dangerous, damaging or harmful to yourself or others, or property.
# Be in a supervised place or en route to a supervised place.
# If a teacher gives you the GO signal, leave the room immediately and silently and without distracting the others.

There are no exceptions to these rules. Violation of one of these rules means the child is given a violation slip which they take to the office to have recorded.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

Teachers can establish idiosyncratic classrooms, but they cannot violate the three rules above. Because there are so few rules, teachers must ensure that they are strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

These rules are largely based on the discipline concepts of Rudolf Dreikurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs, R., Grunwald, B., and Pepper, F.|title=Maintaining sanity in the classroom|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dreikurs' concept of logical consequences is particularly useful in understanding the Individual Education disciplinary procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs|first=Rudolf|title=Psychology in the Classroom|year=1957|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GO and STOP===

The GO signal is a gesture towards the door. A teacher may quietly say the child's name and make the gesture. The child must then leave the classroom immediately and silently without disruption to others. The child then has a few options: go to another class; go to the study hall; go to the library; seek to re-enter the classroom. The child can return to the classroom but may be given the STOP signal at that time, which means the child must go to another option. The STOP signal is a hand held face up in the direction of the child entering.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

Teachers should not keep track of the number of times they give out the GO and STOP signals. They have no meaning in terms of the child's progress in school, and should carry no social consequences. A teacher must not warn the child of an impending GO signal, nor intimidate the child by standing close to them or giving them negative looks. There is no use in intimidating the child, who will rebel against such an attempt.&lt;ref name=Nisan2003 /&gt;

===Consequences of Violations===

For each violation there is a consequence. If the ultimate consequence of expulsion is applied, it should include a referral to other professional help.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

===Findings===
Research articles have indicated the following findings:
# Students' scores on standardized achievement tests typically exceed national averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=232–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Yearly academic gains are similar. Several schools that were initially low in district academic rank made impressive gains in rank. This is in spite of only half the amount of academic instructional time being spent in Individual Education schools compared to the traditional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=How Corsini 4R Schools Work|journal=Individual Education International|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are far less disciplinary problems in Individual Education schools.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41–57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education Through 1984|journal=Individual Psychology|year=1985|volume=41|pages=41–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In many cases, 100% of teachers surveyed in a school have said that they prefer teaching in an Individual Education school rather than in a traditional one. The main comment is that teachers can put their energies into teaching.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41–57"/&gt;
# Parents endorse the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=L.|title=Summary of Research on an Individual Education School|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Present Status of Individual Education==

Raymond Corsini recognized in the late 1960s that adults were mistakenly blaming children for their poor behavior and grades in school when the problems were promoted by the school system in which the children operated. Corsini argued that the traditional system of education was fundamentally undemocratic. Children were "sentenced" to attend an institution where they had no choice of teacher or level of study, and minimal choice in terms of subjects, places or means of study. He set out to design a school system in which respect would be a central principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Alternative Education Systems|year=1979|publisher=F.E. Peacock|location=Itasca, IL|author2=Ignar, E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Paul Clark confirmed that Individual Education is an effective method of encouraging learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Paul A.|title=A Case Study of Two Corsini 4R Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED302907&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED302907|publisher=Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association (Louisville, KY, November 8–11, 1988).|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a dozen individual education schools operating in North America and Europe, including Hawaii, Illinois, Colorado, British Columbia and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Keith A|title=Individual Education/Corsini's 4R Schools: Another Look|journal=Individual Psychology|date=September 1987|volume=43|issue=3|pages=370–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One school, the Blooming Grove Academy, operated in Bloomington, Illinois from 1986 until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blooming Grove Academy Student/Parent Handbook|url=http://www.bloominggroveacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ParentHandbook.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forest Park I.E. (K-5) and Hufford I.E.(6-8), both in Joliet, IL continue to operate using the Corsini system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joliet Public Schools/ |url=http://www.joliet86.org/our-schools/forest-park/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original Individual Education School, Ho'Ala School in Wahiawa, Hawaii, continues to be in operation for kindergarten to grade 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ho'Ala School|url=http://www.hoala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; DaVinci Charter School closed down in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Da Vinci Charter School|url=http://www.davincicharterschools.org/cms/|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and History==

The Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW) is offered within a small group setting (5-6 participants) and is designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced educators. It is a structured approach to peer feedback on [[microteaching]] with additional thematic sessions for instructors' learning. During the 24-hour workshop (usually offered over 3-4 days), participants design and conduct three "mini-lessons" and receive verbal, written and video feedback from the other participants who have been learners in the mini-lessons. Using an intensive [[experiential learning]]&lt;ref&gt; Kolb, D. (1984). Experiential Learning: experience as the source of learning and development. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; approach, the workshop encourages reflection and examination of one's teaching practices with feedback focused on the learning process rather than on the content of the lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Day, R. (2005) The Instructional Skills Workshop: The Heart of an Educator Learning Community in British Columbia and Beyond.  INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP OF TEACHING &amp; LEARNING. Retrieved April 8, 2013 from http://iswnetwork.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Hand_ISW_ISSoTL1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who wish to facilitate ISW after taking it must take the 40-hour [[Facilitator Development Workshop]] (FDW), and those who wish to train facilitators take the Trainer Development Workshop (TDW) by shadowing the FDW with a trainer from the network. 

The ISW promotes participatory learning and the building of community. Detailed information about the ISW and related workshops can be found at [http://www.iswnetwork.ca the ISW Network website]

The Instructional Skills Workshop was initially designed for instructors at community colleges and institutes in [[British Columbia]] in 1978 by Douglas Kerr, from the [[Vancouver Community College]] at the request of Diane Morrison from the Ministry of Advanced Education.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;ISW Handbook for Participants. 2006. Pat Pattison &amp; Russell Day, eds. {{ISBN|0-9781360-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[University of British Columbia]] introduced the ISW as a program designed for teaching assistants.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first handbook was written by Douglas Kerr in 1978. As the ISW grew across Canada and internationally, there have been numerous collaborators contributing to the handbook.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"Interpret Europe – European Association for Heritage Interpretation" is an international membership-based association with charitable status that serves all who use first-hand experiences to give natural and cultural heritage a deeper meaning. Interpret Europe encourages dialogue and partnerships between associations and universities, providers and professionals from more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europeanheritagealliance.eu/members/interpret-europe/ 1. European Heritage Alliance] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Heritage interpretation]] developed in [[US National Parks]] during the first half of the 20th century and was originally defined by [[Freeman Tilden]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Tilden: ''Interpreting Our Heritage''. 1. Auflage. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill 1957&lt;/ref&gt; The first national association in Europe was the Society for the Interpretation of Britain’s Heritage, founded in 1975. Interpret Europe was first developed as an open network in 2000, while the association was formally established in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/aldenbieseneu/docs/manual-inherit-en 3. Tilkin, G. (ed.): Professional Development in Heritage Interpretation. Landcommanderij Alden Biesen, Bilzen 2016, 13]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==
Interpret Europe operates on a two-tier system with an Executive Board of Directors and a Supervisory Committee. The Board of Directors manages the organisation and comprises at least two members, each authorised to act as legal representatives. The Board of Directors is appointed by a Supervisory Committee, consisting of three to nine members. The Supervisory Committee is elected by the General Assembly which must approve the activities of both the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpret-europe.net/fileadmin/Documents/Constitution2014-05-10en.pdf Interpret Europe Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Interpret Europe fosters research and practice on the field of heritage interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpret-europe.net/feet/home/interpret-europe/freiburg-declaration.html Freiburg Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage interpretation is a non-formal learning approach encouraging people to search for meanings that natural or cultural heritage holds for them through first-hand experiences of heritage sites, objects or events. It is a worldwide approach mainly used in protected areas, at monuments, in museums or at zoological or botanical gardens.

Interpret Europe promotes itself as a European platform for cooperation and exchange for these institutions, as well as universities where heritage interpretation is taught.

==Activities==
Interpret Europe holds conferences, participates in international projects and organises training events.

''Conferences'' typically feature up to 100 presentations, workshops and study visits, with most conference participants contributing to them. Interpret Europe conferences have been held in Germany (2011), Italy (2012), Sweden (2013), Croatia (2014) and Poland (2015). The 2016 Interpret Europe Conference, in Belgium, addressed the theme of "Heritage Interpretation – for the Future of Europe" and was dedicated to the question of how the experience of visiting historic sites contributes to learning about subjects such as human rights, active citizenship and peace.

''International projects'' focus on a number of subject areas, including the development of European quality criteria (LEADER “Transinterpret” Project, Leonardo “TOPAS” Project), the development of training course offers (Leonardo “HeriQ” Project), working with specific audiences (Grundtvig “HISA” Project) and dealing with competence-based learning approaches (Leonardo “IOEH” Project, Grundtvig “InHerit” Project, Erasmus+ “HIMIS” Project).

''Training events'' are offered in different languages and currently focus on certification courses for interpretive guides, hosts and writers at visitor-related facilities, such as parks or museums.

==Cooperation==
Interpret Europe is part of a global alliance, cooperating with the [[National Association for Interpretation]] (USA), Interpretation Canada, Interpretation Australia and other networks and initiatives.
In Europe, there are currently joint projects with the [[Association for Heritage Interpretation]] (UK), with Sdružení pro interpretaci místního dědictví (Czech Republic) and with Interpretirajmo Hrvatsku (Croatia). Interpret Europe has also entered into an exchange with the Asociación para la Interpretación del Patrimonio (Spain) and with the Associação de Interpretação do Património Natural e Cultural (Portugal). Interpret Europe supports the development of further national associations in Europe.

'''Jacques-François Blondel''' (8 January 1705 – 9 January 1774) was an 18th-century French [[architect]] and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; After running his own highly successful school of architecture for many years, he was appointed Professor of Architecture at the [[Académie Royale d'Architecture]] in 1762, and his ''Cours d'architecture'' ("Course of Architecture", 1771–1777) largely superseded a similarly titled book published in 1675 by his famous namesake, [[François Blondel]], who had occupied the same post in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Colognola states that Jacques-François Blondel was the grandson of François Blondel. This is not supported by Arnold 1998, Tadgell 1998, Herrmann 1982, Harrington 1982, or Braham 1980, pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Place d'Armes (Metz).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Building on the town square of [[Metz]], work of Jacques-François Blondel.]]

Born in [[Rouen]],&lt;ref&gt;Sturges 1952, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; he initially trained under his uncle [[Jean-François Blondel]] (1683–1756), architect of Rouen. Jacques-François was in Paris by 1726 and continued his studies with [[Gilles-Marie Oppenord]], from whom he acquired a knowledge of [[rococo]]. He also worked with [[Jean Mariette]], contributing to the latter's ''L'Architecture françoise'' (1727, 1738), as a writer and as an architectural engraver.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Blondel developed into a conservative and thorough architect, whose rationally ordered mind consolidated French classical tradition and practice.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His first independent publication was the hugely influential encyclopedic work, ''De la Distribution des Maisons de Plaisance, et de la Décoration des Edifices en General'', issued at Paris, 1737&amp;ndash;38. It contained 155 carefully engraved plates. His ''Distribution des Maisons de Plaisance'' and other engraved work attracted a commission to produce thirteen of the engravings for the [[Royal Entry#Festival books|festival book]] commemorating the ''fêtes'' that celebrated the wedding of [[Louise Élisabeth of France|Madame Elizabeth of France]] with [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Dom Philippe of Spain]], published in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1982, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year he opened his own private school in Paris, the ''École des Arts'', sanctioned by the Académie in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;Sturges 1952:16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing years a long sequence of architects profited from his discourse:  [[Étienne-Louis Boullée|Boullée]], [[Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart|Brongniart]], [[Jean Chalgrin|Chalgrin]], [[Philippe de La Guêpière|La Guêpière]], [[Louis Jean Desprez|Desprez]], [[Charles de Wailly|de Wailly]], [[Jacques Gondoin|Gondoin]], [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux|Ledoux]], [[Gilles-Barnabé Guimard|Guimard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet|Rondelet]], and to foreigners who would bring [[Neoclassicism]] home with them: the Anglo-Swedish Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], and the Dane [[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff]]. "Blondel was the most significant French architectural educator of the eighteenth century.....his objective was to establish design principles for domestic architecture that correspond to the classical principles already in practice for civil structures".&lt;ref&gt;Millard, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Metz vor der Restaurierung , v. 1877.jpg|thumb|left|upright|West portal of the cathedral in Metz, designed by Blondel in 1764, replaced in 1887]]

In his clear and rational ''Architecture françoise'', a four-volume work published from 1752 to 1756, he covered the past century and more of French buildings in and near Paris, setting them in their historical context and providing a wealth of detailed information that would otherwise have been lost. In the preface, he remarked, "I have used simple terms and a popular style with the intention of being understood by layman and artist alike; having noticed that recent books about architecture are either badly organised or overlong."&lt;ref&gt;Blondel, quoted in Sturges 1952:16.&lt;/ref&gt; He originally planned eight volumes, but only the first four were published.&lt;ref&gt;The intended contents of the eight volumes, including the four which remained unpublished, are summarised in the preface to vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The work brought him to official notice; he was inducted into the [[Académie royale d'architecture|Académie Royale d'Architecture]] in 1755 and appointed architect to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].&lt;ref&gt;One of a number; he was not ''Premier Architecte du Roi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his executed body of work was small, mostly confined to work he executed at [[Metz]] under commission of the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|duc de Choiseul]],&lt;ref&gt;His classical colonnades and entrance portal for the [[Cathedral of Metz]] were replaced by more acceptable Gothic pastiches in the later nineteenth century, but Blondel's entrance survived long enough to be photographed (illustrated in Sturges 1952:18 fig. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; his approach was soundly grounded: for Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' he wrote the article on masonry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036 Frank A. Kafker: ''Notices sur les auteurs des dix-sept volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie.'' Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie (1989) Volume 7 Issue 7 p.&amp;nbsp;130–131]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as architecture, and contributed nearly 500 articles between 1751 and his death in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab 1984, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, he was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Académie, closing his own school and introducing his comprehensive curriculum to the Académie. His ''Cours d'architecture ou traité de la décoration, distribution et constructions des bâtiments contenant les leçons données en 1750, et les années suivantes'' began appearing in 1771 and ran to nine volumes by 1777, a volume of plates to each two volumes of text; the last volumes were seen through the press by his disciple [[Pierre Patte]]. His ''Cours d'architecture'' is sometimes referred to as the "Petit Blondel" to distinguish it from the "Grand Blondel", his ''Architecture françoise''.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Smith 1918, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYIhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1100 p. 1100]; Edward Smith 1904, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2APnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt;
Blondel's practical, encyclopedic approach, largely ignoring the excesses of [[Rococo]], had survived changes in taste and remained in the mainstream of French architectural training for several decades more.

==Personal life==
Blondel married Marie Anne Garnier in 1729. Their son, Georges-François Blondel, who was born in 1730, became an architectural engraver. They also had a daughter, Claudine Angelique. After his first wife's death in 1755, Jacques-François married [[Manon Balletti]] in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Balletti is probably better known for her relationship with [[Casanova]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, Jean-Baptiste Blondel, who later became an architect for the city of Paris, was born in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1982, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; During his final illness, Jacques-François requested to be taken to his classrooms at the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], where he died surrounded by his books, his architectural models, and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington 1982, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Browning Wyeth''' (born July 6, 1946) is a contemporary American [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painter, son of [[Andrew Wyeth]], and grandson of [[N.C. Wyeth]].  He was raised in [[Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania]], and is artistic heir to the [[Brandywine School]] tradition - painters who worked in the rural [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] area of [[Delaware]] and [[Pennsylvania]], portraying its people, animals, and landscape.

==Biography==

===Early life===
James  Wyeth is the second child of Andrew and Betsy Wyeth, born three years after brother Nicholas, his only [[sibling]]. He was raised on his parents' farm "The Mill" in [[Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania]], in much the same way as his father had been brought up, and with much the same influences.  He demonstrated the same remarkable skills in drawing as his father had done at comparable ages.  He attended public school for six years and then, at his request was privately tutored at home, so he could concentrate on art. His brother Nicholas would later become an [[art dealer]].&lt;ref name=Duff57&gt;{{cite book | author=Duff, J | title=An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art | location=Boston | year=1987 |publisher=Little Brown &amp; Company | isbn=0-8212-1652-X | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic study===
At age 12, Jamie studied with his aunt  [[Carolyn Wyeth]], a well-known artist in her own right, and the resident at that time of the [[N. C. Wyeth House and Studio]], filled with the art work and props of his grandfather.  In the morning he studied English and history at his home, and in the afternoon joined other students at the studio, learning fundamentals of drawing and composition.  He stated later, "She was very restrictive.  It wasn't interesting, but it was important." Through his aunt, Jamie developed an interest in working with [[oil painting]], a medium he enjoyed at a sensory level: the look, smell and feel of it. Carolyn Wyeth and [[Howard Pyle]] were his greatest early influences in developing his technique in working with oil paint. While Jamie's work in [[watercolor]] was similar to his father's, his colors were more vivid.&lt;ref name=Duff57/&gt;&lt;ref name=Polston&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polston|first1=Pamela|title=With Works by Three Wyeths, the Shelburne Museum Invites Viewers to Shift Perspectives|url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/with-works-by-three-wyeths-the-shelburne-museum-invites-viewers-to-shift-perspectives/Content?oid=2244302|website=Seven Days: Vermont's Independent Voice|publisher=Da Capo Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=2014-07-24|date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Jamie was exposed to art in many ways: the works of his talented family members, art books, attendance at exhibitions, meeting with collectors, and becoming acquainted with [[art historian]]s.&lt;ref name=Duff57/&gt; He also developed an offbeat sense of  humor, sometimes veering to the macabre.&lt;ref name="Polston" /&gt;

For at least three years in the early 1960s, when Wyeth was in his middle to late teens, Wyeth painted with his father.  Of their close relationship, Wyeth has said: "Quite simply, Andrew Wyeth is my closest friend—and the painter whose work I most admire. The father/son relationship goes out the window when we talk about one another's work. We are completely frank—as we have nothing to gain by being nice."&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;  At age 19 [about 1965] he traveled to [[New York City]], to better study the artistic resources of the city and to learn [[human anatomy]] by visiting the city [[morgue]].&lt;ref name=Duff60&gt;Duff, ''An American Vision,'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:USCGtenantsharbor.jpg|thumb|Tenants Harbor Lighthouse, Maine prior to construction of a new house and reconstruction of the tower]]
In 1968, Wyeth married Phyllis Mills, daughter of [[Alice du Pont Mills]] and [[James P. Mills]]&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/tim_layden/05/01/union.rags/index.html |title=The story behind Union Rags and two people's shot at Derby glory |date=May 4, 2012 |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |author=Tim Layden}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his models. Although she had been permanently crippled in a car accident and used crutches (and later a motorized chair)&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; to get around, Wyeth found her to be a strong, determined woman whose elusive nature meant that he continually discovered something new about her.  Mills is the subject of many of his paintings (which usually depict her seated) including ''And Then into the Deep Gorge'' (1975), ''Wicker'' (1979), and  ''Whale'' (1978), as well as, by implication, his painting of Phyllis’ hat in ''Wolfbane'' (1984).&lt;ref name=Duff64&gt;Duff, ''An American Vision'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyllis had worked for [[John F. Kennedy]] when he was a senator and president.

In the 1960s Jamie purchased the Lobster Cove property on [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]] in [[Maine]], which had previously been owned by [[Rockwell Kent]], the famed American painter of modernist wilderness landscapes admired by his grandfather and succeeding generations.  Jamie has painted many of the local people on Monhegan Island.  He and his wife have a home at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania on the Brandywine.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;  In the 1990s his parents, Betsy and Andrew Wyeth, sold Jamie the [[Tenants Harbor Light]] on Southern Island in Maine that they had owned since 1978. As it provides him the solitude and subject matter he most enjoys for his work, most of his painting is done at Tenants Harbor; the rest is done at Chadds Ford.&lt;ref name=FWM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Living in New England | first1=S | last1=Dos Santos | first2=E | last2=Louie  | publisher= | location= | year=2000 | page=71 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqmPv7qFlS8C&amp;pg=PA71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The light station has been inactive since 1933.

Early on, Wyeth became interested in oil painting, his grandfather's primary medium, although he is also adept in watercolor and [[tempera]], his father's preferred media.  In describing his aunt's way of thickly applying oil to her palette, he stated, "I could eat it. Tempera never looked particularly edible.  You have to love a medium to work in it.  I love the feel and smell of oil."&lt;ref name= Duff57/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;

In addition to studying his aunt's oil technique, he also admired his father’s and grandfather's work, and that of [[Howard Pyle]], his grandfather’s teacher, as well as American masters [[Winslow Homer]] and [[Thomas Eakins]].  What inspired Wyeth most was not the subject matter or technique of his grandfather, but his "sense of total personal involvement with and intuitive grasp of his subjects".  Jamie Wyeth adopted a wider palette of colors than his father’s, which was closer to his aunt’s and grandfather's color choices.&lt;ref name=Duff57/&gt;

Wyeth's artistic reach is broader than his father's and grandfather's.  He excels in drawing, lithography, etching, egg tempera, watercolor, and mixed media.&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamie Wyeth: Proteus in Paint |author=Hill Stoner, Dr. J |publisher=Traditional Fine Arts Organization, Inc. |year=2010 |work=Articles and Essays on American Art |url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsmu/nmus82f.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405213319/http://www.tfaoi.com/newsmu/nmus82f.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duff160&gt;Duff, ''An American Vision'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Though grounded in this family’s artist tradition and subjects, and bound by the same solitude of his art, his wider travels and experiences have shaped a more rounded artist.  In travels to Europe, he studied the Flemish and Dutch masters, and learned the intricate and exacting process of lithography, producing a substantial amount of graphic work.&lt;ref name=Duff160/&gt;

On portrait painting, Wyeth stated, "To me, a portrait is not so much the actual painting, but just spending the time with the person, traveling with him, watching him eat, watching him sleep. When I work on a portrait, it's really [[osmosis]]. I try to become the person I'm painting. A successful portrait isn't about the sitter's physical characteristics—his nose, eyeballs and whatnot—but more the mood and the overall effect. I try not to impose anything of mine on him. I try to get to the point where if the sitter painted, he'd paint a portrait just the way I'm doing it."&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Carpenter and Greg Schaber, "Jamie Wyeth: His Art and Insights," ''The Artists Magazine'' '''14''', 8 (August 1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his aunt Carolyn, Wyeth enjoys painting domestic animals, such as chickens, dogs, pigs, and horses.  To do so, he pays particular attention to the texture of the animal's fur or feathers, the glossiness of its eye, the grass around its feet.  To create the desired effects, he uses brushstrokes for texture and varnish for sheen.&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt; Wild birds that appear frequently in his work are the common [[seagull]] and the [[raven]], the first of which also features in his ''Seven Deadly Sins'' series.&lt;ref name=MFA-Inferno&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript: Jamie Wyeth, Inferno|url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/jamie-wyeth/transcript-inferno|website=MFA: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pumpkin]]s also have appeared in several paintings, often carved into [[Jack-o-lantern]]s as if for [[Halloween]]. Other repeated subjects include the trunks of trees, and their exposed tangled roots, or [[tree stump]]s.

Since the 1970s, Wyeth has often painted on [[corrugated cardboard]], and now uses "archival" versions of the surface.  He likes the rough striated effect it gives to his paintings, and he has also portrayed the material with great fidelity in depictions on conventional canvas, such as the painting ''10W30'' (1981), depicting a pair of chickens nesting in a discarded carton that once had held 10W30 grade [[engine oil]].  He also uses thick, opaque watercolor pigments, straight from the tube, creating effects similar to oil paints.&lt;ref name="MFA-Inferno" /&gt;

To evade interruptions by curious sightseers, Wyeth has resorted to painting outdoors in a weathered, smelly, used [[fish bait]] box, in the manner of a plywood [[hunting blind]].&lt;ref name="Annas" /&gt;

==Works==

===Early===
With advice from his father, always his closest friend but always frank, Wyeth quickly developed his technique and style. In 1963, at the age of 17, he painted ''Portrait of Shorty'', a bravura minutely detailed portrait of a local railroad worker. Shorty was a man who lived for twenty years in Chadds Ford, in a humble hut as a [[hermit]], only speaking with a local store owner.  The composition of an unshaven Shorty against an elegant [[wing chair]] is unexpected.&lt;ref name=Duff57/&gt; Joyce Hill Stoner, art historian and paintings conservator, found it has the "exactitude characteristic of sixteenth-century German oil technique."&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;

[[Lincoln Kirstein]], a family friend of the Wyeth family, was the subject of his first major portrait of a prominent person, titled appropriately, ''Portrait of Lincoln Kirstein''.&lt;ref name=Duff60/&gt;  Kirstein was impressed by the portrait, and declared Wyeth the finest American portrait painter since [[John Singer Sargent]]. Kerstein's quote made it into the catalog for his first one-man exhibition, at the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Nureyev: The Life | author=Kavanagh, J | publisher=Vintage Books | location=New York and Toronto | year=2008 | pages=503–504| isbn=978-0-375-70472-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCe1Pc_l38kC&amp;pg=PA504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes and portraits of people from the Chadds Ford area were presented at the exhibit.&lt;ref name=FWM/&gt;

==="Eyewitness to Space"===
From 1966 to 1971, Wyeth served in the [[Delaware Air National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamiewyeth.com/biography.html|title=Biography of Jamie Wyeth|work=jamiewyeth.com|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although at one point he was scheduled for immediate deployment to the [[Vietnam War]], flights were cancelled for noncombatants.  During that period, he painted ''Adam and Eve and the C-97'' (1969), depicting the Biblical couple astonished by a [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] [[cargo plane]] flying overhead.  The painting was executed using military-standard oil paint on a piece of [[parachute]] cloth measuring {{convert|10|by|30|ft|m}}.

His assignment changed when he was granted top [[security clearance]]&lt;ref&gt;Duff, "An American Vision" p.157&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in [[Space art#Space art related books|“Eyewitness to Space”]], a program jointly sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC, to depict the activities of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo moon mission]] through an artist's perspective. A total of 47 artists were involved in the "Eyewitness to Space" program, including [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Lamar Dodd]], [[Norman Rockwell]], and [[Morris Graves]].  Participants met astronauts at launch sites, such as [[Cape Kennedy]], or rode helicopters to observe the pickup of astronauts. Of the works developed, the National Gallery of Arts chose 70 paintings, sculptures, and drawings for "The Artist and Space" exhibit that ran from December 1969 to early January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/1969/artist_space.html |title=The Artist and Space |year=2011 |work=Past Exhibitions |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political portraits and works===
* ''Draft Age'' (1965), made during the Vietnam War, portrays a friend as a rebellious, proud young man who might be required to serve his country to protect values that he may question. Made in oil, the picture shows mastery of the subject, message and medium beyond the artist's nineteen years.&lt;ref name=Duff60/&gt;
* Through his acquaintance with the Kennedy family, Wyeth was commissioned to do a posthumous unofficial ''Portrait of John F. Kennedy'' (1967), with the understanding that he would keep it if it was not accepted by the surviving family.  Both brothers [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]] posed for Wyeth, and he studied photographs and films of the deceased president for three weeks.&lt;ref name=Duff166&gt;Duff, ’’An American Vision’’, pp. 60, 157, 166&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to portray JFK early in his presidency, perhaps in a moment of doubt or indecision over the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], with the burden of power weighing on him.  [[Jackie Kennedy]] thought the portrait accurate, but RFK and other family members did not like the less-than-triumphal depiction.  The painting did not hang in the [[White House]], and after stays at the French embassy in Paris, France and [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in [[Dublin, Ireland]], it was on loan from the artist to The Vice-President's Residence Foundation in Washington DC. Through great public acceptance, it has become one of the most famous images of JFK,&lt;ref name=Duff166/&gt; including use on a 1988 [[postage stamp]] issued in Ireland. In 2014, the artist gave the portrait as a partial gift and partial purchase to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref name="Smee" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MFA-JFK&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Acquires Iconic Portrait of John F.

* [[Harper's Magazine]] engaged Wyeth as a court artist for the Watergate hearings and trials&lt;ref name=FWM/&gt; that included [[US Senate]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] proceedings regarding the impeachment of President [[Richard Nixon]], including the tense courtroom scenes in Judge [[John J.

* In New York during the 1970s, Wyeth painted President-elect [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Andy Warhol Diaries | first1=A | last1=Warhol | editor=Hackett, P  | publisher=Grand Central Publishing | location=New York | year=1989 | page=Monday, December 20, 1976 | isbn=978-0-446-57124-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmBQv6Ib6tgC&amp;pg=PT372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1984 he painted ''Night Vision'' to commemorate the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. This piece depicts a soldier of the Vietnam era as though seen through a Starlight scope or similar [[night vision device]]. It was later reproduced as a signed limited edition and sold to benefit the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial, colloquially known as "The Wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandywinemuseum.org/news_print/2003/news007_print.html |title=Wyeth Tribute to Vietnam Veterans on View at the Brandywine River Museum, March 2003 |work=Press Releases |publisher=Brandywine River Museum |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main body of work===
[[File:Monhegan Harbor, Monhegan, ME.jpg|thumb|Monhegan Harbor, [[Monhegan, Maine]] (1909)]]
* ''Portrait of Andrew Wyeth'' (1969) depicts his father with a sober expression.  His eyes, something Wyeth focuses on to indicate character, are determined and focused.&lt;ref name=Duff60/&gt;  The ruddy face of his father, and the large buttons of his naval coat, with all else in black, suggest that the subject had just arrived home fresh from a brisk walk by the sea.
* In New York during the 1970s, Wyeth painted [[Andy Warhol]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]]&lt;ref name=Duff60/&gt; and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Warhol, "Diaries of Warhol" Monday, March 7, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  Wyeth and Andy Warhol exchanged portraits of each other.&lt;ref name="MFAshow" /&gt; A  1976 show featuring the portraits, at the Coe Kerr Gallery in New York, has been credited with reviving the popularity of the genre, after a period of being eclipsed by [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Goukassian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goukassian|first1=Elena|title=The artists of the National Portrait Gallery’s ‘Face Value’ stood by portraiture in the age of abstract expressionism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/05/01/face-value-national-gallery-art-warhol-wyeth/|accessdate=2014-07-30|work=The Washington Post|date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Wendy Wick Reaves has said of the pair: "They were considered polar opposites. Andy was called the Patriarch of Pop, and Jamie was called Prince of Realism. ... Both had become enormously famous but also had endured extraordinary critical censure for the way their art was done. And they had a lot of interests in common: They collected Americana; they were interested in death and morbidity. They really got along splendidly."&lt;ref name=Stamberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamberg|first1=Susan|title=As Portraits Became Passé, These Artists Redefined 'Face Value'|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/29/316408346/as-portraits-became-pass-these-artists-redefined-face-value|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Portrait of Andy Warhol'' (1976), Warhol seems to be "caught off guard without his personal persona".  Nureyev's portrait reflects an intense man.  Wyeth was fascinated by Nureyev, and found him to have an animal-like presence and strength that is captured in the portrait.&lt;ref name=Duff60/&gt;
*Apart from visits to New York, his primary subjects in the 1970s and 1980s were the people, animals, and landscapes of his [[Pennsylvania]] home and of [[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan island]] in Maine.
*Some of Wyeth's most famous animal portraits are: ''Portrait of a Pig'' (1970),&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists | author=Morgan, A. L. | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2007 | page=532 | isbn=978-0-19-512878-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pyvjWAcwnHEC&amp;pg=PA532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angus'' (1974), ''Islander'' (1975), and  ''10W30'' (1981).&lt;ref name=Duff204&gt;Duff, ''An American Vision,'' pp. 204-205&lt;/ref&gt; Wyeth knows the animals that he paints and the work grows out of their kinship. When painting animals Wyeth changes the textures of the paint to reflect fur, wool, or feathers.&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;
* Wyeth's self-portrait ''Pumpkinhead—Self-Portrait'' (1972),&lt;ref name=Duff204/&gt; depicting a figure in black standing in a field with a pumpkin over his head, is as self-effacing as his father’s self-portrait ''[[Trodden Weed]]'' (1951), showing only Andrew’s legs from the knees down. Jamie Wyeth submitted it to the [[National Academy of Design]] as a required response to his invitation to join, but it was rejected.&lt;ref name=Annas&gt;{{cite web|last1=Annas|first1=Teresa|title=The Wyeth way|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/254371|website=HamptonRoads.com|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot|date=April 21, 2007|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then submitted a half-length nude self-portrait against  a dark background, securing his membership at the young age of 23.&lt;ref name=NAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Portrait (1979.12)|url=http://www.nationalacademy.org/collections/search/#/list/1690|website=National Academy Museum|publisher=National Academy Museum|accessdate=2014-07-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728202828/http://www.nationalacademy.org/collections/search/#/list/1690|archivedate=July 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kleberg'' (1984), portrays a [[Labrador retriever|yellow Labrador]] adorned with a comical black ring drawn around one eye, sitting next to a traditional [[skep]] beehive.  The painting captures Wyeth's love of animals, but also reflects some of Wyeth's favorite books, visible on a bookshelf in the background. Titles of books indicate the close connection to his family: ''[[Treasure Island]]'', illustrated by his grandfather, N. C. Wyeth; ''[[Christina's World]]'' made by his father; and ''The Stray'', written by his mother, Betsy Wyeth and illustrated by Jamie Wyeth.  Other individuals who earned his respect are represented: Howard Pyle in ''Pyle's Book of Pirates'', Lincoln Kirstein's ''Lay This Laurel,'' and a biography of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Favored books include ''[[The Magus (novel)|The Magus]]'' by [[John Fowles]], ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes|The Wanderer]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] and the children's book ''[[Wind in the Willows]]''.&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;
* Much of his output since 1990 was created at Tenants Harbor. Wyeth’s fascination with island life is revealed in its more disturbing form in ''If Once You Have Slept on an Island'' (1996) which depicts a young woman sitting on a tousled bed who appears sad and exhausted from wild dreams. The title was derived from a poem by [[Rachel Field]] with the opening lines:&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If once you have slept on an island,&lt;br/&gt;You'll never be quite the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*''Screen Door to the Sea'', painted in 1994, is also representative of this era.  This painting features a teenage islander who Wyeth painted a number of times, named "Orca Bates".  On painting him, Wyeth has said, "I see a distinct islandness with islanders, a certain edge. Am I putting that into them? I don't care, as long as something comes out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Cindy|title=A Portrait of Orca Bates|journal=Yankee|date=September 1996|volume=60|issue=9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This painting is representative of an “elusive form of realism”, typical of later works by Wyeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tolnick Champa|first1=Judith|title=Jamie Wyeth: Another Breed of Realism|journal=Art New England|date=July–August 2014|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though grounded in portraiture, the painting’s details suggest a narrative.
* In 2002, Wyeth followed up with another humorous self-portrait ''Pumpkinhead Visits the Lighthouse''.
* ''Inferno, Monhegan'' (2005) depicts a semi-expressionistic chaotic scene of a young boy stuffing decaying garbage into a beachside [[incinerator]], surrounded by a screaming flock of seagulls trying to snatch pieces of leftover food. This large {{convert|60|by|80|in|m|adj=on}} painting was executed on corrugated cardboard with thick opaque watercolor pigments, and its completion was documented in a short film accompanying a 2014 traveling exhibition.&lt;ref name="MFA-Inferno" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergeron&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergeron|first1=Chris|title=Jamie Wyeth's wild world at the MFA|url=http://newton.wickedlocal.com/article/20140720/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/140729831/12434/ENTERTAINMENT/?Start=1|accessdate=2014-07-24|work=Wicked  Local Newton: News from the Newton Tab|publisher=Gatehouse Media, Inc.|date=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giuliano" /&gt;  The work is a reinterpretation of earlier paintings,&lt;ref name="Delco" /&gt; such as ''Cat Bates of Monhegan'' (1995) and ''Harbor, Monhegan'' (1998), which show the same scene in a more realist style.
* A ''Seven Deadly Sins'' (c. 2005–2008) series of paintings depicts the [[Seven deadly sins|traditional vices]] using expressive images of [[seagull]]s enacting each scenario.&lt;ref name="AdelsonCat" /&gt; The series was inspired in part by Wyeth's memories of a parallel series done in 1945–1949 by New York [[magical realist]] painter [[Paul Cadmus]].&lt;ref name=Delco&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Gulls inspire ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ series|url=http://www.delconewsnetwork.com/articles/2009/09/12/entertainment/doc4aa119cf2895d569293090.txt?viewmode=fullstory|website=Delaware County News Network|publisher=Delco News Network|accessdate=2014-07-27|date=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Other noteworthy commissions in addition to Wyeth's portrait of JFK have been the design of a 1971 eight-cent Christmas stamp, the official [[White House]] [[Christmas card]]s for 1981 and 1984, and the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] portrait for use on the 1995 [[Special Olympics]] World Summer Games Commemorative coin. He also lent his support to [[lighthouse]] preservation efforts in Maine in 1995 with his exhibition, "Island Light".

Wyeth has illustrated three children's books, ''The Stray'' (1979), written by his mother Betsy James Wyeth,  ''Cabbages and Kings'' (1997), written by Elizabeth Seabrook.,&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt; and ''Sammy in the Sky'' (2011) about the loss of a beloved dog, by Maine author Barbara Walsh.

Wyeth has also produced detailed miniature [[diorama]]s (called ''tableaux vivants''), including two 2013 works: one portrays Andy Warhol dining with friends at [[The Factory]], and another depicts Lincoln Kirstein and other friends dining at a New York restaurant. These works were exhibited in a 2014 retrospective show.&lt;ref name="MFAshow" /&gt;

===Critical reaction===
When Wyeth had his first exhibition in New York in 1965, he received a scathing review by the ''New York Times''.  His work was compared to that of his ancestors, neither of whom were considered contenders in the commercial business of modern art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCY0CaE9ZskC&amp;pg=PA294&amp; |title=The Business of Being an Artist |author=Grant, D |year=2010 |page=294 |publisher=Allworth Press |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie Wyeth’s critics level some of the same charges as they do against his father—to some, both artists seem anachronistic, too close to illustration, and out of touch with the 20th century evolution of Post-Picasso modernism. He answers, "We're charged, my father and I, with being a pack of illustrators. I've always taken it as a supreme compliment. What's wrong with illustration? There's this thing now that illustrations are sort of secondary to art and I think it's a bunch of crap."&lt;ref&gt;David Kinney, ''The Grandson Also Rises'' The ''Wilmington News Journal'' (6 February 1998), D2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Brandywine River Museum, "James Wyeth had earned national attention with a posthumous portrait of John F. Kennedy and other work. Later, he produced striking portraits of Rudolf Nureyev and Andy Warhol, studies for which are in the museum's collection. Since then, Wyeth has established a distinctive style, characterized by strong images and sharp contrasts in his landscapes and portraits. He is known for his monumental animal portraits, including ''Portrait of Pig'' and ''Raven'' in the museum's collection, which represents various stages in his changing style."&lt;ref name=Brandywine/&gt;

In "Jamie Wyeth: Proteus in Paint" Joyce Hill Stoner said of Wyeth:  Jamie Wyeth lives on his own terms with a healthy respect for his heritage and a unique ability to translate acute observations into a spectrum of visual experiences in an impressive range of styles from the laser-like intensity of ''Portrait of Shorty'' to the archetypal but ironic encrusted image of an animal friend in ''Portrait of Pig'' to the eerie painterly dreamscape of ''Comet''.&lt;ref name=Stoner/&gt;

Ann Morgan, author of ''Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Arts'', describes his style as one that follows the realistic style of his father, Andrew Wyeth, while venturing into "more psychologically fraught territory".&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;  When making portraits, Wyeth sees into the nature of an individual and portrays them with such detail and realism that the shocked subjects "often hid them up in their closets".&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, "The Andy Warhol Diaries" p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
[[File:Brandywine river museum.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Brandywine River Museum]], Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania]]
* Wyeth's work became more widely known after being shown alongside his father's and grandfather's art at an exhibition in 1971 at the newly opened [[Brandywine River Museum]] at Chadds Ford, the foremost repository for all the Brandywine artists.  A highlight of the show was Wyeth’s ''Portrait of Pig'', a {{convert|7|by|5|ft|m|adj=on}} painting befitting its subject’s size and status.&lt;ref name=Brandywine&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandywinemuseum.org/collect.html |title=Collections |year=2011 |work=Brandywine River Museum |publisher=Brandywine Conservancy |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 1987, Wyeth traveled to [[Leningrad]] to attend the opening of ''An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art'', a major exhibition of 117 works whose rural subjects proved very popular with the Russian people. In an earlier visit during the summer of 1975, Wyeth had been invited to the [[Soviet Union]] to tour the country’s art museums, and he had taken the opportunity to meet with [[Soviet dissidents|dissident artists]]. After his 1987 trip, he expressed astonishment at the newfound artistic freedom there, and also his concerns that [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] risked a repressive backlash against his new policy of "[[Glasnost]]" (this was several years before the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]]).&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Robert M.|title=Wyeth sees both freedom, apprehension in U.S.S.R.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19870701&amp;id=lVAlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7q0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3009,34222|accessdate=2014-07-23|work=The Sumter Daily Item|date=July 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Renzulli''' (born July 7, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]]. He is the Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Connecticut]]'s Neag School of Education.

==Early life==
Renzulli graduated with a bachelor's degree from [[Rowan University]].&lt;ref name="uconnbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Renzulli Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor|url=https://education.uconn.edu/person/joseph-renzulli/|website=Neag School of Education|publisher=University of Connecticut|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a master in education degree from [[Rutgers University]], and a doctorate from the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="uconnbio"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Three-rings.gif|thumb]]
Renzulli is the Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the University of Connecticut's Neag School of Education,&lt;ref name="uconnbio"/&gt; where he also serves as director of the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented. His research has focused on the identification and development of creativity and giftedness in young people and on organizational models and curricular strategies for total school improvement. A focus of his work has been on applying the strategies of gifted education to the improvement of learning for all students. 

Renzulli developed the three-ring model of giftedness, which promoted a broadened conception of giftedness. He also developed the "Schoolwide Enrichment Model" for developing children's talents in schools. Renzulli is known for his contributions to understanding [[giftedness]]. He argues that high potential individuals may only turn their asset into talent if their environment encourages it.&lt;ref name="conversationhaveyoueverwondered"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pennequin|first1=Valérie|last2=Tricard |first2=Elodie|title=Have you ever wondered if you were exceptionally gifted?|url=http://theconversation.com/have-you-ever-wondered-if-you-were-exceptionally-gifted-87051|accessdate=April 30, 2018|work=The Conversation|date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renzulli is a Fellow in the American Psychological Association and was a consultant to the White House Task Force on Education of the Gifted and Talented.  He established the UConn Mentor Connection program for gifted young students and the summer Confratute program at UConn in 1978, which has served thousands of teachers and administrators from around the world.

'''Kenneth Dupee Swan''' (1887–1970), more commonly known as '''K.D. Swan''', was an American [[nature photography|nature photographer]] in the early part of the 20th century.  During his career in the [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]] (1911–1947) he took many picture of the [[American Northwest]]. Swan captured the face of public lands, revealing its wildness and value to the American public. His messages of long ago still emanate from his images - the value of conserving public lands and the joy of living in magnificent wild places.

==Early life==

Swan first learned to love America's wilderness while rambling the hills of his native [[Massachusetts]].  His "first love was a range of hills — the Blue Hills of Milton and Quincy — high points on the south rim of the Boston Basin." As he later described it, "This was my wilderness, easily reached from home by bicycle, trolley, or even on foot, and here I spent countless carefree hours in all seasons.... Here, too, was born a desire to become a forester ... a decision I have never regretted."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;&lt;!-- Dead link [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3951/is_200604/ai_n17171917/pg_1]--&gt; [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1021380461.html Forest Images by K. D. Swan: Pictures Needed in the Telling | Montana: The Magazine of Western History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Swan, Splendid Was the Trail (Missoula, Mont., 1968), 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He arrived in [[Missoula, Montana]] in the summer of 1911. With a master's degree in Forestry from [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; he was among a cadre of young energetic foresters who joined the newly created Forest Service where he was appointed as a forest assistant.

He surveyed homestead sites, planted trees, and cruised timber in the [[Lewis and Clark National Forest|Jefferson National Forest]] (now Lewis and Clark), [[Custer National Forest|Sioux National Forest]] (now Custer), and [[Clearwater National Forest]]. In 1913, the agency reassigned him to the Northern Region headquarters in [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], where he began a seven-year stint as a topographic draftsman, an "assignment which brought... great satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Swan, "Musselshell Reminiscence," in ''Early Days in the Forest Service'', vol. 2 (Missoula, Mont., 1955), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the remainder of his career working out of the regional office.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Forest education and photography==

His work in forestry eventually led into the arena of public information and photography. In the 1920s, the Forest Service established the Information and Education Branch. Already recognized as a photographer, Swan was soon transferred to it.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;  Through his pictures and many public presentations, Swan revealed the unique beauty of remote, wild areas in [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], and the [[Dakotas]].

Swan's images were used to illustrate a great variety of Forest Service publications, many of which he also authored. They also appeared in publications ranging from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. Swan regularly toured the region giving lectures on forest [[Conservation movement|conservation]], illustrated by both still slides and moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Missoula (Mont.) ''Missoulian'', November 30, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late years==

By Swan's retirement in 1947, his work had become art that transcended the mere recording of a place in time. Today, almost a century later, the photographs still engage and entrance viewers and tell a resounding story about public lands in the West. In 1968, he published ''Splendid Was the Trail'', a memoir that offered a detailed look at life and work in a remote, sparsely populated region during the formative years of the Forest Service.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==

A collection of Swan's photographs is now in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as in many exhibits throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/centennial/calendar.shtml Northern Region - Centennial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602081410/http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/centennial/calendar.shtml |date=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10474">'''LAUNCH''' is a program sponsored by  [[NASA]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[US Agency for International Development]], and the [[US Department of State]] that seeks sustainable innovations through quasi-annual challenges, forums, and a business accelerator. The program began in 2010 and has since focused on themes such as energy, health, water, and waste solutions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201304251928BIZWIRE_USPRX____BW6914&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=212856&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 2010: LAUNCH Water and LAUNCH Health ===
Launch was founded in 2010 by NASA, Nike, USAID, and the US Department of State. The inaugural event, LAUNCH: Water, was held at the NASA Kennedy Space Station in March 2010 and highlighted innovations and research related to water sustainability. Some of the innovations included bacterial water sensing, a floating contaminant sensor network, and evaporation-based underground irrigation technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/mar/HQ_10-061_launch_water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/03/11/nasas-latest-launch-focuses-water-sustainability-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The second LAUNCH forum, LAUNCH: Health, took place in October of that same year, also at the Kennedy Space Center. This challenge highlighted innovations in optimal nutrition (access, choice, and quality of nutritious food and required nutrients), primary preventive health care, and ways to improve fitness and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/stp/centennial_challenges/launch_health_prt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011: LAUNCH Energy ===
The LAUNCH: Energy forum took place in November 2011 at the Kennedy Space Center and highlighted innovations in sustainable energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://inventforhumanity.org/2011/blog/launch-energy-forum-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; The forum featured innovations in fuel cell technology, electricity management, and clean cookstoves.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2011/11/12/launch-energy-forum-update-mission-control&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2011/11/13/launch-energy-forum-fueling-ideas-propelling-innovation&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012: LAUNCH Beyond Waste ===
LAUNCH Beyond waste took place in 2012 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This cycle highlighted nine innovations in the fields of waste-to-energy, ‘eWaste’, ‘upcycling’ and recycling, agricultural waste and conservation, medical waste, sustainable chemicals and materials, and improved sanitation. The forum also included sessions about how to accelerate these innovations towards real-world implementation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/04/02/launching-ideas-waste-less-tomorrow&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, LAUNCH: Health Innovator Samuel Sia's company OPKO Health was awarded a contract to implement their diagnostic platform on the international space station.&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=701899&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous LAUNCH: Beyond Waste innovators were recognized for their projects in the fall of 2012.

'''La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana,''' for 270 years, was Havana's repository for unwanted children. The House of Charity started during a time when Cuba was experiencing extreme poverty, unemployment, and corrupt government. Corrupt leaders were plundering the public treasuring and little attention was given to social assistance, health, education, or the protection of the poor: "los desamparados".

== History==
[[File:Casa de Beneficencia, Habana DORMITORIO.png|thumb|left|Dormitory-Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana]]
The Real Casa de Maternidad y Beneficencia emerged as a product of several transitions between "La Casa Cuna," the "Real Casa de Maternidad" and finally "La Casa de Beneficencia." It was not until 1794 during the government of Luis de las Casas that the Beneficencia was located in its final location at the corners of San Lazaro and Belascoain.

The Casa Cuna was founded in 1687 by Bishop [[Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela]].  His death left a building unfinished due to lack of resources to carry out his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@robertodominguez_64426/la-real-casa-cuna-de-la-habana-por-omar-r%C3%ADos-g-tesoro-territorial-a-central-y-caribe-834ccc23d031|title=LA REAL CASA CUNA DE LA HABANA|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, Bishop Fray Gerónimo de Nosti y Valdés, took up his idea and restored the Casa Cuna in a building he built on the corner of Oficios and Muralla.&lt;ref name=cibercuba&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cibercuba.com/lecturas/la-real-casa-de-beneficencia-y-maternidad|title=La Real Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It housed 200 orphans.&lt;ref name=Apellido_Vald/&gt; 

In the year 1792 an initiative of the Countess of Jaruco, the Marquises of Cárdenas de Monte Hermoso, the Marquis of Casa Peñalver and the Bishop of the Provinces of Louisiana and Florida, Don Luis de Peñalver was founded the so-called "Real Casa de Beneficencia." It accepted only females, settling in a cavalry room of land located in front of the San Lázaro cove, an area known as the Betancourt Garden that the Bishop of Peñalver gave for this purpose.

Antonia María Menocal, a lady of Habana, left at the time of her death in 1830 a large legacy to be invested in charitable works. The executor assigned it to the creation of a Maternity House and for the preservation and education of children up to the age of six.&lt;ref name=Apellido_Vald/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_o8WAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA71&amp;ots=lhLst387Cm&amp;dq=Antonia%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Menocal&amp;pg=RA1-PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=Antonia%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Menocal&amp;f=false|title=Anales de la Academia de Ciencias Medicas, Fïsicas y ..., Volumes 40-41|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcial Dupierris in 1857 writes:

La Casa de Maternidad was added to the Beneficiencia on the initiative of Spanish Governor-[[Manuel Gutiérrez de la Concha|Gutierrez de la Concha]], who administered the island from 1850 to 1852. The mission of La Casa de Maternida was to give refuge to those whose mothers had placed their child in the care of Beneficence. La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad was administered by the Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País.

In 1914 the State assumed the institution which continued to survive on the alms and the service of the Daughters of Charity of Cuba. 

The [[Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital]], the largest health facility in the country was built in place of the former La Casa de Beneficencia.&lt;ref name=cibercuba/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apellido_Vald/&gt;

==Urban setting==
[[File:La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana. Map of barrio San Lazaro, 1855.jpg|thumb|left|Map of barrio San Lazaro, 1855]]
La Casa de Beneficencia, along with the 1916 statute of General [[Antonio Maceo Grajales|Antonio Maceo]] by the italian sculptor Doménico Boni, was one of three buildings, with the hotel Manhattan, by the U.S. Engineering firm of [[Purdy and Henderson, Engineers| Purdy and Henderson]], and the Hotel Vista Alegre at the beginning of Calle Belasquain, that anchored the large expanse of land that had been known as the Caleta de San Lazaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cubaessurtidor.blogspot.com/2014/04/cafe-vista-alegre-en-habana-de-otros.html|title=Café Vista Alegre en Habana de otros tiempos|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument to Antonio Maceo was located in a place previously occupied by the Batería de la Reina (Battery of the Queen), in front of the La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad, at the intersection of Belascoaín and San Lázaro. In 1916 the monument was placed but the park was not built,  many voices were raised asking that a greater tribute deserved be paid to the figure of Antonio Maceo. Kees van Tilburg writes:{{clear}}{{quote|
"Antonio Maceo (1845 –1896) was one of the most noteworthy guerrilla leaders in 19th century Latin America. Maceo, together with his father and brothers joined the Ten Years’ War right from the beginning in 1868. Because of his bravery and ability to outmaneuver the Spanish Army, Antonio was promoted to (Lieutenant) Colonel within half a year and five years later to Brigadier General. The humble origin of Maceo and the color of his skin, delayed his raising to Major General, due to the racist and class exclusiveness tendencies of patriots with an aristocratic or bourgeois origin. With reference to his skin color men under Maceo’s command began to name him “The Bronze Titan”, also because of his exceptional physical strength and resistance to bullet or blade injuries. He recovered from more than 25 war injuries over the course of some 500 military battles. Maceo admired Máximo Gómez and rapidly accepted his strategy of using the machete as a war weapon as a substitute for the Spanish sword. Maceo opposed the signing of the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years War. He and other independence soldiers met with General Martínez-Campos in 1878, to discuss the peace terms. Maceo argued that no peace could be achieved if the objectives of the war had not been accomplished; the abolition of slavery and Cuban independence. In 1895 Maceo had anunfortunate, meeting with Gómez and Martí, because of the disagreements between him and Martí on the relationship between the military movements and the civilian government. Several days later, Martí, treated as a non-military “Doctor” by Maceo, would fall in battle. After Gómez was designated General in Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army, Maceo was named second in command. In December 1896, only accompanied by a small troop of no more than twenty, he met a strong Spanish column, which opened an intense fire hitting Maceo. His companions could not carry himaway. The only rebel who stayed by him was the Lieutenant Francisco Gómez, son of Máximo Gómez, who faced the Spanish column for the sole purpose of protecting the body of his general. After being shot several times, the Spaniards killed Gómez with machete strikes, leaving both bodies abandoned, not knowing the identity of the fallen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equestrianstatue.org/maceo-antonio/|title= Maceo, Antonio  |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Building==
[[File:Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana.jpg|thumb|left| From Calle San Lazaro]]
"Beneficencia had two gates, the front that overlooked San Lázaro street with a large garden. The right part of that building (facing north), corresponded to the chapel that was always open to the public. To the left of the main entrance were the school offices followed by the barber shop and other workshops. The students were never in those gardens where there was only the possibility of a visual contact with them. The other gate that served as access to the vehicles only, was in the back of the school, that is, in Virtudes street between Belascoaín and Lucena. On the right (always facing north), part of the building was located dedicated to the classrooms and on its left was the hospital....This magnificent school was converted into a barracks...they took us out of there to turn it into the Antonio Maceo military school."&lt;ref name=Articulos/&gt;

== Tradition ==
[[File: La Casa de Beneficencia de La Habana-Drop-Off-DOOR.png|thumb|right|The mothers, who abandoned their child for economic reasons or because of the shame of being a single mother, could deliver it without showing their face or revealing their identity.]]
As the children had no last name upon entering the institution of charity, they were given the surname Valdés. It was Bishop Fray Gerónimo de Nosti y Valdés, the successor of [[Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela]], who gave them his last name: Valdés.&lt;ref name=cibercuba/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apellido_Vald&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecured.cu/Casa_de_Beneficencia_y_Maternidad#Apellido_Vald.C3.A9s/media/File:EcuRed |title=Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad |access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bishop Fray Gerónimo de Nosti y Valdés is buried at [[Iglesia del Espíritu Santo, Havana]] in [[La Habana Vieja]].

The mothers, who abandoned their child for economic reasons or because of the shame of being a single mother, could deliver it without showing their face or revealing their identity, Ciro Bianchi Ross writes: "''For that, in the side façade of the building that faced the Belascoaín road, there was the lathe, the infant was placed in it and the deposit was turned at the touch of a bell, and on the other side the abandoned child received a nun from the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, a congregation that served that semiparticular institution that tried to supply the official lack of attention in its attempt to redeem evils that the State did not suppress or remedy ...'' "&lt;ref name=Articulos/&gt; The nuns were of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul (Hermanas de la Caridad de San Vicente de Paul), the congregation that served La Casa de Beneficencia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7255">'''Language learning aptitude''' refers to the "prediction of how well, relative to other individuals, an individual can learn a [[foreign language]] in a given amount of time and under given conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield, Charles W. "Language Aptitude Reconsidered." ''ERIC Digest''. Washington DC: ERIC Clearinghouse on Languages and Linguistics, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many measures of aptitude, language learning aptitude is thought to be relatively stable once a person matures. Many people show a remarkable learning aptitude for learning their language.

== Language learning disability ==

Some high schools, universities or other institutions will interpret low language learning aptitude as a sign of a language learning disability.  A pattern of evidence from several sources can help to diagnose a foreign language learning disability.  Evidence can come from scoring poorly on language learning aptitude assessments, like the [[Modern Language Aptitude Test]], [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]], [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary]] or [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], while attaining average or above-average scores on aptitude assessments in other areas, like general intelligence.  A history of scoring poorly on an array of language aptitude tests taken at the appropriate time ([[Modern Language Aptitude Test#Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary|MLAT-E]] for grades 3–6, [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery|PLAB]] for grades 7–12, [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|MLAT]] for adults) can provide even stronger evidence for a language learning disability.  Evidence can also come from comparing a poor past performance in foreign language courses with average or above-average performance in other courses unrelated to language learning.

Language aptitude is one of the important factors that determined L2 later learners' ultimate achievement, but it has less effect on L2 early learners.&lt;ref&gt; Ortega, L. (2013). Understanding second language acquisition. London : Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== John B. Carroll ==

[[John B. Carroll]], an influential psychologist in the field of educational linguistics, developed a theory about a cluster of four abilities that factored into language learning aptitude, separate from verbal intelligence and motivation.  Using these four distinct abilities (phonetic coding ability, grammatical sensitivity, rote learning ability, and inductive learning ability), Carroll developed the MLAT, a language aptitude assessment for adults.

The four ability components are defined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Component
!Definition
|-
|Phonetic coding ability
|ability to perceive distinct sounds, associate a symbol with that sound and retain that association
|-
|Grammatical memory
| ability to recognize the grammatical function of a lexical element (word, phrase, etc.) in a sentence without explicit training in grammar
|-
|Associative memory
| ability to learn associations between words in a foreign language and their meanings and retain that association
|-
|Inductive learning ability
| ability to infer or induce rules governing the structure of a language
|}

== Paul Pimsleur ==

[[Paul Pimsleur]], also known for the [[Pimsleur language learning system]], spent time researching four factors that he believed to be related to language learning aptitude.  Pimsleur included grade point average as an indication of general academic achievement as well as motivation in his factors.  In addition, the verbal ability factor indicated how well a student would be able to handle the mechanics of learning a foreign language and the auditory factor indicated how well a student would be able to listen to and produce phrases in a foreign language.  To test these four factors, Pimsleur developed the [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]].

== Uses of aptitude measurement ==

Measurements of language learning aptitude are used in many different ways.  The United States Department of Defense uses a measurement of language learning aptitude, the [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], to help place employees in positions that require them to learn a new language.

Governmental agencies use the MLAT as a tool to select and place employees in intensive language training programs.  Businesses and missionaries use the MLAT to select, place and plan for language training.  Universities, colleges and high schools use the MLAT to help in the diagnosis of foreign language learning disabilities.  Although each institution has its own policy, many will waive a foreign language requirement in cases of a foreign language learning disability in favor of a history or linguistic course.

Schools use the PLAB and MLAT-E to place students in suitable language courses, build a history of a foreign language learning difficulty, identify especially gifted students in respect to language learning and to match learning styles with instructional styles.

The '''Lisbon Astronomical Observatory''' ({{lang-pt|Observatório Astronómico de Lisboa}}) is an astronomical [[observatory]] located in ''Tapada da Ajuda'', in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Alcântara, Lisbon|Alcântara]], [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Lisbon]]. Recognized internationally for its quality of work in the field of positioning [[astronomy]] (since the 19th century), in 1992, it became a dependency of the [[University of Lisbon]] (and later, part of the Faculty of Sciences), responsible for scientific and historical research, along with media relations.

==History==
From an 1812 map, there existed in the ''Alto da Casa Branca'' in the Tapada of Ajuda an older observatory.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=23178 |title=Observatório Astronómico de Lisboa/Observatório Astronómico da Tapada da Ajuda/Observatório Astronómico D. Luís (IPA.00023178/PT031106021097) |publisher=SIPA –Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=João |last=Machado |first2=Ana |last2=Pascoal |first3=Catarina |last3=Teixeira |accessdate=7 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309032803/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=23178 |archivedate=9 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory was born from great controversy between French astronomer Hervé Faye (1814-1902), then director of the Observatory of Paris, and Peters, an [[astronomer]] at the Russian Observatory of Pulkova, on the parallax of the star of [[Argelander]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The construction of the Lisbon observatory was due to a strong desire to build an institution that was a reference in Portuguese culture. It was established in the mid-19th century with the aim of promoting new Sidereal Astronomy, discovery and understanding of the infinite [[cosmos]], and concern about the exact mapping of the [[sky]] and measuring the size of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1850, Hervé Faye and [[Wilhelm Struve|Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] (1793-1864) proposed that astronomical observations should be taken in Lisbon, being the first and "unique locale in all of [[continental Europe]] that the [[zenithal telescope]] could encounter the marvelous Argelander star".&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In order to do so, it was necessary to build a new [[observatory]] where you could install the appropriate equipment. The [[Count of Lavradio]] proposed that the government's chamber of peers should acquire Faye's telescope.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The government named a commission, presided by José Feliciano da Silva Costa (1797-1866) and driven by Filipe Folque (1800-1874), to construct a new observatory, since the Royal Military Observatory ({{lang-pt|Observatório Real da Marinha}}) did not have the conditions.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In January 1857, King [[Peter V of Portugal|D. Pedro V]] destined 30 contos de réis to the construction of the observatory and decreed a new commission, managed by Filipe Folque. The commission thought, initially, of constructing the new building in the Prince Royal's garden, then alternately in the Parque Eduardo VII and later the Tapada da Ajuda.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The plan of the building, executed by the French architect architects Jean François Gille Colson (1861-1865), José da Costa Sequeira (1800-1872) and Valentim José Correia (1822-1900) (then the most distinguished foreign architect living in Lisbon), was inspired by the building of the Russian Observatory in Pulkova.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Wilhelm Struve, then-director at Pulkova offered his services to the Portuguese government and became the main adviser, playing a very important role in the choice of equipment and the orientation of astronomer [[Frederico Augusto Oom]] (1830-1890), who was given a rough 5-year training session. Oom, was as a Navy Lieutenant and hydrographic engineer, who eventually became the first director of the Royal Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon and who ultimately had a very important role in the whole foundation of this building.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

D. Pedro V approved the installation of the astronomic observatory in the Tapada, but its construction started on 11 March 1861, during the reign of King [[Luis I of Portugal|Luis I]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The King also contributed to the fund, withdrawing money from his personal budget for the project. The observatory would have been erected in the ''Alto da Casa Branca'', the locale of the older observatory, but was actually situated in the ''Alto da Eira Velha''. Construction work was completed in 1867 and the first observations began at the site between 1867 and 1869.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The Lisbon Astronomical Observatory was formally established by decree on 6 May 1878.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1900 and 1901, the observatory participated in the solar parallax campaign, centered on the observations of the asteroid Eros, using a circular meridian measuring instrument to improve the value of the [[Astronomical unit]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It also contributed to production of a high-quality catalogue of reference stars; the observatory contributed with data and weight to all 3800 observations used in the catalogue. For this work, in 1904, its director [[Campos Rodrigues|César Augusto de Campos Rodrigues]] (1836-1919), received the [[Valz Prize]], by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1995, the observatory was integrated into the University of Lisbon.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The first renovations began in the cupola of the rotational tower in 1999.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

From May 2004, the investigation project ''Fundamentação de Critérios para a Musealização do Observatório Astronómico de Lisboa'', financed by FCT (POCTI/HAR/48711/2002) and under the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Sciences and UTL's Faculty of Architecture.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
The Lisbon Astronomical Observatory consists of a central building in the hills of Ajuda and overlooking the [[Tagus river|Tejo]] river, and two small cupolas in the south containing instruments.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Besides the central [[cupola]] there are three rooms for astronomical observations, equipped with instruments (the best for the time) and windows for observation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The central block of the observatory (a circular room) supports the weight of the large [[equatorial refractor]] over 8 large columns. In arches between the columns are many [[pendulum clock]] used over the century to measure the time.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; At the foot of the large windows (with a view over the Tapada da Ajuda) are wide tables, used by astronomers to assist in their research/investigation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In addition, there are spacious halls linking the central block, used for lessons, taking measurements and research, today used as workshops and support school educational activities.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The three observation rooms are spacious and high, lined in wood, with open space between the wainscoting and the walls of masonry and roofing. This space communicates with the outside world through gaps that are constantly open. There are roofs of rooms in stacks of circulation, and this permanent ventilation is there in order to establish the balance of air [[temperature]] in the rooms and beyond, as it is convenient to the accuracy of observations. The wooden wainscoting providing thermal insulation, apart from being a 100% ecological product, which provides the user with a friendlier environment compared to other substitute materials. The rooms provide openings in the lateral walls and in the ceiling, through doors, thanks to an ingenious mechanism. Once the doors open once they give you an insight to the sky, according to the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of Lisbon, from north to south.

==Biography==
Barbosa began playing electric guitar when he was 11 years old. He was studying with several teachers, mainly with Allan Marshall. At 17 years old he already was a professional musician and a musical teacher in two musical schools in his home city [[Brasília]]. He then decided to establish his own one, focused on the electric guitar. Besides organizing work and managing other teachers, Barbosa established his own entire approach instead of copying or adapting any already existed one and he wrote all the didactic material.&lt;ref name="Almah/M. Barbosa for Spirit Of Metal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/interview-id_inter-586-l-en.html|title= Almah interview |publisher=Spirit Of Metal|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbosa also attended classes and workshops of musicians like [[Greg Howe]], [[Lula Galvão]], [[Hélio Delmiro]], [[Toninho Horta]], [[Guinga]], [[Ian Guest (guitarist)|Ian Guest]] among others. In 2002 he finished summer courses in the famous [[Berklee|Berklee College of Music]]. As a result he was chosen with other 11 students to receive a scholarship for the college's regular course. However, it was not possible to continue due to GTR and his other responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtr.com.br/mb/bio.asp|title=Biography|last=Angelo|first=Maurício|publisher=Marcelo Barbosa official website|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time before that Barbosa became a member of Brasília pop rock band [[Zero10]].&lt;ref name="M. Barbosa's interview at PerfectProg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectprog.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=755&amp;Itemid=95|title=Khallice Interview!! |last=Leonel|date=2006-06-17|publisher=PerfectProg.com|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They released an EP and a full-length album ''Novo Dia'' and they play almost every week at different venues of the capital of Brazil. Later on, he would restart the band [[Khallice]], which played the progressive metal he always liked.&lt;ref name="Almah/M. Barbosa for Terroraiser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marcelogtr-eng.blogspot.com/2009/01/almah-marcelo-barbosa-edu-falaschi.html|title= Almah interview|last=Thrashmentor|date=2008|publisher=Terroraiser magazine (Ukraine)|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Barbosa was invited to join the band [[Almah]] formed by some members of Angra &lt;ref name="News at Blabbermouth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=80181|title=EDU FALASCHI's ALMAH Parts Ways With Guitarist, Announces Replacement|date=2007-05-09|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2009-01-24}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he went into a national tour with the band. By spring 2008 the line-up of Almah was finally established. In the end of April 2008 the recording of new Almah album ''[[Fragile Equality]]'' started at Norcal studios ([[São Paulo]]) and finished in July 2008.&lt;ref name="Interview Marcelo Barbosa for Guitar Clinic magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitar-clinic.net/noticia_detalhe.asp?idioma=2&amp;id_sessao=1&amp;id_noticia=882 |title=Guitar Clinic Interview |last=Nery |first=Rafael |publisher=Guitar Clinic magazine |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922192509/http://www.guitar-clinic.net/noticia_detalhe.asp?idioma=2&amp;id_sessao=1&amp;id_noticia=882 |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbosa writes articles for important guitar magazines in Brazil like [[Guitar Class]], [[Cover Guitarra]] and [[Guitar Player]]. Some time ago Barbosa wrote a book about technique to the "Toque de Mestre" series, published by HMP.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

Barbosa is endorsed by Tagima, [[Elixir Strings]], Nig pedals and Ibox. On Expomusic 2006 (a big musical exhibition in São Paulo) one of the most important guitar brands in Brazilian market TAGIMA released new MB-1, the guitar designed with Barbosa's specifications, which belongs to the select team of "Signature Series" of the company.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== GTR ==
Nowadays his institute GTR is one of the biggest guitar schools in Latin America. GTR have already graduated over 4.000 students, with more than 600 people studying in two different units of GTR (Asa Norte and Asa Sul). Besides electric guitar, there are the courses of vocals, acoustic guitar, production, musical business and others. A number of events are frequently organized by GTR like festivals and workshops with musicians like [[Sidney Carvalho]], [[Kiko Loureiro]], [[Edu Ardanuy]] among others. To its 10th anniversary, GTR released a special 14 tracks CD recorded by some of the most prominent teachers.&lt;ref name="About GTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtr.com.br/gtr/a_escola.asp|title=GTR official website |publisher=GTR|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcelo Barbosa (guitars): GTR is a project I've worked already for twelve years at. It began like a guitar Institute but now we have classes for bassists, vocalists and acoustic guitar players too. I’m responsible for all the didactic material of the guitar course and we have more than six hundred students in three schools. Four years ago I decided to franchise GTR and some people got interested and now we have three schools in Brasília. (...) It is relatively big. We have many students and it’s growing up year by year. We try to teach music, not only one specific style or genre. Rock, Metal, Jazz, Country and Brazilian music is some of the approaches here.&lt;ref name="Almah/M. Barbosa for Spirit Of Metal"/&gt;

'''Marie Taglioni, Comtesse Gilbert de Voisins ''' (23 April 1804 – 22 April 1884) was a Swedish [[ballet dancer]] of the [[Romantic ballet]] era, a central figure in the [[history of dance|history of European dance]]. She was one of the most celebrated ballerinas of the romantic ballet, which was cultivated primarily at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, and at the [[Salle Le Peletier|Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. She is credited with (though not confirmed) being the first ballerina to truly dance ''[[pointe technique|en pointe]]''.

==Early life==
Taglioni was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, to Italian choreographer [[Filippo Taglioni]] and Swedish ballet dancer [[Sophie Karsten]], maternal granddaughter of the Swedish opera singer [[Christoffer Christian Karsten]] and of the Polish opera singer and actress [[Sophie Stebnowska]]. Her brother, [[Paul Taglioni|Paul]] (1808–1884), was also a dancer and an influential choreographer; they performed together early in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abitofhistory.net/html/rhw/t.htm Profile], abitofhistory.net; accessed 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Taglioni was married to Comte Auguste Gilbert de Voisins on 14 July 1832, but separated in 1836. She later fell in love with Eugene Desmares, a loyal fan, who had defended her honor in a duel. Desmares and Taglioni gave birth to a child (illegitimate) in 1836. Three years later Desmares died in a hunting accident. In 1842 she gave birth to her second child. It is unknown who the father is even though the birth certificate states the father as Gilbert de Voisins. Taglioni's children's names were Georges Gilbert and Eugenie-Marie-Edwige.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850|last=Murray|first=Christopher John|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135455781|location=|pages=1122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

Taglioni moved to Vienna with her family at a very young age where she began her ballet training under the direction of [[Jean-François Coulon|Jean-Francois Coulon]] and her father. After Filippo was appointed the ballet master at the court opera in Vienna there was a decision that Marie would debut in the Habsburg capital. Even though Marie had trained with Coulon, her technique was not up to the standards that would impress the Viennese audiences. Her father then created a rigorous six-month training regimen for his daughter where she would hold positions for 100 counts. The training was conducted daily and consisted of two hours in the morning with difficult exercises focusing on her legs and two hours in the afternoon focusing on adagio movements that would help her refine poses in ballet. Taglioni had a rounded back that caused her to lean forward and had slightly distorted proportions. She worked hard to disguise her physical limitations by increasing range of motion and developing her strength. Taglioni focused her energy on her shape and form to the audience and less on bravura tricks and pirouettes. In Vienna, Marie danced her first ballet choreographed by her father titled "La Reception d'une Jeune Nymphe à la Cour de Terpsichore". {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Career==

[[File:Marie-taglioni-in-zephire.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lithograph by Chalon and Lane of Marie Taglioni as Flora in [[Charles Didelot|Didelot's]] ''Zéphire et Flore''. London, 1831 ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]/[[Sergeyev Collection]])]]

Before joining the Paris Opéra, Taglioni danced in both [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]], and at age 23 debuted in another ballet choreographed by her father called "La Sicilien" that jump-started her ballet career. Taglioni rose to fame as a ''[[Principal dancer|danseuse]]'' at the Paris Opéra when her father created the ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1832) for her. Designed as a showcase for Taglioni's talent, it was the first ballet where dancing ''[[en pointe]]'' had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt, often involving ungraceful arm movements and exertions, as had been the approach of dancers in the late 1820s. {{sfn|Secombe|1898}}

==''Pas de Quatre''==
[[File:Pas de quatre1845.jpg|thumb|Taglioni (center) in ''Pas de Quatre'', 1845]]
In 1837 Taglioni left the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre to take up a three-year contract in [[Saint Petersburg]] with the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] (known today as the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet). It was in Russia after her last performance in the country (1842) and at the height of the "cult of the ballerina", that a pair of her [[pointe shoe]]s were sold for two hundred [[Russian ruble|rubles]], reportedly to be cooked, served with a sauce and eaten by a group of [[balletomanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of dance: an interactive arts approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131|last=Kassing|first=Gayle|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736060356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1845, she danced with [[Lucile Grahn]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]] in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ''[[Pas de Quatre]]'', a ballet representing Taglioni’s ethereal qualities that was based on [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]’s lithographic prints. ''Pas de Quatre'' was originally choreographed to be presented to Queen Victoria.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Retirement, last years, and death==
Taglioni retired from performing in 1847; for a time she took up residence at the [[Ca' d'Oro]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] in [[Venice]]. When the ballet of the Paris Opéra was reorganized on stricter, more professional lines, she was its guiding spirit. With the director of the new ''Conservatoire de danse'', [[Lucien Petipa]], and Petipa's former pupil, the choreographer [[Louis Mérante]], she figured on the six-member select jury of the first annual competition for the [[corps de ballet]], held 13 April 1860.

Her only choreographic work was ''[[Le papillon (ballet)|Le papillon]]'' (1860) for her student [[Emma Livry]], who is remembered for dying in 1863 when her costume was set alight by a gas lamp used for [[stage lighting]]. [[Johann Strauss II]] composed the "Marie Taglioni Polka" (Op.&amp;nbsp;173) in honour of Marie Taglioni's niece, Marie "Paul" Taglioni, also known as "Marie the Younger". The two women, having the same name, have often been conflated, or confused with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Taglioni, Maria|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Taglioni, Marie|volume=55|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in England, she taught [[social dance]] and ballroom to children and society ladies in London; she also took a limited number of ballet pupils. She resided at #14 [[Connaught Square]], London from 1875 to 1876.

==Death==
Taglioni died in [[Marseille]] on 22 April 1884,{{sfn|Secombe|1898}} the day before her 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/heroes-villains/marie-taglioni.asp Marie Taglioni, the Italian Ballerina], lifeinitaly.com; accessed 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was moved to Paris. There is some debate over whether she is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]] or in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise]], or if the grave Montmartre site belongs to her mother. The local dancers began leaving their worn pointe shoes on the Montmartre grave as a tribute and thanks to the first pointe dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet shoe tributes at Montmartre, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaloskagathos/304920993 1], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/phooky/443300536/ 2],

'''Music examinations''' are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning [[musical instruments]]. These are called grades.

Although there are music [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s available to [[school]] and [[university]] students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all.

[[Trinity College London]] was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. As of 2012, Trinity College London conducts around 600,000 assessments worldwide per year, as does the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]]. Other examination boards based in the UK include the [[London College of Music Examinations|London College of Music]], [[Victoria College of Music and Drama]], the [[National College of Music]] and [[RSL (Rockschool Ltd.)|Rockschool]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rslawards.com/rockschool/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many students who enter these exams have taken a course of [[music lesson]]s with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life.

Music exams are set in both [[music theory|theory]] and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as [[musical notation]], construction of [[major scale|scales]] and [[musical composition|composition]].

The practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favored by the pupil, for example [[piano]], [[guitar]] or [[flute]]. They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including [[Musical scale|scales]], [[sight reading]], aural, musical knowledge and improvisation.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial level qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit Framework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation before the Grade 1 exam. LCM offers two Step exams at this level and VCM offers four Introductory grades aimed at those in the first 18 months of learning.

Other reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical instruments and music theory include:
* [[Australian Music Examinations Board]]
* New Zealand Music Examinations Board
* Guitarmonk Examination Board, India
* Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra (Board of music and fine arts education), India
* [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], Canada
* [[University of South Africa]] - Directorate Music
* Vienna Music Examination Board (''Wiener Musik-Prüfungskommission'')

Different music examination boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised by regulatory bodies such as Ofqual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/ Ofqual]&lt;/ref&gt;, examination results or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.

The '''Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund''' ({{lang-no|Statens lånekasse for utdanning}}) is a [[etat|government agency]] that allocates loans and grants to [[Norway|Norwegian]] and certain foreign students for their education. Lånekassen was established in 1947. 

Lånekassen is organised under the Ministry of Education and Research ([[Kunnskapsdepartementet]]). The Ministry decides the regulations for the allocation of financial support, and for the repayment of loans.

== Objectives ==
Lånekassen’s objectives for educational support are
   
* to give the same possibilities for education, regardless of economic and social background, geographical aspects, age, gender and physical disabilities, 
* to ensure that the society and the work force has access to competence,
* to secure a satisfactory work environment for education, to make studies efficient.

== Organization ==
* Lånekassen's head office is in Oslo and there are branch offices in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Tromsø and Ørsta. 
* At the end of 2017, Lånekassen had 325 permanent employees.

== History ==
* Lånekassen was established in 1947 as an extension of a number of welfare schemes for students. 
* In its first year, NOK 3.3 million was given in loans to about 2,200 students. 
* Since the late 1950s, support has also been given for upper secondary education. 
* Means testing of parents before giving support for higher education was abolished in about 1970. 
* Large-scale computer systems for the mass processing of applications were developed during the 1980s and 1990s.
* Changes were made in connection with the quality reform of higher education and grants became dependent on the examination results of each individual student. 
* In 2001 it became possible to apply for support electronically, and from 2005 it became possible to sign the acknowledgement of debt electronically. 
* Since 2009, pupils and students have only been able to apply for support electronically, rather than on paper. 
* Between 2004 and 2015, Lånekassen was in the process of a renewal programme. The modernisation was organized in the renewal programme LØFT (Lånekassens ønskede framtid). The programme involved several projects, the largest of which was to replace the entire customer and case handling solution. The objectives of the renewal were better and more targeted information for customers and partners, increased opportunities for self-service solutions and more automation and streamlining. Today, the customers - both students/pupils and customers who are repaying their loans - are almost totally digital.

== Key figures 2017 ==

* As of 31.12.2017 Lånekassen had 1.087.500 customers. 672,865 of the customers have started their repayment. 
* 436,100 students and pupils applied for financial support for the academic year 2016-2017. 
* In 2017, Lånekassen processed approximately 843,000 applications for educational support and payment relief/waiver. 
* NOK 3.7 billion in grants and NOK 24.2 billion in loans were allocated to the students during the academic year 2016-2017. About NOK 6.3 billion of the allocated loans are expected to be converted into educational grants (the conversion occurs after passing examinations / completing the course of education). 
* The lending portfolio (outstanding educational debt) represents approximately NOK 173.8 billion in total.

&lt;!--With a redir at [[House professional]] to the latter.--&gt;
A '''pro shop''' is a [[sporting goods|sporting-goods]] [[Retailing|shop]] within a public or private-membership [[amateur sports|amateur sporting activities]] facility of some kind, most commonly a [[golf course]], where it will typically be located in the [[country club]] building. In the case of golf pro shops, such stores usually provide [[Golf equipment|equipment]] such as [[golf ball]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|clubs]], [[Golf equipment#Shoes|shoes]], and [[golf tee|tees]], as well as golf-themed gift items, and sometimes snacks or refreshments.

Aside from golf courses, pro shops are also frequently found at [[Bowling|bowling alleys]], [[Pool hall|pool and snooker halls]], [[tennis]] and [[racquetball]] courts, [[Ice hockey rink|ice and roller hockey rinks]], and [[Association football|football (soccer)]] facilities. Some [[American football]] teams, such as the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[New England Patriots]], offer team merchandise and replica apparel for purchase through team stores branded as "pro shops", either at a store at the team's stadium, a separate shop located in another venue such as a [[shopping mall]], or through an online shopping portal.

Pro shops are often managed by a '''house pro''', a [[Professional sport|professional player]], and overseen by a General Manager  who is employed by or acts as a consultant contractor to the venue, though shops may instead be run by a retail manager at larger venues (or those too small to attract a pro). House pros are often available to advise on game-related issues such as rules details or the proper equipment for particular needs and conditions, and sometimes also for [[golf instruction|instruction]] such as group lessons or one-on-one training (usually for a fee). House pros sometimes also perform paid personal equipment maintenance, such as restringing [[tennis racquet]]s, drilling and fitting [[bowling ball]]s, re-tipping pool/snooker [[Cue stick|cues]], skate sharpening, etc., depending upon the sport.

[[File:Random Family (LeBlanc) book cover.jpg|thumb|right|Paperback edition]]
'''''Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble, and Coming of Age in the Bronx''''' is a 2003 narrative non-fiction study of urban life by American writer [[Adrian Nicole LeBlanc]].

==Summary==
The book, LeBlanc's first, took more than 10 years to research and write.  ''Random Family'' is a nonfiction account of the struggles of two women and their family as they deal with love, drug dealers, babies and prison time in the [[Bronx]]. LeBlanc began the long period of research after reporting on a piece in ''[[Newsday]]'' about the trial of "a hugely successful heroin dealer" named Boy George.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Boynton, ''The New New Journalism'', New York: [[Random House]], 2005. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Random Family'' was enthusiastically received by critics.  In ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Janet Maslin described LeBlanc's work as "a book that exerts the fascination of a classic, unflinching documentary."&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Boynton, ''The New New Journalism'', New York: [[Random House]], 2005. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Kramer, director of the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman Foundation Program on Narrative Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]], praised the book's "relentless neutrality."&lt;ref&gt;Amy Farley, ''In the Family Way," ''[[Village Voice]]'', January 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]],'' Margaret Talbot wrote, "The conventional compliment to pay a work of narrative nonfiction is to say that it's 'novelistic' or that it 'reads like fiction.' You could certainly say that of 'Random Family,' and yet there are tasks a writer like LeBlanc must accomplish that are different, and in some ways more difficult, than a novelist's. For one thing, she must remain cleareyed about people to whom she owes a tremendous debt of gratitude for admitting her into the intimacies of their lives. And for another, she must hew to a plotline that is often stuttering and circular and decidedly lacking in resolution. None of the people she writes about veer definitively toward a newer or better life — they tend toward the same tired grooves — yet she makes their stories riveting"; Talbot called LeBlanc's work, "An extraordinary book."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Talbot, "In the Other Country," ''The New York Times Book Review'', February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
LeBlanc and ''Random Family'' garnered several awards and nominations.  Her research methods earned her a spot among several other [[journalists]] and nonfiction writers in [[Robert Boynton]]'s book, ''The New New Journalism.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnewjournalism.com newnewjournalism.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, LeBlanc received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], more popularly known as a "Genius Grant".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Ruth Kilbourn''' was a Chicago-area dancer and dance teacher, born 1895. She was educated by prominent dance instructors in Chicago and appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in the [[Chicago Opera House]]. A back injury forced her to end her performance career at a young age, but she cultivated a large following through her dance studio, the Kilbourn School of Dance. She tutored young dancers both in her home and in public schools throughout the city. Ruth Kilbourn's extensive work in the Chicago community also extended to animals, as she willed her home to the Chicago Anti-Cruelty Society upon her death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

====STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration====
{{Details|topic=Temporary foreign workers|Global labor arbitrage|H-1B visa|Optional Practical Training}}

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.&lt;ref&gt;Landivar, Liana C. Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.&lt;ref&gt;"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair." National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3112683 Want to Be a Doctor? A Scientist?  An Engineer?:  An Affirmative Action Leg Up May Hurt Your Chances], Engage (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

Department of Education]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008.

====Scouting====
In 20102, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] began handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] has similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as "Naturalist" and "Digital Art".&lt;ref name="STEM - Girl Scouts"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/girl-scouts-and-stem.html|title=STEM - Girl Scouts|website=Girl Scouts of the USA|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASAStem is a program of the U.S. [[space agency]] [[NASA]] to increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity.&lt;ref name="NASAStem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://missionstem.nasa.gov/diversity-inclusion-leadrshp.html|title=NASA Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO)|website=missionstem.nasa.gov|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-jobs-2017-update|title=STEM Jobs: 2017 Update {{!}} Economics &amp; Statistics Administration|website=www.esa.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.  The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2188-building-americas-future-stem-education/for-students/blog/news.php|title=Building America’s Future: STEM Education Intervention is a Win-Win|website=Penn Wharton Public Policy Initative|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Updates ====
PEW findings revealed that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students’ concentration in learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/01/12/americans-rate-u.s.-stem-education-as-mediocre.aspx|title=Americans Rate U.S. K–12 STEM Education as Mediocre -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/09/25/suddenly-trump-wants-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-stem-in-public-schools/|title=Analysis {{!}} Suddenly, Trump wants to spend millions of dollars on STEM in public schools|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump’s Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) on STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edscoop.com/trump-stands-by-stem-education-spending-in-fy19-budget|title=Trump stands by STEM education spending in fiscal 2019 budget|website=EdScoop|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In September 2017, a number of large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate $300 million for computer science education in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/computer-science-stem-education.html|title=Tech Firms Add $300 Million to Trump Administration’s Computer Science Push|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scouts Canada]] has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811173225/http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Seymour Schulich]] established the [[Schulich Leader Scholarships]], $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto philanthropist Schulich unveils $100-million scholarship |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-philanthropist-schulich-unveils-100-million-scholarship/article2201382/|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philanthropist Makes $100 Million Investment In Nation’s Future|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/news/16038/philanthropist-makes-100-million-investment-in-nations-future/|website=Shalomlife.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientix Project|url=http://www.scientix.eu/|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers.

=== Hong Kong ===
STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document entitled ''Promotion of STEM Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Brief%20on%20STEM%20(Overview)_eng_20151105.pdf|format=PDF|title=Promotion of STEM Education |website=Edb.gov.hk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes the strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education.

===Turkey===
Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FeTeMM Çalışma Grubu|url=http://fetemm.org/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Education Task Force|url=http://tstem.com/|website=Tstem.com |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
In [[Qatar]], [[AL-Bairaq]] is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|title=AlBairaq World - Welcome to Al-Bairaq World|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|title=Supreme Education Council|website=Sec.gov.qa|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|archivedate=2017-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students|title=The Peninsula Qatar - Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students|website=Thepeninsulaqatar.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has so far shown positive results for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejes.eu/images/issue/vol.1/no.3/4.pdf|title=Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF-EFFICACY, EJES, 1(3), 39-57|website=Ejes.eu|accessdate=2017-08-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==

{{main article|Female education in STEM|Women in STEM fields}}
{{see also|Women in science|Women in engineering|Women in computing|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20273">[[Image:SGA Judicial Branch.JPG|thumb|right|Structure of the student judiciary at Metropolitan State College of Denver]]

A '''student court''' is a type of [[judicial]] system occasionally seen in [[student government]]s. Student courts vary in size and functions, but they are most often engaged in conflict resolution and interpretation of student bylaws and constitutions.  Names of student courts vary, with the body variously referred to as the "Student Court," "Judicial Council", the "Judicial Board", the "Supreme Court," or others. Typically, however, student governments only possess legislative and executive branches. Student courts are a less-common feature of student governments.

The methods of selection for student courts also vary: at some institutions, the elected student body president nominates and appoints student court members with the consent of the elected student representative assembly; at others, a search committee interviews potential members who are subsequently nominated and officially appointed; at still other institutions, the sitting members of the student court actually participate in the process of nominating and selecting new court members.

== Debate ==
Arguments in favour of having student courts often hinge on the idea of [[separation of powers]], on the basis that the legislative bodies of student governments should not have the power to police themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://thefulcrum.ca/opinions/student-court-needs-make-comeback/&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments in favour include having the judicial system removed from partisan politics, having a neutral body to make decisions on issues such as election appeals, and greater transparency.&lt;ref&gt;http://thefulcrum.ca/opinions/bring-back-the-sac/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against having student courts often hinge on practicality, with critics saying that students are not necessarily qualified to make judicial decisions, or that university [[ombudsperson]]s are better placed to fulfill the same role.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubyssey.ca/opinion/last-words-birds-sales-court-420/&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments include a lack of accountability from student courts as well the additional bureaucracy that is created and the cost that it entails. Some critics also argue that placing power in the hands of unelected officials is undemocratic.

== Student courts in Canada ==
=== Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia ===
The judicial body of the [[Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia]] is the Student Court. The Student Court is granted the power to "exercise disciplinary powers over the Society’s organizations and members."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.ubc.ca/leadership/code-constitution/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is composed of 5 judges and two alternate judges, all appointed by the AMS Council, with the Chief Justice also being named by the AMS Council. The Chief Justice must be a law student. The decisions of the Court only become binding once the AMS Council ratifies them.

The Student Court was created in the 1970s, but had been inactive from 2009 to 2015, until the AMS Council filling the positions again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubyssey.ca/news/ams-bring-back-student-court-conflict-mediation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carleton University Students' Association ===
The judicial body of the [[Carleton University Students' Association]] is the Constitutional Board. The CUSA constitution gives the Constitutional Board the authority to "rule that any act of Students' Council, its members, its officers, or its agents is in contravention of the Constitution, any Bylaw or Policy of the Association."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cusaonline.ca/wp-content/uploads/CUSA-Constitution-updated-April-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Board is composed of 5 members appointed by the Students' Council, of which 4 must be students and the fifth is the university's [[ombudsperson]], who acts as chair. There are also two alternate members. Constitutional Board members serve one year terms, and cannot be members of the Students' Council. Meetings of the Board are held publicly, and decisions of the Board cannot be appealed.

=== Student Federation of the University of Ottawa ===
The constitution of the [[Student Federation of the University of Ottawa]] does not formally recognise a judicial body for the Federation, but, the powers of the Constitutional Committee closely resemble those of a student court.&lt;ref&gt;sfuo.ca/wp-content/uploads/SFUOConstitution2016-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee has the power to make binding decisions, but those decisions can be overturned by the Board of Administration through a simple majority vote.

The Constitutional Committee is composed of 5 members of the Board of Administration, as well as two alternate members (also members of the Board of Administration) in the case of a conflict of interest. The members of the Constitutional Committee chose a member from among themselves to act as chair. Meetings of the Committee are held [[in-camera]].

The SFUO used to have a judicial system (originally known as the Student Court, and then the Student Arbitration Committee) independent from its BoA, but that body was abolished in 2011, and its powers transferred to the newly created Constitutional Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://thefulcrum.ca/news/boa-removes-presidential-veto-sac/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Alberta Students' Union ===
The judicial body of the [[University of Alberta Students' Union]] is the Discipline, Interpretation, and Enforcement Board (also known as the DIE Board).&lt;ref&gt;http://su.ualberta.ca/governance/committees/die/&lt;/ref&gt; The DIE Board is governed by the union's Bylaw 1500, which defines the Board as "the organ of the Students’ Union responsible for the interpretation and enforcement of Students’ Union legislation," and gives the Board scope to rule on complaints made regarding possible constitutional violations, interpretation of union legislation and rulings made by the elections office.&lt;ref&gt;http://su.ualberta.ca/legislation/wiki/Bylaw:1500&lt;/ref&gt;

The DIE Board is composed of one Chief Tribune, two Associate Chief Tribunes and 5 to 11 additional tribunes. The tribunes are appointed through recommendation of the Tribune Selection Committee and ratification by a 2/3rds vote of the Students' Council. Tribunes cannot be members of the Council, members of Council committees or be an employee of the Union, and hold office until they graduate, resign or are impeached by a 2/3rds vote of the Students' Council.

=== University of Calgary Students' Union ===
The [[University of Calgary Students' Union]] has two judicial bodies: the Review Board, acting as the lower student court, and the Tribunal, acting as the higher student court.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.su.ucalgary.ca/about/who-we-are/review-board-tribunal/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Review Board consists of 9 people, appointed by the Student Legislative Committee from a list provided by the Nominations Committee. Of the 9 members of the Review Board, at least 5 must be students and at least 2 must be non-students. The chair of the Review Board must be one of the students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.su.ucalgary.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The_Union_Bylaw-Mar2017a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal consists of 5 people, appointed by the SLC from a list provided by the Nominations Committee. Of the 5 members of the Tribunal, at least one must be a student and at least one must be a non-student. The chair of the Tribunal must be one of the non-students.

Members of the Review Board and Tribunal serve two-year terms, unless during their terms they fail to meet one of a list of qualifications, including having been a member of SLC, the University of Calgary Board of Governors, Senate, or General Faculties Council, being an executive for a student club, being an employee of the Union and taking part in any student election (other than just voting).

=== University of Manitoba Students' Union ===
The judicial body of the [[University of Manitoba Students' Union]] is the Judicial Board.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.umsu.ca/node/250&lt;/ref&gt; The decisions of the Judicial Board cannot be overturned by any other UMSU body.

The Judicial Board is composed of one UMSU member acting as Chair, three Councillors, and five additional UMSU members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.umsu.ca/governance/governing-documents&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Judicial Board are appointed by the Selections Committee, and cannot be employees of the Union or executives.

=== National University of Singapore ===

==== Adjudication Committee ====

Prior to January 2016, the judicial body of the [[National University of Singapore]] Students' Union (NUSSU) was the Adjudication Committee (AC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/005/original/nussu_constitution.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union] 2015, Part V&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adjudication Committee was established in August 2012, at the recommendation of the Constitution Review Commission. The Commission was convened to carry out a comprehensive redrafting of the Union's Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/022/original/34th_nussu_agm_report.pdf 34th NUSSU AGM Report] (30 September 2013) at 329&lt;/ref&gt; and after "look[ing] into the governance structure of other Student Unions, including foreign ones", it was "[i]n particular…impressed with the [[student court#City University of Hong Kong (CityU)|Adjudication Committee in the City University of Hong Kong Students' Union]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/064/original/33rd_nussu_agm_report.pdf NUSSU Constitution Review Commission Report] (August 2012) at 10&lt;/ref&gt; Citing  the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Singapore Court of Appeal]]'s ''[[obiter dictum|dictum]]'' in ''[[Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs#Obiter dicta|Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs]]'' that "all power has legal limits",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs#Obiter dicta|Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [86]&lt;/ref&gt; it envisaged the Adjudication Committee as "an organ within the Union governance structure to enforce such legal limits and resolve disputes between Constituent Clubs or members".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/064/original/33rd_nussu_agm_report.pdf NUSSU Constitution Review Commission Report] (August 2012) at 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adjudication Committee's functions were to adjudicate disputes within the Union,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/005/original/nussu_constitution.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union] 2015, Art 5.5&lt;/ref&gt; interpret the Union's Constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/005/original/nussu_constitution.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union] 2015, Art 5.6&lt;/ref&gt; and hear appeals arising from disciplinary actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/005/original/nussu_constitution.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union] 2015, Art 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

During its three-year existence, the Adjudication Committee made two reported decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nussu.org/union-category/adjudication-committee-decisions |title=Adjudication Committee Decisions |website=NUSSU |publisher=[[National University of Singapore]] Students' Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Re Yale-NUS College Students'' [2014] NUSSU AC 2, it decided by a 5-2 majority that, as a matter of [[statutory interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[Yale-NUS College]] students were not Union members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/020/original/2014_nussu_ac_2.pdf ''Re Yale-NUS College Students''] [2014] NUSSU AC 2 at [16]&lt;/ref&gt; One dissenting panel member wrote that "YNC students should be integrated into the Union so as to prevent segregation of the student populace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/020/original/2014_nussu_ac_2.pdf ''Re Yale-NUS College Students''] [2014] NUSSU AC 2 at [47]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adjudication Committee was abolished in January 2016 "because its roles and responsibilities are redundant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/103/original/nussu_council_meeting_4_revised.pdf Minutes for 4th 37th NUSSU Council Meeting] (23 January 2016) at [2.7.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Council ====

Since January 2016, the judicial power of the Union has been vested in the Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/118/original/nussu_constitution_updated_18_jun_2016.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union], Art 3.11(6)&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Union's legislative power&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/118/original/nussu_constitution_updated_18_jun_2016.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union], Art 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; and executive authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nussu.s3.amazonaws.com/production/ckeditor/attachment_files/data/000/000/118/original/nussu_constitution_updated_18_jun_2016.pdf Constitution of the National University of Singapore Students' Union], Art 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tele-TASK''' is a university research project in the [[e-learning]] area. It can be applied to lecture recording, post-processing and distribution. Research topics include e-learning, tele-teaching, semantic web, video analysis, speech recognition, collaborative learning, social networking, web technologies, recommendation systems, statistics and video codecs and conversion.

The project was founded by [[Christoph Meinel]] and his research group at the [[University of Trier]]. When he accepted the chair for Internet Technologies and Systems&lt;ref name="Internet Technologies and Systems"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chair for Internet Technologies and Systems|url=http://hpi.de/meinel/chair/prof_dr_ch_meinel.html?L=1.|website=hpi.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hasso Plattner Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of the Hasso Plattner Institute|url=http://hpi.de|website=hpi.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Potsdam]]/Germany, the tele-TASK project also moved with him.

Reference software was developed as proof of concept, such as an online e-lecture archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Lecture archive of tele-TASK|url=http://www.tele-task.de|website=tele-task.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[lecture recording]] system and a post-production tool.

{{primary sources|date=April 2015}}

The '''Tertiary Entrance Examination''' (TEE) was the standard [[Test (student assessment)|academic examination]] for secondary students completing their twelfth year of schooling in [[Western Australia]] during the early twenty-first century.  The exam results were used to determine the [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]] and the Tertiary Entrance Score.  These metrics were used to determine eligibility for entrance to the tertiary institutions in the state.

In 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/_Documents/Publications/2010+WACE+Activities+Schedule+-+Update.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142541/http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/_Documents/Publications/2010+WACE+Activities+Schedule+-+Update.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }} WACE to replace TEE, 2009, Curriculum Council&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Western Australian Certificate of Education]] (WACE) was introduced as an umbrella term given to the set of final examinations that are completed by the majority of Year 12 students, replacing the TEE (Tertiary Entrance Exam). All previous TEE courses and corresponding examinations  were converted to the WACE curriculum, and the TER (Tertiary Entrance Rank) was replaced with the Australian national standard entrance score, the [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]].

==Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER)==
{{Main|Tertiary Entrance Rank}}

The TER was normally derived from the Tertiary Entrance Score (TES) by a mathematical procedure approved by the Academic Board{{specify|reason=WA Academic Board? national Academic Board?}}. For applicants who took university entrance qualifications equivalent to the TEE in another state of Australia, in New Zealand or who obtained the [[International Baccalaureate]] Diploma,  a TER was also derived. In the latter cases, the TER was considered equivalent to the TER derived from Western Australia's TES.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The TER was a number between 99.95 and zero that reported a student's ranking in comparison to all other students{{specify|reason=for that particular year?}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The TER (Tertiary Entrance Rank) was replaced by an Australian national standard entrance score, the [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]], in 2010.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Tertiary Entrance Score (TES)==
In 2008, the TES was a score out of 510 (during 2009, out of 400), calculated on the basis of a person's TEE exam results.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Previously, the TES was calculated by multiplying an applicant's best mean scaled score over four or five Tertiary Entrance subjects, with at least one subject from each of List 1 and List 2 contributing to the score, by 5.1. Prior to 1998, 500 marks came from the subjects as above, while the remaining 10 came from the Australian Scholastic Aptitude Test (ASAT) score. In 2006, the first of the Course of Studies (COS), Aviation was allowed as a TEE Subject and the first external exam was performed, although the average exam mark was an appalling 36%. In 2007, three other COS's will be externally examined upon for the first time; English COS (replacing English TEE Subject), Engineering Studies and Media, Production and Analysis. In 2008 the TES was calculated on an applicant's best four TEE subjects, abolishing the previous list 1/ list 2 approach, however all candidates still had to complete 2 units of TEE English or English literature.

The TEE and COS subjects are broken into 2 lists; List 1-Humanities and List 2-Quantitative. If a student wants to qualify for a TER, they must pick at least 4 subjects, with at least one subject from List One and at least one subject from List Two.

'''Tracking''' is separating pupils by academic ability into groups for all subjects&lt;ref name="Gamoran"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gamoran | first=Adam | year=1992 | title=Is Ability Grouping Equitable? | journal=Educational Leadership | volume=50 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or certain classes and [[curriculum]]&lt;ref name=Teachers,Schools,andSociety&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a [[school]].&lt;ref name="Gamoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teachers,Schools,andSociety/&gt; It may be referred to as '''streaming''' or '''phasing''' in certain schools.

In a tracking system, the entire school population is assigned to classes according to whether the students' overall achievement is above average, normal, or below average.  Students attend academic classes only with students whose overall academic achievement is the same as their own.

== Description ==
Ability grouping is ''not'' synonymous with tracking.&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. E. (1987). Ability grouping: A best-evidence synthesis. Review of Educational Research, 57, 293–336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tracking differs from ability grouping by scale and permanence.  Ability groups are small, informal groups formed within a single classroom.  Assignment to an ability group is often short-term (never lasting longer than one school year), and varies by subject.&lt;ref name="Gamoran"/&gt;  Assignment to an ability group is made by (and can be changed at any time by) the individual teacher, and is usually not recorded in student records.  For example, a teacher may divide a typical mixed-ability classroom into three groups for a mathematics [[lesson]]:  those who need to review basic facts before proceeding, those who are ready to learn new material, and those who need a challenging assignment.  For the next lesson, the teacher may revert to whole-class, mixed-ability instruction, or may assign students to different groups.

==History in the United states==

=== Background ===
Tracking and its various modifications are among the predominant organizing practices of American public schools, and have been an accepted feature of the country's schools for nearly a century.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, B. (2008). Detracking in Context: How Local Constructions of Ability Complicate Equity-Geared Reform. Teachers College Record. Retrieved from: [http://www.tcrecord.org/printcontent.asp?contentID14603]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming into use at a time when schools were enrolling growing numbers of immigrant children as the result of compulsory schooling laws, tracking was adopted as a means of sorting those children viewed as having limited preparation or capacity for schooling from native children.  Unfortunately, however, tracking quickly took on the appearance of internal segregation.&lt;ref name="Wheelock"&gt;Wheelock, A. (1992). Crossing the tracks: How "untracking" can save America's schools. New York: New Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of tracks have changed over the years. Traditionally, there were academic, general, and [[Vocational school|vocational]] tracks, identified by the kind of preparation they provide.  By the 1920s, some schools had developed up to eight distinctly labeled tracks that represented particular curricular programs that reflected an assessment of students’ probable social and vocational futures.&lt;ref name="Wheelock" /&gt;

Many secondary schools now base track levels on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hallinan | first=Maureen | year=1994 | title=Tracking: From Theory to Practice | journal=Sociology of Education | volume=67 | issue=2 | pages=79–84 | doi=10.2307/2112697 | jstor=2112697 | publisher=Sociology of Education, Vol. 67, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public schools might track in terms of high, average, or lower ability.  As noted by Oakes and Martin, "school policies determine three structural qualities of the tracking system: ''extensiveness'' (the number of subjects tracked and the type of distinct curricula offered); ''specificity'' (the number of track levels offered); and ''flexibility'' (whether students move from one track to another)".&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Jeannie and Lipton Martin. "Tracking and Ability Grouping: A structural Barrier to Access and Achievement." Goodlad, John I. and Pamela Keating."Access to Knowledge." New York: College Entrance Examination Board, 1994. 187–204&lt;/ref&gt;  Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement.

===Origins of race-based tracking in school desegregation===
The ''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'' Supreme Court ruling of 1954 determined that the separate school statute established by ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' was unconstitutional, but a plan was not set forth for desegregating schools until the following year with the ''Brown II'' case. For schools in most southern regions of the United States, integration did not occur until the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mickelson|first=R. A.|title=The Academic Consequences of Desegregation and Segregation: Evidence from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools|journal=North Carolina Law Review|year=2003|volume=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mickelson (2003) stated that tracking was used as a tool to maintain white privilege by placing African-American students in lower academic tracks in Charlotte, North Carolina public schools after the ''Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg'' desegregation ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mickelson|first=R. A.|title=The Academic Consequences of Desegregation and Segregation: Evidence from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools|journal=North Carolina Law Review|year=2003|volume=81|pages=1514–1562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haney (1978) did a historical analysis on the negative effects of desegregation on African-American educators.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, J. E. (1978). The Effects of the Brown Decision of Black Educators. The Journal of Negro Education, 47(1), 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; At the secondary school level, African-American teachers or less qualified white teachers were assigned to teach African American students. Teachers in lower tracks were also found to be less organized in preparing lessons and taught fewer concepts to students (Oakes, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, J. (1987). Tracking in Secondary Schools: A Contextual Perspective. [[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]], 22(2), 129–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of race-based tracking actually reach as far back as the federal court ruling in ''Roberts v. The City of Boston'' in 1850, a case that upheld separate school curriculums for blacks and whites on the belief in inherent racial differences in intelligence (Harvard Law Review, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;(1989). Teaching Inequality: The Problem of Public School Tracking. Harvard Law Review, 102(8), 1318–1341.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid- to late-1980s, there were a few federal court cases in the Mississippi and Georgia the involved unfair race-based tracking in school systems. ''Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School District'', ''NAACP v. Georgia'', and ''Montgomery v. Starkville Municipal Separate School District'' each ruled in favor of school districts based on the argument that socioeconomic status was a legitimate reason for tracking. Courts also held the belief that racial discrimination in education was a thing of the past by the 1980s (Harvard Law Review, 1989). Unfortunately, in rural areas of Mississippi and Georgia, African-Americans were made of a large proportion of low income students, placing them in lower academic tracks.

As late as 2009, Childers (in press) found that in a successful Ohio high school that was majority African-American, students of color were still placed in lower academic tracks at a rate that did not reflect the student population.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, S. M. (2011). Getting in trouble: Feminist post-critical policy ethnography in an urban school. Journal of Qualitative Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument for the proliferation of African-Americans in lower tracks was student choice rather than racially based practices of administrators (Childers, in press).

==Track assignment==
The ways by which students are assigned to tracks differs both between and within schools. Today, it is less common for schools to rigidly track students in all subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracking Inequality: Stratification and Mobility in American High Schools|last=Lucas|first=Samuel|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=1999|isbn=0-8077-3798-4|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrators and teachers in a given school may purposefully avoid using the term “tracking” to describe the organization of their school’s curriculum.  Yet, schools maintain a variety of policies that sort students into different programs of study including: test scores and grade requirements, pre- and co-requisite requirements, and teacher recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Sean|date=2007|title=The Contours of Tracking in North Carolina|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/214913|journal=High School Journal|volume=90|pages=15-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools also use over-arching programs of study such as “college prep” as a guidance technique to track students. Non-academic factors such as schedule conflicts can limit students from taking courses of varying level as well.  Thus, while most systems allow for some amount of student and parent choice, this choice is constrained by course taking requirements and guidance policies.  Within the context of this system, researchers disagree over the extent to which highly involved parents intervene to give their own student a course taking advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Useem|first=E.|date=1992|title=Middle Schools and Math Groups: Parents' Involvement in Children's Placement|url=|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=65|pages=263-279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=S.|date=2004|title=Do Increased Levels of Parental Involvement Account for Social Class Differences in Track Placement?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X03000851|journal=Social Science Research|volume=33|pages=626-659|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, high school students were sorted into “business/vocational,” “general,” or the “college” track, which had profound implications for the nature and extent of academic course taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Inequality: The Hidden Curriculum of High School Tracking|last=Rosenbaum|first=James E.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1976|isbn=0-471-73605-8|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent decades, vocational course taking has declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Career and Technical Education in the United States: 1990-2005 (NCES 2008-035).|last=Levesque|first=K. et al.|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while academic course taking has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domina, T.|first=&amp; Saldana, J.|date=2012|title=Does Raising the Bar Level the Playing Field? Mathematics Curricular Intensification in American High Schools, 1982-2004.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831211426347|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=49|pages=685-708|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Domina and Saldana (2012) report that the graduating class of 1982 took an average of 14.6 academic courses while the class of 2004 took 19.1 academic courses. Likewise, the percentage of students graduating with pre-calculus or calculus coursework increased from about 10.3% of students to 32.9% of students.  This increase in academic course taking, especially in the public sector, has narrowed the differences in academic rigor between high- and low-track students somewhat.  Academic intensification has also reduced differences in the academic experiences of public vs. private school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carbonaro, W.|first=&amp; Covay, E.|date=2010|title=School Sector and Student Achievement in the Era of Standards Based Reforms|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038040710367934|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=83|pages=160-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some loosening of high school tracking systems, most schools remain highly differentiated, with policies that encourage students to take the same level of coursework in different subjects.  In a study of high school tracking policies in North Carolina, Kelly and Price (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, S.|first=&amp; Price, H.|date=2011|title=The Correlates of Tracking Policy: Opportunity Hoarding, Status Competition, or a Technical-Functional Explanation?|url=https://doi.org/10.3102%2F0002831210395927|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=48|pages=560-585|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that the typical school had five or more levels of mathematics, with some schools having three or more levels of Geometry alone.  Larger schools and schools with a greater diversity of student achievement level have more extensive tracking systems than smaller, homogenous schools.  In many schools the track assignment process remains a high stakes decision.

== Debate ==

===Advantages===
Proponents of tracking say that tracking has several important strengths.

==== Lessons in adequation with the ability level of the students ====
A major advantage of tracking is that it allows [[teacher]]s to better direct lessons toward the specific ability level of the students in each class.&lt;ref name="Ansalone"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ansalone | first= George | year=2003 | title=Poverty, Tracking, and the Social Construction of Failure: International Perspectives on Tracking | journal=Journal of Children &amp; Poverty | volume=9 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While tracking for regular instruction makes no real difference in scholastic achievement for low and average ability students, it does produce substantial gains for gifted students in tracks specially designed for the gifted and talented.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner'', (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking meets the need for highly gifted students to be with their intellectual peers in order to be appropriately challenged and to view their own abilities more realistically.&lt;ref name="fiedler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiedler |first=Ellen D. |author2=Richard E. Lange |author3=Susan Winebrenner |year=2002 |title=In search of reality: unraveling the myths about tracking, ability grouping, and the gifted |journal=Roeper Review |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=108–11 |issn=0278-3193 |doi=10.1080/02783190209554142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking can allow students to receive lessons targeted at their ability for each subject separately, attending lessons set at different levels at the same school. For example, a student at a higher level in math may attend a class with advanced math students, but if at a lower level in English they may be grouped with peers at their level in English.

Another positive aspect of tracking is that since it separates students by ability, students' work is only compared to that of similar-ability peers, preventing a possible lowering of their self-esteem that could result from comparisons with the work of higher ability students, or inflating the egos of the high-ability students when compared to low-ability, same-age students.  Being with students of similar ability could allow students to realistically compete against one another for the highest marks with a reasonable chance of reaching the top of a class.



==== Higher achievement of high-ability students ====
Supporters of tracking also note that it allows for higher achievement of high-ability students.&lt;ref name="Kulik2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kulik | first= James A. |author2=Chen-Lin C. Kulik  | year=1992 | title=Meta-analytic findings on grouping programs | journal=Gifted Children Quarterly | volume=36 | issue=2 | pages=73–77 | doi=10.1177/001698629203600204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kulik and Kulik (1992) found that high-ability students in tracked classes achieved more highly than similar-ability students in non-tracked classes. Similarly, Rogers (1991) recommends that gifted and talented students spend the majority of their school day with ability peers.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''The Relationship..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 and 1990, the Kuliks also found a moderate improvement in attitude toward subject material for ''all'' ability levels.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor of ability grouping that has been advocated is the Joplin Plan that refers directly to ability grouping for reading. These groups are generally more interchangeable and less defined.&lt;ref name="Kulik2" /&gt;
In another study, Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996) found that high-track students’ achievement dropped when lower-ability students were integrated into the same class.&lt;ref name="Argys"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Argys | first= L. M. |author2=Rees, D. I. |author3=Brewer, D. J.  | year= 1996 | title= Detracking America's Schools: Equity at Zero Cost? | journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages= 623–645 | doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6688(199623)15:4&lt;623::AID-PAM7&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these studies suggest that tracking is beneficial to high-track students.  Tracking can also encourage low-ability students to participate in class since tracking separates them from intimidation of the high-ability students.&lt;ref name="Slavin1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slavin|first=Robert E.|year=1990|title=Achievement Effects of Ability Grouping in Secondary Schools: A Best-Evidence Synthesis|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=60|issue=3|pages=471–499|doi=10.3102/00346543060003471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of tracking also view tracking as an effective means of allocation since it helps direct students into specific areas of the [[labor market]].&lt;ref name="Ansalone" /&gt;

Rogers classifies tracking as one of ten types of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''Re-forming Gifted Education'' (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  High ability groups are often assigned special work that is more advanced than that of the other students in the class. For gifted children, such advanced work contributes to their social and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?, Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===

==== Heterogeneity inside tracks ====
Despite the positive aspects of tracking, some scholars have noted limitations of the system.  Tracking often does not work as effectively as it should because of the composition of the tracks.  In practice, tracks are generally not as homogeneous as they could be
(although they are more homogenous than a non-tracking system, which randomly assigns students to classrooms), so some of the potential benefits can't be fully exploited.&lt;ref name="Hallinan" /&gt;

Even when tracks initially are nearly homogeneous in students' academic abilities, heterogeneity can develop over time, since students learn at different rates.  Some systems reassess all students periodically to keep students of comparable ability together as they progress.

==== Racial and social discrimination ====
Low-track classes tend to be primarily composed of low-income students, usually [[minorities]], while upper-track classes are usually dominated by students from socioeconomically successful groups.&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyland | first=N. | year=2006 | title= Detracking in the Social Studies: A Path to a More Democratic Education? | journal=Theory into Practice | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=64–71 | doi= 10.1207/s15430421tip4501_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Jeannie Oakes theorized that the disproportionate placement of poor and minority students into low tracks does not reflect their actual learning abilities. Rather, she argues that the [[ethnocentric]] claims of [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]]s and the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon]]-driven Americanization movement at the turn of the century combined to produce a strong push for "industrial" schooling, ultimately relegating the poorer minority students to [[vocational education|vocational programs]] and a differentiated curriculum which she considered a lingering pattern in 20th century schools.&lt;ref name="Oakes2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oakes | first=Jeannie | year=1987 | title=Tracking in Secondary Schools: A Contextual Perspective | publisher=Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teachers appointment to classes ====
There is evidence to support the assertion that the appointment of teachers to classes is disproportionate.  The most-experienced, highest-status teachers are often assigned to teach high-track classes, whereas less-experienced teachers are usually assigned to low-track classes.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Davis | first=D. G. | year=1986 | title=A pilot study to assess equality in selected curricular offerings across three diverse schools in a large urban school district: A search for methodology. | journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers of the high-track courses were found to be more enthusiastic in teaching, better at providing explanations, and more organized than teachers of low-track courses.&lt;ref name="Oakes2"/&gt;

==== Curricula ====
Scholars have also found that [[curricula]] often vary widely among tracks, as might be expected.&lt;ref name="Ansalone" /&gt;  While the enrichment and/or acceleration of curricula is considered to be a major benefit to gifted and talented students.,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''The Relationship...'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; lessons taught in low-track classes often lack the engagement and comprehensiveness of the high-track lessons, reflecting their more remedial nature.

This can put low-track students at a disadvantage for college acceptance because they often do not gain the knowledge and skills of the upper-track students, presuming they could and would if not taught under a tracked system.  Oakes (1985) found that in high-track classes, teachers often used course materials and taught concepts which required extensive critical-thinking skills, whereas teachers in low-track classes tended to draw heavily from workbooks and rarely assign work that required critical thinking.&lt;ref name="Oakes1"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oakes | first=Jeannie | year=1985 | title=Distribution of Knowledge | journal=Keeping Track: How Schools Structure Inequality | publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "But tracking described by Oakes in 1985 had little to do with educating gifted and talented children."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, curricula of high-track courses are much more intensive and in-depth than those of low-track courses, as would be expected.&lt;ref name="Spade_etc"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spade |first= J.

==== Social effects and stigmatization ====
Some studies suggest that tracking can influence students' [[peer groups]] and attitudes regarding other students.  Gamoran's study (1992) shows that students are more likely to form friendships with other students in the same tracks than students outside of their tracks.&lt;ref name="gamoran2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gamoran | first=Adam |year=1992 | title=The Variable Effects of High School Tracking | journal=American Sociological Review | volume=57 | issue=6 | pages=812–828 | doi=10.2307/2096125 | jstor=2096125 | publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 57, No. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since low-class and minority students are overrepresented in low tracks with Whites and Asians generally dominating high tracks, interaction among these groups can be discouraged by tracking.&lt;ref name="Khmelkov"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Khmelkov | first=V. |author2=Maureen Hallinan  | year=1999 | title=Organizational Effects on Race Relations in Schools | journal=Journal of Social Issues | volume=55 | issue=4 | pages=627–645 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no research showing an academic benefit to low track students from such interaction.

Tracking can also result in a [[stigmatization]] of low-track students.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt;  In some cases, this stigmatization is thought to have a negative impact on students' academic performance and to influence students' attitudes.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamoran2"/&gt;  In one study, it was found that, among low-achieving students, students in tracked classes were more likely than students in non-tracked classes to believe that "their fate was out of their hands".&lt;ref name="B&amp;S2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Braddock | first=J. H. |author2=R. E. Slavin  | year=1992 | title=Why Ability Grouping Must End: Achieving Excellence and Equity in American Education | journal=Paper presented at the Common Destiny Conference, Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Carol Dweck]], this could be because their teachers impose upon them a 'fixed mindset,' but it is not an inherent attribute of tracking itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2006). ''Mindset: The new psychology of success''. New York: Random House. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dweck implies that teachers who promote a [[growth mindset]] could stimulate students to greater academic achievement regardless of tracking. So whether a fixed mindset is predictive of, or resulting from, a low track assignment is unknown.

The effects of social stigmatization can be some of the worst outcomes for students in lower academic tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oakes|first=J.|author2=Guiton, G. |title=Matchmaking: The dynamics of high school tracking decisions|journal=[[American Educational Research Journal]]|year=1995|volume=32|issue=1|pages=3–33|doi=10.3102/00028312032001003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer and Olexa (1971) interviewed high school students in lower academic tracks to examine the effects of tracking on self-esteem and perceived academic competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=W. E.|title=Tracking and opportunity|year=1971|publisher=Chandler|location=Scranton, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that students lost confidence in their abilities by their placements in low-ability classes in which teacher expectations for them were low.

These dilemmas were very common as students made transitions to new schools (e.g., elementary to middle school, middle to high school). The tracking of African-American students in elementary schools reflected remnants of early desegregation in which African-American secondary school teachers were demoted to teaching in lower grades (Haney, 1978). In these elementary schools, class-based tracking disproportionately placed African-American students in lower tracks with African-American teachers, regardless of ability. In transitions to middle and high school, tracking by ability created a division among these students and stripped students in lower tracks of their perceived academic efficacies.

Goodlad (1983) and Oakes (1985) found that students in lower tracks were more likely to drop out of school or participate in criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodlad|first=J. I.|title=A place called school|year=1983|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=J.|title=Keeping track: How schools structure inequality|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of tracking would have said that students dropped out due to lack of ability, but Mickelson (2003) stated that students differed widely even within lower tracks. Even when students demonstrated high academic ability, it was virtually impossible to change their academic tracks without delaying high school graduation (Mickelson, 2003).

==International perspective==

=== Background ===
Across countries there are wide differences in the use of formal tracking systems.  Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others such as the United States keep their entire secondary-school system  comprehensive. [[Eric Hanushek]] and [[Ludger Woessmann]]  identify the impact of tracking by comparing differences in student outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems.&lt;ref&gt;Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann,  "Does educational tracking affect performance and inequality? Differences-in-differences evidence across countries." ''Economic Journal'' 116( 510), March 2006: C63-C76.&lt;/ref&gt; The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.

=== Tracking by country ===
Tracking was once popular in English-speaking countries, but is less used now; tracking systems formed the basis of the [[Tripartite System]] in England and Wales until the 1970s, and in [[Northern Ireland]] until 2009.

In the UK the term "Tracking" refers to recording data as to individual pupils progress, the term "Streaming" commonly translates to the meaning of Tracking in the sense of this article.

Weak tracking systems have been used in American schools.  In this approach, local schools assign students to classrooms according to their overall achievement, so that a given classroom is primarily composed of students with either high, average, or low academic achievement.

[[Education in Germany|Germany]] uses a tracked system.  In Germany, students' achievements in their last of generally four years of primary school determine the type of secondary school they will be permitted to attend, and therefore the type of education they will receive.

A tracking system has been in place since the advent of modern [[education in the Netherlands]]. After it was relaxed in the 70s and 80s, the tracking system has been gaining substantial strength again since the late 1990s.

==''A Small Act'' and similarities to class-based tracking abroad==
The 2010 HBO documentary, ''A Small Act'', documented the difficulty of Kenyan students being able to afford attending secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Jennifer|title=A Small Act|url=http://www.asmallact.com/index.php|publisher=Home Box Office|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elite schools were viewed as pathway to law school, medical school, and other forms of advanced education. Students who were kicked out of school for insufficient funds were fated to lives of poverty. In Kenya, having only a primary school education prepared one for menial labor, while secondary school equated to future social mobility for poor Kenyan children.

The Kenyan system of education closely mirrored tracking in American high schools where students in college-preparatory tracks were able to attend four-year universities immediately after graduation and vocationally tracked students could only enter community colleges and technical schools. Middle-class Kenyans were more likely to complete secondary schools and attend college, similar to college-preparatory students in the United States. Despite displaying promising academic ability, both low track students in the United States and poor children in Kenya can be at disadvantages in their educational advancement. For those in the United States, they acquire vocational skills at the sacrifice of reaching their full academic potential and the job security of a college education. The prospects for poor children in Kenya are even worse, having acquired few job skills in their primary school education.

Poor children in Kenya did have the opportunity to gain admission to secondary schools through merit scholarships, which required that students attained satisfactory scores on entrance examinations. There were indeed opportunities for bright poor children, but merit scholarships were limited in the number of students who could be awarded. In the United States, bright students in vocational tracks can enroll in two-year universities, but they lack the scholarships and post-secondary funding of their college-preparatory counterparts. Vocational students negotiate with the burden of scant financial support for college, and poor Kenyan children have the stress of passing entrance examinations even if they have academic ability similar to that of middle-class  children or those in college-preparatory tracks.

===Detracking===

Detracking occurs when students are deliberately positioned into classes of mixed ability.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; As opposed to tracking, students are no longer placed in groups based upon academic achievement or ability.&lt;ref name="Hallinan, M. 1005"&gt;Hallinan, M. (1005) Tracking and Detracking Practices: Relevance for Learning. Transforming Schools. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-1257-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking can be associated with giving students in low-track classes less resources, fewer experienced teachers, low expectations, and unchallenging curricula.&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;Brewer, D., &amp; Rees, D. (1995). Detracking America's Schools: The Reform without Cost? Phi Delta Kappan, 77. Retrieved from: [https://www.questia.com/googlescholar.qst?docld=5001654255] Online: [http://www.cog.brown.edu/courses/63/Brewer_detracking.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for detracking believe that low-track students will greatly benefit in school achievement if they are mixed in with high-track students.&lt;ref name=Argys /&gt;

===Benefits of detracking===
Critics of tracking such as [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] say that detracking will help close the class-based and race-based [[achievement gap]].&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt;  Often students in low-track classes are disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority students.&lt;ref name=Burris&gt;Burris, C., &amp; Welner, K. (2005). A Special Section on the Achievement Gap-Closing the Achievement Gap by Detracking. Phi Delta Kappan, 86. Retrieved from https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=MY2YJljsCFJyzltpDmFp7fMbLNVjTS7WswJfvTK49FZJC29k057Z!1380883283!427202863?docId=5009329171&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favor of detracking say that detracking challenges social views about [[race and intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Oaks/&gt;

Tracking has been shown to produce less academic achievement for low-ability students, and higher academic achievement for high-ability students; de-tracking would increase the achievement of the worst students and harm the achievement of the best students.&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt;  Critics say that not challenging all students with the most advanced curriculum results in overall low student educational achievement,&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt; and that students in low tracks do not learn as much as their peers in higher tracks, e.g., advanced mathematics.&lt;ref name=Oaks&gt;Oakes, J., &amp; Stuart, A. (2000). Change Agentry and the Quest for Equity: Lessons from Detracking Schools. The Sharpe Edge of Educational Change: Teaching, Leading, and the Realities of Reform. {{ISBN|978-0-7507-0865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers typically have higher expectations for students in high-track classes and low expectations for students in low-tracked classes, which affects the self-image of students.&lt;ref name="Hallinan, M. 1005"/&gt;

===Concerns of detracking===
Detracking has been proven to reduce the achievement of students who would otherwise be placed  in high-track classes.&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt; Parents of high-ability students and other proponents of tracking say that [[gifted education|academically gifted students]] should have access to classes that maximize their potential.&lt;ref name=Oaks/&gt; Detracking holds back high-ability students because teachers must reduce the amount and complexity of material so that all students in the class, including low-ability students, can understand it.&lt;ref name=Brewer /&gt; Putting all students together in a heterogeneous group makes the teacher's job more difficult by increasing the range of performance of the students in a class.&lt;ref name=Brewer /&gt;

The teachers' perception of a students' academic abilities determines how detracking is carried out in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; For example, in a school with many disadvantaged students, teachers assumed most students had low ability, and therefore the classroom curriculum was easier than what the students were capable of achieving.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; On the other side, in a wealthy school, teachers typically assumed students were college-bound and intelligent, and followed a creative and challenging curriculum.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

==Proposed reforms==
Maureen Hallinan offers many suggestions for reforming the tracking system and counterbalancing its perceived negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt; Although tracking can [[wikt:segregate|segregate]] students by race and [[socioeconomic status]], she says that, by ensuring that students are engaged in integrated settings{{Clarify|pre-text=such as|date=February 2010}} during the school day, some of the negative effects of the segregation{{Clarify|pre-text=such as|date=February 2010}} could be avoided. Some studies suggest that low-track students often have slower academic growth than high-track students, but Hallinan says that providing more-engaging lessons in class, altering assumptions about students, and raising requirements for students' performance could help.  Research is needed in this area to test her hypotheses. In order to prevent stigmatization of low-track students, Hallinan suggests that schools challenge low-track students to achieve highly and should offer public rewards for gains in academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt; Such rewards would be necessary in all tracks to avoid the perception of unfairness.

Heterogeneous class assignment with part-time homogeneous groupings is one possible compromise.

Allen Graubard suggests that creating "small schools" within larger school systems would be a progressive proposal for reformation. The school experience could be reformatted by having students select programs themselves that cover both traditional learning as well as vocational real-world experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graubard|first=Allen|date=September 2004|title=Progressive Education and the Tracking Debate|url=|journal=The Radical Teacher |volume=70|pages=32–39|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform would also benefit from improving the instruction that is provided to students within the classroom. In order to have all students benefit from eliminating tracking, teachers must have the tools to teach all students, as well as the tools to decrease stigma that may arise from students who feel that they are at different learning levels from their peers. There is evidence that as it stands, many teachers are not given proper training to teach/guide differentiated classrooms. In order to successfully accomplish a reformation of the educational experience, teachers and faculty must be provided the proper time and support to complete training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modica|first=Marianne|date=September 2015|title=My Skin Color Stops Me From Learning: Tracking, Identity, and Student Dynamics in a Racially Mixed School|url=|journal=[[International Journal of Multicultural Education]]|volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=76–90|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
