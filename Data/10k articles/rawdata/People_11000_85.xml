'''Louis Antoine Philippe d'Orléans''', [[Duke of Montpensier]] (3 July 1775, [[Palais-Royal]], Paris - 18 May 1807, [[Salthill, Berkshire|Salthill]], England)&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;The story of his death at the Windmill Inn at Salthill is in doubt. See {{cite book |last=Fraser |first=Maxwell |year=1973 |title=The History of Slough |location=Slough |publisher=Slough Corporation |isbn= |page=72 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a son of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans]] (''[[Pseudonym#Noms de guerre|nom de rėvolution]]'': "Philippe Égalité") (1747–1793), and his duchess [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon|Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, Duchess of Orléans]]. He was the younger brother of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], later King of the French. Antoine had a deep affection for him, and they were only ever separated during the [[Reign of Terror]] and the events that followed between 1793 and 1797.

==Life==
In 1791, Antoine Philippe was appointed an aide-de-camp, with the rank of sous-lieutenant in his brother's regiment (his brother,  then duc de Chartres, was known as "Général Égalité.") He was made adjutant-general before the [[battle of Jemmapes]], in which both he and his brother fought. In Paris at the time of the trial of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Antoine Philippe attempted unsuccessfully to persuade his father not to vote for the king's death.

In April 1793, whilst adjutant-general in the ''[[armée du Var]]'', Antoine Philippe was arrested at the same time as the other Bourbons who had remained in France. He was imprisoned in [[fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] at [[Marseille]].

During his imprisonment, Antoine Philippe contracted the [[tuberculosis]] that eventually killed him. He also had an illegitimate child with [[Françoise Barbaroux]] — a son called ''Jean-Antoine-Philippe Dentend'' (7 July 1797 – 5 March 1858)—who became notary to the house of Orléans and in that role oversaw Louis Philippe's donation of his [[Goods of the House of Orléans|personal property]] in 1830 before his accession. Antoine never saw his child; on 13 fructidor year IV (30 August 1796), the [[French Directory]] decided to exile him to [[Philadelphia]], where the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]'s chargé-d'affaires in the United States of America granted him an annual pension of 15,000 francs. He set out on 5 November 1796, accompanied by his brother [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis Charles, comte de Beaujolais]], and in February 1797 met Louis-Philippe in Philadelphia.  For two years they travelled around [[New England]], in the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] area.

[[Image:GD-FR-Randan05.JPG|thumb|right|Effigy set up by [[Princess Adélaïde of Orléans|Adélaïde d'Orléans (1777–1847)]] on the [[Randan, Puy-de-Dôme|Domaine royal de Randan]]]]
Returning to Europe in 1800, the royal [[House of Bourbon]] was still in exile from France, so the brothers set up in England at [[Twickenham]] (Highshot House, Crown Road, building demolished in 1927). Later that year Antoine Philippe resolved to seek the hand in marriage of Lady Charlotte Adelaide Constantia Rawdon (d. 1834), daughter of the [[John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira|1st Earl of Moira]] by his third wife, [[Elizabeth Rawdon, Countess of Moira|Elizabeth Hastings, 16th Baroness Botreaux]] (daughter of the [[Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon|9th Earl of Huntingdon]] by his wife, [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Lady Selena Shirley]], founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]]). Despite her noble lineage, authorisation for the marriage was withheld by [[Louis XVIII|Louis, Count of Provence]] (the future King Louis XVIII), and the couple never wed.&lt;ref name="coutant"&gt;{{cite book | title=La Légitimité Monarchique |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kkmAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Charlotte+Rawdon | publisher=Editions Christian  | author= Coutant de Saisseval, Guy | year=1985 | location=Paris | page=51 |language=French| isbn=978-2-864960188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 Antoine Philippe's pulmonary tuberculosis worsened. His elder brother wanted to take him to [[Devon]] to benefit from the fresh air but, twelve miles out of Twickenham, they had to stop at an inn at [[Salthill, Berkshire|Salthill]] (near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]).&lt;ref name="Fraser" /&gt; Having a respiratory crisis, Antoine Philippe refused the [[ether]] Louis-Philippe wanted to administer and, murmuring to him "Give me your hand, I thought I was dying" ("Donne-moi ta main, j'ai cru que je mourais"), expired.

Louis Philippe had a funeral service held at the Catholic chapel on King Street in London, which ''[[Charles X of France|Monsieur]]'' (the future King Charles X) attended and, thanks to [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], obtained permission to bury his brother in [[Westminster Abbey]].

'''Benoît Chassériau''' (also known as Benito Chassériau or Chasserieux; 19 August 1780 – 27 September 1844) was a French diplomat, French spy and [[Minister of the Interior]] of [[Simón Bolívar]] in [[Cartagena, Colombia]].&lt;ref name="ministre"&gt;‘Indiana University Publications: Social science series, Volumes 8–10 p.58 – Publisher Indiana University, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espion"&gt;‘Selected Writings of Bolivar: 1823–1830’ – Ed. Colonial Press, 1951 – Latin America&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of the artist [[Théodore Chassériau]].

[[File:Benoit-chasseriau.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Portrait of Benoit Chassériau by [[Théodore Chassériau]] – [[Louvre Museum]], Paris]]

==Biography==
Chassériau came very early in the administration and made the memorable Egypt campaign. Although very young, he administered as Financial Controller, two important provinces of Upper Egypt from 1798 to 1801 under the command of general François-Étienne Damas and then under general Augustin-Daniel Belliard.

From 1802 until 1807, he was Treasurer-General and Secretary General of the French colony, [[Santo Domingo]]. Appointed Treasurer-General during the expedition to Santo Domingo in 1802, Chassériau held the position of Secretary General in the government of general Jean-Louis Ferrand in the eastern part of Santo Domingo, ceded to France by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]]. During the invasion of the peninsula by the imperial armies, this part of the territory of Santo Domingo, remained more Spanish than French. Taken prisoner, Chassériau managed to escape but maritime war prevented him from returning to France. He visited the West Indies and the mainland of Spanish America. Chassériau was one of the French exiles at the origin of the city of [[Aigleville (Alabama)|Aigleville]] and the [[Vine and Olive Colony]].

In 1813 [[Simón Bolívar]] appointed Chassériau [[Ministry of the Interior (Colombia)|Minister of the Interior]] and the Police in [[Cartagena, Colombia]] with his friend Antoine Leleux, who had the portfolio of War.&lt;ref name="ministre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espion2"&gt;‘Simón Bolívar, más allá del mito: una reconstrucción documental de la vida de El Libertador, don Simón Bolívar, sus relaciones con El Protector, don José de San Martín y sus conexiones con la pequeña y grande historia de América’ – Guillermo Ruíz Rivas – Ediciones Tercer Mundo, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Chassériau as commander&lt;ref name="panama"&gt;son nom est déformé en espagnol et s'écrit Benito Chaserieux – voir ‘La Independencia de Panamá en 1821: antecedentes, balance y proyecciones’ par Celestino Andrés Araúz – edition Academia Panameña de la Historia, 1980 – page 83 et ‘Panamá y sus relaciones internacionales: Estudio introductorio – Volume 15 of Biblioteca de la cultura panameña Volume 1 of Panamá y sus relaciones internacionales’ par Celestino Andrés Araúz – edition EUPAN, Editorial Universitaria, 1994 – page 17&lt;/ref&gt; took a very active part in the first expedition led by independent against [[Portobelo]] ([[Panama]]) and [[Santa Marta]]. He left Cartagena with 460 men on board 8 schooners and attacked Portobelo (Panama) on 16 January 1814. This expedition was a failure and was rejected by the Spanish royalists controlled by governor Joaquín Rodríguez Valcárcel. The second expedition conducted in 1819 by Scottish general [[Gregor MacGregor]] was a success.

In 1822, Chassériau was the representative of the Masonic loge of the Guajira to the Grand Orient of France. Belonging to a lodge was more a sign of adherence to philosophical or religious principles in a revolutionary goal for freedom and against Spain.

Returned to France in 1822, [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], then Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent him on a foreign posting from 1823 until 1824.&lt;ref name=" Chateaubriand "&gt;‘Bulletin de la Société Chateaubriand – Édition La Vallée-aux-Loups, p.8 à 10, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Chateaubriand gave two informal postings to Chassériau: the first mission was to ensure the mediation of France between Spain and the new state and the second mission to facilitate trade relations between Colombia and the French Caribbean colonies, mainly [[Martinique]].&lt;ref name="Chateaubriand2"&gt;‘‘The Beinecke Lesser Antilles Collection at Hamilton College: A Catalogue of Books, Manuscripts, Prints, Maps, and Drawings, 1521–1860’ par Samuel Jones Hough et Penelope R. O. Hough – Editions University Press of Florida, 1994 – pages 292, 293, 297, 299, 300 et 301&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1826 to 1830, Chassériau was employed by the Department of the Navy as agent in the Danish island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]]. From 1832 to 1833 he was employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, as a Consul of France in St. Thomas. He was Honorary Consul accredited in [[Puerto Rico]] from 1835 to 1839, and served from 1840 to 1844 as Consul of France in Puerto Rico, which had a population of 450,000 – of which 12,000 were French.

Chassériau died in Puerto Rico on 27 September 1844.

==The French friend of Simón Bolívar==
Chassériau maintained for many years a friendly relationship with [[Simón Bolívar]] who in his correspondence called him "''my French friend''".

In 1815, Chassériau indirectly saved the life of Bolívar in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. 
On 10 December 1815 a few hours before the assassination attempt, Chassériau visited Bolivar and gave him money to seek alternative accommodation. Thus, the Liberator left the room where [[José Antonio Páez]] had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged a knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.&lt;ref name="tentative assassinat"&gt;‘Bolívar y los emigrados patriotas en el Caribe (Trinidad, Curazao, San Thomas, Jamaica, Haití)’ – Par Paul Verna – Edition INCE, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tentative assassinat2"&gt;‘Simón Bolívar: Ensayo de interpretación biográfica a través de sus documentos’ – Par Tomás Polanco Alcántara – Edition Academia Nacional de la Historia, 1994 – Page 505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" tentative assassinat3"&gt;‘Petión y Bolívar: una etapa decisiva en la emancipación de Hispanoamérica, 1790–1830’ – Colección Bicentenario – Par Paul Verna – Ediciones de la Presidencia de la República, 1980 – Page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, Chassériau helped finance Simón Bolívar expedition to los Cayos in the southwestern part of [[Haiti]].
In order to collect 3,000 pesos, Chassériau formed a consortium with Jean Pavageau, Michael Scott, George Robertson, S. Campbell and Maxwell Hyslop. On his part, Chassériau lent the sum of 404 pesos to Simón Bolívar. To express his gratitude, Bolivar asked in 1827 the repayment of the loan by increasing interest at 6% per annum from 1 January 1816.&lt;ref name="pret"&gt;‘Memorias del general O'Leary: Documentos Daniel Florencio O'Leary, Simón Bolívar O'Leary, Manuel Pérez Vila – Ed.

Fundación John Boulton, 1966 – Haiti – p. 23 et 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Chassériau was the last of 18 children of Jean Chassériau, merchant, ship owner, advisor to the City of [[La Rochelle]]. He married in 1806, Marie Madeleine Couret de la Blaquière, daughter of a wealthy French owner in Santo Domingo.
He was the father of five children:

{{Bill Weld series}}
'''William Floyd Weld''' (born July 31, 1945) is an American attorney, businessman, and politician who was the [[Governor of Massachusetts|68th Governor of Massachusetts]] from 1991 to 1997. He was the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party's]] nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], sharing the ticket with [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref name="bigstory1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ea9c644d880c49baaeeee7a360b5b070/libertarian-gary-johnson-secures-running-mate|title=Libertarian Gary Johnson secures running mate|last=Peoples|first=Steve|date=|publisher=Bigstory.ap.org|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and Weld were together the first presidential ticket since [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]] to consist of two state governors.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/gary-johnson-the-third-party-candidate|title=The Libertarians’ Secret Weapon|first=Ryan|last=Lizza|date=July 18, 2016|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[libertarian Republican]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=on |url=http://ballot-access.org/2006/04/29/new-york-libertarians-nominate-william-weld-for-governor/ |title=New York Libertarians Nominate William Weld for Governor |publisher=Ballot Access News |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld was the [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District of Massachusetts]] from 1981 to 1986, focusing on a series of high-profile [[public corruption]] cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2016/08/21/bill-weld/|title=Bill Weld – Boston Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the head of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Department of Justice Criminal Division]] from 1986 to 1988. He resigned from the latter position in 1988, along with the Deputy Attorney General, in protest of an ethics scandal and associated investigations of Attorney General [[Ed Meese III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/30/us/high-justice-aides-quit-amid-concern-over-meese-s-role.html|title=HIGH JUSTICE AIDES QUIT AMID CONCERN OVER MEESE'S ROLE|first=Philip Shenon and Special To the New York|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected Governor of Massachusetts in [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1990|1990]] and was in office from 1991 to 1997. He was re-elected by the largest margin in Massachusetts' history in [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1994|1994]] and was the Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1996|1996]], losing to incumbent Democrat [[John Kerry]]. He resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President [[Bill Clinton]] to serve as [[United States Ambassador to Mexico]], but because of opposition by the [[social conservative]] [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations committee]] Chairman [[Jesse Helms]], he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination.

==Background==
{{main|Weld family}}
Weld was born in Smithtown, New York. His ancestor [[Weld Family|Edmund Weld]] was among the earliest students (Class of 1650) at [[Harvard College]]. He would be followed by eighteen more Welds at Harvard, where two buildings are named for the family. [[Stephen Minot Weld Jr.|General Stephen Minot Weld Jr.]] fought with distinction in many major battles of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Eicher760&gt;Eicher, John H. and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]] ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 760. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eicher559&gt;Eicher, John H. and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]] ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 559. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weld has a sense of humor about his background; when [[Massachusetts Senate]] president [[William Bulger|Billy Bulger]] publicly teased him about his all-American heritage and wealth, pointing out that his ancestors had come over on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', Weld rose on the dais with a correction: "Actually, they weren't on the ''Mayflower''. They sent the servants over first to get the cottage ready."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://harvardmagazine.com/1998/11/welds.html |title=The Welds of Harvard Yard: History through a family lens  |last1=Lambert |first1=Craig |work=Harvard Magazine |date=November–December 1998|access-date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weld's father David (1911–1972) was an investment banker; his mother, Mary Nichols Weld (1913–1986), was a descendant of [[William Floyd]], who was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]]. His siblings are Dr. Francis "Tim" Weld, David Weld, and Anne (m. Collins). His maternal grandfather was [[ichthyologist]] and [[ornithologist]] [[John Treadwell Nichols]], and his first cousin is novelist [[John Nichols (writer)|John Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNk1AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22mother's+father,+John+Treadwell+Nichols%22&amp;dq=%22mother's+father,+John+Treadwell+Nichols%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimjOmQ5YHNAhVVXlIKHW83AUQQ6AEIEzAA |title=The New York Times Biographical Service |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weld was educated at [[Middlesex School]]. He graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in [[classics]] from [[Harvard College]] in 1966, studied [[economics]] at [[University College, Oxford]], and graduated with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S.A. |url=http://willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/weld/ |title=Classics: William Weld |publisher=Willamette.edu |date=July 31, 1945 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Weld began his legal career as a counsel with the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. House Judiciary Committee]] during the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] impeachment inquiry, where one of his colleagues was [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham]]. In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully for [[Massachusetts Attorney General]], losing to Democratic incumbent [[Francis X. Bellotti]] by 1,532,835 votes (78.4%) to 421,417 (21.6%).

He was appointed as [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts#U.S. Attorneys|U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts]] in 1981 by President [[Ronald Reagan]], and held the post for five years. In that capacity, Weld expanded an ongoing public corruption investigation of the administration of Boston Mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]. More than 20 city employees were indicted, pleaded guilty, or were convicted of a range of charges, including several key political supporters of the Mayor.

From 1988–1990, Weld was a senior partner at [[Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr|Hale and Dorr]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Political career==
[[File:William F. Weld.jpg|thumb|right|Weld's official portrait at the Department of Justice]]

===U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts===
In 1981, Weld was recommended to [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] by [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph W. Giuliani]], then Associate U.S. Attorney General, for appointment as the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. During Weld's tenure, the Attorney General's office prosecuted some of [[New England]]'s largest banks in cases involving money laundering and other [[white-collar crime]]s. In 1985, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' said Weld "has been by far the most visible figure in the prosecution of financial institutions."&lt;ref name="IowaFP"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marco |last=Battaglia |title=The Fourth Estate, the 2016 United States of America Presidential election, and The United States Supreme Court |url=http://iowafreepress.com/2016/06/20/the-fourth-estate-the-2016-united-states-of-america-presidential-election-and-the-the-united-states-supreme-court/ |work=Iowa Free Press |date=June 20, 2016 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weld gained national recognition in fighting public corruption: he won 109 convictions out of 111 cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mullaney|first=Marie Marmo|title=Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States, 1988-1994|year=1994|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-31328-3-123|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the ''Boston Globe'' stated: "The U.S. Attorney's office has not lost a single political corruption case since Weld took over, an achievement believed to be unparalleled in the various federal jurisdictions."&lt;ref name="IowaFP" /&gt;

===Promotion to Justice Department===
In 1986, President Reagan promoted Weld to head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department in Washington, where Weld oversaw 700 employees. Weld was responsible for supervising all federal prosecutions, including those investigated by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as the work of the 93 U.S. Attorneys (who by then included Rudy Giuliani in Manhattan). During this time, Weld worked on some of the Reagan administration's most significant prosecutions and investigations, including the capture of Panama's [[Manuel Noriega]] on drug trafficking charges.

In March 1988, Weld resigned from the Justice Department, together with [[United States Deputy Attorney General]] [[Arnold Burns]] and four aides, in protest of improper conduct by [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Edwin Meese]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Yardley|title=Arnold Burns, Who Left Justice Dept. in Protest, Dies at 83 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/politics/arnold-burns-who-left-justice-dept-in-protest-dies-at-83.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382013787-AxfkPD7M4+7KCbuSn2GgzA |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1988, Weld and Burns jointly testified before Congress in favor of a potential prosecution of Meese for his personal financial conduct, following a report by a special prosecutor investigating Meese.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Meese resigned from office in July 1988 shortly after Weld's and Burns' testimony.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In 1990, Weld announced his candidacy for [[Governor of Massachusetts]], to replace the out-going [[Michael Dukakis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics in Massachusetts: More Division Than Vision |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/18/us/politics-in-massachusetts-more-division-than-vision.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 18, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Republicans made up under 14% of the Massachusetts electorate and a Republican had not won the gubernatorial election since 1970, Weld's liberal stances on social issues made him a viable candidate for office in the heavily Democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fiscal Crisis Could Open Door to the G.O.P. in Massachusetts |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/24/us/fiscal-crisis-could-open-door-to-the-gop-in-massachusetts.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the state Republican convention, party officials backed [[Steven Pierce]] over Weld, and initial polling had Pierce ahead by 25 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Silber Wins Democratic Contest in Massachusetts |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/us/silber-wins-democratic-contest-in-massachusetts.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 19, 1990 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld gained enough support to force a primary, and in an upset election, Weld won the Republican nomination over Pierce by a 60–40 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE 1990 CAMPAIGN; STUNNING PRIMARY IN MASSACHUSETTS |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/20/us/the-1990-campaign-stunning-primary-in-massachusetts.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 20, 1990 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election, he faced [[John Silber]], the president of [[Boston University]]. Polls showed Weld anywhere from a statistical tie to trailing by as many as ten points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE 1990 CAMPAIGN; Politics of Rage Dominate Contest in Massachusetts |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/01/us/the-1990-campaign-politics-of-rage-dominate-contest-in-massachusetts.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 1, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voter dissatisfaction with the state's Democratic majority gave Weld support for his promises to reduce the state deficit, lower the unemployment rate, and cut taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Healy |first=Patrick |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/w/william_f_weld/index.html?offset=40&amp;s=oldest |title=William F.

Sargent]] left office in 1975.

The business community reacted strongly to Weld's leadership. In a 1994 survey of chief executives conducted by the Massachusetts High Technology Council, 83% of those polled rated the state's business climate as good or excellent—up from only 33% at the beginning of his term. Proponents might claim that Weld's leadership changed the minds of 50% of the CEOs surveyed while others would note the national economic trends or other factors might play a part. Weld also reaped the benefits of the 1990s prosperity, as the state's unemployment rate fell by more than 3 percentage points during his first term, from 9.6% in 1991 to 6.4% in 1994. As a result, Weld received grades of A in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Stephen|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa167.pdf|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors|work=Policy Analysis No. 167|date=January 30, 1992|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Stephen|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors|date=January 30, 1992|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; B in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Stephen|last2=Stansel|first2=Dean|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa203.pdf|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 1994|work=Policy Analysis No. 203|date=January 28, 1994|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Stephen|last2=Stansel|first2=Dean|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/fiscal-policy-report-card-america-governors-1994|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America Governors: 1994|date=January 28, 1994|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and B in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Stephen|last2=Stansel|first2=Dean|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa257.pdf|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 1996|work=Policy Analysis No. 257|date=July 26, 1996|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Stephen|last2=Stansel|first2=Dean|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-1996|title=A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 1996|date=July 26, 1996|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.

===1996 Senate election===
{{Main|United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1996}}

On November 30, 1995, Weld announced that he would challenge incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[John Kerry]] in the 1996 election.&lt;ref name=96Contest&gt;{{cite news |title=Governor Weld of Massachusetts Is to Challenge Senator Kerry in '96Contest |first=Fox |last=Butterfield |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/30/us/governor-weld-of-massachusetts-is-to-challenge-senator-kerry-in-96contest.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld, who was among the first reasonably well-funded Republican Senate candidates in Massachusetts since [[Edward Brooke]] was unseated in 1978, said of the race, "I've spent some time recently considering where I can do the most good for the people of Massachusetts, and right now the fights that matter most to the people of this state are in another arena, Congress."&lt;ref name=96Contest/&gt;

The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warner |first=Margaret |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/june96/massachusetts_6-5.html |title=Online NewsHour: Massachusetts Senate race – Clash of the Titans |date=June 5, 1996 |publisher=[[PBS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119063603/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/june96/massachusetts_6-5.html |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry and Weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading up to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bash|first1=Dana|last2=Hirschkorn|first2=Phil|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/29/kerry.weld/|title=Weld: Kerry prone to 'analysis paralysis'|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=July 30, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though facing a traditional uphill battle in a state where Democrats outnumbered Republicans 3-to-1, and running the same year as the presidential election, Weld was a popular incumbent governor and polled even with Kerry throughout the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenblatt |first1=Alan|last2=Marshall|first2=Robert|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9610/23/2cq.senate.overview/index.shtml|title=AllPolitics – CQ's Senate Overview – Still Anybody's Call|publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]]|via=[[CNN]]|date=October 23, 1996|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warner |first=Margaret |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/september96/kerry_weld_9-19.html |title=Online NewsHour:  Kerry/Weld: Dead Heat |date=September 19, 1996 |publisher=[[PBS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119061948/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/september96/kerry_weld_9-19.html |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Senator Kerry won re-election with 53 percent to Weld's 45 percent&amp;nbsp;– the last seriously contested Senate race in Massachusetts until the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|special election]] for [[Ted Kennedy]]'s seat in 2010. Notably, President [[Bill Clinton]] won [[United States presidential election in Massachusetts, 1996|Massachusetts in 1996]] with 62% of the vote.

===Ambassadorship nomination and resignation===
In July 1997, Weld was nominated to become [[United States Ambassador to Mexico]] by President [[Bill Clinton]]. His nomination stalled after [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations committee]] Chairman [[Jesse Helms]] refused to hold a hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former [[United States Attorney General]] and friend of Helms, [[Edwin Meese]]. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/02/us/in-washington-few-trifle-with-jesse-helms.html|title=In Washington, Few Trifle With Jesse Helms|first1=Richard L.|last1=Berke|first2=Steven Lee|last2=Myers|date=August 2, 1997|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." Senate Majority Leader [[Trent Lott]] said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" and that "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [the nomination] even if it's going to bottom." Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that "I've had a lot of people come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/us/massachusetts-governor-seeking-post-will-resign.html |title=Massachusetts Governor, Seeking Post, Will Resign |work=The New York Times |author=Richard L. Berke |date=July 28, 1997 |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weld resigned the governorship on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few thought he would be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/29/us/it-s-mexico-or-bust-as-restless-massachusetts-governor-resigns.html |title=It's Mexico or Bust as Restless Massachusetts Governor Resigns |work=The New York Times |author=Sara Rimer |date=July 29, 1997 |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an intensive six-week battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/william-f-weld |title=William F Weld |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, "I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so I can go back to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/16/news/mn-32752 |title=Weld Drops Bid for Mexico Post, Blisters Capital |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Tyler Marshall |date=September 16, 1997 |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

===Law firm and private equity partner===
Weld was a partner in the Boston and [[Manhattan]] offices of the international [[law firm]] [[McDermott Will &amp; Emery]] from 1997 to 2001, and head of the New York office from 2000 to 2001.&lt;ref name="MWE"&gt;[https://www.mwe.com/en/press-room/2006/11/william-weld-rejoins-mcdermotts-new-york-office William Weld Rejoins McDermott's New York Office] (press release), McDermott Will &amp; Emery (November 16, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2000, the [[private equity firm]] announced that Weld would join the firm, to be renamed Leeds Weld &amp; Co., as a general partner, effective on January 1, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Former+Massachusetts+Governor+William+F.+Weld+Joins+Leeds+Equity...-a067927020 Former Massachusetts Governor William F.

===2004 election===
During the re-election campaign of President [[George W. Bush]], who was running against Weld's old foe John Kerry, Weld helped Bush to prepare for the [[U.S. presidential election debates, 2004|debates]].

===Kentucky college management===
From January to October 2005, Weld was chief executive of [[Decker College]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. His term ended as the college was closing under bankruptcy protection following a disagreement with the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] about accreditation of its construction-related courses and online instruction. This matter would follow Weld into the 2006 race for Governor of New York, with former U.S. Senator from New York [[Alfonse D'Amato]] asserting that Weld was responsible and oversaw "multimillion dollar looting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barrouquere |first=Brett |title=Probe haunts Weld in bid for N.Y. governor |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/governors/articles/2006/02/14/probe_haunts_weld_in_bid_for_ny_governor/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=February 14, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Weld Is Criticized by D'Amato |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/nyregion/04weld.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2016 | first=Patrick D. | last=Healy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the ''Wall Street Street Journal'' posted an [[editorial]] in which the newspaper expanded on a 2012 piece{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to make the case that the Department of Education's 2005 claim against Decker College was "factually erroneous", with revenge against Weld{{clarify|date=January 2017}} as a motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article_email/why-americans-hate-government-1459117724-lMyQjAxMTI2NTE1NDYxOTQ0Wj|title=Why Americans Hate Government: The regulators who destroyed Decker College have never been held accountable.|date=March 27, 2016|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidacy for Governor of New York, 2005–06===
After being Governor of Massachusetts, Weld moved to New York in 2000. On April 24, 2005, it was reported that he was in talks with the [[New York (state)|New York]] Republicans to run for [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|Governor of New York in 2006]], against likely [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Eliot Spitzer]]. Incumbent GOP Governor [[George Pataki]] announced on July 27 that he would not seek a fourth term. On August 19, 2005, Weld officially announced his candidacy for Governor of New York, seeking to become the second person after [[Sam Houston]] to serve as governor of two different U.S. states. 

In December 2005, Weld received the backing of the Republican county chairs of New York State during a county chairs meeting. On April 29, 2006, Weld received the Libertarian Party's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hammeroftruth.com/2006/04/11/bill-weld-as-a-libertarian-party-candidate-in-new-york/#comment-98208|title=Bill Weld as a Libertarian Party Candidate in New York?|work=Hammer of Truth|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld reportedly offered Faso the chance to join his ticket as a candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]], an offer Faso reportedly declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/nyregion/01gov.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|newspaper=''The New York Times''|title=Weld-Faso?

On June 1, 2006, the Republican State Convention voted 61% to 39% to endorse Faso over Weld. On June 5, [[Stephen J. Minarik]] (the chairman of the state Republican Party, and Weld's most prominent backer), called on Weld to withdraw from the race in the interest of party unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick |last=Healy|title=G.O.P.

===Later political involvement===
Weld publicly endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for the presidency on January 8, 2007. Weld was a co-chairman for Romney's campaign in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Weld backs Romney for Oval Office |first=Brian |last=Mooney |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/01/09/weld_backs_romney_for_oval_office/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day that Weld endorsed Romney, Gov. and Mrs. Weld also raised $50,000 for Romney's exploratory committee. Weld personally made a donation of $2,100, the maximum allowed per person per election at the time. He later donated another $200 (after the new maximum allowed rose to $2,300).

Weld was also active in campaigning for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in [[New Hampshire]] where both governors have been known to travel together. Weld went on to endorse [[Barack Obama]] over John McCain for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidency of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/weld_backs_obam.html | work=The Boston Globe | first=Foon | last=Rhee | title=Weld backs Obama | date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weld endorsed Mitt Romney in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/08/28/william-weld-firmly-mitt-romney-camp-even-convention-delegate/7PCNH1bh2helnAGNzoNyVO/story.html |title=William F.

===2016 Libertarian vice presidential nomination===
{{main|Gary Johnson presidential campaign, 2016}}

On May 17, 2016, former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], the Libertarian Party's 2012 presidential nominee and the leading candidate for its 2016 nomination, announced that he had selected Weld to be his choice for running mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stout|first1=Matt|last2=Sappochetti|first2=John|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/herald_bulldog/2016/05/bill_weld_top_of_vp_list_for_libertarian_candidate|title=Bill Weld top of VP list for Libertarian candidate|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice-presidential candidate is formally nominated separately from and after the presidential candidate under the Libertarian Party's rules, although as the presidential nominee Johnson was first allowed to speak about his endorsement of Weld. Both candidates won their nominations on a second ballot after narrowly failing to attain an absolute majority on the first ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/05/29/libertarian-party-officially-picks-former-massachusetts-gov-bill-weld-vice-presidential-nominee-heated-convention|title=Libertarians pick former Massachusetts Gov.

During the campaign, Weld took the lead on fundraising operations, as well as appearing on national television and at campaign rallies across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedliberty.org/articles/19576-johnson-weld-nyt-interview|title=4 things you should know from Gary Johnson &amp; Bill Weld's livestream with ''The New York Times''|website=www.unitedliberty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/massachusetts/beaconhill/libertarian-vp-candidate-bill-weld-rallies-boston-one-last-time|title=Libertarian VP Candidate Bill Weld Will Rally Boston One Last Time|date=October 30, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Johnson and Weld were the first presidential ticket to consist of two Governors since the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 election]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Despite polling higher than any third-party campaign since [[Ross Perot]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], Johnson and Weld were excluded from the debates controlled by the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] and their poll numbers subsequently declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/16/debate-commission-blocks-gary-johnson-an|title=Debate Commission Blocks Gary Johnson and Bill Weld|date=September 16, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton-vs-johnson|title=2016 General Election: Trump vs. Clinton vs. Johnson - Polls - HuffPost Pollster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationwide, the Johnson/Weld ticket received 4,488,919 votes (3.28%), breaking the Libertarian Party's record for both absolute vote total (previously 1,275,923 for Johnson in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]]) and percentage (previously 1.06% for [[Ed Clark]] and [[David Koch]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]]).

===Other activities===
In February 2013, Weld publicly supported legal recognition for [[same-sex marriage]] in [[United States v. Windsor|an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avlon|first=John|title=The Pro-Freedom Republicans Are Coming: 131 Sign Gay-Marriage Brief|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/28/the-pro-freedom-republicans-are-coming-131-sign-gay-marriage-brief.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bill''' (30 January 1926 &amp;ndash; 13 February 2008) '''and Bobbie Irvine''' (27 July 1932 &amp;ndash; 30 May 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article447218.ece Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; were [[United Kingdom|British]] professional [[ballroom dancer]]s. Bobbie Irvine was born Bobbie Barwell in [[Oudtshoorn]], [[South Africa]], while Bill Irvine, born William, was from Low Craigends in [[Kilsyth]]. His father was a miner, as was his grandfather, and Bill served in the [[Royal Navy]] before starting his dance career. As a young dance teacher he spent a period in South Africa, which led to his meeting Bobbie. They were married in 1957.&lt;ref name=irvine&gt;Irvine, Bill &amp; Bobbie 1974. ''The dancing years''.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair became South African champions, and later settled in London.

The Irvines won 13 world titles between 1960 and 1968 in the [[World Latin Dance Champions|Professional Latin]] and [[World Ballroom Dance Champions|Professional Modern]] categories of ballroom dancing. Their principal ballroom teachers were Eric Hancox, [[Len Scrivener]] and [[Sonny Binnick]]. They were coached in the Latin dances by [[Nina Hunt]], who became a great friend of the couple.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;

{{quote|The Irvines are perhaps the most outstanding couple we have ever had in the profession because they have done well over both branches [ballroom and Latin] and maintained their standard over a number of years. They are good ambassadors for Britain, good teachers, good lecturers, good at everything.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Frank &amp; Peggy. 1968. ''Come Dancing''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They were honoured for their achievements during their careers by appointment as [[Members of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1967, the first such award made for Latin dancing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Silvester]] was awarded the higher honour of [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] on 1961. In his case, contribution as a musician and as a dancer would have been considered.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition record ==
The Irvines' main competitive titles were:&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;

*1960: World 9 Dance, World Ballroom
*1961: World Latin
*1962: World 9 Dance; International, British and World Ballroom

'''Billy Lenz'''  is a fictional [[character (arts)|character]] from the ''Black Christmas'' series of [[slasher film]]s. He first appears in [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974) as a deranged murderer who breaks into a sorority house and begins to make obscene phone calls before killing the college students one by one. In the original film, Billy, referred to as '''The Prowler''' in the closing credits, was portrayed by [[Nick Mancuso]] and was portrayed by Robert Mann in the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|2006 remake of the same name]]. The character was created by screenwriter A. Roy Moore and has since appeared in two films, a [[mockumentary]] and a novelization based on the 1974 film.

The character is the primary antagonist in the ''Black Christmas'' film series. While the character remains ambiguous behind his identity and motivation in the 1974 [[Black Christmas (1974 film)|original film]], the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)| 2006 remake]] explores the childhood of Billy and the motivation for his killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth and Reality of Serial Killers in US Cinema|last=|first=|publisher=ProQuest|year=|isbn=0549375333|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Horror Film: The Genre at the Turn of the Millennium|last=Hantke|first=Steffen|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=2010|isbn=160473454X|location=|pages=112|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's intention was to never reveal what Billy looks like, so in the 1974 film, Billy's physical appearance is never fully shown (appearing only as a silhouette and one exposed eye), while in the 2006 film, his appearance is fully revealed.

==Appearances==
''Billy'' made his first appearance in the 1974 original film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]''. In the film Billy, a mentally disturbed man known as "The Moaner", regularly calls a local [[sorority house]] leaving disturbing and obscene messages. During one such phone call one of the sorority sisters, Barb, provokes him; he responds by threatening to kill them. The caller then goes on a killing spree, murdering many of the sorority house’s inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Bob Clark|title=Black Christmas|medium=DVD|location=Canada|publisher=Ambassador Films|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The character later appears in a 1976 novelization of the film written by Lee Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://horrornovelreviews.com/2013/08/18/10-horror-movie-novelizations-you-might-not-have-known-existed/comment-page-1/|title=10 Horror Movie Novelizations You Might Not Have Known Existed!|last=Molgaard|first=Matt|date=|website=Horror Novel Reviews|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the police not knowing who the murderer is, Billy makes one more call to Agnes.

''Billy'' later appeared in the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|2006 remake of the original film]]. In the film, the character’s history is expanded, his real name being William “Billy” Edward Lenz (Robert Mann), suffering from severe [[jaundice]] due to a liver disease. Although his father loves him, Billy is physically and mentally abused as a child by his mother, Constance Lenz, who blames him for being born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Glen Morgan|title=Black Christmas|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=Dimension Films|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching her and her lover (the man who became his stepfather) murder his own father, she locks Billy away in the attic. Attempting to have another child with her lover, he repeatedly falls asleep on the job, frustrating Constance and leading her to rape Billy at age twelve. Although young, and despite the years of abuse, it is implied that Billy becomes aroused when Constance reveals her nude body to him. He then impregnates Constance, leading to the birth of his half-sister and daughter, Agnes. Eight years later, Billy escapes the attic and the two murder their mother and stepfather. Billy then maims, but does not kill, Agnes. Billy is placed in a mental asylum and 15 years later, at age 35, escapes. Billy joins Agnes in attacking the sorority, but both are badly burned by [[Kelli Presley|Kelli]] and Leigh. Billy revives and attacks Kelli, but is pushed over a railing and impaled on a Christmas tree. Billy’s fate is changed in the film’s alternate endings: in one, Billy dies on the operating table, while in another Billy seemingly dies on the operating table only to disappear; the final shot shows Billy peering out of the vents.

==Characterization==
Bob Clark's intention was to never reveal what Billy looked like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|last=Nowell|first=Richard|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2010|isbn=1441188509|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the course of the original film, Billy's appearances are all silhouette, with only a glimpse of his eye being seen just before Barb is killed and when Jess comes face to face with him. Billy is depicted as a verbal, mentally unhinged, mass murderer who says disturbing things incoherently during the phone calls he makes to the sorority house. He is shown to be able to change his voice frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1970s|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2002|isbn=0786491566|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his physical appearance is not revealed in the [[Black Christmas (1974 film)|1974 film]], in the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|reboot]] Billy is shown to have severe [[jaundice]] due to a liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doom-generation.com/black-christmas-1974-and-2006/|title=Black Christmas movie review|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Generation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
In ''Shock Value: How a Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Invented Modern Horror,'' [[Jason Zinoman]] praised the character saying that, "What really made ''Black Christmas'' stand out was the killer, who, despite all expectations to the contrary, the audience never actually sees-except for one shot of his eyes peeking out of the crack in the door to the attic. We know he's up there and that he occasionally comes downstairs to butcher people, but we never know when."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shock Value: How a Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Inven ted Modern Horror|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|publisher=Penguin|year=2011|isbn=1101516968|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Horror Films of the 1970s'', [[John Kenneth Muir]], who criticized certain aspects of ''Black Christmas'' for being unbelievable, called Billy an effective villain stating, "the "Moaner" is a really creepy villain. His sick, oddball voice is frightening, and the things he says are downright horrid." He then said that the phone call scenes work because "we've all been plagued by crank callers, and some of us have been plagued by crank callers while in our homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1970s|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2002|isbn=0786491566|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Hagenbeck''' (June 10, 1844 – April 14, 1913) was a [[Germans|German]] merchant of [[wild animal]]s who supplied many European [[zoo]]s, as well as [[P. T. Barnum]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He created the modern [[zoo]] with animal enclosures without bars that were closer to their natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zandavisitor.com/forumtopicdetail-411-Hagenbeck_Tierpark_und_Tropen-Aquarium-Zoos |title=Hagenbeck Tierpark und Tropen-Aquarium |accessdate=2008-07-22 |quote=The founder and his idea Carl Hagenbeck built what no other dared dream of. In 1907, the Hamburg man opened the first barless zoo in the world. As early as the end of the nineteenth century, this son of a fishmonger had the idea of showing animals no longer caged up but in open viewing enclosures. In his zoo of the future, nothing more than unseen ditches were to separate wild animals from members of the public. Carl Hagenbeck patented this idea in 1896. Nine years later his dream was to come true in the Stellingen district of Hamburg. The revolutionary open viewing enclosures and panoramas were in fact ridiculed in professional circles but took the public's breath away. Hagenbeck's zoo is considered to have prepared the way for today's wildlife adventure parks. |publisher=Zoo and Aquarium Visitor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221104119/http://www.zandavisitor.com/forumtopicdetail-411-Hagenbeck_Tierpark_und_Tropen-Aquarium-Zoos |archivedate=2009-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of the zoo architecture initiated by him is known as the '''Hagenbeck revolution'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-May-2011/chrulew.html "Managing Love and Death at the Zoo: The Biopolitics of Endangered Species Preservation"], ''Australian Humanities Review'', Issue 50, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbeck founded [[Germany]]'s most successful privately owned zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]], which moved to its present location in [[Hamburg]]'s [[Stellingen]] district in 1907.  He was a pioneer in displaying humans next to animals in [[human zoo]]s.

==Biography==
Hagenbeck was born on June 10, 1844, to Claus Gottfried Carl Hagenbeck (1810&amp;ndash;1887), a fishmonger who ran a side business buying and selling exotic animals.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;46;Nigel Rothfels, ''Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo''. (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hagenbeck was 14, his father gave him some [[Pinniped|seal]]s and a [[polar bear]].&lt;ref name=savage/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His collection of animals grew until he needed large buildings to keep them. Hagenbeck left his home in [[Hamburg]] to accompany hunters and explorers on trips to jungle regions and snow-clad mountains. He captured animals in nearly every continent in the world. In 1874, he decided to exhibit [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Sami people]] (then known as "Laplanders") as "purely natural" populations, with their [[tent]]s, weapons, [[sled]]s, near a group of [[reindeer]].&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo Human Zoos], by [[Nicolas Bancel]], [[Pascal Blanchard]] and [[Sandrine Lemaire]], in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', August 2000  [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html French]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_16_131/ai_n13463375 Savages and Beasts - The Birth of the Modern Zoo], [[Nigel Rothfels]], [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, Hagenbeck began to exhibit his animals in all the large cities of [[Europe]] as well as in the [[United States]].

In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian [[Sudan]] to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe, and toured [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; In 1880, his agent [[Johan Adrian Jacobsen]] recruited a group of eight [[Labrador]] [[Inuit]]. The group toured [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Krefeld]] and [[Paris]]. One member of the group, [[Abraham Ulrikab]], kept a diary during his travels in Europe. Unfortunally, all eight Inuit were killed by [[smallpox]].

Hagenbeck's exhibit of human beings, considered as "[[Noble savage|savage]]s in a natural state," was the probable source of inspiration for [[Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]'s similar "[[human zoo]]" exhibition in the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]] in Paris. Saint-Hilaire organized in 1877 two "[[ethnology|ethnological]] exhibitions," presenting Nubians and [[Greenlandic Inuit]] to the public, thereby doubling the number of visitors of the zoo.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

Hagenbeck also trained animals for his [[circus]]es at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1893, and the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis]] in 1904. Hagenbeck's circus was one of the most popular attractions. His collection included large animals and reptiles. Many of the animals were trained to do tricks. In 1900 he [[crossbred]] a female [[lion]] with a [[Bengal tiger]] and sold the [[tigon]] to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[zoologist]] [[Bisiano Mazinho]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Hagenbeck's trained animals also performed at amusement parks in [[New York City]]'s [[Coney Island]] prior to 1914.

Hagenbeck planned a permanent exhibit where animals could live in surroundings like their natural homes.  Despite the existence of the [[Zoological Garden of Hamburg]], Hagenbeck opened his great zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] at Stellingen, near Hamburg in 1907. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1909-1910 he supervised the building of the Giardino Zoologico in Rome. Today his ideas are followed by most large zoos.

In 1905, Hagenbeck used his outstanding skills as an animal collector to capture a thousand [[camel]]s for the [[German Empire]] for use in [[Africa]]. He described his adventures and his methods of capturing and training animals in his book ''Beasts and Men,'' published in 1909.

Hagenbeck was one of the first Europeans to describe a creature that came to be known as [[Mokele-mbembe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loxton |first1=Daniel |last2=Prothero |first2=Donald R. |date=2013 |title=Abominable Science!

Hagenbeck thought the animal was some kind of dinosaur similar to a [[Apatosaurus|brontosaurus]] and unsuccessfully searched for it. His claim made headlines in newspapers around the world and helped launch the legend of Mokele Mbembe.

Hagenbeck died on April 14, 1913, in [[Hamburg]] from a bite by a snake, probably a [[boomslang]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Carl Hagenbeck.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Caroline Healey was born and raised in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], daughter of Mark Healey, a merchant and investor, and Caroline Foster.&lt;ref&gt;Lavan, Spencer, and peter Hughes [http://uudb.org/articles/carolinedall.html] Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography&lt;/ref&gt; She lived there off and on during her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Boston Directory]] |year= 1873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young woman, she  received a comprehensive education, encouraged by her father to write novels and essays, and to engage in debates about religion, philosophy and politics.&lt;ref name=deese /&gt; In addition to private tutoring, she attended a private school for girls run by educator Joseph Hale Abbot, until the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name="BMC"&gt;"Carolyn Healy Dalls Papers." Accessed on Oct 26 2013. Retrieved from http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/dall.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the fall of 1842, Healey taught at Lydia S. English's Female Seminary (later known as the [[Georgetown Female Seminary]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0GEcnfZ2VIC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=lydia+english+georgetown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI0svruu3ZAhWiwFkKHQrbC2YQ6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=lydia%20english&amp;f=false|title=Daughter of Boston: The Extraordinary Diary of a Nineteenth-century Woman, Caroline Healey Dall|last=Dall|first=Caroline Wells Healey|date=September 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807050354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over Christmas 1842, a Unitarian minister from Baltimore named Charles Dall came to fill an open pulpit in Georgetown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Healy initially found Dall unappealing and she was shocked when he proposed to her by letter months later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  But after a few weeks of correspondence, she accepted his proposal, reigned her teaching position, and moved to Baltimore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She married [[Charles Dall]], a Unitarian minister who worked with the poor in Baltimore, in 1844.&lt;ref name="BMC" /&gt; The two lived in Toronto during the early 1850s, and returned to Boston in 1855.&lt;ref name="deese" /&gt; Her children included [[William Healey Dall]], in whose Washington DC home she lived her later years.

===Work for women's rights===

Though she continued to write through the early years of her marriage and child-rearing, after her husband moved to Calcutta, India to perform missionary work, Dall became an active participant in the Boston Women's Rights movement.&lt;ref name="BMC" /&gt; She was soon an active lecturer and writer on the topic, and organized the New England Women's Rights Convention, along with suffragist [[Paulina Davis]].&lt;ref name=AmerWom&gt;"Dall, Caroline Wells Healey." In ''Notable American Women, 1607–1950'', Volume I. Harvard University Press, 1971. Retrieved from http://www.credoreference.com on Oct 26 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also with Davis she founded ''Una'', a journal devoted to woman's rights, and the pioneer publication of its kind.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Dall, Caroline Healy|short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deciding that she did not like working with groups, Dall turned to writing as her principal means of addressing women's equality. her most prominent works from this time included ''Historical Pictures Retouched: a Volume of Miscellanies'' (1861), which highlighted previously ignored women in history, and a collection of lectures entitled ''The College, the Market, and the Court; or Woman's Relation to Education, Labor, and Law'' (1867) in which she argued that the modern woman was no longer content to be in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] and should be allowed to participate in public life.&lt;ref name=AmerWom /&gt; The [[New York Evening Post]] called this collection "the most eloquent and forcible statement of the Woman's Question which has been made."&lt;ref name=AmerWom /&gt; Dall was a founder of the [[American Social Science Association|Social Science Association]] (1865).&lt;ref name=nie /&gt;

===Later life===

In the late 1860s, Dall retired from the Women's Rights movement and turned her writing attention to such diverse topics as Egypt (''Egypt's Place in History'' 1868) and the Civil War (''Patty Gray's Journey'', three volumes for children, 1869–70).&lt;ref name=deese /&gt; During this time, she also moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a friend of the current first lady [[Frances Cleveland]].&lt;ref name=deese /&gt; Much of her later work was about the American Renaissance to which she was witness as a young woman.&lt;ref name=deese /&gt; Works from this period include ''Margaret and Her Friends: Ten Conversations with Margaret Fuller'' (1895) and ''Transcendentalism in New England: a Lecture'' (1897), given to the Society of Philosophical Inquiry at the age of 73. During this time, she also gave the occasional sermon in the Unitarian Church, one of the earliest women to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=George Willis|title=Unitarianism in America|year=1902|publisher=American Unitarian Association|page=368|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LqD51ATal4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the last years of her life, she suffered greatly from arthritis, though she remained active until her death at the age of 90 on December 17, 1912.&lt;ref name=deese /&gt;

They later lived near [[Junction City, Oregon|Junction City]], on a farm without electricity. During [[World War II]], the family moved to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] in early 1942, when "Cece" was 11, where Hal (1906–2004)&lt;ref name=dadobterg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6860%2C1938917 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |title=Hal Andrus |agency=(obituary) |date=December 8, 2004 |page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother Bud opened a machine shop to refurbish sawmill equipment.&lt;ref name=CDA/&gt; Andrus graduated from [[South Eugene High School|Eugene High School]] in 1948 at age 16 and attended [[Oregon State University|Oregon State College]]&lt;!-- became OSU in 1961 --&gt; in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], where he majored in engineering in his freshman year.&lt;ref name=eugalum73&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e6ZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7OADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6787,6440178|newspaper=Eugene-Register Guard|last=Willis|first=Henry|title=Eugene 'alum' at conference|date=September 27, 1973|page=6B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}

===State Senate===
In 1960, at age 28, and concerned over the local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Idaho Senate|state senator]]'s stance against needed [[education]] improvements in Idaho schools, particularly in rural areas of the state, Andrus filed as a Democrat to run against him and won,&lt;!-- becoming the youngest member ever elected up to that time to the [[Idaho Legislature|state legislature]].  (John V. Evans was elected in 1952 at age 27)  --&gt; and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964 from [[Orofino, Idaho|Orofino]] (and [[Clearwater County, Idaho|Clearwater County]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Gubernatorial candidate===
Andrus first ran for governor in 1966, but was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary by Charles Herndon, an attorney from [[Salmon, Idaho|Salmon]].&lt;ref name=slhheoa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OrteAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3699%2C306923|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|location=(Idaho)|agency=Associated Press|title=Smylie loses, Herndon holds edge on Andrus|date=August 3, 1966 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven weeks before the November election, however, Herndon and two others died in a twin-engine private plane crash in the mountains {{convert|6|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest of [[Stanley, Idaho|Stanley]],&lt;ref name=ackicfg&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_i1IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dgANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2709,2050908|newspaper=Morning-Record|location=(Meriden, Connecticut)|agency=Associated Press|title=Air crash kills Idaho candidate for governor|date=September 16, 1966|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; while en route from [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] to [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]] in mid-September.&lt;ref name="herndon"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gjzo8vhdjoIC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22Cecil+Andrus%22+%22Charles+Herndon%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fWl9NDTLsS&amp;sig=RHqo2AuD_WyKiSzAAir75arHgqo A Political Dynasty in North Idaho, 1933-1967]; accessed January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ailbscs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5DkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3274%2C213558|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Andrus is likely ballot successor|date=September 16, 1966|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrus was appointed the nominee to take Herndon's place on the ballot.

Andrus returned to the [[Idaho Senate|state senate]] two years later in 1968, representing [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]].&lt;ref name=sscalhs/&gt; Herndon's widow, Lucille, was elected to several local political offices after his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/salmon-recorder-herald-sep-03-1970-p-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Idaho (1971–77)===
Undaunted by his earlier setback, Andrus defeated Samuelson by over 10,000 votes in a gubernatorial election rematch in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5jkVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584%2C1088404|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=(Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Andrus tops Idaho vote|date=November 4, 1970 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed in large part to Andrus's public opposition to proposals for development of [[molybdenum]] mining in central Idaho's [[White Cloud Mountains]], which Samuelson supported.&lt;ref name=samreit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=btJRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_zIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5524,2870546|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=Samuelson reiterates support of mining in White Clouds|date=September 17, 1969|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plqcip&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BVlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FO8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3558,8530927&amp;dq=molybdenum&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press|last=Kenyon|first=Quane|title=Priest Lake question colors Idaho politics|date=April 29, 1985|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alice Lake.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Alice Lake (Sawtooth Wilderness)|Alice Lake]] in Idaho's [[Sawtooth Wilderness]]]]
During his first term as governor, Andrus played a key role in winning support by the U.S. Congress for Federal designation of the [[Sawtooth Wilderness|Sawtooth Wilderness Area]] in the State of Idaho.&lt;ref name=andidgg/&gt; Andrus was easily re-elected in 1974 with over 70% of the vote, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor [[Jack M.

In 1974, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Governor Andrus one of the "200 Faces for the Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879402-3,00.html|title=200 Faces for the Future |publisher=TIME|date=July 15, 1974|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretary of the Interior (1977–81)===
In January 1977, Andrus left his post as governor to serve as [[U.S. Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] for newly inaugurated President [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref name=agumtto/&gt; whom he had known since both were freshman governors in 1971. Andrus became the first Idahoan to serve in a [[Cabinet (government)|Presidential Cabinet]]. He was succeeded in Idaho by Lieutenant Governor [[John V. Evans]], a Democrat who served nearly a decade, winning re-election in 1978 and in 1982.&lt;ref name=sligh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zKpfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pTIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4044%2C527705|work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Gov.

Evans rejoices, Batt talks about quitting politics |date=November 4, 1982 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrus also took a leadership role in securing Congressional passage of the [[Redwood National Park|Redwood National Park Expansion Act]] in 1978.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} which added {{convert|48000|acre|sqmi km2}} to Redwood National Park in California, in a major expansion to preserve remnants of the giant redwood forests there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrepfer|first=Susan R.|title=The Fight to Save the Redwoods: A History of Environmental Reform, 1917-1978|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=1983|location=Madison|pages=130–85|isbn=0-299-08850-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Redwood National Park, fog in the forest.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Redwood National Park]] in California]]
In 1979, when President Carter asked for the resignations of his entire Cabinet during an administration retreat at [[Camp David]], the resignation of Andrus was not accepted. Andrus stayed on as Secretary of the Interior for the remainder of Carter's presidency, and returned to Idaho after Carter's term ended in January 1981.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Andrus wrote in his memoir about such a need for compromise relative to his successful, last-ditch efforts in securing passage of the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act|Alaska Lands Act]] during the last month of the Carter Administration in December 1980, following [[Ronald Reagan]]'s election in November: "The environmental groups were initially hostile. I actually had to listen to the idiotic argument (from the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club's paid Washington lobbyists) that they could get a better Alaska package out of Reagan and [[James G. Watt|Watt]]."{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

"Cooler heads quickly prevailed," Andrus continues, "It proved the old adage that there's nothing like a hanging in the morning to focus the mind. Even though we were creating tomorrow's controversies, a 103-million acre [preservation] plan ... was a lot better than nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Cecil D. Andrus, "''Politics Western Style''" (with Joel Connelly), Sasquatch Books, Seattle, 1998.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Idaho again (1987–95)===
After several years in private life following his return to Idaho in 1981, Andrus surprised many by seeking and recapturing the Idaho governorship in [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 1986|1986]], when he defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor [[David H. Leroy]] in a close open seat election.&lt;ref name=squek&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nkJYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1PkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2392%2C663736|newspaper=Spokane Chronicle|location=(Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Andrus reclaims old job in squeaker over Leroy|date=November 5, 1981|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent since succeeding Andrus in 1977, Evans had chosen to run for the [[United States Senate election in Idaho, 1986|U.S. Senate]],&lt;ref name=npotrinid&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gDFkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yfkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6978,2681874|newspaper=Spokane Chronicle|location=(Washington)|last=Kenyon|first=Quane|agency=Associated Press|title=No political truce in Idaho|date=October 28, 1986|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost.

During this second stint as governor, Andrus vigorously opposed federal efforts to store nuclear waste in Idaho. He also brokered a path-breaking agreement among land use and conservation interests to control water pollution from nonpoint sources to protect riparian and fish habitat in Idaho's rivers and streams.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In September 1989, Andrus closed off the Idaho border to [[nuclear waste]] shipments from the federal government's [[Rocky Flats]] site near [[Denver]]. He initially agreed to open a temporary dump near [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]] to store waste until the federal government agreed to open a site near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]]. When the federal government failed to open the Carlsbad site, Andrus refused to accept shipments of [[plutonium]] from Rocky Flats. [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[James D. Watkins]] did not challenge Andrus's authority to close the border.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1990, Andrus drew attention when he vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, which "would have made [[abortion]] illegal except in cases of [[statutory rape|non-statutory rape]] reported within seven days, [[incest]] if the victim was under 18, severe [[Fetal|fetal deformity]] or where the [[pregnancy]] posed a threat to the mother's life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-31/news/mn-173_1_abortion-bill Idaho's Andrus Vetoes Strict Abortion Bill], March 31, 1990, Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; Andrus was easily [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 1990|re-elected]] later that year against conservative Republican state senator [[Roger Fairchild]] of [[Fruitland, Idaho|Fruitland]],&lt;ref name=carlw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=shhXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=__kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1859%2C1028717|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=(Washington)|agency=wire services|title=Andrus, Craig record lopsided wins|date=November 7, 1990|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won every county except [[Lemhi County, Idaho|Lemhi]] and [[Jefferson County, Idaho|Jefferson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Shoshone falls.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Snake River]]'s [[Shoshone Falls]]&lt;br&gt;near [[Twin Falls, Idaho]]]]
In his fourth and final term as governor, Andrus was again in the national spotlight due to the [[Endangered Species Act]] listing of several [[Snake River]] [[Salmon|salmon species]].  These anadromous fish species spawn in their natal streams in Idaho and migrate seaward at a young age. Governor Andrus called attention to the downstream federal dams operated by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] as the major culprit. His successful lawsuit against the federal government led to incremental changes in operations of the dams, and to continuing efforts for major conservationist modifications to the dams that are ongoing today.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

On April 3, 1990, he signed ''House Bill 817'' into law, creating two new types of [[felony]] crimes, defined new criminal investigation areas, provided the basis for opening [[Satanic ritual abuse|ritual child abuse]] cases based upon probable cause, and provided a framework for extensive ritual child abuse investigation training throughout Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A SIGN OF THE TIMES|url=http://www.skeptictank.org/files/mys2/usalaws1.htm|work=Skeptic Tank Files|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite remaining personally popular, Andrus did not seek a fifth term in [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 1994|1994]]. At his death in 2017, he was the eleventh longest-serving governor in {{nowrap|U.S. history.&lt;ref name="deathplace"/&gt;}} Andrus was succeeded by [[Phil Batt]] of [[Wilder, Idaho|Wilder]], the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in Idaho since 1966; he served a single term and did not seek a second in [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]].&lt;ref name=bsrslgd&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3L4jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yNAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1542,1809232 |newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|location=(Idaho-Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Batt says Republicans shouldn't let guard down |date=September 18, 1997|page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrus's re-election in [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 1990|1990]] was the sixth straight gubernatorial win by Democrats in Idaho (Evans in 1978, [[1982 Idaho gubernatorial election|1982]]), but is the most recent; Republicans have since won seven consecutive, {{nowrap|through [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]].}}

A wildlife preservation area in Idaho established in 1993, {{convert|18|mi|-1|spell=in}} from [[Cambridge, Idaho|Cambridge]] in [[Washington County, Idaho|Washington County]], is named the [[Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area]] in his honor.&lt;ref name="IDFG"/&gt;

In 1995, Andrus founded the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150327150529/https://sspa.boisestate.edu/andruscenter/ Andrus Center for Public Policy] at [[Boise State University]], and in 1998, published his memoir, ''Politics Western Style''.&lt;ref name=CDA&gt;Cecil D. Andrus, ''Politics Western Style'' (with Joel Connelly), Sasquatch Books, Seattle, 1998.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An elementary school opened in 1997 in west Boise by the [[West Ada School District]] was named the Cecil D. Andrus Elementary School in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianschools.org/Andrus/Pages/AndrusElementary.aspx Andrus Elementary - Joint School District No. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804060557/http://www.meridianschools.org/Andrus/Pages/AndrusElementary.aspx|date=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrus remained active in the [[Idaho Democratic Party]] in the early 21st Century, and continued to campaign on behalf of other Democrats. In 2006, Andrus served as campaign treasurer for Idaho Democratic gubernatorial nominee [[Jerry Brady]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsos.idaho.gov/ELECT/Finance/2006/Oct10/Candidate/Gov_Brady.pdf Campaign finance report from Idaho Secretary of State website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705013541/http://www.idsos.idaho.gov/ELECT/Finance/2006/Oct10/Candidate/Gov_Brady.pdf|date=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Andrus endorsed and campaigned actively on behalf of [[Illinois]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]] in Boise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/01/obama_endorsed_by_former_idaho.html|title=Obama endorsed by former Idaho Governor Andrus - Breaking News Updates from Portland and Oregon|publisher=Blog.oregonlive.com|date=January 31, 2008|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At what was described as the "second biggest political rally in Idaho history," by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Andrus introduced Obama and recalled hearing [[John F. Kennedy]] speak years earlier: "I'm older now, some would suggest in the twilight of a mediocre political career," Andrus said, "[but] I, like you, can still be inspired. I can still hope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/obama-the-shock-of-the-red/?ref=opinion |title=Timothy Egan: "Obama: The Shock of the Red"|publisher=Egan.blogs.nytimes.com |date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing page of his memoir, Andrus quotes the poet [[Robert Frost]]: "We should not have to care so much, you and I."&lt;ref name=PWSp239&gt;Cecil D. Andrus, ''Politics Western Style'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  "But we do care", Andrus continues, "and we should.  We care about the future ... I remain hopeful that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren all the pleasures of life in an unspoiled West.  Perhaps hope should be replaced by a stronger word. It is a matter of obligation."&lt;ref name=PWSp239/&gt;

==Background and Personal life==
Dushyant Sridhar was born into a [[Tamilian]] family living in [[Bangalore]]. His father was a marketing professional and his mother, a school teacher.&lt;ref name="manam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Upanyasam expert Dushyant Sridhar's exclusive interview (also posted on you tube)|accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=Manam magazine |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started to study [[Sanskrit]] and the [[Vedas]] from the age of five when his parents enrolled him in Sanskrit and Veda classes at the [[Ahobila mutt]]. After studying in schools in Bangalore, he joined [[BITS Pilani]] and studied chemical engineering there. At BITS, Sridhar got more interested in finding out the meaning of chants, as he and a few classmates used to gather on weekends at the [[Saraswati]] [[temple]] in the campus to chant [[Vishnu Sahasranamam]]. Listening to them chant, the vice chancellor (Mr. Venkateshwaran) suggested delivering an ''upanyasam'' (discourse)in the campus. He gave his first discourse (''''upanyasa'''') by chance, at BITS Pilani to his co-students at the behest of the vice chancellor, professor and a professor's friend. Sridhar describes how his first experience was a revelation to him on what else went into being an upanyaskar other than public speaking, and started to study more to improve his Sanskrit and Tamil.

Sridhar passed out of [[BITS, Pilani]] in 2008, by which time he had given a dozen upanyasams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview  - Dushyant Sridhar |publisher=BITSAA Global meet 2017 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was under the impression that these upanyasams were a passing fad. Thereafter, Sridhar worked one year at the practice school at Century Rayon, [[Shahad]] and subsequently worked in the corporate sector in a number of companies including a market research firm in [[Mumbai]] and [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New age exponent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/new-age-exponent/article5867710.ece |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently quit working in the corporate sector in 2016 and currently spends all his time studying the Vedas and delivering lectures on television channels as well as in public gatherings. He lives with his wife,daughter and parents in [[Bengaluru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Samanth |first1=Subramanian |title=In the beginning was the word |url=https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/zsEBJDUoFd9l7xM7x12kcM/In-the-beginning-was-the-word.html |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Live Mint |date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francine''' "'''Penny'''" '''Patterson''' (born February 13, 1947) is an American [[animal psychologist]]. She is best known for teaching a modified form of [[American Sign Language]], which she calls "Gorilla Sign Language", or GSL, to a [[gorilla]] named [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] beginning in 1972.

==History==
Patterson is the second oldest of seven children and daughter of [[C. H. Patterson]], a professor of psychology, and Frances Spano Patterson. She was born in [[Chicago]] and moved with her family to [[Edina, Minnesota]], when she was young, and then to [[Urbana, Illinois]]. Her mother died of cancer when Patterson was a freshman in college and the youngest of her siblings was just five years old. This triggered her interest in [[developmental psychology]], a theme which pervaded much of her later work.

Patterson earned her [[bachelor's degree]] in psychology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1970. She attained her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1979 from [[Stanford University]], with her dissertation ''Linguistic Capabilities of a Lowland Gorilla'', on teaching sign language to [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and [[Michael (gorilla)|Michael]], another Lowland Gorilla, who died in 2000.

Currently, Patterson serves as the President and Research Director of [[The Gorilla Foundation]]. The foundation was founded with her longtime research colleague [[Ronald Cohn]] in 1978 using monetary support from a [[Rolex]] Award. The Gorilla Foundation has been trying to move from its current home in [[Woodside, California]], to [[Maui, Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Mar/09/ln/ln06p.html Honolulu Advertiser Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson is an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at [[Santa Clara University]] and a member of the Board of Consultants at the Center for Cross Cultural Communication in [[Washington, D.C.]]. She is the Editor-in-Chief of the ''Gorilla'' journal.

==Media==
Patterson is also an author of non-fiction works, including ''The Education of Koko'', ''Koko's Kitten'', ''Koko-Love!: Conversations With a Signing Gorilla'', and ''Koko's Story''. All of these books deal with her personal experiences with signing gorillas.

Patterson and her work with Koko are the subject of [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s 1978 feature-length documentary ''[[Koko: A Talking Gorilla]]''.
==Controversy==
Patterson's work has garnered some controversy as several former employees have questioned her scientific methods and findings, her attention to the welfare of the gorillas, and her overall professionalism. One allegation, made by former employees, said that she would routinely show her nipples to Koko and demand that other employees, both female and male, present their nipples to the gorilla.  A [[sexual harassment]] [[lawsuit]] over this matter was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/08/koko_kanzi_and_ape_language_research_criticism_of_working_conditions_and.html Hu, Jane C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3369">'''Ferdinand "Fred" Immler''' (December 10, 1880 – February 20, 1965) was a [[German people|German]] stage and film actor. 

==Life==
{{moresources|section|date=October 2015}}
Born in [[Coburg]], as a young adult he worked from 1900-02 at [[Deutsche Bank]] in [[Berlin]] and from 1902-04 at [[Dresdner Bank]]. 1905 he returned to Coburg as an actor-in-training and from 1906-08 he performed at the local court theatre. From 1908-09, he worked at the Residence Theater [[Hanover]], 1909 at the Summer Theatre in [[Poznań|Posen]] and from 1909-10 at the court theatre in [[Gera]]. 1910, he played at the Liebich Theatre and at the Victoria Theatre in [[Breslau]]. 

In 1912, Immler made the transition to the medium of motion pictures and appeared opposite the Danish actress [[Asta Nielsen]] in several roles between 1912-15, all directed by Nielsen's husband [[Urban Gad]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he enlisted in the German military. He returned to film in 1919, and starred in the [[Ernst Lubitsch]]-directed, [[Hanns Kräly]]-penned costume-drama ''[[Madame Du Barry]]'' opposite [[Pola Negri]] and [[Emil Jannings]]. One of his best recalled films of the early 1920s was in the 1921 Ernst Lubitsch-directed drama ''Vendetta'', once more opposite Pola Negri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/115467/Vendetta/overview ''Vendetta'' film review], ''New York Times Movies''; accessed October 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 he appeared with [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Fritz Kortner]] in the [[Maurice Tourneur]]-directed film adaption of the [[Franzos Keremen]] novel ''Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen'' (''The Ship of Lost Men'').{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Fred Immler retired from acting in 1935 and worked primarily as a dispatcher for a production company until the end of [[World War II]]. His last film appearance was in the 1935 film ''Der blaue Diamant'' (English: ''The Blue Diamond''). After the war he retired to his hometown of Coburg. {{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Harold Cardinal''' (January 27, 1945 &amp;ndash; June 3, 2005) was a [[Cree]] writer, political leader, teacher, negotiator and lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start Cardinal steadfastly demanded, on behalf of all [[First Nation]] peoples, the right to be "the red tile in the [[cultural mosaic|Canadian mosaic]]."

Cardinal was a lifelong student of First Nations law as practiced by Cree and other Aboriginal Elders, and this study has been complemented, but in no way supplanted, by extensive study of law in mainstream educational institutions. He was also a generous mentor and inspiration to a great many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students, professionals and political leaders.

He died of [[lung cancer]] in 2005 at the age of 60.

== Political career ==

Cardinal's activism began early, as he was elected president of the Canadian Indian Youth Council in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ld5UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZzwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=canadian-indian-youth-council&amp;pg=7069%2C2319405 Regina Leader Post, Oct 13, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt; His leadership qualities began to surface in 1968 when, at age 23, he was elected leader of the [[Indian Association of Alberta]] for an unprecedented nine terms, during which he was instrumental in the formation of the National Indian Brotherhood (the forerunner of the [[Assembly of First Nations]]).

Cardinal then served the people of his home community, the [[Sucker Creek Cree First Nation|Sucker Creek Indian Band]], as their Chief.

Cardinal served as the Vice Chief of the Assembly of First Nations during the period of the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s.

Cardinal was instrumental in the creation, in 1984, of the Prairie Treaty Nations Alliance, representing all First Nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to advance issues of concern to those First Nations with particular emphasis on their treaties with the Crown.

Cardinal also participated in Canadian federal politics, in 2000 running unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the riding of [[Fort McMurray—Athabasca|Athabasca]].  He ran against [[David Chatters]], who had been accused of being anti-Native, in explicit opposition to the apparent revival of popular and political support for policies of Aboriginal assimilation.

== The "White Paper" and ''The Unjust Society'' ==

Cardinal rose to national prominence in the late 1960s.  In 1968, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] proclaimed Canada to be a "just society."  However, after a promising round of consultations between the government of Canada and aboriginal leaders in which issues of Aboriginal and Treaty rights and the right of self-government were prominently discussed, Aboriginal people were outraged when Trudeau's [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs]], the Hon. [[Jean Chrétien]] (later Prime Minister of Canada) introduced a "[[1969 White Paper|White Paper]]" which advocated the elimination of separate legal status for native people in Canada. The white paper amounted to an assimilation program which, if implemented, would have repealed the ''[[Indian Act]]'', transferred responsibility for Indian Affairs to the provinces and terminated the rights of Indians under the various treaties they had made with the Crown.

In 1969, Cardinal swept open what he called, in his first book ''The Unjust Society,'' (cf. [[Just Society]]) the "buckskin curtain" between aboriginal people and mainstream society with force that was backed up with knowledge, understanding, dignity, anger and pride. The result, as expressed in the title of his second book, published in 1977, was ''The Rebirth of Canada's Indians'' as a political force in Canada.
 
''The Unjust Society'' was Cardinal's personal response to the Trudeau White Paper. It became an immediate Canadian best-seller and was reprinted in 2000 with a new introduction by Cardinal. ''The Unjust Society'' was instrumental in causing the Canadian government to abandon the  policy of the White Paper. Cardinal was also the principal author of the Indian Association of Alberta's response to the White Paper, entitled ''Citizen's Plus' or known as 'The Red Paper''. Cardinal's words galvanized the First Nations of Canada into action.  The result was a complete about-face by the federal government on the policies of the White Paper and the establishment of joint meetings between First Nations and the federal cabinet in the early 1970.

Cardinal's gift for satire was displayed in his early writings, turning Trudeau's promise of a "just society" into an "unjust society" and a "white paper" into "red paper", and then equating the brutal slaughter of American Indians by the U.S. Cavalry with bayonet and guns with the cultural genocide which the Canadian government was perpetrating on aboriginal people with paper.

Cardinal's lifelong demand for radical changes in policy on aboriginal rights, education, social programs and economic development was a beacon of hope for Canada's First Nations people.

== Intellectual legacy ==

In 1969, along with Indigenous communities, Elders, and other leaders, Cardinal radically questioned the hegemony of the nation state through his efforts to stop ''The White Paper,'' which culminated in his book ''The Unjust Society''. The book was instrumental in bringing Indigenous people's voices and issues to a centre stage in Canadian life; it also critically engaged the theoretical foundation and practice of Canadian liberalism as found in then Prime Minister Trudeau's conceptualizations of a "just society" where all citizens would be considered "equal" in the context of the current nation state.  Cardinal argued the state's premise of equality and justice was a false one because it failed to take into account the historical conditions under which the nation state was created: conditions that denied Indigenous people's rights as entrenched in the treaties and conditions that, subsequently, oppressed and subjugated them.

Cardinal was not only an architect of change on the political level, he was also instrumental in engaging and redefining the manner in which Indigenous and non-Indigenous people related to one another. One of the foundations of his life work was the insistence of the need for mutual recognition, understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. While he acknowledged difference, he still fundamentally believed in the power of relationship: "Two more disparate people, speaking in different tongues, speaking from different worlds, would be hard to find anywhere, and yet their dreams, their visions, their hopes, and their aspirations could not find any greater fusion"(Cardinal,1977, p.-).  Cardinal is also one of the first Indigenous scholars who actively sought "…a convergence between the knowledge systems of the Cree people and other First Nations and the knowledge systems found in Western educational institutions" (Cardinal,2007, p.&amp;nbsp;65).  Upon recognition of the power of colonization over both societies,  Cardinal foresaw a bridge of understanding between them.

As embedded in Cardinal's philosophical praxis, his most profound legacy was felt within Indigenous communities. He was one of the first contemporary Indigenous scholars to articulate the notion that Indigenous people could still hold onto traditions while fully engaging in modernity. Cardinal also opened the mindset of the Canadian public to the idea that Indigenous Elders were effectively "public intellectuals," tacitly, raising the profile of Indigenous knowledge. He made further intellectual road maps between Indigenous scholarship and traditional knowledge by articulating the Elders' desires to see Indigenous scholars become familiar with conceptual and theoretical frameworks of Indigenous thought through Indigenous languages in order to maintain cultural strength.

== Professional life ==

In addition to his political posts, Cardinal had a full and varied career.  In the 1970s, Cardinal was the first Aboriginal person to be appointed to the post of regional director general of Indian Affairs.  His tenure was brief and controversial.

In 1984, Cardinal was appointed by the chiefs of Treaty 8 to negotiate an agreement to "renovate" that treaty.  The failure of the negotiations after a promising beginning caused Cardinal to undertake a lengthy period of personal reflection, including much study with elders.

Cardinal also acted as a negotiator and consultant to many First Nations relating to land and other issues, usually relating to treaty rights.

Cardinal made a significant contribution to the work of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as the work of the [[Assembly of First Nations]], particularly on the need for recognition of the sovereignty of First Nations as expressed through their treaties with the Crown.  His lifelong position has been that the spirit and intent of the treaties must be the principal instrument governing relations between First Nations and the Crown.

== Legal career ==

After a career in First Nations politics and extensive study with First Nation elders, Cardinal undertook the formal study of law in his 40s.  While studying law at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] he also served as an assistant professor at that University.  He completed his LLM at [[Harvard University]].  A Doctorate in Law from the [[University of British Columbia]] was awarded to Cardinal days before his death in June, 2005.

On November 4, 2004, two months before his 60th birthday, Cardinal was admitted to the Bar of Alberta.

== Other honours ==

In 1999, Cardinal received an honorary doctor of laws from the [[University of Alberta]] in recognition of his unique achievements in leadership, public policy and law.

In 2001 Cardinal received a [[Indspire Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Award]], now the Indspire Awards, lifetime achievement award.

'''Harris Lee Wittels''' (April 20, 1984 – February 19, 2015) was an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, and musician. He was a writer for ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'', a writer and executive producer for ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', and a recurring guest on ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]].'' He is credited with coining the word "humblebrag" in 2010.&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8073107/harris-wittels-parks-and-rec-humblebrag-dies-at-30|title=Harris Wittels, Parks and Rec writer who coined 'humblebrag', dies at 30|work=The Verge|author=Casey Newton|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wittels was born in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], the son of Dr. Ellison Wittels and Maureen (née Davidson) Wittels, and raised in [[Houston, Texas]], in the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name=nerdist/&gt; He celebrated his [[bar mitzvah]] at Temple Emanu-El, across the street from [[Rice University]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="houstonia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstoniamag.com/news-and-profiles/people-and-profiles/articles/harris-whittels-humblebrag-interview-august-2014|title=Not to Humblebrag... But ignoring our calls won't get rid of us.|work=houstoniamag.com|author=John Nova Lomax|date=August 3, 2014|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His elder sister is voice over actress [[Stephanie Wittels]].&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;Greater Houston Jewish Genealogical Society, ''The Houston Jewish Herald-Voice Index to Vitals and Family Events, 1908-2007''.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his father as "the funniest dude alive".&lt;ref name="optimist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.serialoptimist.com/interviews/interview-with-harris-wittels-girls-want-to-be-him-guys-want-to-date-him-3778.html|title=Harris Wittels: Girls Want to Be Him, Guys Want to Date Him|work=[[Serial Optimist]]|author=David Dean|date=March 15, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittels attended [[High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] in Houston. In 2006, he graduated from [[Emerson College]], where he was a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], with a degree in television and video production.&lt;ref name="optimist"/&gt;

==Career==
After performing stand-up comedy in Los Angeles, Wittels met [[Sarah Silverman]] and became a writer on ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' in 2007. He also wrote for the 2007 and 2008 [[MTV Movie Awards]].&lt;ref name="optimist"/&gt; When ''The Sarah Silverman Program'' ended in 2010, Wittels became a staff writer and executive story editor for ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' during the show's second season, then later co-producer during the third season and executive producer during the fourth. His writing credits included the episodes "[[Media Blitz]]", "[[94 Meetings]]" and "[[Dave Returns]]". He also appeared on the show as [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Harris and Brett|Harris]], a dim-witted [[Animal control officer|animal control]] employee. He wrote for ''[[Secret Girlfriend]]'' and ''[[Eastbound and Down]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

In 2012, Wittels was cast as a co-star in [[Sarah Silverman]]'s NBC pilot ''Susan 313'' along with [[June Diane Raphael]] and [[Tig Notaro]], which was not picked up. In 2012, Wittels was hired as a consulting producer for the TV series ''[[Eastbound &amp; Down]]'' during its third season. He consulted throughout the season, as well as co-writing two episodes.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|2715265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittels was a frequent guest on the [[Earwolf]] podcast ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' and was known for the recurring segment "Harris' Foam Corner" (originally titled "Harris' Phone Corner", which debuted on Episode 31 of ''CBB''), during which he read jokes and observations saved on his phone that were deemed to be not good enough for his act. The jokes were typically lambasted by host [[Scott Aukerman]]. Also on the Earwolf network, Wittels hosted the ''Analyze Phish'' podcast, where he attempted to convince friends to enjoy the band [[Phish]]. He was also part of the popular series of ''CBB'' episodes entitled "Farts and Procreation" along with fellow ''Parks and Recreation'' alumni [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] and [[Chelsea Peretti]].&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; The episodes would usually devolve into nonsensical improv sessions. There were four "Farts and Pro" episodes, the final one being recorded very shortly before Harris' death and released days later, posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOT Farts and Procreation 4|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/not-farts-procreation-4/|website=Earwolf|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/a-tribute-to-harris-wittels |title=A Tribute To Harris Wittels, episode #221 of Who Charted? on Earwolf |website=Earwolf.com |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2015/05/20/horrible-and-wonderful-and-figuring-it-out-death-and-mourning-harris-wittels|title="Horrible and wonderful and figuring it out": The Death and Mourning of Harris Wittels|website=mediacommons.futureofthebook.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittels was a member of the band Don't Stop or We'll Die, along with comedians [[Paul Rust]] and Michael Cassady. He was the band's drummer and provided backing vocals. DSOWD performed a number of times on [[Scott Aukerman]]'s ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' podcast and played Los Angeles venues such as Largo and writer/director [[Rob Schrab]]'s wedding. Notable songs include "Lisa," "Once in Awhile," and "She Got Titties (In All The Right Places)". In 2010, Wittels coined the phrase "humblebrag" on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="verge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.twitter.com/humblebrag Humblebrag (@Humblebrag)], Twitter.com; retrieved May 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for Grantland on the subject of notable "humblebrags", the act of boasting about one's life and then downplaying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grantland.com/contributors/harris-wittels/ Harris Wittels Stories, Blogs, Podcasts].

In August 2013, NBC picked up an untitled Wittels sitcom, about a [[slacker]] still living with his parents while dealing with his whiz kid younger brother, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2013/08/nbc-buys-comedies-from-writers-harris-wittels-dan-mazer-561298|title=NBC Buys Comedies From Writers Harris Wittels &amp; Dan Mazer|work=Deadline.com|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wittels was a dedicated fan of the band [[Phish]]. His mother Maureen estimated that he saw the band in concert over 300 times in his lifetime, and his contract for ''The Sarah Silverman Program'' was reportedly written to include time-off so he could follow the band on tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wachs |first1=Stephanie Wittels |title=A Eulogy for Harris |url=https://medium.com/@stephaniewittelswachs/a-eulogy-for-harris-b73aae08b3e |website=Stephanie Wittels Wachs |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wittels |first1=Maureen |title=The Loss Of My Son Harris Wittels To Heroin |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-loss-of-my-son-harris-wittels-to-heroin_us_5819fc80e4b01f610e394766 |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first episode of ''Analyze Phish'', Wittels became a fan of Phish while he was in high school, after he and his friends spontaneously decided to see the band's concert on September 25, 1999 at the [[Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion]] in [[The Woodlands, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101 |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittels described the show's impact on him in an interview with ''[[Relix]]'', recalling "I was literally a fan since that night. It was the most amazing concert experience of my life. It wasn't even that great of a show, but even a regular Phish show, especially [[Phish#Hiatus: 2000-2002|pre-hiatus]], is gonna be better than anything else you see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mocharla |first1=Chris |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to "Analyze Phish" (Throwback) - Relix Media |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittels often appeared on ''Parks and Recreation'' as the character Harris, who habitually wore Phish t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rabin |first1=Nathan |title=In Memoriam: Harris Wittels - Phish.net |url=https://phish.net/blog/1424571723/in-memoriam-harris-wittels.html |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 19, 2014 interview on the podcast ''[[You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes|You Made It Weird]]'', Wittels openly discussed his personal life and history of drug addiction with host [[Pete Holmes]]. He said he had done drugs recreationally since he was 12. He said his drug usage got "out of hand" because of a breakup with a woman he felt was "perfect" for him in every way, except that she and her family were [[Scientology|Scientologists]], which he described as a "deal-breaker." He said he began to rely on [[oxycodone]] to deal with his stress over the relationship, his work on various television pilots, and writing the ''Humblebrag'' book. "It was easier just to take drugs and do it all. I wrote that entire book on so much drugs," Wittels said. "That's a humblebrag."&lt;ref name=nerdist/&gt; He said he had gone to [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] for a second time after becoming addicted to [[heroin]], and had just gotten out a month earlier; "Sobriety is still fresh. I haven't figured it all out."&lt;ref name=nerdist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nerdist.com/pepisode/you-made-it-weird-236-harris-wittels-returns|title=You Made It Weird: Harris Wittels Returns|work=[[The Nerdist Podcast]]|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittels addressed his struggles with addiction on ''Analyze Phish'', citing his second stay in rehab as one of the reasons for the delays in releasing the episode where cohost Scott Aukerman went to Phish's 2013 live show at the Hollywood Bowl. During the episode, which was released nearly a year after the show, Wittels touched on the impact his addiction had on his personal and professional life, as well as the use of recreational drugs as part of his Phish fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analyze Phish: Hollywood Bowl|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/hollywood-bowl/|website=Earwolf|date=June 25, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Harris' sister, [[Stephanie Wittels|Stephanie Wittels Wachs]], used funds her brother left her in his will to set up a multi-discipline performance and communal space for creative people in [[Houston]]. Called the Rec Room, the 82-seat theater and adjoining bar opened in June 2016 near [[Minute Maid Park]]. On April 20, 2017, the first [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]-themed "Harris Phest" was held, with comedy, ''Parks and Rec'' sketches and a [[Phish]] cover band to mark what would have been his 33rd birthday.

'''Judah ibn Verga''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''יהודה אבן וירגה''') was a [[Jews of Spain|Spanish]] historian, [[kabalist]], perhaps also [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]], of the 15th century, born at [[Seville]]. He is supposed to have been the grandfather (by [[Eliakim Carmoly]], ''Revue Orientale,'' ii. 98, the father) of [[Solomon ibn Verga]], author of the ''Shebeṭ Yehudah,'' and it is this work which furnishes some details of Ibn Verga's life.

==Biography==
He was held in high esteem by the governor of [[Andalusia]]. Once the Jews of [[jerez de la Frontera|Xerez de la Frontera]], a small town near Seville, were accused of transferring the body of a converted Jew to their cemetery; they applied to Ibn Verga for help, who, when admitted to the presence of the governor, proved by means of a cabalistic writing that the real criminals were the priests (''Shebeṭ Yehudah,'' § 38). He was very active in maintaining an understanding between the ''[[Marranos]]'' and the Jews; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], on its introduction into [[Spain]], desired him to betray the former. He succeeded, however, in escaping to [[Lisbon]], where possibly he lived several years, until he was taken by the Inquisition; he died under torture (ib. § 62). Ibn Verga wrote a history of the persecutions of the Jews, largely taken from [[Profiat Duran]]'s ''Zikron ha-Shemadot'' (comp. the synopsis in [[Heinrich Grätz|Grätz]], ''Gesch.'' viii., note 1); his work, in turn, was the basis of the ''Shebeṭ Yehudah'' (see preface to the latter).

==Other works==
The [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], [[Paris]] (MS. No. 1005, Hebr.), contains a series of scientific treatises written by a certain Judah ibn Verga, who is generally identified with the Judah ibn Verga of the ''Shebeṭ Yehudah.'' These treatises are:
* ''Ḳiẓẓur ha-Mispar,'' a short manual of arithmetic (ib. folios 100-110a)
* ''Keli ha-Ofeḳi,'' a description of the astronomical instrument which he invented to determine the sun's meridian, written at Lisbon toward 1457 (folios 110b-118a)
* A method for determining heights (folios 118b-119b)
* A short treatise on astronomy, the result of his own observations, completed at Lisbon in 1457 (folios 120-127).
* Ibn Verga also wrote a commentary on [[Al-Farghani]]'s compendium of the ''[[Almagest]],'' about 1480 (Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 2013, 4).

There is, however, some reason for the statement that this identification is doubtful (comp. ''Shebeṭ Yehudah,'' § 62). Another Judah ibn Verga lived in the 16th century and corresponded with [[Joseph Caro]] (''Abḳat Rokel,'' Nos. 99, 100).

Volute crater, ca. 320 BCE. [[Getty Center|The Getty]], Malibu, California.]] --&gt;
In [[Greek mythology]], King '''Laius''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|l|aɪ|.|ə|s|}}), or '''Laios''' ({{lang-el|Λάϊος}}) of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] was a divine hero and key personage in the Theban [[founding myth]]. Son of [[Labdacus]], he was raised by the regent [[Lycus (brother of Nycteus)|Lycus]] after the death of his father.

==Abduction of Chrysippus==

While Laius was still young, [[Amphion and Zethus]] usurped the throne of Thebes.  Some Thebans, wishing to see the line of [[Cadmus]] continue, smuggled Laius out of the city before their attack, in which they killed Lycus and took the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', 9.5.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laius was welcomed by [[Pelops]], king of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]] in the [[Peloponnesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus. ''Library'', 3.5.5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, Laius abducted and raped the king's son, [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], and carried him off to Thebes while teaching him how to drive a chariot, or as [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] records it, during the [[Nemean games]]. This abduction is thought to be the subject of one of the lost tragedies of [[Euripides]]. With both Amphion and Zethus having died in his absence, Laius became king of Thebes upon his return.

==Later misfortunes==

After the rape of Chrysippus, Laius married [[Jocasta]] or [[Epicasta]], the daughter of [[Menoeceus]], a descendant of the [[Spartoi]]. Laius received an [[oracle]] from [[Delphi]] which told him that he must not have a child, or the child would kill him and marry his wife; in another version, recorded by Aeschylus, Laius is warned that he can only save the city if he dies childless. One night, however, Laius was drunk and fathered [[Oedipus]] with her. On Laius' orders, the baby, Oedipus, was exposed on [[Mount Cithaeron]] with his feet bound (or perhaps staked to the ground), but he was taken by a shepherd, who did not have the resources to look after him, so he was given to King [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]] and Queen [[Merope (Oedipus)|Merope]] (or [[Periboea]]) of [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], who raised him to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Apollodorus. Library, 3.5.7"&gt;Apollodorus. ''Library'', 3.5.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Oedipus desired to know more about his parentage, he consulted the Delphic Oracle, only to be told that he must not go to his home or he would kill his father and marry his mother. Thinking that he was from Corinth, he set out toward Thebes to avoid this fate.&lt;ref name="Apollodorus. Library, 3.5.7"/&gt;  At the road called 'Cleft Way,' he met Laius, who was going to Delphi to consult the oracle because he had received omens indicating that his son might return to kill him.&lt;ref name="Tripp, p. 337"&gt;Tripp, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus refused to defer to the king, although Laius' attendants ordered him to. Being angered, Laius either rolled a chariot wheel over his foot or hit him with his whip, and Oedipus killed Laius and all but one of his attendants, who claims it was a gang of men. Laius was buried where he died by [[Damasistratus]], the king of [[Plataea]].&lt;ref name="Tripp, p. 337"/&gt; Later, Thebes is cursed with a disease because his murderer has not been punished.

Many of Laius' descendants met with ill fortune, but whether this was because he violated the laws of hospitality and marriage by carrying off his host's son and raping him, or because he ignored the Oracle's warning not to have children, or some combination of these, is not clear. Another theory is that the entire line of Cadmus was cursed, either by [[Ares]] when Cadmus killed his serpent, or else by [[Hephaestus]] who resented the fact that Cadmus married [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], the daughter of Ares and [[Aphrodite]], Hephaestus' straying wife. Certainly, many of Cadmus's descendants had tragic ends.

'''Laurence Clark''' is a British stand-up comedian, writer, actor, presenter, and disability rights campaigner. Laurence was born with cerebral palsy and uses his line of work to alter the general public’s perceptions of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent Blogs&amp;nbsp;– Laurence Clark|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/author/laurence-clark/|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stand-up comedy==
Laurence Clark topped [[Shortlist (magazine)|''Shortlist'' magazine]]'s poll of Britain’s Ten Funniest New Comedians in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

At the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference in 2005, Clark was called a 'sit-down comedian' by the then-Prime Minister's wife [[Cherie Blair]], referring to him being a wheelchair user.

'''Maria Bárbola''', also known as ''Mari'', ''Mariabárbola'' and ''Mariabárbola Asquín'' (died after 1700), was a Spanish court official, foremost known from the famous painting ''[[Las Meninas]]''. 

She was from Austria and from 1651 onward employed as a [[court dwarf]] in the household of the queen regent of Spain, [[Mariana of Austria]], with the official title ''Enana de la Reina'', and a companion to [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]]. On 30 March 1700, King [[Philip V of Spain|Phillip V]] reorganized the Spanish royal court in accordance with then-modern principles and as a consequence, the offices of court dwarf, fools and several other positions deemed outdated were abolished, and Maria Bárbola returned to her native Austria. 

In ''[[Las Meninas]]'', Maria Bárbola is depicted in an unusual way for a person in her position at the time. While people with dwarfism normally did not enjoy much respect in the 17th century and were often depicted in an insulting fashion, Maria Bárbola is depicted in a dignified position, standing upright beside the princess, with a thoughtful and controlled expression, meeting the eyes of the viewer.

'''Myron Elmer "Max" Essex''' (born August 17, 1939) is the [[Mary Woodard Lasker]] Professor of Health Sciences in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at [[Harvard University]], Chair of the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] AIDS Initiative (HAI) in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aids.harvard.edu/ Harvard School of Public Health AIDS Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chair of the Botswana–Harvard AIDS Institute in [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]]. Essex was one of the first to link animal and human [[retrovirus]]es to [[immunosuppressive]] disease, to suspect that a retrovirus was the cause of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and to determine that [[HIV]] could be transmitted through blood and blood products to [[hemophilia]]cs and recipients of blood transfusions. With collaborators, Essex also provided the first evidence that HIV could be transmitted by [[heterosexual]] intercourse.

In 1984, Essex identified [[gp120]], the virus surface protein that is used worldwide for blood screening, HIV detection, and epidemiological monitoring. With collaborators, he discovered the first [[simian immunodeficiency virus]], as well as [[HIV-2]].  Since 1986, he has developed programs for AIDS collaboration in [[Senegal]], [[Thailand]], [[Botswana]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[China]]. In 1996, Essex helped establish the Botswana–Harvard Partnership for HIV Research and Education (now the Botswana–Harvard AIDS Institute). This is a collaboration between the Ministry of Health in Botswana and HAI.

The '''Haughty Maiden of Logres''' is a character from [[Arthurian legend]], appearing in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' and works based on it. She is left nameless in Chrétien's unfinished romance, but [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who reworked the tale for the [[German language|German]] epic ''[[Parzival]]'', calls her '''Orgeluse''' (taken from ''Orgueilleuse'', the French word for "haughty").

In Chrétien's work, [[Gawain]] meets the Haughty Maiden while travelling; she treats him with contempt and scorn. Despite her humiliating treatment, Gawain acts with unfailing courtesy towards her, accepting her insults with grace.

Following her instructions to search for a nearby castle by a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]], Gawain encounters a knight who tells him that he is either very brave or foolish, for everyone who has tried to cross the perilous ford between them had drowned. Gawain realises the damsel had tried to do away with him. The knight offers to lead Gawain to a bridge, but the hero chooses to jump the ford on his horse [[Gringolet]]. He fails once, but succeeds the second time, and when he returns to the Haughty Maiden, she finally gives in and asks for forgiveness for treating him so poorly. She explains that her attitude was the result of tragic circumstances; the knight [[Guiromelant]] tried to win her love by killing her first suitor in single combat. Gawain sets off to avenge the fallen knight, but matters are complicated when Guiromelant reveals his love for Gawain's sister. The poem breaks off before the matter is resolved, though a later author tied up some of the loose threads in the [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of ''Perceval''.

Wolfram expands the story and brings it to completion. He explains that the [[Fisher King|Wounded King]] Anfortas had been injured fighting for Orgeluse, and was now waiting for [[Percival|Parzival]] (Percival) to heal him. Gawain and Orgeluse express their love for each other, and eventually peace is made between the lady and Guiromelant. Orgeluse marries Gawain while Guiromelant marries the champion's sister.

'''''Otros Aires''''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] XXI century [[Tango music]] project, founded in 2003 in [[Barcelona]] by Argentine musician/architect Miguel Di Genova.

''Otros Aires'' mixes the first [[Argentine tango|''tangos'']] and [[Milonga (music)|''milongas'']] structures from the beginning of the last century ([[Carlos Gardel|Gardel]], Razzano, D'Arienzo, etc.) with electronic sequences, melodies and lyrics of the 21st century.

This project counts with many collaborators like: Diego Ramos (Piano &amp; arrangements), Chloë Pfeiffer (Piano), Lalo zanelli (Piano), Martin Bruhn (Drums), Martin Paladino (Drums), Manu Mayol (Drums &amp; production) Pablo Potenzoni (Drums), Javier Saume Mazzei (Drums), Christian Maturano (Drums), Carlos Ocorso (Percussion), Hugo Satorre (Bandoneon), Lisandre Donoso (bandoneon), Herve Esquis (bandoneon), Emmanuel Trifilio (bandoneon), Simone Van Der Veerden (bandoneon), Joe Power (Harmonica), Nick Wadlew (Cover Drawings), Pablo Meketa (Cover Drawings), Marcelo Sofia (Cover Arts), Charly Fiorentino (Cover Arts) Miru Trigo (Photography) and Santiago Saponi (Video Director)  between others.

On December 11, 2004, known as "Tango day", ''Otros Aires'' presented its first CD at the Carlos Gardel's House Museum, commemorating the birthday of the singer.

With about 40 tours around, including more that 200 cities of Europe, North America and South America, OTROS AIRES was presented in some of the most important venues and world music festivals of the world like: Lincoln Center (NYC), Dublin National Concert Hall, Bardentreffen Festival (Nuremberg), Amsterdam Roots Festival, Greensound Festival (Bucharest), Pirineos Sur Festival (Spain), between others and also at the most relevant tango festivals of the planet including Buenos Aires Tango Festival several times.

OTROS AIRES songs are featured in TV shows like ¨Dancing with the Stars¨ and ¨America´s Got Talent¨ in US and ¨Strictly Come Dancing¨ in UK.

===National Board of Ophthalmology===
In 1995, Paul passed the [[American Board of Ophthalmology]] (ABO) boards on his first attempt and earned board-certification under the ABO for 10 years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Prior to this, in 1992, the ABO had changed its certification program, which had previously awarded lifetime certifications, instead requiring doctors to recertify every 10 years. Those who had already been given lifetime certification were allowed to keep it (according to the ABO, they would not legally have been able to rescind these certifications). Shortly after this change, Paul began a campaign to protest it. This effort culminated in 1997 with him creating, "along with 200 other young ophthalmologists", the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO) to offer an alternative certification system, at a cost substantially lower than that of the ABO.&lt;ref name="WaPoNBO"&gt;{{cite news|first=David A.|last=Fahrenthold|title=How Rand Paul tried to lead an eye doctors' rebellion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-rand-paul-tried-to-lead-an-eye-doctors-rebellion/2015/02/01/010994da-9cd6-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 1, 2015|access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Rand Paul: I passed my ophthalmology certification, but took a stand against the way the board operates|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=June 14, 2010|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/rand_paul_i_passed_my_opthamal.html|access-date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montopoli|first=Brian|title=Rand Paul's Addresses Ophthalmology Certification Questions|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20007639-503544.html|publisher=CBS News|access-date=October 18, 2013|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its certification exam, an open book take-home test, was described by one taker as "probably harder" and "more clinically relevant" than the ABO's exam.&lt;ref name="WaPoNBO"/&gt;

Named board members were Paul, his wife, and his father-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rand Paul's Doctor Credentials Questioned for Lacking Top Board's Certification|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/14/rand-pauls-doctor-credentials-questioned-lacking-boards-certification|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=October 18, 2013|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NBO was, itself, never accepted as an accrediting entity by organizations such as the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]],&lt;ref name="lcj-2010"/&gt; and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul let his own ABO certification lapse in 2005, which did not affect his practice in Kentucky; the state does not require board certification. By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 doctors were certified by the NBO.&lt;ref name="WaPoNBO"/&gt; The NBO was incorporated in 1999, but Paul allowed it to be dissolved in 2000 when he did not file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Dissolution|url=https://app.sos.ky.gov/corpscans/24/0479924-09-99999-20111101-ADS-4902880-PU.pdf|publisher=Kentucky Secretary of State|access-date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Paul was head of the local chapter of the [[Young Conservatives of Texas]] during his time at [[Baylor University]].&lt;ref name=RLizza /&gt; In 1984, Paul took a semester off to aid his father's primary challenge to Republican Senator [[Phil Gramm]].&lt;ref name=RLizza/&gt;

While attending [[Duke University School of Medicine]], Paul volunteered for his father's [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 1988|presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Intellectual Inheritance"/&gt;

In response to President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]]'s breaking his election promise to not [[Read my lips: no new taxes|raise taxes]], Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Inheritance"/&gt; In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception.

Paul managed his father's successful [[Texas's 14th congressional district#1996|1996 Congressional campaign]], in which the elder Paul returned to the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent [[Party switching in the United States|Democrat-turned-Republican]] [[Greg Laughlin]] in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the [[National Republican Congressional Committee|NRCC]] and Republican leaders such as [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=RLizza/&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in 2010 that, although Paul had told a Kentucky television audience as recently as September 2009 that KTU published ratings each year on state legislators' tax positions and that "we've done that for about 15 years", the group had stopped issuing its ratings and report cards after 2002 and had been legally dissolved by the state in 2000 after failing to file registration documents.&lt;ref name=inactive/&gt;

At the beginning of 2009, there was movement by political supporters of his father to [[Draft (politics)|draft]] Paul in a bid to replace beleaguered Republican Kentucky senator [[Jim Bunning]]. Paul's potential candidacy was discussed in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/03/ron-paul-defend.html |title=Ron Paul defends earmarks, says anti-pork McCain is just grandstanding |work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 11, 2009 |access-date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and locally in the Kentucky press.&lt;ref name=ky5&gt;[http://kywordsmith.com/#/rand-paul-issues/4533680792 "Rand Paul Set To Launch"] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016134135/http://kywordsmith.com/ |date=October 16, 2015 }}, www.kywordsmith.com. May 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's father said, "Should Senator Bunning decide not to run, I think Rand would make a great U.S. Senator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressman Paul's Statement on His Son Rand Paul|last=Martin| first= T.|work=Pediatrics Week|date=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2009, Paul gave his first political speech as a potential candidate at a Tea Party rally held in his town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, where more than 700 people had gathered in support of the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tea Party Goes to Washington'', Nashville: Center Street, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2009, Paul said that if Bunning, whose fundraising in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/05/bunning-retirement-might-not-save-gop.html|title=Bunning Retirement Might Not Save GOP in Kentucky|agency=FiveThirtyEight.com|first=Nate|last=Silver|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] primary to succeed him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/44184752.html|title=Dr. Rand Paul Ready To Enter Primary For Bunning's Seat|agency=WBKO|date=May 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529140108/http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/44184752.html|archivedate=May 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed an [[exploratory committee]] soon after, while still promising to stay out of the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on [[MSNBC|MSNBC's]] ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kywordsmith.com/#/paul-forms-exploratary-cmte/4533578818 "Rand Paul To Form Exploratory Committee For U.S. Senate Bid..."] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016134135/http://kywordsmith.com/ |date=October 16, 2015 }}, www.kywordsmith.com.

On July 28, 2009, Bunning announced that he would not run for reelection in the face of insufficient fundraising.

On August 20, 2009, Paul's supporters planned a [[moneybomb]] to kick off his campaign. The official campaign took in $433,509 in 24 hours.

Insiders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentuckyfight.com/ "Kentucky Fight – Rand vs. Trey"], kentuckyfight.com September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the campaign, Paul claimed his pledge to not take money from lobbyists and Senators who had voted for the bailout was only a "primary pledge";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiner|first=Bruce|title=Rand Paul flips, seeks money from bailout senators| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9139316|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 23, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; he subsequently held a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., with the same Senators who had been the target of the September 23, 2009, "moneybomb". Paul ended up raising some $3 million during the primary period. Paul's fundraising was aided by his father's network of supporters.&lt;ref name=RLizza /&gt;

He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build [[United States missile defense complex in Poland|defensive anti-missile installations in Poland and the Czech Republic]]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial [[Keystone Pipeline]], which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.&lt;ref name=Putinsaggression /&gt;

Paul played a leading role in blocking a treaty with Switzerland that would enable the IRS to conduct [[Credit Suisse#Tax Evasion Probes|tax evasion probes]], arguing that the treaty would infringe upon Americans' privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/rand-paul-tax-swiss-banks-104148.html |title=Rand Paul in cross hairs of tax evasion war |last1=Bade|first1=Rachael|date=March 2, 2014 |work=Politico|access-date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul received the 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the [[Center for the National Interest]] (formally called the Nixon Center) for his public policy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romeyn-Sanabria|first1=Marjorie|title=Rand Paul's 'Conservative Realism' Is Encouraging, But It Lacks A Diplomatic Vision| url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/24/rand-pauls-conservative-realism-is-encouraging-but-it-lacks-a-diplomatic-vision/|access-date=October 30, 2014|publisher=Daily Caller|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Antonin Scalia]] in February 2016, on February 15, Paul indicated that he would oppose any nomination by President Obama to replace the late Supreme Court Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/02/15/3749689/rand-paul-scalia-supreme-court-obama-nominee/|first=Emily|last=Atkin|title=Rand Paul: It's A 'Conflict Of Interest' For Obama To Nominate A Supreme Court Justice|date=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a press briefing on May 6, 2016, President Obama called on Paul to stop "blocking the implementation of tax treaties that have been pending for years", arguing that they assisted law enforcement in off shore investigations into [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/06/obama-calls-out-rand-paul-for-blocking-tax-treaties/|title=Obama Calls Out Rand Paul For Blocking Tax Treaties|date=May 6, 2016|publisher=dailycaller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/05/06/obama-calls-on-congress-to-reform-u-s-tax-code.html|title=Obama Calls on Congress to Reform U.S. Tax Code|first=Matthew|last=Kazin|date=May 6, 2016|publisher=Fox Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul advocated for the abolition of gun-free zones during a speech to the National Rifle Association on May 20, citing repeated tragedies occurring in these locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/280737-paul-calls-for-the-end-of-gun-free-zones|title=Paul calls for end of gun-free zones|first=Tim|last=Devaney|date=May 20, 2016|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, Paul spoke of introducing legislation to cease Selective Service, three days after the passing of [[Muhammad Ali]], after whom he intended to name the legislation in tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/06/rand-pauls-tribute-to-muhammad-ali-trying-to-end-selective-service/|title=Rand Paul's tribute to Muhammad Ali: Trying to end Selective Service|date=June 6, 2016|work=The Washington Post|first=David|last=Weigel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===115th Congress (2017–present)===
In March 2017, Paul introduced the [[Stop Arming Terrorists Act]] that would prohibit the use of United States Government funds to provide assistance to [[Al Qaeda]], [[Al-Nusra Front|Jabhat Fateh al-Sham]], and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and to countries supporting those organizations.&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/608/all-info"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-two-non-interventionists_us_594f1cdde4b0326c0a8d0918 The Two Non-Interventionists]".

Paul questioned President Trump's [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|April 2017 missile strike to Syria]] by saying, "While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked." He said that further action should not be taken without congressional authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Alexandra|title=Rand Paul: Syria strikes 'not in the national interest'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/08/politics/rand-paul-smercinish-cnntv|access-date=April 12, 2017|work=CNN|date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lardner|first1=Richard|title=Lawmakers slam Trump for bypassing Congress on Syria strike|url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2017/04/07/lawmakers-slam-trump-for-bypassing-congress-on-syria-strike|access-date=April 12, 2017|work=Boston.com|agency=Associated Press|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Amash]] (R-MI), [[Thomas Massie]] (R-KY), [[John Duncan Jr.]] (R-TN) and Sen. [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) in opposing a bill that would impose new economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. President Trump opposed the bill, pointing out that relations with Russia were already "at an all-time and dangerous low". He did, however, sign the bill though likely out of political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ivn.us/2017/08/03/meet-5-lawmakers-voted-against-russia-sanctions-bill/|title=Meet the 5 Lawmakers Who Voted Against the Russia Sanctions Bill|date=August 3, 2017|website=IVN.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, the Trump administration announced the intended recission of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program. In tweets responding to the act, Paul stated the executive order that created DACA was illegal and congressional bipartisanship was needed to solve or fix the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/349219-rand-paul-calls-for-bipartisan-daca-solution|title=Paul calls for bipartisan DACA solution|date=September 5, 2017|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul confirmed in an October 2017 intetview he would not vote for the Republican budget in the Senate unless billions in spending were removed from the plan: "If leadership is unwilling to compromise with somebody who is concerned about the debt, then they deserve to lose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/rand-paul-oppose-senate-gop-budget-243864|title=Rand Paul opposes Senate GOP budget|date=October 17, 2017|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Republican Senators introduced immigration framework akin to that proposed by President Trump and with his support that called for a 25 billion being provided for border security in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million immigrants brought into the US illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/373514-gop-senators-introduce-trump-immigration-framework|title=GOP senators introduce Trump immigration framework|date=February 12, 2018|publisher=The Hill|first=Jordain|last=Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was one of fourteen Republican Senators to vote against the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/374321-the-14-gop-senators-who-voted-against-trumps-immigration-framework|title=The 14 GOP senators who voted against Trump’s immigration framework|first=Jordain|last=Carney|publisher=The Hill|date=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FiveThirtyEight|Five ThirtyEight]], which tracks Congressional votes, found that Paul has voted with Donald Trump's positions the least out of all Republicans, only voting with him 74% of the time as of August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/rand-paul/|title=Tracking Congress In The Age Of Trump|last=Bycoffe|first=Aaron|date=2017-01-30|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affordable Care Act repeal ====
Paul introduced a bill on January 25, 2017, that sought to replace the Affordable Care Act which included each person's having a tax credit of $5,000 and not requiring everyone to have coverage, unlike Obamacare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/316084-rand-paul-unveils-obamacare-replacement|title=Rand Paul unveils ObamaCare replacement|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bill was pulled by Republican leaders from a vote, Paul released a statement on March 24 thanking House conservatives for rebelling "against ObamaCare Lite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/325702-rand-paul-takes-victory-lap-on-gop-health-bill|title=Rand Paul takes victory lap on GOP health bill|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=The Hill|first=Jordain|last=Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on April 2, Paul golfed with Trump and Budget Director [[Mick Mulvaney]] at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where they discussed a variety of topics, including healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/326913-trump-plays-golf-with-rand-paul-mulvaney-at-trump-golf-club-in|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|title=Trump plays golf with Rand Paul, budget chief at Trump Golf Club in Virginia|first=Paulina|last=Firozi|date=April 2, 2017|quote=President Trump hit the links at one of his golf courses on Sunday with Sen.

Paul told reporters on June 15 that he was willing to vote for a partial repeal, but not the implementation of new Republican entitlement programs, which he identified as present in both House and Senate versions of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/337970-rand-paul-denounces-new-entitlements-in-emerging-health-bill|date=June 15, 2017|title=Rand Paul denounces 'new entitlements' in emerging health bill|first=Peter|last=Sullivan|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul also told reporters on September 11 that he did not believe the [[Graham-Cassidy]] bill would pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/350161-paul-new-obamacare-repeal-bill-probably-worse-than-nothing|title=Paul: Cassidy-Graham health care bill not 'going anywhere'|date=September 11, 2017|publisher=The Hill|first=Peter|last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul tweeted on September 15 that Graham-Cassidy retained "90% of Obamacare" and dubbed it "more Obamacare Lite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/350828-rand-paul-says-cant-support-last-ditch-gop-obamacare-repeal|title=Rand Paul says can't support last-ditch GOP ObamaCare repeal|date=September 15, 2017|first=Rachel|last=Roubein|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, Paul asserted the Graham-Cassidy bill as immortalizing the Affordable Care Act and "a big government boondoggle of a trillion dollars of spending" that Republicans should abandon in favor of pursuing measures that would allow for health insurance to be purchased across state lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/351325-paul-trump-may-issue-interpretation-to-law-allowing-people-to-buy-insurance|title=Paul calls new ObamaCare repeal bill a trillion-dollar boondoggle|first=Olivia|last=Beavers|date=September 19, 2017|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, after President Trump tweeted that "Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as 'the Republican who saved Obamacare'", Paul responded that he would not be coerced into supporting Graham-Cassidy with bribes or bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/trump-obamacare-tweet-rand-paul-response-243015|title=Rand Paul to Trump: 'I won't be bribed or bullied' into supporting Graham-Cassidy bill|first=Nolan D.|last=McCaskill|publisher=Politico|date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul went on to win the straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/28/rand-paul-wins-2015-cpac-straw-poll|title=Rand Paul wins 2015 CPAC straw poll|publisher=[[Fox News]]|access-date=March 1, 2015|date=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rand Paul wins CPAC straw poll, with Scott Walker a close second|journal=The Washington Post|date=February 28, 2015|last=Cha|first=Ariana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/28/rand-paul-wins-cpac-straw-poll-narrowly-topping-walker|access-date=March 2, 2015|quote="A candidate's popularity with the Conservative Political Action Conference hasn't necessarily been a great predictor of his or her success with the larger GOP electorate, as attendees tend to have a stronger libertarian bent than the Republican majority."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Senator Rand Paul wins straw poll in boost to 2016 presidential prospects|journal=Reuters|date=February 28, 2015|last=Holland|first=Steve|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/01/us-randpaul-idUSKBN0LW0YY20150301|access-date=March 2, 2015 |quote="Whether the victory for Paul will have long-lasting benefit is unclear since his libertarian views may not have broad appeal in the Republican Party."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" and that the conservative movement has never been about rich people or privilege, "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obamacare' under attack as conservatives eye 2016|url=https://news.yahoo.com/obamacare-under-attack-conservatives-eye-2016-200658669--election.html|agency=Associated Press|access-date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled "Hillary's Losers" which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from [[Hillary Clinton]]. Clinton was [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|also a candidate for President]] and eventually won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party's nomination]], going on to lose to [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/7/rand-paul-clinton-democrats-became-hillarys-losers|title=Rand Paul: 'Clinton Democrats' became 'Hillary's losers' during election landslide|publisher=Washington Times|access-date=February 4, 2015|date=November 7, 2014|last=Sherfinski|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor [[Steve Beshear]]'s veto can be overridden with a simple majority).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-obscure-kentucky-contests-that-could-alter-rand-paul-s-2016-plans-20140814|title=The Obscure Kentucky Contests That Could Alter Rand Paul's 2016 Plans|publisher=National Journal|date=August 14, 2014|access-date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/02/will-rand-paul-have-to-risk-his-senate-s|title=Will Rand Paul Have to Risk His Senate Seat for the Presidency?|publisher=Reason.com|date=September 2, 2014|access-date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/11/04/3520134_palumbo-westrom-and-benvenuti.html|title=Democrats maintain control of Kentucky House of Representatives|publisher=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=November 4, 2014|access-date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/11/04/democrats-hold-kentucky-house-a-minor-blow-to-rand-pauls-presidential-hopes/|title=Democrats hold Kentucky House, a minor blow to Rand Paul's presidential hopes|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 6, 2014|date=November 4, 2014|first=Reid|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/2016-elections-rand-paul-112629.html|title=Kentucky looks at primary change that would help Rand Paul|publisher=Politico|date=November 5, 2014|access-date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.&lt;ref name="McConnellCaucus"&gt;{{cite news|date=February 24, 2015|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/02/24/mitch-mcconnell-backs-rand-pauls-bid-to-run-for-both-senate-white-house/|title=Mitch McConnell Backs Rand Paul's Bid to Run for Both Senate, White House|first=Janet|last=Hook|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=February 26, 2015|quote=In a shift first reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader, a McConnell aide said the senator had decided to support Mr. Paul's proposal that the Kentucky GOP establish a presidential selection caucus in March separate from the state's May primary for other offices.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2015, Paul generated controversy by suggesting that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should have the freedom to make that decision for their children. In an interview with [[CNBC]] on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children.

===2017 assault on Paul===
On November 3, 2017, Paul was assaulted by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (then aged 59), a retired [[anesthesiologist]]. Paul, who is deaf in one ear, was wearing [[noise-cancelling headphones]] while mowing his lawn, enabling Boucher to blindside Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/politics/behind-rand-pauls-broken-ribs-a-trivial-dispute-lawyer-says.html|date=November 6, 2017|title=Is Landscaping Drama at the Root of Rand Paul's Assault?|publisher=[[New York Times]]|first1=Nicholas|last1=Fandos|first2=Noah|last2=Weiland|first3=Jonathan|last3=Martin|quote=Because Mr. Paul was wearing sound-muting earmuffs, he did not realize Mr. Boucher was coming, according to one of the Kentucky Republicans and a friend familiar with the altercation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boucher was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Paul sustained five broken ribs, of which three were displaced fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/06/the-attack-on-sen-rand-paul-just-keeps-getting-stranger-and-stranger|title=Analysis – 'A disturbed person': The mystery behind the attack on Rand Paul grows, as Paul's side weighs in|first=Aaron|last=Blake|date=November 9, 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoreSerious"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Brandon|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|title=Sen.

Voter records from March 2017 showed Boucher registered as a Democrat, but his attorney, Matthew Baker, said there was no political motivation for the assault, descripting it as "a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial".&lt;ref name="MoreSerious"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect in attack on Sen.

'''Gaidinliu''' (26 January 1915 – 17 February 1993)  was a Rongmei [[Naga people|Naga]] spiritual and political leader who led a revolt against [[British rule in India|British rule]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Kusumlata2002"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kusumlata Nayyar | title=Rani Gaidinliu | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Mm6puVRqGAC | accessdate=12 June 2013 | year=2002 | publisher=Ocean Books | isbn=978-81-88322-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13, she joined the [[Heraka]] religious movement of her cousin [[Haipou Jadonang]]. The movement later turned into a political movement seeking to drive out the British from [[Manipur]] and the surrounding [[Naga people|Naga]] areas. Within the Heraka faith, she came to be considered an incarnation of the Goddess Cherachamdinliu.&lt;ref name="Arkotong2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=Arkotong Longkumer | title=Reform, Identity and Narratives of Belonging: The Heraka Movement in Northeast India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6HR3bjokSUC&amp;pg=PA176 | accessdate=12 June 2013 | date=4 May 2010 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-8264-3970-3 | pages=162–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 at the age of 16, and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] met her at Shillong Jail in 1937, and promised to pursue her release. Nehru gave her the title of "Rani" ("Queen"), and she gained local popularity as '''Rani Gaidinliu'''.

She was released in 1947 after [[Partition of India|India's independence]], and continued to work for the upliftment of her  people. An advocate of the ancestral Naga religious practices, she staunchly resisted the conversion of Nagas to Christianity. She was honoured as a freedom fighter and was awarded a [[Padma Bhushan]] by the Government of India.

== Early life ==

Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915 at Nungkao (or Longkao) village in the present-day Tousem sub-division of [[Tamenglong District]], Manipur. She was from the [[Rongmei]] tribe (also known as Kabui). She was the fifth of eight children, including six sisters and a younger brother, born to Lothonang Pamei and Kachaklenliu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-north-east.com/2011/07/rani-gaidinliu-true-freedom-fighter.html Rani Gaidinliu – the true freedom fighter], ''India-north-east.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The family belonged to the ruling clan of the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jan3012/state07 97th birth anniversary of Rani Gaidinliu observed]. Assam Tribune, 30 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She did not have a formal education due to the lack of schools in the area.&lt;ref name="Outlook_2005"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?228368 The Rani Of The Nagas] by Pritam Sengupta. Outlook, 22 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As Haipou Jadonang's disciple ==

In 1927, when she was just 13, Gaidinliu joined the ''[[Heraka]]'' movement of her cousin [[Haipou Jadonang]], who had emerged as a prominent local leader. Jadonang's movement was a revival of the Naga tribal religion. It also aimed to end the British rule and establish the self-rule of the Nagas (''Naga Raj''). It attracted a number of followers from the Zeliangrong tribes (the [[Zeme Naga|Zeme]], [[Liangmei Naga|Liangmai]] and [[Rongmei Naga|Rongmei]]). With the arrival of guns from [[Cachar]], it turned into an armed rebellion against the British policies of forced labour and ruthless oppression.

Persuaded by Jadonang's ideology and principles, Gaidinliu became his disciple and a part of his movement against the British. In three years, by the age of 16, she became a leader of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces fighting against the British rulers.

== Rebellion and incarceration ==

After Jadonang was arrested and hanged by the British in 1931, Gaidinliu emerged as his spiritual and political heir.&lt;ref name="SSShashi1996"&gt;{{cite book | author=S. S. Shashi | title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Q4wAQAAIAAJ | accessdate=12 June 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Anmol Publications | isbn=978-81-7041-859-7 | page  = 1270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She openly rebelled against the British rule, exhorting the Zeliangrong people not to pay taxes. She received donations from the local Nagas, many of whom also joined her as volunteers. The British authorities launched a manhunt for her. She evaded arrest by the police, moving across villages in what are now Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. The Governor of [[Colonial Assam|Assam]] dispatched the 3rd and 4th battalions of the [[Assam Rifles]] against her, under the supervision of the [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills]] Deputy Commissioner JP Mills. Monetary rewards were declared for information leading to her arrest: this included a declaration that any village providing information on her whereabouts will get a 10-year tax break. Her forces engaged the Assam Rifles in armed conflicts in the North Cachar Hills (16 February 1932) and the Hangrum village (18 March 1932).

In October 1932, Gaidinliu moved to the Pulomi village, where her followers started building a wooden fortress. While the fortress was under construction, an Assam Rifles contingent headed by Captain MacDonald launched a surprise attack on the village on 17 October 1932. Gaidinliu, along with her followers, was arrested without any resistance near the Kenoma village. Gaidinliu denied that she had any role in the attack on the Hangrum post of the Assam Rifles or the construction of the fort.&lt;ref name="Arkotong2010"/&gt; In December 1932, her followers from the Leng and the Bopungwemi villages murdered the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] [[chowkidar]] (watchman) of the Lakema Inspection Bungalow in the Naga Hills, suspecting him to be the informer who led to her arrest. Gaidinliu was taken to [[Imphal]], where she was convicted on the charges of murder and abetment of murder after a 10-month trial. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] by the Political Agent's Court for abetment of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/historyofthefron035444mbp History Of the Frontier Areas Bordering On Assam 1883–1941] by Sir Robert Reid, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her associates were either executed or jailed.&lt;ref name="Outlook_2005"/&gt;

From 1933 to 1947 she served time at the [[Guwahati]], [[Shillong]], [[Aizawl]] and [[Tura, Meghalaya|Tura]] jails. Many rebels proclaimed her and Jadonang to be their inspiration in refusing to pay taxes to the British. However, her movement declined after the last of her followers, Dikeo and Ramjo, were arrested in 1933. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] met her at the Shillong Jail in 1937 and he promised to pursue her release. His statement, published in the [[Hindustan Times]], described Gaidinliu as a daughter of the hills and he gave her the title 'Rani' or Queen of her people. Nehru wrote to the British [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Lady Astor]] to do something for the release of Rani Gaidinliu but the [[Secretary of State for India]] rejected her request stating that trouble may rise again if Rani was released.

== Life in independent India ==

After the [[Interim Government of India]] was set up in 1946, Rani Gaidinliu was released on [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] Nehru's orders from Tura jail, having spent 14 years in various prisons. She continued to work for the upliftment of her people after her release. She stayed at Vimrap village of [[Tuensang]] with her younger brother Marang till 1952. In 1952, she was finally allowed to move back to her native village of Longkao. In 1953, Prime Minister Nehru visited Imphal where Rani Gaidinliu met and conveyed to him the gratitude and goodwill of her people. Later she met Nehru in [[Delhi]] to discuss the development and welfare of Zeliangrong people.

Gaidinliu was opposed to the [[Naga National Council]] (NNC) insurgents, who advocated secessionism from India. Instead, she campaigned for a separate Zeliangrong territory within the Union of India.&lt;ref name="Arkotong2010"/&gt;{{rp|147}} The rebel Naga leaders criticized Gaidinliu’s movement for the integration of Zeliangrong tribes under one administrative unit. They were also opposed to her working for the revival of the traditional Naga religion of animism or ''[[Heraka]]''. The NNC leaders considered her actions an obstacle to their own movement. The [[Nagaland Baptist Church Council|Baptist]] leaders deemed the ''Heraka'' revival movement anti-Christian and she was warned of serious consequences if she were not to change her stand. In order to defend the ''Heraka'' culture and to strengthen her position, she went underground in 1960.&lt;ref name="Amit1976"&gt;{{cite book | author=Amit Kumar Nag | title=Rani Gaidinliu: A Study of the Jadonang Movement of the Nagas | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNgzAAAAMAAJ | accessdate=12 June 2013 | year=1976 | publisher=Tribal Mirror Publications | page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She organized a private army of about a thousand men equipped rifles to defend and press for her demand for a single [[Zeliangrong|Zeliangrong district]]. In response to [[Angami Zapu Phizo|Phizo]]'s declaration of the "Naga Federal Government", she set up her own quasi-administration named the "Zeliangrong Government of Rani Party". In 1964, the overground Zeliangrong leaders in consultation with underground leaders led by Rani Gaidinliu, demanded "a separate Zeliangrong Administrative Unit or Political Unit" within the [[Union of India]]. On 29 January 1965, her followers kidnapped and killed nine Naga rebels from the Ngulong village of the Kohima district, causing great uproar.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

In 1966, after six years of hard underground life in old age, under an agreement with the [[Government of India]], Rani Gaidinliu came out from her jungle hideout to work for the betterment of her people through peaceful, democratic and non-violent means. She went to Kohima on 20 January 1966, and met the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in Delhi on 21 February 1966, demanding the creation of a separate Zeliangrong administrative unit. On 24 September 320 of her followers surrendered at Henima. Some of them were absorbed into the [[Nagaland Police|Nagaland Armed Police]].

During her stay at [[Kohima]], she was conferred "Tamrapatra Freedom Fighter Award" in 1972, the [[Padma Bhushan]] (1982)&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda Seva Award]] (1983).

== Death ==
[[File:Rani Gaidinliu 1996 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Gaidinliu on a 1996 stamp of India]]
In 1991, Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace Longkao, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=345%3Arani-gaidinliu&amp;catid=26%3Aaugust-&amp;Itemid=8 Rani Gaidinliu].

E-pao.net. Retrieved on 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Governor of Manipur]], [[Chintamani Panigrahi]], the Home Secretary of Nagaland, officials from Manipur and many people from all parts of the [[North-East India|North Eastern region]] attended her funeral at her native village. In Imphal, the [[Chief Minister of Manipur]] R.K. Dorendro Singh, Deputy Chief Minister, [[Rishang Keishing]] and others paid floral tributes and a general holiday was declared by the [[Government of Manipur|State Government]].

Rani Gaidinliu was also conferred the ''[[Birsa Munda]] Award'' posthumously. The [[Government of India]] issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996.  The Government of India issued a commemorative coin in her honour in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/pm-narendra-modi-honours-legendary-freedom-fighter-from-north-east Commemorative Coin]. Indianexpress.com. Retrieved on 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Because of the Heraka movement's hostility towards Christianity, Gaidinliu's heroics were not acknowledged highly among the Nagas, most of whom had converted to Christianity by the 1960s. The [[Naga nationalism|Naga nationalist]] groups don't recognize her either, because she was considered close to the Government of India. When the Hindu nationalist [[Sangh Parivar]] aligned with the Heraka movement in the 1970s, the perception that she was a promoter of Hinduism grew stronger among the Christian Nagas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rani-gaidinliu-a-naga-queen-and-the-spin-machine/article1-1358573.aspx |title=Rani Gaidinliu: A Naga queen and BJP's spin machine |author=Rahul Karmakar |date=14 June 2015 |newspaper=Hindustan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, when the Central government and [[T. R. Zeliang]]'s state government decided to construct a Gaidinliu memorial hall, several civil society organizations in the [[Nagaland]] state opposed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Nagaland-Outfit-Joins-Chorus-Against-Rani-Memorial/2015/08/23/article2988745.ece1 |title=Nagaland Outfit Joins Chorus Against Rani Memorial |date=23 August 2015 |author=Prasanta Mazumdar |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingpin Act sanction==
On 24 March 2010, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] sanctioned Hernánez Lechuga under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]], sometimes referred to simply as the "Kingpin Act", for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty three other international criminals and ten foreign entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESIGNATIONS PURSUANT TO  THE FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN  DESIGNATION ACT|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/narco_designations_kingpin.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=28 May 2014|page=11|date=15 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025153/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/narco_designations_kingpin.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from business activities with him, and froze all his assets in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act|url=http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=28 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528053616/http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|page=1|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
He was apprehended in [[Córdoba, Veracruz]] on 12 December 2011, and was believed to have controlled operations for [[Los Zetas]] in over 10 states in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='El Lucky' dirigía operaciones de 'Los Zetas' en 10 entidades del país|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/13/el-lucky-dirigia-operaciones-de-los-zetas-en-10-entidades-del-pais|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=CNN Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one of his bodyguards was killed; authorities also found 133 rifles, five grenade launchers, 29 grenades and 36 pistols at the scene of the raid.

'''Robert Lee Park''' (born January 16, 1931) is an American [[emeritus]] [[professor]] of [[physics]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and a former director of public information at the Washington office of the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name=APA-PPDirector&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200607/bob-park.cfm|title=What's New: The end of an era|publisher=American Physical Society | newspaper=APS News | volume=15 | issue=7 | date=July 2006 | accessdate=2009-01-10 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Park is most noted for his critical commentaries on [[alternative medicine]] and [[pseudoscience]], as well as his criticism of how legitimate science is distorted or ignored by the media, some scientists, and [[public policy]] advocates as expressed in his book ''[[Voodoo Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sherman | first = M | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/exposing-fools-gladly | title = Exposing Fools Gladly | publisher = American Scientist | date = 2000-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also noted for his preference for robotic over manned space exploration.&lt;ref name="wn061606"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN06/wn061606.html#2 | first=Robert L. | last=Park | title=What's New: Doomsday: Stephen Hawking Explains Why We Must Colonize Space | publisher=University of Maryland | date=2006-06-16 | accessdate=2009-01-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808121730/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN06/wn061606.html#2 | archivedate=2008-08-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Park was born in 1931 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  His father was a lawyer and a farmer in southern [[Texas]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes2000"/&gt; and Park had originally intended to attend law school himself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/oral-history-interview-with-robert-park-2001-march-4-and-7/oclc/881393559|title=Oral history interview with Robert Park,|last=Park|first=Robert L|last2=McCray|first2=Patrick|date=2001|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1951 and served (among other places) at [[Walker Air Force Base]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]] until 1956.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;  When the Air Force sent him to [[radar]] school, he discovered a passion for physics.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2000"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5D61639F93AA15757C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=health | title=A Claim-Buster by Calling; From U.F.O.

==Academic career==
Park obtained  his bachelor's and master's degrees in [[physics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1958 and 1960, and his Ph.D. in physics at [[Brown University]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/people/faculty/cv/ParkCV.pdf | title=Curriculum Vitae: Robert L. Park | year=2003 | publisher=University of Maryland | accessdate=2009-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his graduate work he was associated with physicist [[Harrison E. Farnsworth]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with whom he co-authored several papers.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Park spent almost a decade working as a member of the technical staff, and later director of the Surface Physics Division, at Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. government weapons research laboratory.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1974, Park took a faculty position at the University of Maryland physics department, where he remained until retirement.  He was director of UMD's Center of Materials Research from 1975 to 1978 and chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1978 to 1982.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He is a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the [[American Physical Society]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[American Vacuum Society]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Public policy work==
From 1983 until 2006, he was director of public information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society. In this role (which he established), he engaged politicians and the press on matters of science and public policy.  The Washington office now employs six people and Park continues in an advisory capacity.&lt;ref name=APA-PPDirector/&gt; He has been seen in the media as an outspoken [[human versus robotic spaceflight|critic of human spaceflight]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes200509"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/22/opinion/22park.html | title=Opinion: The Dark Side of the Moon | first=Robert L. | last=Park | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 16, 2006 | issn=0362-4331 | accessdate=2009-01-10 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; efforts to [[space colonization|colonize space]],&lt;ref name="wn061606"/&gt; and the prototype U.S. [[National Missile Defense]] (as well as its predecessor [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]]).&lt;ref name="wn112787"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN87/wn112787.html | first=Robert L. | last=Park | title=What's New | publisher=University of Maryland | date=1987-11-27 | accessdate=2009-01-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704142054/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN87/wn112787.html | archivedate=2008-07-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular writing==
Park writes a column, ''[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/ What's New]'', which appears on the [[University of Maryland]]'s website. It features discussions on topics such as science news, space exploration, energy, the government in science, pseudoscience, alternative medicine, the [[creation-evolution controversy]],&lt;ref name="wn081889-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN89/wn081889.html|first=Robert L.|last=Park|title=What's New: Pathological Science, Pseudo-Science and "Creation" Science|publisher=University of Maryland|date=1989-08-18|accessdate=2009-01-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041041/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN89/wn081889.html|archivedate=2008-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="wn051702-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn051702.html#3|first=Robert L.|last=Park|title=What's New: Nuclear Posture Review: Senate Hearing Takes Up The Debate|publisher=University of Maryland|date=2002-05-17|accessdate=2009-01-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401035608/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn051702.html#3|archivedate=2009-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park has also expressed his opinion that [[Wikipedia]] is a target for misuse by the "purveyors of [[pseudoscience]]",&lt;ref name="wn032307-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN07/wn032307.html#3| first=Robert L.|last=Park | title=Wikipedia: Has a beautiful idea fallen victim to human nature?|publisher=What's New By Bob Park|date=2007-03-23|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he has also stated that he finds the site to be both indispensable and "cool".&lt;ref name="wn032307-4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN09/wn082809.html|first=RL|last=Park|title=What's New:Wikipedia: It's Still a Beautiful Idea, but Maybe Not Perfect|publisher=University of Maryland|date=2009-08-28|accessdate=2009-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003518/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN09/wn082809.html|archivedate=2009-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 Park gave a public lecture at [[Dartmouth College]] on [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/news/public.lecture.abstract.html | title=Abstract: The Last Endangered Species: Population Dynamics on a Finite Planet | publisher=Dartmouth College | date=2009-02-19 | accessdate=2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/news/colloquium.archives/park_2.19.09.pdf | title=Presentation Notes: The Last Endangered Species: Population Dynamics on a Finite Planet | publisher=Dartmouth College | date=2009-02-19 | accessdate=2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for the distribution of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], "arguably the most important technological development in history", to reduce [[total fertility rate|fertility rates]] in [[developing country|developing nations]].  Park has criticized [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [[Trotter Prize (Texas A&amp;M)|Trotter Prize]] for being awarded to [[creationism|creationist]] and [[intelligent design]] advocate [[William A. Dembski]], whom Park calls "one of the nation's top [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]]", for inappropriately forcing religion and science together.&lt;ref name=Trotter&gt;{{Cite web | last = Park | first = RL | title = 2005 Trotter Prize: An Award for Overlapping the Magisteria | website = What's New by Bob Park | date = 2005-04-08 | url = http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN05/wn040805.html | accessdate = 2010-08-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100601173839/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN05/wn040805.html | archivedate = 2010-06-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
In 2000 Park published the book ''[[Voodoo Science]]'', which addressed and criticized topics such as [[alternative medicine]], [[telepathy]] and [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref name=Park2000&gt;{{Cite book |year=2000 |author=Park, Robert L |title=Voodoo Science: The road from foolishness to fraud |place=Oxford, U.K. &amp; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-860443-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzCK6-Kqs6QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22voodoo+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 November 2010 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Science fiction author [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]] reviewed the book for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', criticizing it for citing news stories as the inspiration for his criticisms and using ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks against individuals criticized rather than performing a more thorough investigation of the topics, and speaking with the actual researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A55991-2000Jun24 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209023333/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A55991-2000Jun24 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 9, 2013 | title=Testing the Current | first=Charles | last=Platt | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=June 25, 2000 | issn=0190-8286 | accessdate=2009-01-10| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by a number of letters to the editor criticizing Platt for bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0007nn/000723nn.htm |title=LETTERS |newspaper=Washington Post |date=July 23, 2000 |page=X11 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000217/http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2000nn/0007nn/000723nn.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 Park published his second book, ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Robert L. | last=Park | title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science | location=Princeton | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | year=2010 | pages=240 | isbn=978-0-691-13355-3 }}  On-line [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8720.html excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "disjointed", unfavorably comparing it to [[Daniel Dennett]]'s ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'' for merely summarizing the existing arguments about science and religion.&lt;ref name = Amazon&gt;{{Cite book| title= Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science | publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |isbn = 978-0691133553|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Park commented that the reviewer for ''Publishers Weekly'' was offended at his assertion that "science is the only way of knowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN09/wn081409.html | last = Park | first = B | title = What's New by Bob Park - August 14th, 2009 | date = 2009-08-14 | accessdate = 2010-08-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100531193153/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN09/wn081409.html | archivedate = 2010-05-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Booklist]]'' reviewed the book positively for its lucid style, engaging with respected scientists who also hold strong religious faith and its internal logic against claims of supernatural revelation and [[New Age]] irrationality.  The same review noted that Park was less compelling in addressing his own [[atheism]], [[neurochemistry]] and its ability to address problems such as [[free will]].&lt;ref name = Amazon/&gt;

==Personal life==
Park is married to Gerry and lives in [[Adelphi, Maryland]].  They have two sons, Robert Jr. and Daniel, and three grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2000"/&gt;

On September 3, 2000, Park was hospitalized after being struck by a falling oak tree.&lt;ref name="KlassAward"/&gt; He later wrote about the experience in his book, ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''.

Park suffered a [[hemorrhagic stroke]] on March 17, 2013, which resulted in difficulty with reading, writing, and speech.  In a newsletter update to his readers dated July 12, 2013, Park wrote, "Many wonderful people are helping me, but recovery is a long process. I am optimistic that I will resume writing What’s New." Park stated that he will continue writing his newsletter because "the public is often misled by reports in the media and unaware of it".&lt;ref name=park71213&gt;Park, Robert L. (July 12, 2013).

'''Malcolm Scott Carpenter''' (May 1, 1925 – October 10, 2013), ([[Commander (United States)|Cmdr]], [[United States Navy|USN]]), was an American [[United States Navy|naval officer]] and [[United States naval aviator|aviator]], [[test pilot]], [[aeronautical engineer]], [[astronaut]], and [[aquanaut]].  He was one of the [[Mercury Seven|original seven]] astronauts selected for [[NASA]]'s [[Project Mercury]] in April 1959. Carpenter was the second American (after [[John Glenn]]) to [[Orbital spaceflight|orbit the Earth]] and the fourth American in [[Outer space|space]], following [[Alan Shepard]], [[Gus Grissom]], and Glenn.

==Early life==
Born May 1, 1925, in [[Boulder, Colorado]], Carpenter moved to [[New York City]] with his parents Marion Scott Carpenter and Florence Kelso Carpenter for the first 3 years of his life.&lt;ref name="nasa bio"/&gt; His father had been awarded a postdoctoral research post at [[Columbia University]]. In the summer of 1927, Scott returned to Boulder with his mother, then ill with [[tuberculosis]]. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in the family home at the corner of Aurora Avenue and Seventh Street, until his graduation from [[Boulder High School]] in 1943.&lt;ref name= Stoever&gt;{{cite book

It was claimed that Carpenter named his spacecraft "Aurora 7" after Aurora Avenue, but he denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=iBslf6SV2RU&amp;t=1m9s|title=Scott Carpenter JSC Oral History 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and earned the rank of [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#Second Class|Second Class Scout]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-558.pdf M. Scott Carpenter at scouting.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval service==
Upon graduation, he was accepted into the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] as an aviation cadet (V-12a) at [[Colorado College]] in [[Colorado Springs]]. After a year there, he spent six months in training at [[Saint Mary's College of California|St. Mary's]] Preflight School, [[Moraga, California]], and four months in primary flight training at [[Ottumwa, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="selfbio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carpenter|first1=Scott|title=About Scott|url=http://www.scottcarpenter.com/about_scott.htm|website=Mercury Astronaut Scott Carpenter|accessdate=27 December 2016|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War II]] ended before he was able to finish training and receive an overseas assignment, so the Navy released him from active duty.

He returned to Boulder in November 1945 to study [[aeronautical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. While at [[University of Colorado at Boulder|Colorado]] he joined [[Delta Tau Delta]] International Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delts.org/about/famousdelts.html Retrieved 2012-02-19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515135404/http://delts.org/about/famousdelts.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his senior year, he missed the final examination in [[heat transfer]], leaving him one requirement short of a degree. After his Mercury flight, the university granted him a [[Bachelor of Science]] because "his subsequent training as an astronaut [...] more than made up for the deficiency in the subject of heat transfer."&lt;ref name= Stoever/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''For Spacious Skies,'' (hardcover ed.), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the [[Korean War]], Carpenter was recruited by the [[United States Navy]]'s Direct Procurement Program (DPP). He reported to [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], [[Florida]] in the fall of 1949 for pre-flight and primary flight training. He earned his [[United States Aviator Badge|aviator wings]] on April 19, 1951, in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. He spent three months in the Fleet Airborne Electronics Training School, [[San Diego, California]], and was in a [[P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2 Neptune]] transitional training unit at [[Whidbey Island, Washington]], until October 1951. In November 1951, he was assigned to [[VP-6|Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6)]] based at [[Naval Air Station Barbers Point]], [[Hawaii]]. During his first tour of duty, on his first deployment, Carpenter flew on reconnaissance and [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) missions during the [[Korean War]]. Forward-based in [[Naval Air Facility Adak]], [[Alaska]], Carpenter then flew surveillance missions along the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Chinese coasts during his second deployment; designated as PPC (patrol plane commander) for his third deployment, [[Lieutenant, junior grade|LTJG]] Carpenter was based with his squadron in [[Guam]].&lt;ref name= Stoever/&gt;

Carpenter was then appointed to the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]], Class 13, at [[NAS Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]] in 1954. He continued at Patuxent until 1957, working as a [[test pilot]] in the Electronics Test Division; in this assignment Carpenter conducted flight test projects in a variety of Navy airplanes, including multi- and single-engine [[jet aircraft]] and [[Fastest propeller-driven aircraft|propeller-driven fighters]], [[Attack aircraft#Post-World War II|attack planes]], [[Maritime patrol aircraft#Post–World War II|patrol bombers]] and [[seaplanes]].&lt;ref name="selfbio" /&gt; In his next tour of duty was spent in [[Monterey, California]], at the Navy Line School. After attending the Naval Air Intelligence School, [[Washington D.C.]], for an additional eight months in 1957 and 1958, Carpenter was named [[Air Intelligence Officer]] for {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}.&lt;ref name= Stoever/&gt;

==NASA career==

[[File:Carpenter in White Room - GPN-2000-001442.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carpenter inspects the honeycomb material that will support the protective [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] of his ''Aurora 7'' spacecraft in 1962.]]

{{Main|Mercury-Atlas 7}}

After being chosen for [[Project Mercury]] in 1959, Carpenter, along with the other six astronauts, oversaw the development of the Mercury capsule. He served as backup pilot for [[John Glenn]], who flew the first U.S. orbital mission aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'' in February 1962. Carpenter, serving as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|capsule communicator]] on this flight, can be heard saying "Godspeed, John Glenn" on the recording of Glenn's liftoff.

When [[Deke Slayton]] was withdrawn on medical grounds from Project Mercury's second manned orbital flight (which Slayton would have named ''Delta 7''), Carpenter was assigned to replace him. He flew into space on May 24, 1962, atop the [[Mercury-Atlas 7]] [[rocket]] for a three-orbit science mission that lasted nearly five hours. His ''Aurora 7'' spacecraft attained a maximum altitude of {{convert|164|mi|km}} and an orbital velocity of {{convert|17532|mi/h|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt;

[[File:Scott-Carpenter recovery NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|Carpenter in a water egress training exercise before his [[Mercury-Atlas 7]] mission]]

Carpenter performed five onboard experiments per the flight plan, and became the first American astronaut to eat solid food in space. He also identified the mysterious "fireflies" observed by Glenn during ''Friendship 7'' as  particles of frozen liquid loosened from the outside of the spacecraft, which he could produce by rapping on the wall near the window. He renamed them "frostflies".&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt;

Carpenter's performance in space was the subject of criticism and controversy.  NASA's 1989 official history of Project Mercury says that until the third pass over Hawaii, [[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.]] (who directed the flight from Cape Canaveral) "considered this mission the most successful to date; everything had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of fuel",&lt;ref name=tno453&gt;''This New Ocean,'' p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; However, then problems worsened and Kraft wrote in his 2001 memoir (as quoted by ''New York Times'' in Carpenter's obituary) “He was completely ignoring our request to check his instruments. (…) I swore an oath that Scott Carpenter would never again fly in space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Carpenter, One of the Original Seven Astronauts, Is Dead at 88|publisher=''New York Times''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/scott-carpenter-mercury-astronaut-who-orbited-earth-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=2|date=October 10, 2013|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnoticed by ground control or pilot, however, the overexpenditure of fuel was caused by an intermittently malfunctioning pitch horizon scanner (PHS) that later malfunctioned at reentry. Still, NASA later reported that Carpenter had:

&lt;blockquote&gt;exercised his manual controls with ease in a number of [required] spacecraft maneuvers and had made numerous and valuable observations in the interest of space science. ... By the time he drifted near [[Hawaii]] on the third pass, Carpenter had successfully maintained more than 40 percent of his fuel in both the automatic and the manual tanks. According to mission rules, this ought to be quite enough hydrogen peroxide, reckoned Kraft, to thrust the capsule into the retrofire attitude, hold it, and then to reenter the atmosphere using either the automatic or the manual control system.&lt;ref name=tno453/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the retrofire event, the pitch horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to manually control his reentry, which caused him to overshoot the planned splashdown point by {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}}. ("The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [a component of the automatic control system] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event."&lt;ref&gt;Results of the Second United States Manned Orbital Spaceflight, NASA SP-6, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;) The PHS malfunction jerked the spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for {{convert|170|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the override button and accounted for another 15 to {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1}}, producing a {{convert|250|mi|km|sigfig=2|adj=on}} overshoot.&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt;

During [[reentry]], there was a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had actually survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off course. There are two accounts of the ''Aurora 7'' recovery, the first being that forty minutes after splashdown, Carpenter was located in his life raft, safe and in good health by Major Fred Brown under the command of the [[Puerto Rico Air National Guard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sgt. Ramon Alonso, ed., ''Puerto Rico Air National Guard: Forty Five Years of History, 1947–1992''. Centro Grafico del Caribe Inc., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and recovered three hours later by the {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}},&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt; and the second being that a P-2 Neptune from [[VP-18|Patrol Squadron 18]] flying out of [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station|Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was the first to sight and mark Carpenter's position.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Postflight analysis described the PHS malfunction as "mission critical" but noted that the pilot "adequately compensated" for "this anomaly ... in subsequent inflight procedures",&lt;ref&gt;Results of the Second United States Manned Orbital Spaceflight, NASA SP-6, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; confirming that backup systems—human pilots—could succeed when automatic systems fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury|last1=Swenson Jr.|first1=Loyd|last2=Grimwood|first2=James|last3=Alexander|first3=Charles|chapter=Mercury Mission Accomplished

Scott was just glad to be around, and was physically fit to an amazing degree. But he screwed up his own Mercury flight by joyriding, not paying enough attention to the job, missing his retrofire cue and splashing down several hundred miles from the target area. It became pretty obvious that Scott would never fly in space again."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kraft, ''Flight: My Life in Mission Control'' (New York: Dutton, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; have revived the simmering controversy over who or what, exactly, was to blame for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon. Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much, if not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt;

Carpenter never flew another mission in space. After taking a leave of absence from the astronaut corps in the fall of 1963 to train for and participate in the Navy's [[SEALAB|SEALAB program]], Carpenter sustained a medically grounding injury to his left arm in a motorbike accident. After failing to regain mobility in his arm after two surgical interventions (in 1964 and 1967), Carpenter was ruled ineligible for spaceflight. He resigned from NASA in August 1967.&lt;ref name=Stoever/&gt; He spent the last part of his NASA career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future [[Extravehicular activity|spacewalks]].

==Personal life==

[[File:John Glenn and Scott Carpenter (14067533676).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Carpenter with John Glenn (left). The two were great friends]]

Carpenter was married four times, divorced three times, and had a total of seven children by three wives.

Carpenter married his first wife Rene Louise Price (born 1928) in 1948.  They had four children: Marc Scott (deceased), Kristen Elaine, Candace Noxon, and Robyn Jay.  By 1968, Carpenter and his wife had separated, with him living in California and Rene Carpenter having moved with their children to [[Washington, D.C.]]  The Carpenters divorced in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20065127,00.html | title=Ex-Astronaut Wife Rene Is the Carpenter in the News Now | publisher=People Magazine | date=April 7, 1975 | accessdate=July 2, 2015 | author=Martha Fay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Carpenter married his second wife Maria Roach, daughter of film producer [[Hal Roach]]. Together, they had two children: Matthew Scott and [[Nicholas Carpenter|Nicholas Andre]], who would later become a filmmaker.

In 1988, Carpenter married his third wife, Barbara Curtin.  Their marriage produced a son, Zachary Scott, when Carpenter was in his 60s.  The marriage ended in divorce a few years later.

In 1999, Carpenter married his fourth wife Patty Barrett, when he was 74.  They resided in [[Vail, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Carpenter Fast Facts|url=http://www.ksbw.com/news/Scott-Carpenter-Fast-Facts/-/1852/19747324/-/rsfxedz/-/index.html|publisher=CNN NewSource|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012041239/http://www.ksbw.com/news/Scott-Carpenter-Fast-Facts/-/1852/19747324/-/rsfxedz/-/index.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Carpenter suffered a [[stroke]] and, after hospitalization, was admitted to the Denver Hospice Inpatient Care Center.  He died on October 10, 2013 at the age of 88.  Carpenter was survived by his wife at the time of his death, six children, a granddaughter, and five step-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/scott-carpenter-obituary/167477300 | title=Scott Carpenter Obituary | publisher=Legacy.com | date=October 2013 | accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shantideva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: Śāntideva; {{zh|c=寂天}}; {{bo|t=ཞི་བ་ལྷ།|s=Zhiwa Lha}}; {{lang-mn|Шантидэва гэгээн}}; {{lang-vi|Tịch Thiên}}) was an 8th-century Indian [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] and scholar at [[Nalanda]]. He was an adherent of the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy of [[Nagarjuna]].

==Biography==
The ''Zhansi Lun'' of the [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] identifies two different individuals given the name "Shant inideva": their founder of the Avaivartika Sangha in the 6th century and a later Shantideva who studied at [[Nalanda]] in the 8th century and appears to be the source of the Tibetan biographies. Archaeological discoveries support this thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahsid |first=More Harunur |year=2012 |chapter=Deva Dynasty |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Deva_Dynasty |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shantideva.net/index.html Bodhicaryāvatāra Historical Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306210334/http://www.shantideva.net/index.html |date=March 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Tibet]]an sources of the life of Shantideva are the historians [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] and [[Taranatha|Tāranātha]]. Recent scholarship has brought to light a short Sanskrit life of Shantideva in a 14th-century Nepalese manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pezzali |first=Amalia |title=Śāntideva Mystjique buddhiste des VII et VIIIe siècles |location=Florence |publisher=Vallechi Edtore |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accessible account that follows the Butön closely can be found in Kunzang Pelden, ''The Nectar of Manjushri's speech''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Shantideva |title=The Way of the Bodhisattva |others=translated by the Padmakara Translation Group |location=Boston l|publisher=Shambala |year=1997 |isbn=1-57062-253-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantideva was born in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurastra]] (in modern [[Gujarat]]), son of King Kalyanavarman, and he went by the name Śantivarman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author=Kunzang Pelden |title=The Nectar of Manjushri's Speech. A Detailed Commentary on Shantideva's Way of the Bodhisattva |page=17 |publisher=Shambala Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59030-439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pema Chödrön]], "Shantideva was not well liked at Nalanda."&lt;ref name="chodron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutting Ties: The Fruits of Solitude|url=http://tricycle.org/magazine/cutting-ties-fruits-solitude |publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|date=|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Apparently he was one of those people who didn't show up for anything, never studying or coming to practice sessions. His fellow monks said that his three “realizations” were eating, sleeping, and shitting.&lt;ref name="chodron"/&gt;}}

After being goaded into giving a talk to the entire university body, Shantideva delivered ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra|The Way of the Bodhisattva]]''.&lt;ref name="chodron"/&gt;

The ''Śikṣāsamuccaya'' (“Training Anthology”) is a prose work in nineteen chapters. It is organized as a commentary on twenty-seven short mnemonic verses known as the ''Śikṣāsamuccaya Kārikā''. It consists primarily of quotations (of varying length) from sūtras, authoritative texts considered to be the [[buddhavacana|word of the Buddha]] — generally those sūtras associated with Mahāyāna tradition, including the ''[[Samadhiraja Sutra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/santideva/ |author=Amod Lele |title=Śāntideva |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bodhicaryavatara''===
Shantideva is particularly renowned as the author of the ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]''. A variety of English translations exist, sometimes glossed as "A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life" or "Entering the Path of Enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Way of the Bodhisattva: A Translation of the Bodhicharyavatara | translator=the Padmakara Translation Group | publisher=Shambhala Publications | date=2003 | isbn=1590300572}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a long poem describing the process of enlightenment from the first thought to full [[buddhahood]] and is still studied by [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhists today.

An introduction to and commentary on the ''Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra'' by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] called ''A Flash of Lightning in the Dark of Night'' was printed in 1994. A commentary on the Patience chapter was provided by the Dalai Lama in ''Healing Anger'' (1997), and his commentaries on the Wisdom chapter can be found in ''Practicing Wisdom'' (2004). [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Khenpo_Kunzang_Palden Kunzang Palden] has written a commentary based on that given by [[Patrul Rinpoche]], translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. Patrul Rinpoche was a wandering monk of great scholarship, who dedicated his life to the propagation of the ''Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Kunzang Palden |title=The Nectar of Manjushri's Speech.

As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nourr|first1=Sarah|title=Happy Birthday, Sherman Alexie|url=http://theartspartnership.net/artspulse/happy-birthday-sherman-alexie/|website=The Arts Partnership|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]] tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of [[Colville tribe|Colville]], [[Choctaw]], [[Spokane people|Spokane]] and [[European American]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="DLB 278"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quirk |first=Sarah A. |title=Sherman Alexie (7 October 1966–) |journal=Dictionary of Literary Biography |year=2003 |volume=278 |series=Seventh |pages=3–10 |url=http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/DLBC_Online/iulib_iupui/BK1560155002 |accessdate=2012-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of [[Russians|Russian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Sherman_Alexie/status/206980413242097665|title=@Sherman_Alexie: Elizabeth Warren is as close to her Indian ancestors as I am to my 19th-century Russian fur-trapping great-grandfather.|last=Alexie|first=Sherman|date=May 27, 2012|website=Twitter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001204755/https://twitter.com/Sherman_Alexie/status/206980413242097665|archive-date=October 1, 2013|dead-url=yes|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexie was born with [[hydrocephalus]], a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the nasal cavity.&lt;ref name="About Alexie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cline|first=Lynn|title=About Sherman Alexie|journal=Ploughshares|year=2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=197|url=https://www.pshares.org/issues/winter-2000/about-sherman-alexie-profile| accessdate=2016-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or [[mental disabilities]] if he survived.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt; Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but
had other side effects.&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt;

His parents were [[alcoholics]], though his mother achieved [[sobriety]]. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a [[clerk]] at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs.&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt;

Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids and endured abuse he described as "torture" from white [[nun]]s who taught there. They called him "The Globe" because his head was larger than usual, due to suffering hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and [[bedwetting]]; he had to take strong drugs to control them.&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Authors and Artists for Young Adults |year=1999 |volume=28 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1603000488&amp;mode=view&amp;userGroupName=iulib_iupui&amp;jsid=f86b6cba6316c44135ea18270477b862 |accessdate=2012-04-08 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.&lt;ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Encyclopedia of World Biography |year=1998 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA148411809&amp;mode=view&amp;userGroupName=iulib_iupui&amp;jsid=44a2dc07cadd1e9faa807374a9050e8b |accessdate=2012-04-08 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school in [[Reardan, Washington]].&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt; The school was twenty-two miles off the reservation and Alexie was the only Native American student.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the [[basketball]] team, the [[Reardan High School]] Indians.&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt; He was elected as [[class president]] and participated as a member of the [[debate team]].&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt;

His successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to [[Gonzaga University]], a Roman Catholic university in [[Spokane]].&lt;ref name="About Alexie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; Originally, Alexie enrolled in the [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] program with hopes of becoming a doctor,&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="Artists 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sherman Alexie |journal=Authors and Artists for Young Adults |year=2011 |volume=85 |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1603001902&amp;mode=view&amp;userGroupName=iulib_iupui&amp;jsid=02b81ec66e363278407e6feeee50736 |accessdate=2012-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt;

In 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled at [[Washington State University]] (WSU),&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; where he took a creative writing course taught by [[Alex Kuo]], a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt; Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled ''Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back'', by [[Joseph Bruchac]]. Alexie said this book changed his life as it taught him "how to connect to non-Native literature in a new way".&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman Alexie Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conversation With Sherman Alexie|url=http://bluemesareview.org/issues/issue-26/a-conversation-with-sherman-alexie/|work=Blue Mesa Review|date=December 6, 2012| accessdate=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;

With his new appreciation of poetry, Alexie started working on what was published as his first collection, ''[[The Business of Fancydancing|The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems]]'', published in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Official Sherman Alexie website"&gt;[http://www.fallsapart.com/biography.html Official Sherman Alexie website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602092035/http://www.fallsapart.com/biography.html |date=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded a bachelor's degree from [[Washington State University]].&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt;

===Today===
In 2005, Alexie became a founding board member of [[Longhouse Media]], a non-profit organization that is committed to teaching filmmaking skills to Native American youth and using media for cultural expression and social change.  Alexie has long supported youth programs and initiatives dedicated to supporting at-risk Native youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longhousemedia.org/about.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702054102/http://longhousemedia.org/about.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 2, 2010|title=About Us: What is Longhouse Media?|website=Longhouse Media|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexie is married to Diane Tomhave, who is of [[Hidatsa]], [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]] heritage. They live in [[Seattle]] with their two sons.&lt;ref name="Official Sherman Alexie website"/&gt;

==Sexual harassment allegations ==
On February 28, 2018, Alexie published a statement regarding accusations of [[sexual harassment]] against him by several women, including author Litsa Dremousis, with whom he'd had a consensual affair in the past and who claimed numerous women had spoken to her about Alexie's behavior.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4391069-Sherman-Alexie-Statement.html Sherman Alexie Statement] contributed by Shirley Qiu, ''Seattle Times''. Dated February 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Dremousis' response initially appeared on her [[Facebook]] page and was subsequently reprinted in [[The Stranger (newspaper)|''The Stranger'']] on March 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first=Rich|last=Smith|url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/03/01/25869478/litsa-dremousis-responds-to-sherman-alexies-statement|title=Litsa Dremousis Responds to Sherman Alexie's Statement|newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|publisher=Index Newspapers, LLC|location=Seattle, Washington|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fallout from these accusations includes the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] renaming its Sherman Alexie Scholarship as the MFA Alumni Scholarship. The blog ''Native Americans in Children's Literature'' has deleted or modified all references to Alexie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Prachi|last=Gupta|url=https://jezebel.com/native-american-lit-community-warns-of-sexual-harassmen-1823320909|title=Native American Lit Community Warns of Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Sherman Alexie|website=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=February 27, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 it was reported that the [[American Library Association]], which had just awarded Alexie its [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me: A Memoir'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2018/02/manhattan-beach-you-dont-have-say-you-love-me-receive-2018-andrew-carnegie|title= 'Manhattan Beach,' 'You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,' receive 2018 Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction|website=ALA News|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reconsidering, and in March it was confirmed that Alexie had declined the award and was postponing the publication of a paperback version of the memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Vincent|last=Schilling|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/people/sherman-alexie-declines-carnegie-medal-publisher-postpones-paperback-wake-sexual-allegations/|title=Sherman Alexie Declines Carnegie Medal; Publisher Postpones Paperback|website=[[Indian Country Today]]|publisher=[[National Congress of American Indians]]|location=Washington DC|date=March 19, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Indian Library Association]] rescinded its 2008 Best [[Young Adult Book]] Award from Alexie for ''The Absolute True Diary of a Part Time Indian'', “to send an unequivocal message that Alexie’s actions are unacceptable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Kara|last=Yorio|url=https://www.slj.com/2018/03/industry-news/aila-rescinds-sherman-alexies-2008-ya-book-year-award/|title='AILA Rescinds Sherman Alexie’s 2008 YA Book of the Year Award'|magazine=[[School Library Journal]]|publisher=[[Media Source Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=March 21, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
[[File:Red-ink-alexie-matsunaga-2016-3730 (27727653451).jpg|thumb|Alexie reading at the launch of the [[RED INK International Journal of Indigenous Literature, Art, and Humanities]], at [[Arizona State University]] in 2016]]
Alexie's stories have been included in several short story anthologies, including ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' 2004, edited by [[Lorrie Moore]]; and ''[[Pushcart Prize]]'' XXIX of the Small Presses. Additionally, a number of his pieces have been published in various literary magazines and journals, as well as online publications.

===Themes===
Alexie's poetry, short stories and novels explore themes of despair, poverty, violence and alcoholism among the lives of Native American people, both on and off the reservation. They are lightened by wit and humor.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; According to Sarah A. Quirk from the ''Dictionary of Library Biography,'' Alexie asks three questions across all of his works: "What does it mean to live as an Indian in this time?  What does it mean to be an Indian man? Finally, what does it mean to live on an Indian reservation?"&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;  The protagonists in most of his literary works exhibit a constant struggle with themselves and their own sense of powerlessness in white American society.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

===Influences===
Alexie’s writings are meant to evoke sadness, but at the same time, he uses humor and pop culture that leave the readers with a sense of respect, understanding, and compassion.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;  Alexie’s influences for his literary works do not rely solely on traditional Indian forms. He "blends elements of popular culture, Indian spirituality, and the drudgery of poverty-ridden reservation life to create his characters and the world they inhabit," according to Quirk.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt; Alexie's work is laced with often startling humor. According to Quirk, he does this as a "means of cultural survival for American Indians&amp;mdash;survival in the face of the larger American culture's stereotypes of American Indians and their concomitant distillation of individual tribal characteristics into one pan-Indian consciousness."&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;

===Arizona HB 2281===
In 2012, [[Ethnic studies#Arizona ban|Arizona's HB 2281]] removed Alexie's works, along with those of others, from Arizona school curriculum. Alexie's response:

{{quote|Let's get one thing out of the way: Mexican immigration is an oxymoron. Mexicans are indigenous. So, in a strange way, I'm pleased that the racist folks of Arizona have officially declared, in banning me alongside Urrea, Baca, and Castillo, that their anti-immigration laws are also anti-Indian. I'm also strangely pleased that the folks of Arizona have officially announced their fear of an educated underclass. You give those brown kids some books about brown folks and what happens? Those brown kids change the world. In the effort to vanish our books, Arizona has actually given them [[Streisand effect|enormous power]]. Arizona has made our books sacred documents now.''&lt;ref&gt;rdsathene, [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/01/1060453/-Sherman-Alexie-Arizona-has-made-our-books-sacred-documents-now# "Sherman Alexie "Arizona has made our books sacred documents now."] ''Daily Kos'', February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Poetry===
Within a year of graduating from college, Alexie received the Washington State Arts Commission Poetry Fellowship and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Poetry Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ettlinger |first=Marian |title=Sherman Alexie |url=http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_american_lit/survey_american_lit_alexie.htm |publisher=Salem Press |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414135823/http://salempress.com/store/samples/survey_american_lit/survey_american_lit_alexie.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His career began with the publishing of his first two collections of poetry in 1992, entitled, ''I Would Steal Horses'' and ''The Business of Fancydancing.''&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt; In these poems, Alexie uses humor to express the struggles of contemporary Indians on reservations. Common themes include alcoholism, poverty and racism.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;  Although he uses humor to express his feelings, the underlying message is very serious.

''The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems (1992)'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/season/20/spokane-wa/appraisals/1992-sherman-alexie-inscribed-book--201502T07|title=The Business of Fancydancing - Stories and Poems (1992) BOOK APPRAISAL; Ken Sanders Rare Books, Salt Lake City, UT |first=Ken|last=Sanders|work=[[Antiques Roadshow]]|date=June 6, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; was well received, selling over 10,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; Alexie refers to his writing as "[[fancydancing]],"&lt;ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia" /&gt; a flashy, colorful style of competitive [[Pow wow]] dancing. Whereas older, traditional forms of Indian dance may be ceremonial and kept private among tribal members, the fancydance style was created by Native American veterans from [[World War II]] as a form of public entertainment.&lt;ref name="Alexie Encyclopedia" /&gt; Alexie compares the mental, emotional, and spiritual outlet that he finds in his writings to the vivid self-expression of the dancers.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; Leslie Ullman commented on ''The Business of Fancydancing'' in the ''Kenyon Review,'' writing that Alexie "weaves a curiously soft-blended tapestry of humor, humility, pride and metaphysical provocation out of the hard realities...: the tin-shack lives, the alcohol dreams, the bad luck and burlesque disasters, and the self-destructive courage of his characters."&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

Alexie's other collections of poetry include:
*''The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems'' (1992)
*''Old Shirts and New Skins'' (1993)&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

===Short stories===
Alexie published his first prose work, entitled ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]],'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt; The book consists of a series of short stories that are interconnected.  Several prominent characters are explored, and they have been featured in later works by Alexie.  According to Sarah A. Quirk, ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]]'' can be considered a [[bildungsroman]] with dual protagonists, "Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, moving from relative innocence to a mature level on experience."&lt;ref name="DLB 278" /&gt;

''[[Ten Little Indians (Alexie)|Ten Little Indians]]'' (2004) is a collection of "nine extraordinary short stories set in and around the Seattle area, featuring Spokane Indians from all walks of urban life," according to Christine C. Menefee of the ''School Library Journal''.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; In this collection, Alexie "challenges stereotypes that whites have of Native Americans and at the same time shows the Native American characters coming to terms with their own identities."&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

''[[War Dances]]'' is a collection of short stories, poems, and short works. It won the 2010 [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]].  The collection, however, received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

Other short stories by Alexie include:

===Novels===
In his first novel, ''[[Reservation Blues]]'' (1995), Alexie revisits some of the characters from ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]].'' Thomas Builds-the-Fire, Victor Joseph, and Junior Polatkin, who have grown up together on the Spokane Indian reservation, were teenagers in the short story collection. In ''Reservation Blues'' they are now adult men in their thirties.&lt;ref name=Klinkenborg&gt;{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg |first=Verlyn |title=America at the Crossroads: Life on the Spokane Reservation |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1100040017&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=iulib_iupui&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRG&amp;sw=w |accessdate=2012-04-05 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=June 18, 1995 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are now musicians and in a band together. Verlyn Klinkenborg of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a 1995 review of ''[[Reservation Blues]]'': "you can feel Alexie's purposely divided attention, his alertness to a divided audience, Native American and Anglo."&lt;ref name="Klinkenborg" /&gt; Klinkenborg says that Alexie is "willing to risk didacticism whenever he stops to explain the particulars of the Spokane and, more broadly, the Native American experience to his readers."&lt;ref name="Klinkenborg" /&gt;

''[[Indian Killer]]'' (1996) is a murder mystery set among Native American adults in contemporary [[Seattle]], where the characters struggle with urban life, mental health, and the knowledge that there is a serial killer on the loose. Characters deal with the racism in the University system, as well as in the community at large, where Indians are subjected to being lectured about their own culture by white professors who are actually ignorant of Indian cultures.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

Alexie's young adult novel, ''[[The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian]]'' (2007) is a coming-of-age story that began as a memoir of his life and family on the Spokane Indian reservation.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; The novel focuses on a fourteen-year-old Indian named Arnold Spirit. The novel is semi-autobiographical, including many events and elements of Alexie's life.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; For example, Arnold was born with hydrocephalus, and was teased a lot as a child. The story also portrays events after Arnold's transfer to Reardan High School, which Alexie attended.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; The novel received great reviews and continues to be a top seller. Bruce Barcott from the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' observed, "Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home."&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

''[[Flight (2007 novel)|Flight]]'' (2007) also features an adolescent protagonist. The narrator, who calls himself "Zits," is a fifteen-year-old orphan of mixed Native and European ancestry who has bounced around the foster system in Seattle. The novel centers around experiences of the past, as Zits experiences short windows into others' lives after he believes to be shot while committing a crime.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;

=== Memoir ===
Alexie's memoir, ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,'' was released by [[Hachette Book Group|Hachette]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sherman-alexie/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me/9780316396776/|title=You Don't Have to Say You Love Me|last=|first=|date=|website=Hachette Book Group|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudia Rowe]] of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote in June 2017 that the memoir "pulls readers so deeply into the author’s youth on the Spokane Indian Reservation that most will forget all about facile comparisons and simply surrender to Alexie’s unmistakable patois of humor and profanity, history and pathos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/sherman-alexies-brave-new-memoir-delves-into-his-childhood/|title=Sherman Alexie’s brave new memoir delves into his childhood|date=2017-06-19|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexie cancelled his book tour in support of ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me'' in July 2017 due to the emotional toll that promoting the book was taking. In September 2017, he decided to resume the tour, with some significant changes. As he related to Laurie Hertzel of [[Star Tribune|The Star Tribune]], “I’m not performing the book,” he said. “I’m getting interviewed. That’s a whole different thing.” He went on to add that he won’t be answering any questions that he doesn’t want to answer. “I’ll put my armor back on,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/writer-sherman-alexie-is-back-on-the-road-i-averted-a-crisis/443095923/|title=Writer Sherman Alexie is back on the road: 'I averted a crisis'|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
In 1998 Alexie broke barriers by creating the first all-Indian movie, ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]''.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; Alexie based the screenplay on his short story collection, ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]]'', and characters and events from a number of Alexie's works make appearances in the film.&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt;  ''Smoke Signals'' was directed by Chris Eyre, a [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne-Arapaho]] Indian filmmaker, and the entire production team and cast is Native American.&lt;ref name="Authors &amp; Artists" /&gt; The film tells the story of two young Indians, Victor Joseph ([[Adam Beach]]) and Thomas Builds the Fire ([[Evan Adams]]), who leave the reservation on a road trip to retrieve the body of Victor's dead father ([[Gary Farmer]]).&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; During their journey the characters' childhood is explored via flashbacks. The film took top honors at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Artists 2011" /&gt; It received an 86% and "fresh" rating from the online film database [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoke Signals|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/smoke_signals/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes| accessdate=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Business of Fancydancing]]'', written and directed by Alexie in 2002, explores themes of Indian identity, cultural involvement vs [[blood quantum]], living on the reservation or off it, and other issues around makes someone a "real Indian." The title refers to the protagonist's choice to leave the reservation and make his living performing for predominantly-white audiences. [[Evan Adams]], who plays Thomas Builds the Fire in "Smoke Signals", again stars, now as an urban gay man with a white partner. The death of a peer brings the protagonist home to the reservation, where he reunites with his friends from his childhood and youth. The film is unique in that Alexie hired an almost completely female crew to produce the film. Many of the actors improvised their dialogue, based on real events in their lives.

Other film projects include:

*''49?'' (writer, 2003)
*''The Exiles'' (presenter, 2008)
*''[[Sonicsgate]]'' (participant, 2009)

'''Stewart Edward White''' (12 March 1873 – September 18, 1946) was an American writer, novelist, and spiritualist. He was a brother of noted mural painter [[Gilbert White (painter)|Gilbert White]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], he attended [[Central High School (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Grand Rapids High School]], and earned degrees from [[University of Michigan]] (B.A., 1895; M.A., 1903).

From about 1900 until about 1922 he wrote fiction and non-fiction about adventure and travel, with an emphasis on natural history and outdoor living. Starting in 1922 he and his wife [[Elizabeth "Betty" Grant White]] wrote numerous books they say were received through [[Mediumship|channelling]] with spirits. They also wrote of their travels around the state of California. White died in [[Hillsborough, California]].

 |quote  =&lt;poem&gt;

Whenever you see a dust through the trees, you look first to make sure it is not raised by stray cattle.  Then when you are certain of your horse and man, you start a fire in the little stove.  That is the invariable rule in the mountains. The logic is simple, unanswerable, and correct.  The presence of the man argues that he has ridden from some distant point, for here all points are more or less distant; and the fact in turn proves that somewhat of exercise and space have intervened last he has eaten.  Therefore, no matter what the time of day, you feed him.  It works out like a mathematical formula. 
&lt;/poem&gt;|source =From "On Strangers", ''The Cabin'', 1911}}

==Writing==
White's books were popular at a time when America was losing its vanishing wilderness. He was a keen observer of the beauties of nature and human nature, yet could render them in a plain-spoken style. Based on his own experience, whether writing camping journals or Westerns, he included pithy and fun details about cabin-building, canoeing, logging, gold-hunting, and guns and fishing and hunting. He also interviewed people who had been involved in the fur trade, the California [[gold rush]] and other pioneers which provided him with details that give his novels verisimilitude. He salted in humor and sympathy for colorful characters such as canny Indian guides and "greenhorn" campers who carried too much gear. White also illustrated some of his books with his own photographs, while some of his other books were illustrated by artists, such as the American Western painter [[Fernand Lungren]] for "The Mountains" and "Camp and Trail". [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wrote that White was "the best man with both pistol and rifle who ever shot" at Roosevelt's rifle range at [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roosevelt|first=Theodore|title=Theodore Roosevelt: an autobiography|year=1913|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Long Rifle'' (1930), ''Folded Hills'' (1932), ''Ranchero'' (1933), and ''Stampede'' (1942) constitute ''The Saga of Andy Burnett,'' which follows a young Pennsylvania farm boy who escapes his overbearing step father by running away to the West with grandmother's blessing and "The Boone Gun", the original Kentucky rifle carried by [[Daniel Boone]]. He encounters mountain man Joe Crane, who becomes his mentor in the ways of survival in the wild. The remainder of the saga follows Andy as he moves west, ultimately settling in California, which is the setting of the last three books. The series incorporates actual events and characters from the time period in the narrative. The four stories were published as a posthumous volume, ''The Saga of Andy Burnett'', in 1947, and were adapted into several episodes of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' during 1957 and 1958, starring [[Jerome Courtland]] as Andy Burnett, and [[Jeff York]] (Mike Fink) as his friend and mentor Joe Crane. This series was in many ways a follow-up to Disney's much more successful ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]''.

==Honors==
In 1927 the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made White an ''Honorary Scout'', a new category of Scout created that same year.  This distinction was given to "American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...".  The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: [[Roy Chapman Andrews]]; [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]]; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]; [[Richard E. Byrd]]; [[George Kruck Cherrie]]; [[James L. Clark]]; [[Merian C. Cooper]]; [[Lincoln Ellsworth]]; [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]; [[George Bird Grinnell]]; [[Charles A. Lindbergh]]; [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]]; [[Clifford H. Pope]]; [[George P. Putnam]]; [[Kermit Roosevelt]]; [[Carl Rungius]]; [[Orville Wright]].&lt;ref name="time29aug1927"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 29, 1927 |title=Around the World |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,723029,00.html |accessdate= 2007-10-24 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wang Xiaoyun''' ({{zh|s=王小云 |t=王小雲 |p=Wáng Xiǎoyún}}; born 1966) is a Chinese [[cryptographer]] and computer scientist. She is a professor in the Department of Mathematics and System Science of [[Shandong University]] and an academician of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosec.sdu.edu.cn/2person_wangxiaoyun.htm Key Lab of Cryptologic Technology and Information Security], [[Shandong University]], retrieved 2015-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the rump session of [[CRYPTO]] 2004, she and co-authors demonstrated [[collision attack]]s against [[MD5]], [[SHA-0]] and other related hash functions. (A collision occurs when two distinct messages result in the same hash function output). They received a standing ovation for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/historical/collisions-but-sha1-secure.htm|title=Hash Function Update Due to Potential Weaknesses Found in SHA-1|publisher=[[RSA Laboratories]]|date=March 11, 2005|first=James|last=Randall|accessdate=2015-07-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005 it was reported that Wang and co-authors had found a method to find collisions in the [[SHA-1]] [[hash function]], which is used in many of today's mainstream security products.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/7-1-11/50336.html |title=Chinese Professor Cracks Fifth Data Security Algorithm |newspaper=[[The Epoch Times]] |date=January 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115033337/http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/7-1-11/50336.html |archivedate=January 15, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their attack is estimated to require less than 2&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; operations, far fewer than the 2&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; operations previously thought needed to find a collision in SHA-1. Their work was published at the CRYPTO '05 conference. In August 2005, an improved attack on SHA-1, discovered by Wang, [[Andrew Yao]] and [[Frances Yao]], was announced at the [[CRYPTO]] conference rump session. The time complexity of the new attack is claimed to be 2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Leyden|title=SHA-1 compromised further: Crypto researchers point the way to feasible attack|journal=[[The Register]]|date= August 19, 2005|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/19/sha-1_attack/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang was born in [[Zhucheng]], [[Shandong Province]]. She gained bachelor (1987), master (1990) and doctorate (1993) degrees at [[Shandong University]], and subsequently lectured in the [[mathematics]] department from 1993.&lt;ref name="tan kah kee"&gt;[http://www.tsaf.ac.cn/english/awarders/year/2006/1401.html Tan Kah Kee Award in Information Technological Sciences], Tan Kah Kee Science Award Foundation, 2006, retrieved 2015-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral advisor was [[Pan Chengdong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=134260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang was appointed assistant professor in 1995, and full professor in 2001. She became the [[Chen Ning Yang]] Professor of the [[Center for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="tan kah kee"/&gt;

'''William Frederick Elliot Eden''' (19 January 1782 – January 1810) was a [[British people|British]] soldier, politician and [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]], serving as [[Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer|Teller of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref name=peerage-WFEE&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon.

==Life==
Born into the influential Eden family, one of fourteen children, William was the eldest son of [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]], later to become the 1st Baron of Auckland, and his wife Eleanor Elliot, daughter of [[Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet, of Minto|Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet]].&lt;ref name=links&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon.

==Career==
Eden became MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1806|1806 general election]], the same constituency as his father had represented. In the same year he was given the position of [[Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer]].

Eden was also a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[85th Regiment of Foot (Westminster Volunteers)|Westminster Volunteers]].

==Death==
The drowned body of Eden was found by a [[barge]]man, William Western, in the [[River Thames]], [[London]], on 25 February 1810. He had been missing since 19 January. Although he was thought to have committed [[suicide]] on that day, the inquest jury returned a verdict of "Found drowned in the river, but by what means it came there, there was no evidence before the Jury." William Western received £50 for finding the body.
His brother, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|George Eden]], succeeded their father in the [[Baron Auckland|Auckland Barony]]. William Eden was unmarried.

The '''Yara-ma-yha-who''' is a [[legendary creature]] found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]]. According to legend, the creature resembles a little frog-like man with red fur, a very big head, a large mouth with no teeth and suckers on the ends of its hands and feet.

The Yara-ma-yha-who is said to live in [[fig tree]]s. Instead of hunting for food, it is described as waiting for an unsuspecting traveller to rest under the tree. The creature then drops down and uses its suckers to drain the victim's blood. After that it swallows the person, drinks some water, and then takes a nap. When the Yara-ma-yha-who awakens, it regurgitates the victim, leaving them shorter than before. The victim's skin also has a reddish tint to it that it didn't have before.&lt;ref name="Smith1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

At length, the victim is transformed into a Yara-ma-yha-who themselves.

According to legend, the Yara-ma-yha-who is only active during the day and only targets living prey. "[[Apparent death|Playing dead]]" until sunset (it is said to only hunt during the day) is offered as a ploy to avoid attack.
