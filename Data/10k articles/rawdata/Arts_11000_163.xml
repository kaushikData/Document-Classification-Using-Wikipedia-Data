'''''A Perfumed Scorpion'''''&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1978) A Perfumed Scorpion. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-86304-080-2}} (paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-fiction book by the [[Sufism|Sufist]] writer, [[Idries Shah]], that was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1978, the same year that he published two other major works: ''[[Learning How to Learn: Psychology and Spirituality in the Sufi Way]]'' and ''[[The Hundred Tales of Wisdom]]''.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''A Perfumed Scorpion'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref name="IAN"&gt;Shah, T. In Arabian Nights: A Caravan of Moroccan Dreams. New York, NY: Bantam. pp. 215–216. {{ISBN|0-553-80523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The book contains the substance of lectures given by the author at various universities in the United States under the aegis of the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]] and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].  The ‘perfuming of a scorpion’ is a reference to a symbol used by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Bahaudin Naqshband]] of Bukhara when he taught about the ubiquitous problem of hypocrisy and self-deception in both individuals and institutions: “Whoever might perfume a scorpion will not thereby escape its sting”.

The seven sections of the book deal in depth with this issue under headings such as Education, The Nature of Sufi Knowledge, The Path and the Duties and the Techniques, [[Teaching stories|Teaching Stories]], A framework for New Knowledge and Involvement in Sufi Study. Each section contains numerous illustrative anecdotes from contemporary life but is nevertheless rooted in the teaching patterns of [[Rumi]], [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Jami]], and other great Oriental sages who dealt with the need for, and the path to, knowledge and information before real progress can be made.

== Reception ==
''A Perfumed Scorpion'' was described by one reviewer as "... an invigorating and abrasive book, like jumping into icy water - hard to do, but you're glad you have done it." This reviewer also appreciated the way it dissolves in the attentive reader “the maiming effect of unconscious bias.”&lt;ref&gt;Books and Bookmen. May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the book continues and it has remained in print ever since it was published.

Philosopher of [[science]] and physicist [[Henri Bortoft]] used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Bortoft's ''[[The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science]]'' includes stories from ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', ''[[The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin]]'' and ''A Perfumed Scorpion''.

'''Alternative formats''' include [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[braille]], [[E-text|electronic]] or [[large print]] versions of standard print such as educational material, textbooks, information leaflets, and even people's personal bills and letters. Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille).

== Audio ==
Audio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY player]] or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. 

=== Choosing audio ===
Different people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content.

=== CD as a medium for accessing information ===
[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|Interference-colors]]
[[Compact Discs]] (CDs) were first produced  in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to [[cassette tapes]] (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.[[File:Cassette-tape 8192.jpg|thumb|Cassette-tape 8192]]

Over time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers.

== Braille ==
Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.

[[File:A person reading a braille book.jpg|thumb|A person reading a braille book]]
Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format.

== Electronic (e-text) ==
For many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today’s technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology.

== Large print ==
Large print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point.

Having one single size will not meet everyone’s needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5804">[[File:Amaru Shataka by Amaru, early 17th century.jpg|thumb|Wife awaits her Husband, Verse 76, Amaru Shataka by Amaru, early 17th-century painting.]]

The '''''Amaruśataka''''' or '''''Amarukaśataka''''' (अमरुशतक,  "the hundred stanzas of Amaru"), authored by '''Amaru''' (also Amaruka), is a collection of poems dated to about the 7th&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|2005}}, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; or 8th century.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

The ''Amaruśataka'' ranks as one of the finest [[lyrical poetry]] in the annals of [[Sanskrit literature]], ranking with [[Kalidasa]] and  {{IAST|[[Bhartṛhari]]}}'s ''{{IAST|Śṛngâraśataka}}''. The ninth-century literary critic [[Anandavardhana]] declared in his ''Dhvanyaloka'' that "a single stanza of the poet Amaru ... may provide the taste of love equal to what's found in whole volumes." Its verses have been used by poets and critics as examples and standards to judge other poems by. [[Andrew Schelling]] describes it as "love poetry original and vivid as that produced anywhere on the planet".&lt;ref name=schelling&gt;{{Harvnb|Schelling|2004}}, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Its subject is mostly [[Sringara]] (erotic love, romantic love) including aspects such as love, passion, estrangement, longing, rapprochement, joy and sorrow, etc. Greg Bailey notes that it is "as much about the social aspects of courting, betrayal, feminine indignance and masculine self-pity as it is about sensuality".&lt;ref name=bailey/&gt; Similarly, Schelling notes: "All the flavours or nuances of love are said to lie within the book, though you'll notice that the emphasis falls more on the bitter taste of separation or betrayal than on the sweetness of consummation."&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

==Authorship==
Not much is known about the life of Amaru. Traditional accounts attribute the work to King Amaru of Kashmir. The collection in its present form may well represent the work of more than one author—the poems that form part of the collection differ quite significantly across its different regional recensions.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Siegfried Lienhard]], only around half the verses in the Amarusataka are common across its various regional versions.  {{Harvnb|Lienhard|1984|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of legends associating the collection with the philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. One version occurs in his 14th century biography written by a follower, the ''Shankara-digvijaya''. According to this version, during [[Adi Shankara#Meeting with Mandana Mishra|his debate]] with [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], he was asked philosophical questions phrased in metaphors of love by the latter's wife, Ubhaya Bharati. Being celibate and therefore ignorant of the ''kama shastras'', Shankara requested an adjournment. He then entered the recently dead body of Amaru and spent a hundred days mastering the art of erotic love, before returning to defeat his opponent. He wrote the Amarushataka to memorialise his learning.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

Another version, given in Ravichandra's commentary on the Amarushataka, states that Shankara composed these poems to impart spiritual insight to the epicurean king Amaru, in metaphors he might understand. When this was misunderstood and mocked by the advisers at the court, Shankara entered the body of Amaru and provided a spiritual exegesis of the poems.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

Accordingly, several manuscripts add [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s naming Shankara as the true author of the work, and Ravichandra, a mediaeval commentator on the Bengal recension of the Amarusataka, read metaphysical meanings into the verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lienhard|1984|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legends also state that  Amaru was the 101st reincarnation of a soul that had previously occupied 100 women.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The '''Arts &amp; Entertainment District''', or previously known as '''Omni''', is a neighborhood of greater [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], just south of [[Edgewater (Miami)|Edgewater]]. It is bound roughly by North 19th Street to the north, North 10th Street to the south, North East 2nd Avenue to the west, and Biscayne Boulevard to the east.&lt;ref&gt;http://aedistrictmiami.com/map/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is an urban, residential neighborhood with many high-rise residential towers, as well as some smaller scale historic buildings. It is home to the [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]], the old ''[[Miami Herald]]'' headquarters (now located in [[Doral, Florida]]), and the [[Omni International Mall]].  Until 2014 it was one of the neighborhoods that hosted the annual [[Miami International Boat Show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaislemarina.com/boat-show/]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Sea Isle Marina]]. The [[City of Miami Cemetery]], one of Miami's oldest cemeteries, is also located in the district, as well as the historic [[Miami Women's Club|Women's Club]], and some of Miami's oldest churches and synagogues.

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is served by the Omni Loop branch of the [[Metromover]] and by the [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]] via Metromover at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]].

==History==
From the 1920s to the 1950s, the Omni area was a high-end shopping area with many major department stores along [[Biscayne Boulevard]], such as [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] (whose tower still stands at the [[Arsht Center]]), [[Jordan Marsh]] (NE 15th Street and Biscayne Blvd) built in 1956, and a [[Burdines]] (NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/donboyd/image/95013898|title=Late 1950's - east end of Jordan Marsh on NE 15th Street looking west toward Biscayne Boulevard by Don Boyd|author=|date=|website=PBase|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, this area of [[Biscayne Boulevard]] was the home of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company Department Store (Miami, Florida)|Sears (later Burdines) Store]], and the [[Shrine Building (Miami, Florida)|Shrine Building]] (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne  Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the [[Art Deco]] [[architectural style]]. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district.  By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the [[Piggly-Wiggly|Piggly-Wiggly grocery store]], Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/Shrine Building.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Omni International Mall]] opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style [[shopping mall]]. The mall brought many upscale stores to the Omni such as [[Emilio Pucci]], [[Givenchy]] and [[Hermes]]. By the 1990s, however, the mall began to falter, and in 1991, [[Jordan Marsh]] closed, and in 1998, so did [[JC Penney]]. In 2000, the mall closed, and the area was reconverted into offices in 2007. Today, it houses a few office tenants and the [[Miami International University of Art and Design]]. It is also the corporate home of the [http://www.miamichamber.com Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce]. The name of the neighborhood today, comes from the name of the Omni Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelemilio.com/omni-mall-in-downtown-miami-is-getting-a-real-estate-facelift/]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-30/news/the-fall-of-the-mall/|title=The Fall of the Mall|first=Victor|last=Cruz|date=30 December 1999|website=miaminewtimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, rapid construction of [[high-rise]] residential [[skyscraper]]s has revitalized the neighborhood from [[urban blight]]. The area around Margaret Pace Park has seen large population growth from 2000 to 2010. Omni today has a large residential population, and with continued retail and residential construction in the neighborhood, has grown into its own unique neighborhood in the city.

==Transportation==
[[File:Crowded Metromover.jpg|thumb|right|[[Metromover]] is a popular way of getting around the Downtown area. It connects the area's neighborhoods and can get very busy during [[rush hour]].]]
{{see also|Transportation in Miami}}
[[Metromover]] train system runs three lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. There are two Metromover stations in the district- School Board Station and Adrienne Arsht Center. Transfers can be made to the [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], Miami's [[heavy rail]] system, at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]], as well as to the Brickell and Inner Metromover loops. Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to [[Miami International Airport]], all Miami-Dade County bus lines, [[Tri-Rail]] and [[Amtrak]]. The main bus station is also located in the district, next to the Arsht Center at the [[Adrienne Arsht Center (Metromover station)|Adrienne Arsht Center]] station.

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is served by [[Miami Metrobus|Metrobus]] throughout the area, the [[Miami Metrorail]], and the [[Metromover]]:

As an urban and [[pedestrian-friendly]] area with an extensive [[public transit]] network, the Arts &amp; Entertainment District and the greater Downtown area, is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many residents get around by foot, bicycle, [[Metromover]] or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.

Recently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and [[bike lanes]], that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. [[Bike lanes]] and [[Shared lane marking|bike sharrows]] are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. The [[Venetian Causeway]] is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects [[South Beach]] to Omni. The [[Rickenbacker Causeway]] is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106222951/http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It serves graphic design professionals, managers, educators and students. Created in 1996 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] (Bill Pr56),&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:1523 ROYAL ASSENT / SANCTION ROYALE|author=[http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/36-1/l064.htm  '''Bill Pr56, An Act respecting the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario]|date=25 April 1996|journal=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Association is Canada's only accredited body of graphic designers with a legislated title&lt;ref name=RGD-founders/&gt; and the second such accredited body of graphic designers in the world. RGD certifies graphic designers and promotes knowledge sharing, continuous learning, research, advocacy and mentorship.

==Advocacy==
RGD works to establish professional standards and innovative thinking within the graphic design industry. The association assumes an advocacy role for best practices for both graphic designers and the clients they work with. They focus on issues such as spec work and crowdsourcing, accessibility, sustainability, salaries and billing practices, pro bono work and internship guidelines.

RGD advocacy initiatives include:
* Supporting, defending and maintaining policies
* Promoting measures that broadly benefit members and the industry
* Increasing public awareness and disseminating information about industry best practices and the value of working with a Registered Graphic Designer (RGD)
* Arguing in favour of a new idea
* Speaking out on issues of concern
* Mediating, coordinating, clarifying and advancing a particular point of view
* Intervening with others on behalf of the profession

==History==
In 1956, Toronto-based designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld and Sam Smart formed the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).&lt;ref name=RGD-founders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |title=Founders |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702230050/http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |archive-date=2014-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TDC was later renamed the [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada]] (GDC) to reflect the wider interests of its members.

By 1984 many other design disciplines such as Architecture and Interior Design had been given Acts in Provincial Legislatures so that their respective associations could govern and grant their members exclusive professional designations. RGD's founders recognized the need to align Graphic Design with other design professionals. To ensure Graphic Design could also advance as an acknowledged profession the Association's founders decided to incorporate the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD).

On April 25, 1996 Bill Pr56&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"/&gt; was passed and Royal Assent was given to an Act Respecting The Association of Registered Graphic Designers by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Sponsored by Mrs. [[Margaret Marland]], Member of Provincial Parliament and signed by the Honourable [[Hal Jackman]] C.M., O.Ont., O.ST.J., B.A., L.L.B., L.L.D., Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario.

In 1999 a separate Examination Board was established to administer the Registered Graphic Designers Qualification Examination, now referred to as the [http://www.rgd.ca/rgd-certification.php Certification Process for RGD].

'''Baron Munchausen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|n|tʃ|aʊ|z|ən}};{{sfn|Cambridge University Press|2015}}{{efn|The German name for both the fictional character and his historical namesake is Münchhausen. The simplified spelling Munchausen, with one ''h'' and no umlaut, is standard in English when discussing the fictional character, as well as the medical conditions named for him.{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=257}}}} {{IPA-de|ˈmʏnçˌhaʊzn̩|lang}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Munchausen, Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional [[German nobility|German nobleman]] created by the German writer [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]] in his [[1785 in literature|1785]] book ''[[Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia]]''. The character is loosely based on a real [[Freiherr|baron]], Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen ({{IPA-de|ˈmʏnç(h)aʊzn̩|lang}}; 1720–1797).

Born in [[Bodenwerder]], [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], the real-life Münchhausen fought for the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo–Turkish War (1735–39)|Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739]]. Upon retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous [[tall tale]]s based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them [[anonymous work|anonymously]] into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which was first published in [[Oxford]] by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet [[Gottfried August Bürger]]. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a [[libel]] suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.

The fictional Baron's exploits, [[First-person narrative|narrated in the first person]], focus on his impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller, for instance riding on a [[round shot|cannonball]], fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and [[Moon in fiction|travelling to the Moon]]. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen's claims, and contain an undercurrent of [[satire|social satire]]. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of the character's definitive visual representation. Raspe's book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.

Versions of the fictional Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other concepts are named after him, including [[Munchausen syndrome]], the [[Münchhausen trilemma]], and [[Munchausen number]]s.

==Historical figure==
[[File:Bruckner - Münchhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of the real-life Münchhausen|The real-life Münchhausen circa 1740, as a ''[[cuirassier]]'' in [[Riga]], by G. Bruckner]]
Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von Münchhausen was born on 11 May 1720 in [[Bodenwerder]], [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]].{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}} He was a younger son of the "Black Line" of Rinteln-Bodenwerder, an aristocratic family in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]].{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxvii}} His cousin, [[Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen]],{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxv}} was the founder of the [[University of Göttingen]] and later the Prime Minister of the [[Electorate of Hanover]].{{sfn|Levi|1998|p=177}} Münchhausen started as a [[Page (occupation)|page]] to [[Anthony Ulrich II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Anthony Ulrich&amp;nbsp;II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], and followed his employer to the [[Russian Empire]] during the [[Russo-Austro–Turkish War (1735–39)]].{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}} In 1739, he was appointed a [[cornet (military rank)|cornet]] in the Russian cavalry regiment, the Brunswick-[[Cuirassier]]s.{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}} On 27 November 1740, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]].{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxvii}} He was stationed in [[Riga]], but participated in two campaigns against the Turks in 1740 and 1741. In 1744 he married Jacobine von Dunten, and in 1750 he was promoted to ''[[Rittmeister]]'' (cavalry [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]).{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}}

In 1760 Münchhausen retired to live as a ''[[Freiherr]]'' at his estates in Bodenwerder, where he remained until his death in 1797.{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}}{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=53}} It was there, especially at parties given for the area's aristocrats, that he developed a reputation as an imaginative after-dinner storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his adventures in Russia. Over the ensuing thirty years, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling nobles wanting to hear his tales.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=251}} One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories "cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events".{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|pp=xxvii–xxviii}} Rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as an honest man.{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}} As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen's unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but "to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances".{{sfn|Kareem|2012|pp=495–496}}

Münchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790.{{sfn|Meadow|Lennert|1984|p=555}} In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven years his junior.{{sfn|Meadow|Lennert|1984|p=555}} Von Brunn reportedly took ill soon after the marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the [[spa town]] of [[Bad Pyrmont]], although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting.{{sfn|Meadow|Lennert|1984|p=555}} Von Brunn gave birth to a daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint that the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and [[alimony]] litigation.{{sfn|Meadow|Lennert|1984|p=555}} Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=1}}

==Fictionalization==
[[File:Muenchhausen Herrfurth 1 500x763.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Refer to caption|The Baron entertaining guests, from a series of postcards by Oskar Herrfurth]]
The fictionalized character was created by a German writer, scientist, and con artist, [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xxii}}{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=x}} Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen,{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxv}} and may even have been invited to dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xxii}} Raspe's later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|pp=xvi–xvii}}

In his native German language, Raspe wrote a collection of anecdotes inspired by Münchhausen's tales, calling the collection "M-h-s-nsche Geschichten" ("M-h-s-n Stories").{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§3}} It remains unclear how much of Raspe's material comes directly from the Baron, but the majority of the stories are derived from older sources,{{sfn|Krause|1886|p=2}} including [[Heinrich Bebel]]'s ''Facetiæ'' (1508) and [[Samuel Gotthold Lange]]'s ''Deliciæ Academicæ'' (1765).{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}} "M-h-s-nsche Geschichten" appeared as a feature in the eighth issue of the ''Vade mecum für lustige Leute'' (''Handbook for Fun-loving People''), a Berlin humor magazine, in 1781. Raspe published a sequel, "Noch zwei M-Lügen" ("Two more M-Fibs"), in the tenth issue of the same magazine in 1783.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§3}} The hero and narrator of these stories was identified only as "M-h-s-n", keeping Raspe's inspiration partly obscured while still allowing knowledgeable German readers to make the connection to Münchhausen.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§8}} Raspe's name did not appear at all.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§3}}

In 1785, while supervising mines at [[Dolcoath]] in [[Cornwall]], Raspe adapted the ''Vade mecum'' anecdotes into a short English-language book, this time identifying the narrator of the book as "Baron Munchausen".{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xix}} Other than the [[anglicization]] of Münchhausen to "Munchausen", Raspe this time made no attempt to hide the identity of the man who had inspired him, though he still withheld his own name.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=252}}

[[File:Rudolf Erich Raspe.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Refer to caption|Portrait of Rudolf Erich Raspe, creator of the fictional Baron]]

This English edition, the first version of the text in which Munchausen appeared as a fully developed literary character,{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|pp=xxvi–xxvii}} had a circuitous publication history. It first appeared anonymously as ''Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia'', a 49-page book in [[12mo]] size, published in [[Oxford, Oxfordshire|Oxford]] by the bookseller Smith in late 1785 and sold for a [[shilling (English coin)|shilling]].{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|pp=164–165}} A second edition released early the following year, retitled ''Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen'', added five more stories and four illustrations; though the book was still anonymous, the new text was probably by Raspe, and the illustrations may have been his work as well.{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|pp=166–167}}

By May 1786, Raspe no longer had control over the book, which was taken over by a different publisher, G. Kearsley.{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|p=167}}{{efn|Both booksellers worked in Oxford and used the same London address, 46 Fleet Street, so it is possible that Kearsley had also been involved in some capacity with publication of the first and second editions.{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|p=167}}}} Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as ''Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen''.{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|pp=167–168}}

Kearsley's version was a marked popular success. Over the next few years, the publishing house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length ''Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed into the body of stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating [[Augustan prose]].{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|pp=xxxi–xxxii}} Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by [[Thomas Seccombe]] in 1895 and [[F. J. Harvey Darton]] in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxxvii}}

At least ten editions or translations of the book appeared before Raspe's death in 1794.{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=55}} Translations of the book into French, Spanish, and German were published in 1786.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=252}} The text reached the United States in 1805, expanded to include American topical satire by an anonymous [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] writer, probably [[Thomas Green Fessenden]].{{sfn|Gudde|1942|p=372}}

[[File:G a buerger sw.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of Gottfried August Bürger|Gottfried August Bürger translated the book into German, and was often assumed to be its author.]]

The first German translation, ''Wunderbare Reisen zu Wasser und Lande'', was made by the German [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Gottfried August Bürger]]. Bürger's text is a close translation of Smith's second edition, but also includes an interpolated story, based on a German legend called "[[The Six Wonderful Servants]]". Two new engravings were added to illustrate the interpolated material.{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxx}} The German version of the stories proved to be even more popular than the English one.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§5}} A second German edition in 1788 included heavily altered material from an expanded Kearsley edition, and an original German sequel, ''Nachtrag zu den wunderbaren Reisen zu Wasser und Lande'', was published in 1789. After these publications, the English and Continental versions of the Raspe text continued to diverge, following increasingly different traditions of included material.{{sfn|Carswell|1952a|p=171}}

Raspe, probably for fear of a [[libel]] suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§6–7}} It was often credited to Bürger,{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}} sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xi}} Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed that it was a competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, [[Abraham Gotthelf Kästner]], and [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=x}} The scholar [[Johann Georg Meusel]] correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xi}} Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, [[Karl Reinhard (biographer)|Karl Reinhard]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=xii}}{{efn|Nonetheless, no known edition of the book credited Raspe on its [[title page]] until [[J. P. Carswell|John Patrick Carswell]]'s 1948 [[Cresset Press]] edition.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§4}}}}

In the first few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was responsible for the stories.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=252}} According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories,{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=252}} and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=491}}

==Fictional character==

The fictional Baron Munchausen is a [[Alazon#Miles Gloriosus|braggart soldier]], most strongly defined by his comically exaggerated [[boast]]s about his own adventures;{{sfn|George|1918|pp=169–171}} all of the stories in Raspe's book are told in [[first-person narrative]], with a prefatory note explaining that "the Baron is supposed to relate these extraordinary Adventures over his Bottle, when surrounded by his Friends".{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=488}} The Baron's stories imply him to be a [[superhuman]] figure who spends most of his time either getting out of absurd predicaments or indulging in equally absurd moments of gentle mischief.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=253}} In some of his best-known stories, the Baron rides a [[Round shot|cannonball]], [[Moon in fiction|travels to the Moon]], is swallowed by a giant fish in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], saves himself from drowning by pulling on his own hair, fights a forty-foot crocodile, enlists a wolf to pull his sleigh, and uses [[Laurus nobilis|laurel tree]] branches to fix his horse when the animal is accidentally cut in two.{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}}

In the stories he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, [[rationality|rational]] man, describing what he experiences with simple [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events he has not witnessed himself.{{sfn|George|1918|pp=174–175}} The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=484}} and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle [[satire|social satire]].{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=253}} In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of [[:wikt:gallantry|gallantry]], with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, a tendency to be pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds.{{sfn|George|1918|pp=181–182}} The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§12–13}}

Because the feats the Baron describes are overtly implausible, they are easily recognizable as fiction,{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=492}} with a strong implication that the Baron is a liar.{{sfn|George|1918|pp=169–171}} Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=485}} In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.{{sfn|George|1918|pp=177–178}}

Illustrators of the Baron stories have included [[Thomas Rowlandson]], [[Alfred Crowquill]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Ernst Ludwig Riepenhausen]], [[Theodor Hosemann]], [[Adolf Schrödter]], [[Gustave Doré]], [[William Strang]],{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|pp=xxxv–xxxvi}} [[W. Heath Robinson]],{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§29}} and [[Ronald Searle]].{{sfn|Raspe|1969}} The Finnish-American cartoonist [[Klaus Nordling]] featured the Baron in a weekly ''Baron Munchausen'' comic strip from 1935 to 1937,{{sfn|Holtz|2011}} and in 1962, Raspe's text was adapted for ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' #146 (British series), with both interior and cover art by the British cartoonist [[Denis Gifford]].{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}

In the first published illustrations, which may have been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=500}} For the 1792 ''Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a [[Théophile Gautier, fils|Théophile Gautier ''fils'']] translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|pp=500–503}}

The relationship between the real and fictional Barons is complex. On the one hand, the fictional Baron Munchausen can be easily distinguished from the historical figure Hieronymus von Münchhausen;{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=257}} the character is so separate from his namesake that at least one critic, the writer [[W. L. George]], concluded that the namesake's identity was irrelevant to the general reader,{{sfn|George|1918|pp=179–180}} and [[Richard Asher]] named [[Munchausen syndrome]] using the anglicized spelling so that the disorder would reference the character rather than the real person.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=257}} On the other hand, Münchhausen remains strongly connected to the character he inspired, and is still nicknamed the ''Lügenbaron'' ("Baron of Lies") in German.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=252}} As the Munchausen researcher Bernhard Wiebel has said, "These two barons are the same and they are not the same."{{sfn|Wiebel|2011}}

==Critical and popular reception==
[[File:Bodenwerder-Münchhausen-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Refer to caption|Statue of Munchausen in Bodenwerder]]
Reviewing the first edition of Raspe's book in December 1785, a writer in ''[[The Critical Review]]'' commented appreciatively:{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=vi}}

{{quote|This is a satirical production calculated to throw ridicule on the bold assertions of some parliamentary declaimers. If rant may be best foiled at its own weapons, the author's design is not ill-founded; for the marvellous has never been carried to a more whimsical and ludicrous extent.{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=vi}}{{efn|At the time, "ludicrous" was not a negative term; rather, it suggested that humor in the book was sharply satirical.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=491}}}}}}

A writer for ''[[The English Review]]'' around the same time was less approving: "We do not understand how a collection of lies can be called a satire on lying, any more than the adventures of a woman of pleasure can be called a satire on fornication."{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=496}}

W. L. George described the fictional Baron as a "comic giant" of literature, describing his boasts as "splendid, purposeless lie[s] born of the joy of life".{{sfn|George|1918|p=169}} Théophile Gautier ''fils'' highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an "absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which backs away from nothing".{{sfn|Lefebvre|2011|p=60}} According to an interview, [[Jules Verne]] relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels.{{sfn|Compère|Margot|Malbrancq|1998|p=232}} [[Thomas Seccombe]] commented that "Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved [a permanent place in literature]&amp;nbsp;... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. [[Lemuel Gulliver]], or [[Robinson Crusoe]]."{{sfn|Seccombe|1895|p=v}}

[[Steven T. Byington]] wrote that "Munchausen's modest seat in the [[Valhalla]] of classic literature is undisputed", comparing the stories to American [[tall tale]]s and concluding that the Baron is "the patriarch, the perfect model, the fadeless fragrant flower, of liberty from accuracy".{{sfn|Byington|1928|pp=v–vi}} The folklore writer [[Alvin Schwartz (children's author)|Alvin Schwartz]] cited the Baron stories as one of the most important influences on the American tall tale tradition.{{sfn|Schwartz|1990|p=105}} In a 2012 study of the Baron, the literary scholar Sarah Tindal Kareem noted that "Munchausen embodies, in his deadpan presentation of absurdities, the novelty of fictionality [and] the sophistication of aesthetic illusion", adding that the additions to Raspe's text made by Kearsley and others tend to mask these ironic literary qualities by emphasizing that the Baron is lying.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=485}}

By the beginning of the 19th century, Kearsley's phenomenally popular version of Raspe's book had spread to abridged [[chapbook]] editions for young readers, who soon became the main audience for the stories.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§24}} The book, especially in its adaptations for children, remained widely popular throughout the century.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=503}} It was translated into nearly all languages spoken in Europe;{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxxiii}} [[Robert Southey]] referred to it as "a book which everybody knows, because all boys read it".{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§24}} Notable later translations include Gautier's French rendering{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=500}} and [[Korney Chukovsky]]'s popular Russian adaptation.{{sfn|Balina|Goscilo|Lipovet︠s︡kiĭ|2005|p=247}} By the 1850s, ''Munchausen'' had come into [[slang]] use as a verb meaning "to tell extravagantly untruthful pseudo-autobiographical stories".{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=504}} [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], in an 1863 almanac, cited the iconic 1792 illustration of the Baron by asking rhetorically:

{{quote|Who is there that has not, in his youth, enjoyed ''The Surprising Travels and Adventures of Baron Munchausen in Russia, the Caspian Sea, Iceland, Turkey, &amp;c.'' a slim volume—all too short, indeed—illustrated by a formidable portrait of the baron in front, with his broad-sword laid over his shoulder, and several deep gashes on his manly countenance? I presume they must be few.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=503}}}}

Though Raspe's book is no longer widely read by English speakers,{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=486}} the Munchausen stories remain popular in Europe, especially in Germany and in Russia.{{sfn|Baister|Patrick|2007|p=159}}

==In culture==
===Literature===
As well as the many augmented and adapted editions of Raspe's text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§30}} In 1838–39, [[Karl Leberecht Immermann]] published the long novel ''Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken'' (''Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques''){{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|p=78}} as an homage to the character, and [[Adolf Ellissen]]'s ''Munchausens Lügenabenteur'', an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846.{{sfn|Carswell|1952b|p=xxxiii}} In his 1886 philosophical treatise ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] uses one of the Baron's adventures, the one in which he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical [[free will]]; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt "to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness".{{sfn|Nietzsche|2000|p=218}}

In the late 19th century, the Baron appeared as a character in [[John Kendrick Bangs]]'s comic novels ''[[A House-Boat on the Styx]]'', ''[[Pursuit of the House-Boat]]'', and ''[[The Enchanted Type-Writer]]''.{{Sfnm|Bangs|1895|1p=27|Bangs|1897|2p=27|Bangs|1899|3p=34}} Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published ''[[Mr. Munchausen]]'', a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§30}} [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s second novel, ''Baron Münchhausen's New Scientific Adventures'', put the Baron character in a [[science fiction]] setting; the novel was serialized in ''[[The Electrical Experimenter]]'' from May 1915 to February 1917.{{sfn|Westfahl|2007|p=209}}

[[Pierre Henri Cami]]'s character Baron de Crac, a French soldier and courtier under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]],{{sfn|Cami|1926}} is an imitation of the Baron Munchausen stories.{{sfn|George|1918|p=175}} In 1998,{{sfn|Wardrip-Fruin|2009|p=77}} the British game designer [[James Wallis (games designer)|James Wallis]] used the Baron character to create a multi-player [[storytelling game]], ''[[The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents.{{sfn|Mitchell|McGee|2009|pp=100–102}} The American writer [[Peter David]] had the Baron narrate an original short story, "Diego and the Baron", in 2018.{{sfn|Bold Venture Press|2018}}

[[File:Cliff Hall and Jack Pearl 1952.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of Jack Pearl and Cliff Hall|For radio, [[Jack Pearl]] (right) and Cliff Hall (left) played the Baron and his disbelieving foil Charlie, respectively.]]
[[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] produced the [[pantomime]] ''Baron Munchausen; or, Harlequin's Travels'' in London in 1795, starring the actor-singer-caricaturist [[Robert Dighton]] as the Baron;{{sfn|Sadler's Wells|1795|p=2}} another pantomime based on the Raspe text, ''Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love'', was produced in London in 1818.{{sfn|Kareem|2012|p=504}} [[Herbert Eulenberg]] made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, ''Münchhausen'',{{sfn|Eulenberg|1900}} and the [[Expressionist]] writer [[Walter Hasenclever]] turned the stories into a comedy, ''Münchhausen'',{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|p=78}} in 1934.{{sfn|Furness|Humble|1991|p=114}} [[Grigori Gorin]] used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play ''That Very Munchausen'';{{sfn|Balina|Goscilo|Lipovet︠s︡kiĭ|2005|pp=246–247}} a [[That Very Munchausen|film version]] was made in 1980.{{sfn|Hutchings|2004|pp=130–131}} ''Baron Prášil'', a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in [[Prague, Czech Republic|Prague]].{{sfn|Košatka|2010}}{{efn|name=Prasil}} The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen''.{{sfn|Czech Centre London|2011}}

In 1932, the comedy writer Billy Wells adapted Baron Munchausen for a [[radio comedy]] routine starring the comedians [[Jack Pearl]] and Cliff Hall.{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=50}} In the routine, Pearl's Baron would relate his unbelievable experiences in a thick German accent to Hall's [[Straight man|"straight man" character]], Charlie. When Charlie had had enough and expressed disbelief, the Baron would invariably retort: "Vass ''you'' dere, Sharlie?"{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=51}} The line became a popular and much-quoted [[catchphrase]], and by early 1933 ''The Jack Pearl Show'' was the second most popular series on American radio (after [[Eddie Cantor]]'s program).{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=51}} Pearl attempted to adapt his portrayal to film in ''[[Meet the Baron]]'' in 1933, playing a modern character mistaken for the Baron,{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=51}} but the film was not a success.{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=50}} Pearl's popularity gradually declined between 1933 and 1937, though he attempted to revive the Baron character several times before ending his last radio series in 1951.{{sfn|Erickson|2014|p=52}}

For a 1972 [[Caedmon Records]] recording of some of the stories, [[Peter Ustinov]] voiced the Baron. A review in ''[[The Reading Teacher]]'' noted that Ustinov's portrayal highlighted "the braggadocio personality of the Baron", with "self-adulation&amp;nbsp;... plainly discernible in the intonational innuendo".{{sfn|Knight|1973|p=119}}

===Film===
[[File:Gottfried Franz - Munchhausen Underwater.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Refer to caption|The Baron travels underwater, illustrated by Gottfried Franz.]]
The early French filmmaker [[Georges Méliès]], who greatly admired the Baron Munchausen stories,{{sfn|Lefebvre|2011|p=60}} filmed ''[[Baron Munchausen's Dream]]'' in 1911. Méliès's short silent film, which has little in common with the Raspe text, follows a sleeping Baron through a surrealistic succession of intoxication-induced dreams.{{sfn|Zipes|2010|p=43}} Méliès may also have used the Baron's journey to the moon as an inspiration for his well-known 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.{{sfn|Lefebvre|2011|p=60}} In the late 1930s, he planned to collaborate with the [[Dada]] artist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] on a new film version of the Baron stories, but the project was left unfinished at his death in 1938.{{sfn|Ezra|2000|p=20}} Richter attempted to complete it the following year, taking on [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Jacques Brunius]], and [[Maurice Henry]] as screenwriters, but the beginning of the [[Second World War]] put a permanent halt to the production.{{sfn|Sadoul|Morris|1972|p=25}}

The French animator [[Émile Cohl]] produced a version of the stories using [[silhouette]] [[cutout animation]] in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929.{{sfn|Sadoul|Morris|1972|p=25}} [[Colonel Heeza Liar]], the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by [[John Randolph Bray]] in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and [[Teddy Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Shull|Wilt|2004|p=17}} The Italian director [[Paolo Azzurri]] filmed ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' in 1914,{{sfn|Zipes|2010|p=408}} and the British director [[F. Martin Thornton]] made a short silent film featuring the Baron, ''The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', the following year.{{sfn|Young|1997|p=441}} In 1940, the Czech director [[Martin Frič]] filmed ''[[Baron Prášil (film)|Baron Prášil]]'', starring the comic actor [[Vlasta Burian]] as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.{{sfn|Česká televize}}{{efn|name=Prasil|Among Czech speakers, the fictional Baron is usually called Baron Prášil.{{sfn|Sadoul|Morris|1972|p=25}}}}

For the German film studio [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]]'s 25th anniversary in 1943, [[Joseph Goebbels]] hired the filmmaker [[Josef von Báky]] to direct ''[[Münchhausen (film)|Münchhausen]]'', a big-budget color film about the Baron.{{sfn|Hull|1969|pp=252–253}} David Stewart Hull describes [[Hans Albers]]'s Baron as "jovial but somewhat sinister",{{sfn|Hull|1969|p=254}} while Tobias Nagle writes that Albers imparts "a male and muscular zest for action and testosterone-driven adventure".{{sfn|Nagle|2010|p=269}} A German musical comedy, ''[[Münchhausen in Afrika]]'', made as a vehicle for the Austrian singing star [[Peter Alexander (Austrian performer)|Peter Alexander]], appeared in 1957.{{sfn|Arndt|von Brisinski|2006|p=103}} [[Karel Zeman]]'s 1961 Czech film ''[[The Fabulous Baron Munchausen]]'' commented on the Baron's adventures from a contemporary perspective, highlighting the importance of the poetic imagination to scientific achievement; Zeman's stylized ''[[mise-en-scène]]'', based on Doré's illustrations for the book, combined animation with live-action actors, including [[Miloš Kopecký]] as the Baron.{{sfn|Hames|2009|pp=197–198}}

In the Soviet Union in 1929 by Daniil Cherkes was released cartoon ''Adventures of Munchausen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2364 Cartoon on Animator.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7FR90VpBBM Cartoon on youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oza8xE3tp_M Cartoon on youtube with english subs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], [[Soyuzmultfilm]] released a 16-minute [[stop-motion animation]] ''Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich.{{sfn|Venger &amp; Reisner|loc=[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=2226 "Adventures of Baron Munghausen"] {{sic}}}} Another Soviet animated version was produced as a series of short films, ''[[Munchausen's Adventures]]'', in 1973 and 1974.{{sfn|Venger &amp; Reisner|loc=[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=6754 "Munchausen's Adventures"]}} The French animator [[Jean Image]] filmed ''[[The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary Baron Munchausen]]'' in 1979,{{sfn|Zipes|2010|p=408}} and followed it with a 1984 sequel, ''[[Moon Madness (film)|Moon Madness]]''.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=184}} [[Oleg Yankovsky]] appeared as the Baron in the 1979 Russian television film ''[[The Very Same Munchhausen]]'', directed by [[Mark Zakharov]] from Grigori Gorin's screenplay, produced and released by Mosfilm. The film, a satirical commentary on Soviet censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of his adventures in a disbelieving and [[conformity]]-driven world.{{sfn|Hutchings|2004|pp=130–131}}

In 1988, [[Terry Gilliam]] adapted the Raspe stories into a lavish Hollywood film, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', with the British stage actor and director [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] in the lead. [[Roger Ebert]], in his review of the film, described Neville's Baron as a man who "seems sensible and matter-of-fact, as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible".{{sfn|Ebert|1989}} The German actor [[Jan Josef Liefers]] starred in a 2012 two-part [[television film]] titled ''[[Baron Münchhausen (2012 film)|Baron Münchhausen]]''; according to a ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' review, his characterization of the Baron strongly resembled [[Johnny Depp]]'s performance as [[Jack Sparrow]] in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.{{sfn|Hass|2012}}

===Memorials===
[[File:Muenchhausen-1lats.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Latvian commemorative coin of 2005]]
In 2004, a fan club calling itself Munchausen's Grandchildren&lt;!-- (Внучата Мюнхаузена) --&gt; was founded in the Russian city of [[Kaliningrad]] (formerly [[Königsberg]]). The club's early activities included identifying "historical proofs" of the fictional Baron's travels through Königsberg, such as a [[jackboot]] supposedly belonging to the Baron{{sfn|Викторова|2004}} and a [[sperm whale]] skeleton said to be that of the whale in whose belly the Baron was trapped.{{sfn|Волошина|Захаров|2006}}

On 18 June 2005, to celebrate the 750th anniversary of Kaliningrad, a monument to the Baron was unveiled as a gift from Bodenwerder, portraying the Baron's cannonball ride.{{sfn|Kaliningrad-Aktuell|2005}} Bodenwerder sports a Munchausen monument in front of its Town Hall,{{sfn|Baister|Patrick|2007|p=159}} as well a Munchausen museum including a large collection of illustrated editions of the stories.{{sfn|Blamires|2009|loc=§32}} Another Munchausen Museum (''Minhauzena Muzejs'') exists in Duntes Muiža, [[Liepupe parish]], [[Latvia]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://minhauzens.lv/en/home/ Munchausen's World - museums homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;, home of the real Baron's first wife;{{sfn|Baister|Patrick|2007|p=154}} the couple had lived in the town for six years, before moving back to the baronial estate in Hanover.{{sfn|Baister|Patrick|2007|p=159}} In 2005, to mark the real-life Baron's 285th birthday, the [[National Bank of Latvia]] issued a commemorative silver coin.{{sfn|Baister|Patrick|2007|p=159}}

===Nomenclature===
In 1951, the British physician [[Richard Asher]] published an article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' describing patients whose [[factitious disorder]]s led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder "Munchausen's syndrome", commenting: "Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him".{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}} The disease is now usually referred to as [[Munchausen syndrome]].{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=250}} The name has spawned two other coinages: [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients,{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}} and [[Munchausen by Internet]], in which illness is feigned online.{{sfn|Feldman|2000}}

In 1968, [[Hans Albert]] coined the term "[[Münchhausen trilemma]]" to describe the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have to be derived from still other premises, and so on forever, leading to an [[infinite regress]] interruptible only by [[circular logic]] or [[dogmatism]]. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair.{{sfn|Apel|2001|pp=39–40}} The same story also inspired the mathematical term "[[Munchausen number]]", coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;).{{sfn|Orly|Haines|2013|p=136}}

Subclass ATU1889 of the [[Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system]], a standard index of folklore, was named "Münchhausen Tales" in tribute to the stories.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|p=77}} In 1994, a [[main belt asteroid]] was named [[14014 Münchhausen]] in honor of both the real and the fictional Baron.{{sfn|NASA|2013}}

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin Parkway-27527.JPG|thumb|260px|right|Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from the top of the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]
'''Benjamin Franklin Parkway''', commonly abbreviated to '''Ben Franklin Parkway''', is a scenic boulevard that runs through the cultural heart of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Named for Founding Father [[Benjamin Franklin]], the mile-long Parkway cuts diagonally across the [[grid plan]] pattern of Center City's Northwest quadrant. It starts at [[Philadelphia City Hall]], curves around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]], and ends before the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

==Attractions==
The Parkway is the spine of Philadelphia's [[Museum District, Philadelphia|Museum District]]. Some of the city's most famous sights are here: [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]]; [[Swann Memorial Fountain]]; [[Parkway Central Library]], the [[Family Court Building]], the [[Franklin Institute]], [[Moore College of Art and Design]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], the [[Rodin Museum]], [[Eakins Oval]], the [[Barnes Foundation]] and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. From its northern end, the Parkway provides access to [[Fairmount Park]] through Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), Martin Luther King Drive (formerly West River Drive), the [[Schuylkill River Trail]], and the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] ([[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]]).

The Parkway also is an outdoor sculpture garden. Works include: ''The Thinker'' by [[Auguste Rodin]]; ''Gates of Hell'' also by Rodin; ''LOVE'' by [[Robert Indiana]]; ''The Ideal Scout'' by [[Robert Tait McKenzie]]; ''Three-Way Piece'' by [[Henry Moore]]; the three River figures in the [[Swann Memorial Fountain]] by [[Alexander Stirling Calder]]; ''Shakespeare Memorial'' also by Calder; ''Philadelphia Holocaust Memorial'' by [[Nathan Rapoport]]; ''Joseph Leidy'' by [[Samuel Murray]]; ''[[Aero Memorial (Manship)|Aero Memorial]]'' by [[Paul Manship]]; ''General Galusha Pennypacker'' by [[Charles Grafly]] and [[Albert Laessle]]; ''Jesus Breaking Bread'' by [[Walter Erlebacher]], ''All Wars Colored Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[J. Otto Schweizer]]; ''Thaddeus Kosciuszko'' by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]]; ''Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[Hermon Atkins MacNeil]]; ''Kopernik'' by [[Dudley Talcott|Dudley Vaill Talcott]]; ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Emmanuel Fremiet]]; [[Washington Monument (Philadelphia)|Washington Monument]] by [[Rudolf Siemering]]; and the ''Rocky'' statue by [[A. Thomas Schomberg]].

==Urban renewal==
[[File:Philadelphia museum district.JPG|thumb|left|Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with [[Franklin Institute]] in the foreground.]]

In a city [[list of Philadelphia neighborhoods|famous for its urban planning]], the Parkway represents one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the [[United States]]. The road was constructed to ease heavy industrial congestion in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and to restore Philadelphia's natural and artistic beauty, as part of the [[City Beautiful]] movement.

Preliminary proposals for the Parkway had been produced and added to the City Plan by 1906, but the first comprehensive plan for the Parkway was commissioned in 1907 by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]). The Association commissioned architects [[Horace Trumbauer]], Clarence Zantzinger, and [[Paul Philippe Cret]], who created a detailed parkway design that was formally added to the City Plan in 1909. Construction on the Parkway did not begin until 1917, when French landscape architect [[Jacques Gréber]] submitted a revised plan to the Commissioners of Fairmount Park. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownlee|first=David Bruce |title=Building the city beautiful: the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the Philadelphia Museum of Art|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 1989 | isbn = 0812282213|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gréber designed the Parkway in 1917 to emulate the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The route was determined by an axis drawn from [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall Tower]] to a fixed point on the hill that [[William Penn]] called [[Fairmount Water Works|"Fairmount"]], now the site of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phila.gov/phils/NationalHistoryDayPhilly/OneHistoryDay_2007.htm Outline History of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 1871-1935.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Champs-Élysées terminates at the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the Parkway's terminating at the Art Museum gives the notion of "a slice of Paris in Philadelphia." The Parkway also has an international flavor by being lined with flags of countries from around the world. 

The traffic [[Roundabout|rotary]] on the western end of the Parkway, at the foot of the Art Museum's [[Rocky Steps]], is named [[Eakins Oval]] after Philadelphia painter [[Thomas Eakins]]. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval originally formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events.

Because of its central location, the Parkway is the site for many concerts and parades. On July 2, 2005, the steps of the museum played host to the Philadelphia venue of [[Live 8]], where artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Linkin Park]] and [[Maroon 5]] performed. The Parkway was also the site of Jay-Z's [[Budweiser Made in America Festival|Made in America Festival]] on September 1-2, 2012 featuring [[Jay-Z]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Skrillex]] and [[Calvin Harris]], among others.  On September 26th and 27th, 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia and the Parkway was flooded with over a million visitors both weekend days, a Celebration of Families on Saturday, and a Holy Mass on Sunday.

In recent years, there has been concern that the original plan of a wide, multi-sectioned, multi-laned, tree-lined boulevard, while beautiful to travel on, is not very engaging for pedestrian or other public use. Traffic along the Parkway has decreased considerably because of the completion of [[Interstate 676]] (Vine Street Expressway), linking the Schuylkill Expressway with the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]]. In response, the roadway has been narrowed somewhat and the sidewalks expanded around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]]. Various plans for the rest of the Parkway, some of which would insert shops and other smaller structures into the long stretches between museums, have been proposed, but none so far have been thought feasible or financially sound.

A new museum for the [[Barnes Foundation]] collection of [[Impressionist]] art on the site between the [[Free Library of Philadelphia|Free Library]] and the [[Rodin Museum]] opened in Spring 2012.

{{main article|Bohemianism}}
In modern use, the term "[[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]" is applied to people who live unconventional, usually artistic, lives. The adherents of the "[[Bloomsbury Group]]", which formed around the Stephen sisters, [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] in the early 20th century, are among the best-known examples. The original "Bohemians" were travellers or refugees from central Europe (hence, the French ''bohémien'', for "[[gypsy]]").

Reflecting on the fashion style of "[[boho-chic]]" in the early years of the 21st century, the ''Sunday Times'' thought it ironic that "fashionable girls wore ruffly floral skirts in the hope of looking bohemian, nomadic, spirited and non-[[bourgeois]]", whereas "gypsy girls themselves ... are sexy and delightful precisely because they do not give a hoot for fashion".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 19 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th, aspects of Bohemian fashion reflected the lifestyle itself.

== Early 19th century and the role of women ==
The bohemian sub-culture has been closely connected with predominantly male artists and intellectuals. The female counterparts have been closely connected with the so called [[Grisette (person)|Grisettes]],young women who combined part-time prostitution with various other  occupations. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the term Grisette also came to refer more specifically to the independent young women. These, often working as seamstresses or milliner's assistants as well frequented [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artistic and cultural venues in Paris. Many grisettes worked as artist's models, often providing sexual favours to the artists in addition to posing for them. During the time of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] they came to dominate the bohemian modelling scene.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lathers, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18580116.html 'The social construction and deconstruction of the female model in 19th-century France'], ''Mosaic'',  June, 1996. Retrieved via subscription 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Art is the grand excuse for all actions that are beyond vulgar. It is art that purifies everything, even a poor young woman's submission of her body."&lt;ref&gt;"C'est que l'art est la grande excuse à toutes les actions au délà du vulgaire; c'est que l'art purifie tout, même cet abandon qu'une pauvre fille fait de son corps." in Jules Janin, "La grisette" in ''Les Français peints par eux-mêmes: Encyclopédie morale du dix-neuvième siècle'', Paris, 1839-1842. Quoted in Dana Goldstein, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The grisette became a frequent character in French fiction but have been mentioned as early as in 1730 by [[Jonathan Swift]]. The term, compare [[Grisette (French)#The grisette in poetry|The grisette in poetry]], signifies qualities of both flirtatiousness and intellectual aspiration, [[George du Maurier]] based large parts of ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' on his experiences as a student in Parisian bohemia during the 1850s. Poe's 1842 story was based on the unsolved murder of [[Mary Rogers|Mary Cecilia Rogers]] near New York City, subtitled "A Sequel to '[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'", it was the first detective story to attempt the solution of a real crime.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Allan Poe, ''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'', (Introduction and notes by John S. Wiley), Wordsworth Editions, 1993, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The most enduring grisette is Mimi in [[Henri Murger]]’s  novel (and subsequent play) ''[[Scènes de la vie de Bohème]]'', the source for [[Puccini]]'s famous opera ''[[La bohème]].''

=== Pre-Raphaelites ===
[[File:Proserpine-(utdrag).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jane Morris]] painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] as ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'' (1874)]]
In 1848 [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] used the word ''bohemianism'' in his novel ''Vanity Fair''. In 1862, the ''Westminster Review'' described a Bohemian as "simply an artist or ''littérateur'' who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art". During the 1860s the term was associated in particular with the [[pre-Raphaelite]] movement, the group of artists and aesthetes of which [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] was the most prominent:&lt;ref&gt;The original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood had been formed in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], Rossetti and [[John Everett Millais]], who aspired to a style of painting that they felt had been lost since the time of [[Raphael]] (1483–1520).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the 1860s progressed, Rossetti would become the grand prince of bohemianism as his deviations from normal standards became more audacious. And as he became this epitome of the unconventional, his egocentric demands necessarily required his close friends to remodel their own lives around him. His bohemianism was like a web in which others became trapped – none more so than [[William Morris|William]] and [[Jane Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Franny Moyle (2009) ''Desperate Romantics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jane Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and pre-Raphaelite traits===
[[Jane Morris]], who was to become Rossetti's muse, epitomised, probably more than any of the women associated with the pre-Raphaelites, an unrestricted, flowing style of dress that, while unconventional at the time, would be highly influential at certain periods during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among The Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; She and others, including the much less outlandish [[Georgiana Burne-Jones]] (wife of [[Edward Burne-Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Though more conventional in many ways than Jane Morris, Georgie Burne-Jones was becoming "a bit of a bohemian" even in the early days of her marriage; for example, she would ask her maid to model for sketches in mid-morning, whereas a typical bourgeois wife would have given priority to the housework: Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the later pre-Raphaelites), eschewed the [[corsets]] and [[crinoline]]s of the mid-to-late Victorian era,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Flanders (2001) ''A Circle of Sisters''&lt;/ref&gt; a feature that impressed the American writer [[Henry James]] when he wrote to his sister in 1869 of the bohemian atmosphere of the Morrises’ house in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of London and, in particular, the "dark silent medieval" presence of its chateleine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s hard to say whether she’s a grand synthesis of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … whether she’s an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in  a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of [[hoop skirts|hoops]] (or of anything else I should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and ''in lieu'' thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.&lt;ref&gt;Henry James, letter to Alice James, 10 March 1869&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Effie Gray]] by [[Thomas Richmond]]]]
In his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1912) [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] unmistakably based the part of Mrs. Higgins on the then elderly Jane Morris. Describing Mrs. Higgins' drawing room, he referred to a portrait of her "when she defied the fashion of her youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which, when caricatured by people who did not understand, led to the absurdities of popular estheticism ''[sic]'' in the eighteen-seventies".&lt;ref&gt;''Pygmalion'', introduction to Act III&lt;/ref&gt;

A biographer of Edward Burne-Jones, writing a century after Shaw (Fiona MacCarthy, 2011), has noted that, in 1964, when the influential [[Biba]] store was opened in [[Swinging London|London]] by [[Barbara Hulanicki]], the "long drooping structureless clothes", though sexier than the dresses portrayed in such Burne-Jones paintings as ''The Golden Stairs'' or ''The Sirens'', nevertheless resembled them.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of Biba has been described by the biographer of British 20th century designer [[Laura Ashley]] as having an atmosphere that "reeked of sex ... [It] was designed to look like a [[bordello]] with its scarlet, black and gold plush fitments, but, interestingly, it implied an old-fashioned, [[Edwardian]] style of forbidden sex with its [[feather boas]], potted palms, [[bentwood]] coat racks and dark lighting"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"&gt;Anne Sebba (1990) ''Laura Ashley: a Life By Design''&lt;/ref&gt; MacCarthy observed also that "the androgynous appearance of Burne-Jones's male figures reflected the sexually ambivalent feeling" of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early flower power: Effie Millais===
[[Effie Gray]], whose marriage to [[John Ruskin]] was [[annulled]] in 1854 prior to her marrying the pre-Raphaelite painter [[John Millais]], is known to have used flowers as an adornment and probably also as an assertive "statement". While in Scotland with Ruskin (still her husband) and Millais, she gathered [[foxglove]]s to place in her hair. She wore them at breakfast despite being asked by her husband not to do so, a gesture of defiance, at a time of growing crisis in their relationship, that came to the critical notice of [[Florence Nightingale]]&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''. Florence Nightingale's observations regarding the foxgloves are noted in correspondence of her friend, the novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], whose acquaintance with Effie Ruskin dated back to their schooldays. However, it is unclear when Nightingale herself met Effie: Cooper, ''op.cit'', footnote 85. (Gaskell was especially well connected. In 1861, for example, she was part of a house party at [[Fryston village|Fryston]] Hall, [[Yorkshire]] given by [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]] – a persistent suitor of Florence Nightingale – that included also the MP [[William Edward Forster|William Forster]], [[Austen Layard]], who excavated the biblical city of [[Ninevah]], and the American (Union) Minister in London, [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]]. Gaskell was among a group visiting nearby [[Pomfret Castle]] when Adam received news of the [[Trent incident|''Trent'' incident]] that, in the early stages of the [[American Civil War]] almost brought Britain and the Union to war: see Amanda Foreman (2010)  ''A World on Fire''.)&lt;/ref&gt; (who tended to regard others of her sex with "scarcely concealed scorn" and was generally unsympathetic to "women's rights"&lt;ref&gt;David Cannadine (1998) ''History in Our Time''&lt;/ref&gt;). A few weeks earlier, on [[Midsummer Day]], Effie (possibly inspired by [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'') was said by her hostess, [[Pauline, Lady Trevelyan|Pauline Trevelyan]], to have "looked lovely" with [[stephanotis]] in her hair at an evening party in [[Northumberland]],&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Pauline, Lady Trevelyan, 24 June 1853, quoted in Robert Brownwell (2013) ''Marriage of Inconvenience''&lt;/ref&gt; while, the previous year, a male friend had brought glass flowers for her hair from [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="Brownwell, op.cit."&gt;Brownwell, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's father was evidently shocked to learn that, when Effie herself was in Venice, she had removed her bonnet in public, ostensibly because of the heat.&lt;ref name="Brownwell, op.cit."/&gt;

In 1853 Millais painted ''Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair'' which depicts her wearing the flowers while doing needlework. Other paintings of the mid-to-late 19th century, such as [[Frederick Sandys]]' ''Love's Shadow'' (1867) of a girl with a rose in her hair, sucking a sprig of blossom, which was described in 1970 as "a first rate [[public relations|PR]] job for the Flower People",&lt;ref&gt;Robert Melville in ''New Statesman'', 20 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and Burne-Jones' ''The Heart of the Rose'' (1889),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/paintings/18.html See MacCarthy, ''op.cit.'';]&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited as foreshadowing the "[[flower power]]" of the mid-to-late 1960s.

==Early 20th century and inter-war years==

===Rational dress and the women's movement===
[[File:Fanny_Gräfin_zu_Reventlow.jpg|thumb|[[Fanny zu Reventlow|Franziska Countess zu Reventlow]], undated photo, the "Bohemian Countess" of [[Schwabing]]]]
By the turn of the 20th century, an increasing number of professional women, notably in [[United States|America]], were attempting to live outside the traditional parameters of society. Between 1870 and 1910 the marriage rate among educated women in the United States fell to 60% (30% lower than the national average), while, by 1893, in the state of [[Massachusetts]] alone, some 300,000 women were earning their own living in nearly 300 occupations. The invention of the [[typewriter]] in 1867 was a particular spur: for example, by the turn of the 20th century, 80% of [[stenographers]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Mills in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 July 2015 (reviewing Kate Bolick, ''Spinster'')&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, such movements as the [[Rational Dress Society]] (1881), with which the Morrises and Georgiana Burne-Jones were involved, were beginning to exercise some influence on women's dress, although the pre-Raphaelite look was still considered "advanced" in the late years of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among The Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]]'s precocious daughter [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], an accomplished painter and artist who mixed in bohemian circles, was sympathetic to rational dress and to the developing women's movement generally (although her rumoured pregnancy at the age of 18 was said to have been disguised by tight corsetry).&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland in ''The Times'', 21 December 2013, reviewing Lucinda Hawksley, ''Princess Louise: Queen Victoria's Rebellious Daughter''&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was not really until the [[First World War]] that "many working women ... embarked on a revolution in fashion that greatly reduced the weight and restrictions imposed on them by their clothing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (2008) ''We Danced All Night''&lt;/ref&gt; Some women working in factories wore trousers and the [[brassiere]] (invented in 1889 by the [[feminist movement|feminist]] [[Herminie Cadolle]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Luxx'', 26 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and patented in America by [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] in 1914) began gradually to supersede the corset.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marr (2009) ''The Making of Modern Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; In shipyards "[[trouser suit]]s" (the term, "pantsuit" was adopted in America in the 1920s) were virtually essential to enable women to shin up and down ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Henrietta Heald, 'For England's Sake', ''History Today'', October 2014, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music hall]] artists also helped to push the boundaries of fashion; these included [[Vesta Tilley]], whose daring adoption on stage of well tailored male dress not only had an influence on men's attire, but also foreshadowed to an extent styles adopted by some women in the inter-war period. It was widely understood that Tilley sought additional authenticity by wearing male underclothing, although off stage she was much more conventional in both her dress and general outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Adie (2013) ''Fighting on the Home Front: The Legacy of Women in World War One''. Tilley was actively involved in recruitment for war service and was happily married to her songwriter, [[Walter de Frece]], who was later knighted and became a Member of Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1920s, what had been a wartime expedient – the need to economise on material – had become a statement of freedom by young women, manifested by shorter hemlines (just above the knee by 1925–6&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (2008) ''We Danced All Night''&lt;/ref&gt;) and boyish hairstyles, accompanied by what [[Robert Graves]] and [[Alan Hodge]] described as "the new fantastic development of [[Jazz]] music".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves &amp; Alan Hodge (1940) ''The Long Weekend: A Social History of Great Britain 1918–1939''&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1920 Olympics|Antwerp Olympic Games]] in 1920 the French [[lawn tennis|tennis]] player [[Suzanne Lenglen]] attracted attention with a knee length skirt that revealed her [[suspender belt]] whenever she leapt to smash a ball. From then on, sportwear for women, as with day-to-day clothes, became freer,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fawcett in ''Royal Academy of Arts Magazine'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; although, after the [[Second World War]], when the American player [[Gussie Moran]] appeared at the [[Wimbledon championships]] of 1949 in a short skirt that revealed lace-trimmed [[panties]], the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] accused her of bringing "vulgarity and sin into tennis" and shunned the outfit's designer [[Ted Tinling|Teddy Tinling]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' obituary of Gussie Moran, 19 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====The impact of lingerie in the 1920s and 30s====
The ''Penguin Social History of Britain'' noted that "by the 1920s newspapers were filled with advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' which would have been classed as indecent a generation earlier".&lt;ref name="John Stevenson 1984"&gt;John Stevenson (1984) ''British Society 1914–45''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in [[Ben Travers]]' comic novel ''[[Rookery Nook (novel)|Rookery Nook]]'' (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, "[[Union suit|Combies]]. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...",&lt;ref&gt;Rhoda Marley to Clive FitzWatters and Harold Twine in Travers, ''Rookery Nook'', chapter XII. Offering to assist her, Clive had suggested to Twine that "it will be more or less guess-work on my part – in the bag put one pair of thin com – er – lady's summer underwear". Rhoda asked if Twine "could just manage a pair of [[camiknickers|cami-knickers]] and a Princess [[petticoat]]". As early as 1920, in Travers' [[debut novel|début novel]] ''The Dippers'', Pauline Dipper's "black silk petticoat [did not] extend unduly, and it was possible to esteem the shapely outline of calf and instep, compressed in stockings of the same material" (chapter III). Also in ''The Dippers'', a young woman tried to start a conversation about "hygienic underclothing for ladies" with a man she mistakenly believed to have written articles on the subject: "I wanted to speak to you about something delicate ... this is not a subject one can discuss in public. People have such conventional ideas" (Helen Monk to Henry Talboyes, chapter VIII).&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Agatha Christie]]'s thriller, ''[[The Seven Dials Mystery]]'' (1929), the aristocratic heroine, [[Bundle Brent|Lady "Bundle" Brent]], wore only "a negligible trifle" under her dress; like many real life "[[it girl]]s" of her class, she had been freed from the "genteel expectations" of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;''Glamour's Golden Age'', BBC4, 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] the actress [[Carole Lombard]], who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and "avoided panties".&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Wayne (1993) ''Clark Gable: Portrait of a Misfit''&lt;/ref&gt; However, she famously declared that though "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion'' (10th ed. 1993) edited by John Walker. Almost 70 years after Lombard's death, the ''Sunday Times'' described red lipstick as the "''ne plus ultra'' [not further beyond] of make up ... We respect red lipstick as a badge of loveliness and youth ([[Georgia May Foote|Georgia May]]), bold style ([[Florence Welch]]), sexual confidence ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) and old-school glamour ([[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]]) – and, above all, we appreciate that it doesn't work for everyone": Shane Watson in ''Style'', 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, sales of men's [[undershirts]] fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, [[Clark Gable]], was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with [[Claudette Colbert]] in the film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934). According to Gable, "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed on the other side of the blanket [hanging from a clothesline to separate twin beds]". However, he "gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility"&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the [[Hays code|Hays Production Code]] in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'', 1931)&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stanley, 'Speaking in Code', ''History Today'', October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.

Looking back at this period, Graves and Hodge noted the protracted course that "daring female fashions had always taken ... from brothel to stage, then on to Bohemia, to Society, to Society's maids, to the mill-girl and lastly to the suburban woman".&lt;ref&gt;Graves &amp; Hodge, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Dorelia" look===
Among female Bohemians in the early 20th century, the "gypsy look" was a recurring theme, popularised by, among others, [[Dorelia McNeill|Dorothy "Dorelia" McNeill]] (1881–1969), [[muse]], lover and second wife of the painter [[Augustus John]] (1878–1961), whose full skirts and bright colours gave rise to the so-called "Dorelia look".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katherine Everett]], ''née'' Olive, a former student of the [[Slade School of Art]] in London, has described McNeil's "tight fitting, hand-sewn, canary coloured bodice above a dark gathered flowing skirt, and her hair very black and gleaming, emphasiz[ing] the long silver earrings which were her only adornment".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Everett (1949) ''Bricks and Flowers''. See also Juliet Nicholson (2006) ''The Perfect Summer''&lt;/ref&gt;

Everett recalled also the Johns' woods "with wild cherry trees in blossom, and ... a model with flying red hair, clad in white, being chased in and out of the trees by nude children".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Everett (1949) ''Bricks and Flowers''&lt;/ref&gt; With similar lack of inhibition, as early as 1907 the American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] (1875–1972) was leading like-minded women in [[Lesbianism|sapphic]] dances in her Parisian garden,&lt;ref&gt;See Diana Souhami (2004) ''Wild Girls''&lt;/ref&gt; photographs of which look little different from scenes at [[Woodstock]] in 1969 and other "pop" festivals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Bobbed hair and cross-gender styles===

By contrast, short [[bob cut|bobbed hair]] was often a Bohemian trait,&lt;ref name="John Stevenson 1984"/&gt; having originated in Paris ''c.''1909 and been adopted by students at the Slade&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Cannan (1916) ''Mendel''&lt;/ref&gt; several years before American film actresses such as [[Colleen Moore]] and [[Louise Brooks]] ("the girl in the black helmet") became associated with it in the mid-1920s. This style was plainly discernible on a woodblock self-portrait of 1916 by [[Dora Carrington]], who had entered the Slade in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Gerzine (1989) ''Carrington''&lt;/ref&gt; and, indeed, the journalist and historian Sir [[Max Hastings]] has referred to "poling [[Punt (boat)|punts]] occupied by reclining girls with bobbed hair" as an enduring, if misleading, popular image of the "idyll before the storm" of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings (2013) ''Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914''. Hastings himself rejected the notion that the years immediately before the war represented some sort of golden age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s short story, ''[[Bernice Bobs Her Hair]]'' (1920), a young woman who wishes to become a "society [[vampire|vamp]]" regards the adoption of a bob as a necessary prelude,&lt;ref&gt;See Ellie Pithers in ''Telegraph Magazine'', 26 January 2013. The term, "vamp" (after "vampire"), was associated in particular with the silent film actress [[Theda Bara]] (1885–1955).&lt;/ref&gt; while Louise Brooks' sexually charged performance as [[Earth Spirit (play)|Lulu]] in [[G. W. Pabst]]'s film, ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929), left an enduring image of the style, which has been replicated on screen over the years, most vividly by [[Cyd Charisse]] in ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), [[Isabelle de Funès]] as [[Valentina (comic book)|Valentina]] in ''[[Baba Yaga (film)|Baba Yaga]]'' (1973)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina was originally a comic book creation by Italian artist [[Guido Crepax]], inspired by Louise Brooks in ''Pandora's Box'': see Roland Jaccard (ed. 1986) ''Louise Brooks: Portrait of an Anti-Star''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Melanie Griffith]] in ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1986). It was associated also with many popular singers and actresses in the 1960s and has frequently been evoked by writers and directors, as well as fashion designers, seeking to recapture the [[hedonism|hedonsitic]] or free spirit of the 1920s. For example, [[Kerry Greenwood]]'s ''[[Cocaine Blues (novel)|Cocaine Blues]]'' (1989) and succeeding novels about [[Phryne Fisher]], a glamorous, but unconventional aristocratic investigator in late twenties [[Melbourne]], Australia, conveyed an image – "five feet two [157.5 centimetres] with eyes of green and black hair cut into a cap"&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood (2012) ''Unnatural Habits''&lt;/ref&gt; – that was later cultivated stylishly on television by [[Essie Davis]] in [[ABC1|ABC]]'s ''[[Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasmania]]n-born Davis was in her early 40s when she played Phryne Fisher, though the heroine of the books was only as old as the century (28 in 1928). Other recent examples of the 1920s style bob have included [[Gemma Arterton]] in ''[[St Trinian's (2007 film)|St. Trinian's]]'' (2007) and [[Michelle Dockery]] as Lady Mary Crawley in the 5th series of ITV's ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2014), the latter set in 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1926 an even shorter style, known as the "[[Eton crop]]", became popular:&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."/&gt; on her arrival in [[Tilling (Sussex)|Tilling]] (Rye) in [[Edward Frederic Benson|E F Benson]]'s comic novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia]]'' (1931), Lucia described "Quaint" Irene as "a girl with no hat and an Eton crop. She was dressed in a fisherman's [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and knickerbockers". (In the same book, Miss Mapp frequently – and topically – addressed Lucia, to her irritation, as "Lulu".) For many years trite assumptions were often made about the sexuality of women with cropped hairstyles; an historian of the 1980s wrote of the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common]] "peace camp" in England that it "brought public awareness to [[feminist]] separation and even to lesbianism, hitherto seen in the mass media – when acknowledged at all – either in terms of Eton-cropped [[androgyny]] or of pornographic fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Alwyn W. Turner (2010) ''Rejoice! Rejoice!: Britain in the 1980s''&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, others have drawn a stark contrast between the bohemian demeanour of the Greenham women and the "bold make-up and [[power dressing|power-dressing]]" that tended to define women's fashion more generally in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Graham Stewart (2013) ''Bang! A History of Britain in the 1980s''&lt;/ref&gt; (the so-called "designer decade").

One social historian has observed that "the innocuous woollen jersey, now known [in Britain] as the [[Sweater|jumper]] or the pullover, was the first item of clothing to become interchangeable between men and women and, as such, was seen as a dangerous symptom of gender confusion".&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."/&gt; Trousers for women, sometimes worn mannishly as an expression of sexuality (as by [[Marlene Dietrich]] as a  cabaret singer in the 1930 film, ''[[Morocco (1930 film)|Morocco]]'', in which she dressed in a white tie suit and kissed a girl in the audience&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stanley, 'Speaking in Code' in ''History Today'', October 2014 at page 21. Dietrich made clear her personal preference for such clothes: "I do not wear them to be sensational. I think I am much more alluring ..." (quoted, ''ibid.'').&lt;/ref&gt;) also became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, as did aspects of what many years later would sometimes be referred to as "[[shabby chic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabby Chic Accessory Ideas|url=https://www.justlovelyproducts.com/blog-article/shabby-chic-accessory-ideas-for-your-home-11/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]]'s niece [[Clarissa Eden|Clarissa]] was among those who wore a tailored suit in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Clarissa Eden (2007) ''A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Liberation Paris ==
[[Image:Cafe de Flore Paris.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Café de Flore, Saint-Germain-des-Près, Paris: haunt of post-war bohemians]]

===The "New Look"===
After the [[Second World War]] [[Christian Dior]]'s "[[Christian Dior S.A.#The "New Look"|New Look]]", launched in Paris in 1947, though drawing on styles that had begun to emerge in 1938-9,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Phillips in ''Age of Austerity 1945–1951'' (ed. Michael Sissons &amp; Philip French, 1963)
&lt;/ref&gt; set the pattern for women's fashion generally until the 1960s. Harking back in some ways to the ''[[Belle Epoque]]'' of the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and thus not a "new" look as such (by early 1948, it was simply known as "The Look" in America&lt;ref&gt;Norah Alexander in ''Daily Mail'', 13 March 1948. In a cartoon of 1949 [[David Langdon]] had a ''vendeuse'' saying to a customer, "By 'New Look' I take it you mean what we now consider 'Old Look', but not the 'Old Look' which preceded the 'New Look': ''Punch'', 30 March 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;) – it was criticised by some as excessively feminine and, with its accompanying corsets and rustle of frilled [[petticoat]]s, as setting back the "work of emancipation won through participation in two world wars".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It also, for a while, bucked the trend towards boyish fashion that, as after the [[First World War]], tended to follow major conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;With reference to the colourless "utility" garments that became commonplace in Britain during the war, Phillips ''(loc.cit.)'' quotes an expert of the time at London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as asserting that "men will feel oppressed and frightened by excessive [[femininity]] when they return from war".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rive Gauche''===
American influences had been discouraged  during the [[Nazi occupation of France]], but, notably in the form of [[be-bop]] and other types of jazz, were strong among intellectual [[café society]] in the mid-to-late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See Dan Halpern in ''The New Yorker'', 25 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, ''Samedi-Soir'' lifted the lid on what it called the "[[caveman|troglodytes]] of Saint-Germain",&lt;ref&gt;''Samedi-Soir'', 3 May 1947&lt;/ref&gt; namely bohemians of the Parisian [[Left Bank]] (''Rive Gauche'') district of [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], who appeared to cluster around [[existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. These included [[Roger Vadim]] (who married and launched the career of actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the 1950s), novelist [[Boris Vian]] (since described as "the epitome of Left Bank bohemia, standing at the center of its postwar rehabilitation"&lt;ref&gt;Dan Halpern, ''The New Yorker'', 25 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) and singer [[Juliette Gréco]].
[[Image:Juliette Gréco (1963) by Erling Mandelmann - 3.jpg|thumb|right|Juliette Gréco in 1963]]

====Juliette Gréco====
At the [[liberation of Paris]] in 1944, the American journalist [[Ernie Pyle]] observed that the women were all "brightly dressed in white or red blouses and colourful peasant skirts, with flowers in their hair and big flashy earrings."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholas Rankin (2011) ''Ian Fleming's Commandos: The Story of 30 Assault Unit in WWII''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lady Diana Cooper]], whose husband, [[Duff Cooper]], became British Ambassador to Paris that year, wrote that, during the occupation, Parisienne women had worn "grotesquely large hats hung with flowers and fruits and feathers and ribbons" as well as high carved wooden shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, 23 September 1944: ''Darling Monster: The Letters of Lady Diana Cooper to her Son John Julius Norwich 1939-1952'' (ed John Julius Norwich, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to such striking bohemian adornments and subsequently the "New Look" (which itself scandalised some Parisennes), the clothes of the post-war bohemians were predominantly black: when Gréco first performed outside Saint-Germain she affronted some of her audience by wearing "black trousers, her bare feet slipped into golden sandals".&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Beevor]] &amp; Artemis Cooper (1994) ''Paris After the Liberation''&lt;/ref&gt; In old age she claimed that this style of dress arose from [[poverty]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was a teenager in Paris ... I only had one dress and one pair of shoes, so the boys in the house started dressing me in their old black coats and trousers. A fashion was shaped out of misery. When people copied me I found it a little ridiculous, but I didn't mind. It made me smile.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Will Hodgkinson, ''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Performing in London over fifty years later, Gréco was described as "still ooz[ing] bohemian style".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint-Germain in retrospect===
Capturing the spirit of the time, [[David Profumo]] has written of how his mother, the actress [[Valerie Hobson]], was entranced by Roger Vadim's flatmate, the director [[Marc Allégret]], while she was filming ''Blanche Fury'' in 1947:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allégret's apparently bohemian lifestyle appealed sharply to her romantic side ... and she revelled in the Left Bank milieu to which he introduced her during script discussions in Paris. There were meals with [[André Gide]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and the long-legged [[Zizi Jeanmaire]]. For an attractive British woman who felt deprived of attention ... this was an ideal situation for some sort of reawakening.&lt;ref&gt;David Profumo (2006) ''Bringing the House Down''. In contrast to Vadim, who had not turned twenty, Allégret (1900–73) was in middle age when he directed Hobson. He had been married to the daughter of the editor of French ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', who left him after the war for a theatrical agent, André Bernham, taking their daughter with her ''(ibid).'' Jeanmaire is probably best remembered through the second line – "And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire" – of [[Peter Sarstedt]]'s song "[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]" (1969) which captured the spirit of Parisian high life in the late 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The previous year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as "Great Expectations" to coincide with her role as [[Estella Havisham]] in [[David Lean]]'s [[Great Expectations (1946 film)|film]] of that name, based on [[Charles Dickens]]' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of  then-[[Oxford University]] undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for "push-up" pink brassieres.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore (2013) ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography – Volume One: Not for Turning''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'' in London, it was apparent that she had retained a Parisienne mix of ''[[chic (style)|chic]]'' and Boheminism. A ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' journalist described her "pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting", while a young [[Eton School|Etonian]] who visited her dressing room recalled that "it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment".&lt;ref&gt;Eve Champman and Hugo Williams quoted in [[David Kynaston]] (2009) ''Family Britain 1951–57''&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician [[John Profumo]], was involved in a [[Profumo Affair|sex scandal]] that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] wrote that "his [Profumo's] wife is very nice and sensible. Of course, these people live in a raffish, theatrical, bohemian society where no one really knows anyone and everyone is "darling"".&lt;ref&gt;Harold Macmillan, diary, 22 March 1963, quoted in Alistair Horne (1989) ''Harold Macmillan 1957–1986''; Charles Williams (2009) ''Harold Macmillan''&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war Paris was recalled fondly in 2007 when [[Smoking in France|France introduced a ban]] on [[smoking ban|smoking]] in public places. The aroma of [[Gauloises]] and [[Gitanes]] was, for many years, thought to be an inseparable feature of Parisian café society, but the owner of [[Les Deux Magots]], once frequented by Sartre, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]] and other writers, observed that "things have changed. The writers of today are not so addicted to cigarettes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6319133.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Europe - Bidding goodbye to the Gauloises|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British journalist who interviewed Juliette Gréco in 2010 described Les Deux Magots and the Café de Flore as "now overpriced tourist hotspots" and noted that "chain stores and expensive restaurants have replaced the bookshops, cafés and revolutionary ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s Rive Gauche".&lt;ref&gt;Will Hodgkinson, ''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010. Simone de Beauvoir was an [[existentialist]] companion of Sartre. See Bruno Waterfield in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 25 July 2015, regarding the "sanitised" Europe of the early 21st century and its effect on French culture.&lt;/ref&gt; As measures of changing attitudes to [[cuisine]] and fashion, by the early 21st century 80% of French [[croissants]] were being made in food plants, while, by 2014, only one factory continued to manufacture the traditional male [[beret]] associated with printers, artists, political activists and, during the inter-war years, the tennis player [[Jean Borotra]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Waterfield in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 25 July 2015 (reviewing Jonathan Fenby (2015) ''The History of Modern France'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===New influences in 1960s===
The bohemian traits of post-war Paris spread to other urban parts of the French-speaking world, notably to [[Algiers]], where an underground culture of "jazz clubs, girls and drugs" grew up - in the words of [[punk rock]] producer [[Marc Zermati]], who was in the city at the height of the [[Algerian war]] in the late 1950s, "all very French".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''History Today'', March 2015 at page 64 (reviewing Barnett Singer, ''The Americanization of France'').&lt;/ref&gt; However, that war marked a turning point which, in the view of some, was so traumatic that "ordinary French people" looked instead to America  as "a new model for pleasure and happiness".&lt;ref&gt;Hussey, ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, led to the ''[[ye-ye]]'' music of the early to mid 1960s (named after the British band, the [[Beatles]]' use of "yeah, yeah" in some their early songs&lt;ref&gt;Notably ''She Loves You'' ([[John Lennon]]/[[Paul McCartney]], 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;) and the rise of such singers as [[Johnny Halliday]] and [[Françoise Hardy]]. The French also adopted a number of British singers ([[Petula Clark]], [[Gillian Hills]], [[Jane Birkin]]) who performed successfully in French, Birkin forming a long-term relationship with singer/songwriter [[Serge Gainsbourg]], who was a seminal figure in French popular music in the 1960s and 70s. In 1968 major industrial and student unrest in Paris and other parts of France came close to ousting the government of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who, after leading the [[Free French]] during the Second World War, had returned to power at the time of the Algerian emergency. The [[May 1968 events in France|events of 1968]] represented a further significant landmark in post-war France,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Seale &amp; Maureen McConville (1968) ''French Revolution 1968''&lt;/ref&gt; although their longer term impact was probably more on cultural, social and academic life than on the political system, which, through the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (1958), has remained broadly intact.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, Seale &amp; McConville ''(op.cit.)'' described de Gaulle's survival in 1968 as "an amazing demonstration of political virility in a man of 77". He resigned the following year and died in 1970. A later historian contrasted the stature of de Gaulle with "the [[soap opera]] lives" of Presidents [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] (2007-12) and [[François Hollande|Hollande]] (2012-): Jonathan Fenby (2015) ''The History of Modern France: From Revolution to Present Day''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one paradox of 1968 was that the first student demonstrations broke out at [[Nanterre University|Nanterre]], whose catchment area included the affluent and "[[chic]]" 16th and 17th ''arrondissements'' of Paris. Its students were more modish and "trendy" than those of the [[Sorbonne]] in the city's [[Quartier Latin|Latin Quarter]], being described at the time in terms that typify more generally the styles and attitudes of young people the late 1960s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the girls that give the show away - [[culottes]], glossy leather, [[mini skirt|mini-skirts]], boots - driving up in [[Mini|Mini-Coopers]] ... Rebellious sentiment is more obvious among the boys: long hair, square spectacles, [[Che Guevara]] [Cuban revolutionary, died 1967] beards. The picture in Nanterre in May was lots and lots of painted dollies cohabiting with unkempt revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Seale &amp; McConville, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== America: the beat generation and flower power ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Summer of Love]] --&gt;

[[Image:Anna Sui Lumberjack Dress FW 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Snejana Onopka]] on the runway for [[Anna Sui]] in November 2011.]]

In the United States adherents of the "[[Beat generation|beat]]" counter-culture (probably best defined by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s novel, ''[[On the Road]]'', set in the late 1940s, written in 1952 and published in 1957) were associated with black [[polo neck|polo-neck]] (or turtle neck) sweaters, blue denim jeans and sandals. The influence of this movement could be seen in the persona and songs of [[Bob Dylan]] in the early to mid-1960s, "road" films like ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and the [[punk rock|punk]]-oriented "New Wave" of the mid-1970s, which, among other things, produced a boho style icon in [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] of the New York band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], whom photographer [[David LaChapelle]] has described as "the definition of [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lina Das in ''You'' magazine, ''Mail on Sunday'', 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (However, as with some American musicians of the mid-1960s, such as [[Sonny and Cher]], Blondie came to international prominence only after a tour of Britain in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;When the British band the [[Rolling Stones]] arrived in Los Angeles in 1964 they were met by [[Sonny Bono]], who was then doing promotional work for producer [[Phil Spector]]. A year later, he and [[Cher]] were "feted" at the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London and "presented to the world" by [[Ahmet Ertegun]]: see Keith Richards (2010) ''Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Greenwich Village and West Coast===
New York's [[Greenwich Village]], which, since the late 19th century, had attracted many women with [[feminism|feminist]] or "[[free love]]" ideals,&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Mills in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 July 2015 (reviewing Kate Bolick (2015) ''Spinster'')&lt;/ref&gt; was a particular magnet for bohemians in the early 1960s. Bob Dylan's girl-friend [[Suze Rotolo]], who appeared with him on the cover of his second album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963), recalled that the Village was "where people like me went – people who didn't belong where they came from .. where the writers I was reading and the artists I was looking at had lived or passed through".&lt;ref&gt;Suze Rotolo (2009) ''A Freewheelin' Time''&lt;/ref&gt; These "beatniks" (as they came to be known by the late 1950s) were, in many ways, the antecedents of the hippie movement that formed on the West Coast of the USA in the mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;Suze Rotolo observed that "the Beats had already cracked the façade [of constricted and rigid morality] and we, the next generation, broke through it": ''A Freewheelin' Time, op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the fore as the first post-war [[baby-boomers]] reached the age of majority in the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967. The [[Monterey Pop Festival]] was a major landmark of that year, which was associated with [[Flower power|"flowerpower"]], [[psychedelia]], opposition to the [[Vietnam war]] and the inventive music and flowing, colourful fashions of, among others, [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and the British group, [[The Beatles]], whose album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', is said to have caused the guru of psychedelia, [[Timothy Leary]], to remark that "my work is finished".&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Yorker'', 26 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hippiedom and the Pre-Raphaelites===
The documentary film, ''[[Festival (1967 film)|Festival]]'' ([[Murray Lerner]], 1967), recorded how the "clean-cut college kids" who attended the [[Newport Folk Festival|Newport (Rhode Island) Folk Festival]] in 1963-4 had, by 1965 (when [[Electric Dylan controversy|Bob Dylan caused a sensation]] at that year's festival by playing an [[electric guitar]]), become "considerably scruffier": "the hippies were waiting to be born".&lt;ref&gt;Jason Anderson, "This Land is Your Land" in ''Uncut'', September 2015, at p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the wearing of male neckties, which, in the mid-1960s, had often drawn on 19th century paisley patterns,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; declined as [[sideburns|muttonchop]] whiskers and [[sunglasses|teashades]] (sunglasses) came in: by the time of the [[Chicago 7]] trial (late 1969), hair over the collars had become so commonplace that it was beginning to transcend Bohemian style, taking on mass popularity in the 1970s. The London art dealer [[Jeremy Maas]] reflected in the mid-1980s that

&lt;blockquote&gt;there [was] no question that the Hippy ''[sic]'' movement and its repercussive influence in England owed much of its imagery, its manner, dress and personal appearance to the Pre-Raphaelite ideal ... It was observed by all of us who were involved with these exhibitions [of pre-Raphaelite paintings] that visitors included increasing numbers of the younger generation, who had begun to resemble the figures in the pictures they had come to see.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Laurence Des Cars]] (2000) ''[[The Pre-Raphaelites: Romance and Realism]]'', ‘[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]’ series. See also Fiona MacCarthy (2011), ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jimmy Page]] of the British band [[Led Zeppelin]], who collected Pre-Raphaelite paintings, observed of Edward Burne-Jones that "the romance of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends [captured in his paintings] and the bohemian life of the artists who were reworking these stories seemed very attuned to our time",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''History Today'', October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the author David Waller noted in 2011 that Burne-Jones' subjects "have much in common with the sixties rock chicks and their pop-star [[paladin]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''History Today'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== London in the 1950s ==

Although the annual ''[[The Saturday Book|Saturday Book]]'' recorded in 1956 a view that "London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and little bits of girls in jeans",&lt;ref&gt;''Saturday Book'', vol 16, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; the "Edwardian" ("[[teddy boy]]") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, the legacy of the "New Look" was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, "photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late".&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Phillips in ''Age of Austerity'', ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and [[espresso]] bars of [[Soho]] and [[Fitzrovia]]. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; in the words of one social historian, “thousands of pale, [[Duffle Coat|duffel-coat]]-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Sandbrook (2005) ''Never Had It So Good''&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pub|public houses]] and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the [[Colony Room Club]] in Soho, opened in 1948 by [[Muriel Belcher]], a lesbian from [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Parkin (2012) ''Colony Room Club 1948–2008: A History of Bohemian Soho''&lt;/ref&gt; As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called "[[Angry Young Men]]" from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer [[Alma Cogan]] wished to mark her success by buying [[mink]] coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and "a sort of a beatnik".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Dyhouse in ''History Today'', November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 the future author [[Jacqueline Wilson]], who, as a teenager, lived in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]], [[Surrey]], captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a [[record shop]] "in [[turquoise]] duffle coats, extremely tight jeans and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha]] shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, 13 February 1960, quoted in David Kynaston (2014) ''Modernity Britain: A Shake of the Dice, 1959-62''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental influences===
In [[Iris Murdoch]]'s novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), an art student named Dora Greenfield bought "big multi-coloured skirts and jazz records and sandals". However, as Britain emerged from post-war [[austerity]], some Bohemian women found influences from continental Europe, adopting, for example, the "[[gamine]] look", with its black jerseys and short, almost boyish hairstyles associated with film actresses [[Audrey Hepburn]] (''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', 1954, and as a "Gréco beatnik"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Funny Face]]'', 1957) and [[Jean Seberg]] (''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'', 1957 and [[Breathless (1960 film)|''A bout de souffle'']], 1960), as well as the French novelist [[Françoise Sagan]], who, as one critic put it, "was celebrated for the variety of her partners and for driving fast sports cars in bare feet as an example of the free life".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lewis (1978) ''The 50s''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[Fenella Fielding]] played "a mascara-clad Gréco-alike" in ''[[The Rebel (1961 film)|The Rebel]]'' with comedian [[Tony Hancock]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while, more recently, [[Talulah Riley]] replicated the look for scenes in ITV's 2006 adaptation of Agatha Christie's ''[[The Moving Finger]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Part of the ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple|Marple]]'' series, with Riley as Megan Symington.&lt;/ref&gt; set in 1951.

Others favoured the lower-cut, tighter styles of continental stars such as Bardot or [[Gina Lollobrigida]]. Valerie Hobson was among those whose wardrobe drew on Italian ''couture''; in addition to a large collection of [[stiletto heel]]ed shoes, she possessed a skirt made from [[Python (genus)|python]] skin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Davenport-Hines (2013) ''An English Affair''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, European tastes – including the [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] motor scooter and Italian and French cuisine, which the widely travelled cookery writer [[Elizabeth David]], herself a bit of a Bohemian, did much to promote&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''A Book of Mediterranean Food'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; – not only began to pervade Bohemian circles, but offered a contrast, from 1955 onwards, with the brasher Americanism of [[rock 'n' roll]], with its predominantly [[teenager|teenage]] associations.

== Hamburg and Beatlemania ==
[[Image:Don Adams Barbara Feldon Get Smart 1965.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Bobbed hair revival: [[Barbara Feldon]] with [[Don Adams]] in ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1965)]]
In 1960, when the Beatles (then an obscure [[Liverpudlian]] combo with five members, as opposed to their eventual "fab" four) were working in [[Hamburg]], West Germany, they were influenced by a Bohemian "art school" set known as [[Exi (subculture)|''Exis'']] (for "existentialists"). The ''Exis'' were roughly equivalent to what in France became known as ''les beats'' and included photographer [[Astrid Kirchherr]] (for whom the "[[fifth Beatle]]" [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] left the group) and artist and musician [[Klaus Voormann]] (who designed the cover for the Beatles' album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' in 1966).

[[John Lennon]]'s wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]] recalled that Kirchherr was fascinated by the Beatles' "teddy-boy style", but that they, in turn, were "bowled over by her hip black clothes, her ''[[avant garde]]'' way of life, her photography and her sense of style".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lennon (2005) ''John''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the group acquired black leather jackets, as well as fringed [[eponymous hairstyles|hairstyles]] that were the prototype of the "[[mop-top]]" cuts associated with "[[Beatlemania]]" in 1963-4.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Sandbrook, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The latter coincided with the revival of the bobbed style for women, promoted in London by hairdresser [[Vidal Sassoon]],&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hope in ''Telegraph Magazine'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; initially for actress [[Nancy Kwan]], and adopted by, among others, singers [[Cilla Black]],&lt;ref&gt;And replicated by [[Sheridan Smith]] in the ITV [[biopic]], ''[[Cilla (TV series)|Cilla]]'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billie Davis]] and, in America, [[Bev Bivens]] of [[We Five]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], fashion designers [[Mary Quant]] and [[Jean Muir]], American actress [[Barbara Feldon]] in the TV series ''[[Get Smart]]'', and, in the form of a longer bob, [[Cathy McGowan (presenter)|Cathy McGowan]], who presented the influential British TV pop music show, ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' (1963-6).&lt;ref&gt;A similar style to McGowan's was adopted in the early 2010s by British Labour Party politician [[Rachel Reeves]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when longer blonde hair (associated with, among many others, [[Julie Christie]], [[Samantha Juste]], [[Judy Geeson]] and a fashion model named [[Lorna McDonald (model)|Lorna McDonald]], who, at the end of each edition of the BBC's ''Dee Time'', jumped into [[Simon Dee]]'s open [[E-type Jaguar]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wiseman (2006) ''Whatever Happened to Simon Dee?''&lt;/ref&gt;) came to typify the "sixties" look, advertisers turned to the Bohemian world for inspiration: through its use of herbs, [[Sunsilk]] [[shampoo]] was said to have "stolen something from the gypsies".&lt;ref&gt;TV advertisement of 1966: ''Washes Whiter'' (BBC2, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swinging London ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Adam Adamant Lives!]] --&gt;

Beatlemania did not of itself create the apparent [[iconoclasm]] of the 1960s; however, as one writer put it, "just as [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]] reflected the louche, carefree attitude of the [Nineteen] Twenties, so did the Beatles' music capture the rhythm of breaking free experienced by an entire generation of people growing up in the Sixties".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; By the middle of the decade, British pop music had stimulated the fashion boom of what ''Time'' called  “[[swinging London]]”.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 15 April 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Associated initially with such "[[mod (subculture)|mod]]" designs as Quant's [[mini-skirt]], this soon embraced a range of essentially Bohemian styles. These included the military and Victorian fashions popularised by stars who frequented boutiques such as [[Granny Takes a Trip]], the "fusion of fashion, art and lifestyle" opened by [[Nigel Waymouth]] in the [[Kings Road|King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in January 1966,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Times Magazine'', 24 June 2006; David Moss in ''Antiques Trade Gazette'', 27 August 2011 (number 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1967, the hippie look largely imported from America (although, as noted, London stores such as [[Biba]] had, for some time, displayed dresses that drew on Pre-Raphaelite imagery&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCathy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Rolling Stones]]' [[Keith Richards]], whose early girl friend, [[Linda Keith]], had, in her late teens, been a bohemian force in [[West Hampstead]], noted on the Stones' return from an American tour in 1967 how quickly hippiedom had transformed the London scene.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Richards (2010) ''Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victorian imagery===
[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 04.png|thumb|130px|right|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] ([[John Tenniel]])]]
This fusion of influences was discernible in two black-and-white productions for [[BBC]] television in 1966: the series ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'', starring [[Gerald Harper]] as an Edwardian adventurer who had been [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] in time and [[Juliet Harmer]] as [[Georgina Jones]], a stylish "mod" who befriended him, and [[Jonathan Miller]]'s dreamy, rather [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] production of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s mid-Victorian children's fantasy ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;Miller's production starred 13-year-old [[Anne-Marie Mallik]] in her only known acting role.&lt;/ref&gt; (Confirming the aspiration, [[Sydney Newman]], the BBC's Head of Television Drama in the 1960s, reflected of ''Adam Adamant'' that "[they] could never quite get [the] Victorian mentality to contrast with the '60s".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pixley (2006) DVD viewing notes for ''Adam Adamant Lives!''&lt;/ref&gt;)

On the face of it, Carroll (a pseudonym for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) had been a rather conventional and repressed [[Oxford University|Oxford]] [[University don]], but he was a keen and artistic photographer in the early days of that medium (taking, among other things, rather bohemian looking pictures of [[Alice Liddell]] and other young girls)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Winchester (2011) ''The Alice Behind Wonderland''. Alice Liddell, the inspiration for ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', was the daughter of [[Henry Liddell]], Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where Dodgson was a Fellow.&lt;/ref&gt; and he developed an empathy and friendship with several of the Pre-Raphaelites;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Lovett Stoffel (1997) ''Lewis Carroll and Alice'', ‘[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]’ series.&lt;/ref&gt; the sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]] and possibly even Rossetti dissuaded him from illustrating ''Alice'' himself,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lancelyn Green (1960) in ''Aspects of Alice'' (ed. Robert Phliips, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; a task that was undertaken instead by [[John Tenniel]]. The imagery of ''Alice'', both textually and graphically, lent itself well to the psychedelia of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fensch (1968) "Alice – the First Acidhead" in ''Aspects of Alice'', ''op,cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; In America, this was apparent in, among other ways, the "Alice happening" in [[Central Park]], New York (1968) when naked participants covered themselves in [[polka dots]]&lt;ref&gt;Waldemar Januszczak in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the lyrics to [[Grace Slick]]'s song "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]" (1966) – "One pill makes you larger/And one pill makes you small" – that she performed with both the [[The Great Society (band)|Great Society]] and Jefferson Airplane, including with the latter at Woodstock in 1969.

==Women in the late 1960s and early 1970s==
[[Image:1970s Laura Ashley dresses 03.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mid 1970s dresses by Laura Ashley exhibited at the [[Fashion Museum, Bath]] in 2013]]
By the late 1960s shops such as [[Laura Ashley]] (whose first London outlet opened in 1968&lt;ref&gt;The first American branch of Laura Ashley opened in San Francisco in 1974, but had closed by the time a shop opened in New York in 1981 (Laura Ashley products having been sold in [[Bloomingdales]] and [[Macy's]] department stores for some years): Anne Sebba (1990) ''Laura Ashley: a Life By Design''&lt;/ref&gt;) were routinely promoting the "peasant look" and selling a range of "uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to step into a 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found something out of a dressing-up box".&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation in the early part of the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic [[Germaine Greer]] (''[[The Female Eunuch]]'', 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of "[[bra burning]]" in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, ''[[Carry On Girls]]'', and a poster by Young &amp; Rubicam,&lt;ref&gt;Nick Souter &amp; Auart Newman (1987) ''The Postter Handbook''&lt;/ref&gt; one of a mildly subversive series for [[Smirnoff vodka]]: "I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of [[feminist movement|women's "liberation"]].&lt;ref&gt;In 2013 ''[[The Oldie]]'' published a cartoon depicting women [[suffragettes]] of the early 20th century with the caption "... but I'm not sure about this proposal to burn our [[whalebone]] corsets" (''Oldie'', February 2013). A pragmatic 21st-century view was that "feminism is not about burning your bra in the street. It is about [among other things] women getting up in the morning and leaving the house to go to a job that pays them an actual wage ..." (Laura Smith, letter in ''Metro'', 30 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Vermont]] lawyer later observed wryly that "like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra", but that "now it's the nineties ... I realize [[Playtex]] [underwear manufacturer] had supported me better than any man I know."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sweetser, quoted in ''Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations'' (5th edition, ed Gyles Brandreth, 2013) 119:13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Perry]], who became a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a "women's officer" at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was "a bra-burning feminist with a hideous [[new romantic|new-romantic]] haircut", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Rachel Sylvester &amp; Alice Thomson, ''The Times'', 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Girl power"===
By the mid-1980s, the American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had turned the bra into a positive, even provocative, fashion statement. Madonna's flamboyant and gritty style (notably seen to bohemian effect alongside [[Rosanna Arquette]] in the 1985 film, ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'') was, in turn, a precursor of so-called "[[girl power]]" that was associated in the 1990s with various prominent young women (such as singers [[Courtney Love]], who played the 1999 [[Glastonbury Festival]] in a headline-grabbing pink bra,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and the more commercially oriented [[Spice Girls]]) and offbeat or quirky American television series (''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Caroline in the City]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'').

==Since the 1960s: hippie/boho-chic==
{{main article|Boho-chic}}

[[File:She &amp; Him at NFF.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Zooey Deschanel]] (left) with [[M. Ward]], [[Newport Folk Festival]], 2008]]
Journalist Bob Stanley remarked that "the late 1960s are never entirely out of fashion, they just need a fresh angle to make them ''de jour''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the features of hippie fashion re-emerged at various stages during the ensuing forty years.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, variants of the short and fundamentally un-Bohemian [[rah-rah skirt]] (which originated with [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]]) were combined with leather or demin to create a look with some Bohemian or even [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] features (for example, by the singing duo [[Strawberry Switchblade]] who took inspiration from 1970s [[punk fashion]]&lt;ref&gt;Photographs for album, ''Since Yesterday'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;). In the 1990s the term, "hippie [[chic (style)|chic]]", was applied to [[Tom Ford]]’s collections for the Italian house of [[Gucci]]. These drew on, among other influences, the style, popular in retrospect, of [[Talitha Getty]] (died 1971), actress wife of [[John Paul Getty III|John Paul Getty]] and step-granddaughter of Dorelia McNeil, who was represented most famously in a photograph of her and her husband taken by [[Patrick Lichfield]] in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Lichfield (1981) ''The Most Beautiful Women''. See http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/guccis-cruise-wear-for-earth-mamas/3399&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling the influx of hippies into Marrakesh in 1968, [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]], then editor of ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', wrote that "the dapper drifters in embroidered skirts and [[cowboy boots]] were so delighted by the bright satin '50s underwear favoured by the matrons of Marrakesh that they wore them outside their denims à la Madonna [the singer] twenty-five years later".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Neville (1995) ''Hippie Hippie Shake''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, "boho-chic" was associated initially with supermodel [[Kate Moss]] and then, as a highly popular style in 2004-5, with actress [[Sienna Miller]]. In America similar styles were sometimes referred to as "[[Bourgeois bohemian|bobo]]-" or "ashcan chic", or "[[luxe grunge]]", their leading proponents including actresses [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] and [[Zooey Deschanel]]. As if to illustrate the cyclical nature of fashion, by the end of the [[noughties]] strong pre-Raphaelite traits were notable in, among others, singer [[Florence Welch]], model [[Karen Elson]] and designer [[Anna Sui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/style/celebrity-fashion/kate-middleton-wears-aw15-anna-7740620 |title=Kate Middleton wears AW15 Anna Sui as she changes into a floaty maxi dress for National Park visit |last1=Stacey |first1=Danielle |last2= |first2= |date=April 12, 2016 |website=mirror.co.uk |publisher=Mirror |access-date=November 3, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, terms like ''Bionade-Bourgeoisie'', ''[[Bionade-Biedermeier]] or'' ''Biohème'' refer to former Bohemians that gained a sort of [[Cultural hegemony]] with their  [[LOHAS|LOHA]] lifestyle&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Kathrin Hartmann|Title=Ende der Märchenstunde: Wie die Industrie die Lohas und Lifestyle-Ökos vereinnahmt |Publisher=Karl Blessing Verlag|ISBN=978-3-641-03632-4|language=German|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zkkq2wcc9AC|Format= books.google.com|AccessDate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;- The phenomen of such former (young) bohemians becoming establishment during the years is a typical aspect of [[gentrification]] processes.

'''''Breaking Home Ties''''' is a [[painting]] by American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]], created for the September 25, 1954, cover of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The picture represents a father and son waiting for a train that will take the young man to the [[State university system|state university]]. The painting, considered by experts to be one of Rockwell's masterworks, is also one of the most widely reproduced, and was voted the second-most popular image in ''Post'' history.&lt;ref name=vogel1/&gt;

==Description==
The details of the picture, as with most of Rockwell's works, combine to tell a story, in this case a story of endings and beginnings, as a boy from [[New Mexico]] leaves home for the first time. The young man and his father sit on the running board of the family's stakesided farm truck. The ticket protruding from the son's pocket, and the single rail visible at the lower corner of the painting, by which the trio sit, suggest that they are at a [[whistle stop]] waiting for the [[train]].

The son's books are stacked on a new [[suitcase]] bearing a "[[State university system|State U]]" [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]]. With his tie and socks perfectly matched, wearing pressed white trousers and matching jacket, he is ready for his new life in [[Higher education in the United States|college]]. The young man's shoes are shined to a polished gleam, as, hands folded, and with the family dog resting his head in his lap, his gaze focuses eagerly toward the horizon, and on the next chapter in his life.

In contrast, the father sits slumped with both his and his son's hats clutched in his hand, as if reluctant to let him go. The direction of his gaze is opposite to his son's. The tag from a [[Bull_Durham_Smoking_Tobacco|Bull Durham]] tobacco satchel dangles, near at hand, from his shirt pocket. There is a red flag and a [[lantern]] at the ready, near his right hand, atop a well-used trunk. With the son's luggage unloaded and waiting next to them, there is nothing left for him to do but signal the train to stop, and his pose suggests that he is looking up the track, dreading the imminent arrival of the train that will carry his son away.

Though the two figures are not looking at each other, the sense of family ties is very strong in this iconic 1954 painting.

==History==
The painting was shown in many locations over many years, including [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in 1955, and in [[Moscow]] and [[Cairo]] in 1964. It was also the inspiration for an eponymous 1987 TV movie, featuring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Doug McKeon]] as the father and son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093647/ |title=Breaking Home Ties |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10956544/rockwell_painting_is_films_inspiration/ |title=Rockwell painting is film's inspiration |agency=[[Gannett Company|Gannett News Service]] |newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] |date=October 10, 1987 |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the painting was put on display at the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]], which was its first public showing in over 25 years. Despite some experts noticing discrepancies between the painting on display and the published ''Post'' image, the painting on display was believed to be the original.&lt;ref name=newport&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Sean |title=Exhibit explores what’s behind the walls |url=http://www.newportri.com/newportdailynews/news/page_one/exhibit-explores-what-s-behind-the-walls/article_0d660ca7-70ee-5ecc-8581-61c2b2de28f1.html |newspaper=[[Newport Daily News]] |location=[[Newport, Rhode Island]] | date=June 11, 2016 | accessdate=May 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finding the original===
In 1962, the painting had been purchased for $900 by cartoonist [[Don Trachte]], a friend of Rockwell's, and was in his ownership until his death in May 2005. In March 2006, two of his sons found a hidden area in Trachte's house, which contained several paintings, including ''Breaking Home Ties''. Further investigation found that Trachte had created copies of several paintings he owned, and hidden the originals, unknown to his family.  Thus, the ''Breaking Home Ties'' that had been put on display at the Norman Rockwell Museum in 2003, was actually a replica.&lt;ref name=newport /&gt; The museum later placed the original on display, along with the replica.&lt;ref name=vogel1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/arts/design/no-flattery-is-found-in-an-imitation-of-a-rockwell.html |title=No Flattery Is Found in an Imitation of a Rockwell |first=Carol |last=Vogel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 sale===
On November 29, 2006, [[Sotheby's]] sold the original painting at auction for $15.4 million, which at the time was a record sum paid for a Rockwell work. The buyer or buyers chose to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name=vogel2&gt;{{cite news | last = Vogel | first = Carol | title = $15.4 Million at Sotheby’s for a Rockwell Found Hidden Behind a Wall | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = November 30, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/nyregion/30rockwell.html | accessdate = April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives a score of 68% based on reviews from 120 critics. Its consensus state that "What ''Cadillac Records'' may lack in originality, it more than makes up for in strong performances and soul-stirring music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cadillac_records/ | title=Cadillac Records | publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggretator, [[Metacritic]], gave the film a 65% approval rating based on 30 reviews classifying that the film has "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/cadillacrecords | title=Cadillac Records (2008):Reviews | publisher= [[CBS]] | work = Metacritic | accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave the film three stars and stated in his review that "The film is a fascinating record of the evolution of a black musical style, and the tangled motives of the white men who had an instinct for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081203/REVIEWS/812039993 | title=Cadillac Records - Roger Ebert Review | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' awarded the film three stars and wrote in her review, "Writer-director Darnell Martin clearly respects the fact that the history of Chess Records is a worthy subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/12/05/2008-12-05_cadillac_records_takes_a_greatesthits_ap.html | title='Cadillac Records' takes a greatest-hits approach | publisher=New York Daily News | accessdate=2008-12-07 | first=Elizabeth | last=Weitzman | date=December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics praised the film for its music, but complained about its script. Jim Harrington of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' praised Beyoncé's vocal performance and wrote in his review that, "[[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]]' captivating voice and the film's other pluses can't outweigh the glaring omissions from the story line for this critic" and "Chess Records deserves, and will hopefully someday get, a better spin than the one delivered by ''Cadillac Records''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/tv/ci_11138574 | title='Cadillac Records': Good music, shaky history | publisher=Mercury News | date=December 5, 2008 | accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic inscribed stones''' are stone monuments dating from 400 to 1000 AD. They are inscribed with [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or [[Latin]] text, which can be written in [[Ogham inscription|Ogham]] or [[Latin script|Roman]] letters. Some stones have both Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The stones are found in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]], the [[Isle of Man]], and parts of western [[England]] (mainly [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Lundy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/ |title=Celtic Inscribed Stones Project history |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They relate to other standing stones with decoration, such as the [[Turoe Stone]] and [[Castlestrange Stone]].

'''''Chalk Cliffs on Rügen''''' ({{lang-de|Kreidefelsen auf Rügen}}) is an [[oil painting]] of circa 1818 by [[German Romantic]] artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]].

==Development==
In January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in [[Neubrandenburg]] and [[Greifswald]]. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of [[Rügen]] with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union.

==Description==
The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the [[Stubbenkammer]], at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the ''[[Wissower Klinken]]'' outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of [[erosion]]. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article495995/Am_Ende_bleibt_nur_die_Kunst.html Uta Baier: ''Am Ende bleibt nur die Kunst - Die Wissower Klinken und Caspar David Friedrich''], article in Die ''[[Die Welt|Welt]]'' of 26 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kreidefelsen 1010.jpg|thumb|left|A later variation on the theme; watercolor, 1824, 25 × 32 cm]]

Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself.&lt;ref name="HBS"&gt;Helmut Börsch-Supan: ''Caspar David Friedrich.'' 4. erweiterte und überarbeitete Auflage, Prestel, Munich 1987, {{ISBN|3-7913-0835-1}}, p 118&lt;/ref&gt; His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him—the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men.&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline)&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures—whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear.

The colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian [[theological virtues]]: faith, hope and love.&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt; The art historian Helmut Börsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: "clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood".&lt;ref name="HBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"deutlich [...] wie kaum zuvor, zugleich aber auch in einer selten heiteren Stimmung"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6069">[[File:Gerolamo Induno - Autoritratto.jpg|thumb|215px|Self-portrait (date unknown)]]
'''Gerolamo Induno''' (13 December 1825 – 18 December 1890) was an Italian painter and soldier, best known for his military scenes. His older brother, [[Domenico Induno|Domenico]], was also a well-known artist and they often worked together.

==Biography==
He was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the [[Brera Academy]], where he studied with [[Luigi Sabatelli]] from 1839 to 1846.&lt;ref name="U"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(L'Unificazione)/ Biographical notes] from L'Unificazione (2011) @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] (now lost).&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Biography and appreciation] form Dizionario Biorafico, (2004) @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the [[Five Days of Milan]] and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in [[Ticino]], then returned and settled in Florence.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General [[Giacomo Medici (general)|Giacomo Medici]] and fought against the French during their [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war.
[[File:Artgate Fondazione Cariplo - Induno Gerolamo, La partenza del garibaldino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Departure of the Garibaldino, 1860 ([[Fondazione Cariplo]])]]
While engaged in the defense of the {{ill|Villa del Vascello|it}}, near [[Porta San Pancrazio]], he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long  recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count [[Giulio Litta]], a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the [[Risorgimento]], as well as [[Genre art|genre]] works, influenced by his brother.

From 1854 to 1855, during the [[Crimean War]], he was back in uniform; this time with the [[Bersaglieri]] of [[Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora|Alessandro La Marmora]]. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the [[Battle of the Chernaya]] that was purchased by King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; Some of his works were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the [[Hunters of the Alps]] and came to be recognized by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes.

During the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new [[Milano Centrale railway station]] (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the "{{ill|Plebisciti risorgimentali|it|lt=Plebiscite}} of Naples" for the theater in [[Gallarate]]. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the [[Battle of Magenta]], but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked.&lt;ref name="U" /&gt;

After unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is "A Game of Chess", a scene from a play of the same name by [[Giuseppe Giacosa]]. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.

==Release==
In March 2015 the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) refused to issue a certificate to the film for a [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] release, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the Board's carefully considered conclusion that the unremitting manner in which [the film] focuses on physical and sexual abuse, aggravated by racist invective, means that to issue a classification to this work, even if confined to adults, would be inconsistent with the Board's Guidelines, would risk potential harm, and would be unacceptable to broad public opinion.&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/hate-crime-vod|title=HATE CRIME {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Cullen Bressack commented that he was "honoured to know that [his] mind is officially too twisted for the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/03/02/james-cullen-bressacks-hate-crime-banned-by-the-bbfc/|title=Nerdly » James Cullen Bressack's 'Hate Crime' banned by the BBFC|last=Wheat|first=Phil|date=2015-03-02|website=www.nerdly.co.uk|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/simon-thompson/hate-crime-why-censors-ar_b_6799332.html|title=Hate Crime: Why Censors Are Right to Ban the Anti-Semitic Horror|last=Thompson|first=Simon|date=2015-03-04|work=[[HuffPost UK]]|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; reacted positively to the ban, Bressack stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a Jewish man, and a victim of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] hate, I made a horror film that depicts the very thing that haunts my dreams. As an artist I wanted to tell a story to remind us that we live in a dangerous world; a world where racial violence is on the rise. It saddens me to learn that censorship is still alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/03/09/uk-hate-crime-ban-james-cullen-bressack-responds/|title=Nerdly » UK 'Hate Crime' ban – James Cullen Bressack responds|last=Wheat|first=Phil|date=2015-03-09|website=www.nerdly.co.uk|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''House of the Centenary''' (Italian '''''Casa del Centenario''''', also known as the '''House of the Centenarian''') was the house of a wealthy resident of [[Pompeii]], preserved by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. The house was discovered in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;Massimiliano David, "A Chronology of the Excavations in Pompeii," in ''Houses and Monuments of Pompeii: The Works of Fausto and Felice Niccolini'' (Getty, 2002, originally published in Italian 1997), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and was given its modern name to mark the 18th [[wikt:centenary|centenary]] of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[August Mau]], ''Pompeii: Its Life and Art'', translated by Francis W. Kelsey (Macmillan, 1907), p. 348; Roger Ling, "A Stranger in Town: Finding the Way in an Ancient City," ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 37 (1990), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the mid-2nd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmina F. Jashemski, "The Vesuvian Sites before A.D. 79: The Archaeological, Literary, and Epigraphical Evidence," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 7; Jean Pierre Adam, ''Roman Building: Materials and Techniques'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; it is among the largest houses in the city, with [[thermae|private baths]], a [[nymphaeum]],&lt;ref&gt;James L. Franklin, Jr., ''Pompeis Difficile Est: Studies in the Political Life of Imperial Pompeii'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0igfF0rWIAC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22Casa+del+Centenario%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Loi6Tv_JF8argweI_v3eCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Casa%20del%20Centenario%22&amp;f=false p. 147.]&lt;/ref&gt; a fish pond ''(piscina)'',&lt;ref&gt;James Higginbotham, ''Piscinae: Artificial Fishponds in Roman Italy'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1997), pp. 22, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]].&lt;ref&gt;Michele George, "Repopulating the Roman House," in ''The Roman Family in Italy: Status, Sentiment, Space'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 307; Adam, ''Roman Building'', p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; The Centenary underwent a remodeling around 15 AD, at which time the bath complex and swimming pool were added. In the last years before the eruption, several rooms had been extensively redecorated with a number of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.–A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the identity of the house's owner eludes certainty, arguments have been made for either Aulus Rustius Verus or [[Tiberius Claudius Verus]], both local politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Mau, ''Pompeii: Its Life and Art'', p. 559, was a proponent of Claudius Verus, citing ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' IV.5229. Matteo Della Corte argued for Rusticus Verus, as discussed by Franklin, ''Pompeis Difficile Est,'' p. 134. Franklin finds Rusticus more likely than Claudius.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the varied paintings preserved in the House of the Centenary is the earliest known depiction of Vesuvius,&lt;ref&gt;Annamaria Ciarallo, ''Gardens of Pompeii'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2001), p. 22; Haraldur Sigurdsson, "Mount Vesuvius before the Disaster," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as explicit erotic scenes in a room that may have been designed as a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Private sex clubs|private "sex club"]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World: A Study of Social History and the Brothel'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004), pp. 164–165. The room is most often taken to be one of the bedrooms ''(cubicula)'', which are sometimes decorated with erotic art in private Roman houses.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site and features==
For the purposes of archaeological and historical study, Pompeii is divided into nine regions, each of which contains numbered blocks ''(insulae)''. Within a block, doorways are numbered in clockwise or counter-clockwise order;&lt;ref&gt;Ling, "A Stranger in Town," p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; the Centenary is numbered IX.8.3–6.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Gutzwiller, "Seeing Thought: Timomachus' ''Medea'' and Ecphrastic Epigram," ''American Journal of Philology'' 125 (2004), p. 376 (= Schmidt 13).&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the luxurious "[[tuff|tufa]]" period of Pompeiian architecture, characterized by the use of fine-grained gray volcanic tufa that was quarried around [[Nuceria]].&lt;ref&gt;Jashemski, "The Vesuvian Sites before A.D. 79," p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the two atria, the grander one leads to the most highly decorated rooms. The smaller atrium might have been for private family and service access.&lt;ref&gt;George, "Repopulating the Roman House," p. 307; Adam, ''Roman Building'', p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[triclinium]] or dining room was situated so that the guest of honor could view the enclosed garden.&lt;ref&gt;See a plan of the house with the view as construed by John R. Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.–A.D. 250: Ritual, Space, and Decoration'' (University of California Press, 1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q7qcegqaRYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22plan+and+reconstruction+of+the+guest+of+honor's+view+from+the+triclinium+of+the+house+of+the+centenary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BpDBTs6gN4Ps2QWL6pyzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22plan%20and%20reconstruction%20of%20the%20guest%20of%20honor's%20view%20from%20the%20triclinium%20of%20the%20house%20of%20the%20centenary%22&amp;f=false p. 18.]&lt;/ref&gt; The dining room itself was decorated with vertical stalks entwined with tendrils on which birds perch, with leaf-adorned candelabra in the panels between.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ling, ''Roman Painting'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991, 2006), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The house had its own bakery, located in a cellar under the service quarters on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Franklin, ''Pompeii: The Casa del Marinario and Its History'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1990), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clarke Ars Erotica 04.jpg|thumb|left|Erotic painting on the wall of the "sex club", with damage revealing brickwork under the painted panels]]
A graffito in the [[latrine]] uses the rare word ''cacaturit''&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 4.5242.&lt;/ref&gt; ("wants to shit") found also once in the ''Epigrams'' of [[Martial]].&lt;ref&gt;Martial, 11.77: "In privies Vacerra consumes the hours; the whole day does she sit; Vacerra wants to dine, she does not want to shit ''(In omnibus Vacerra quod conclavibus / consumit horas et die toto sedet, / cenaturit Vacerra, non cacaturit)''; Craig Williams, ''A Martial Reader: Selections from the Epigrams'' (Bolchazy-Carducci, 2011), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Another records a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]]'s bid for freedom: "Officiosus escaped on November 6 of the [[Roman consul#Consular dating|consulate]] of [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus Caesar]] and [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul AD 15)|M. Junius Silanus]]" (15 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' IV.5214; Antonio Varone, "Voices of the Ancients: A Stroll through Public and Private Pompeii," in ''Rediscovering Pompeii''  («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1990), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that one secluded room (numbered 43), which was decorated with explicit scenes of female-male intercourse, functioned as a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Private sex clubs|private "sex club."]] Guests would have entered the smaller, more private atrium, then passed down a corridor and through a triclinium  and antechamber to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution,'' pp. 164–165; discussion of his theory of "sex clubs" in general at Pompeii, pp. 157–166, including literary evidence. McGinn finds the House of the Centenary along with the [[House of the Vettii]] to offer the best examples of potential sex-club facilities. See also Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 161ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A few similar rooms in Pompeiian houses suggest that the intention was to create the ambience of a brothel in a home, for parties at which participants played the roles of [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute or client]], or for which actual prostitutes were hired to entertain guests.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution'', p. 158–159. Some houses had suites that may have functioned as actual brothels; these, however, were like an attached shop ''([[taberna]])'' that might be leased out for business. They lacked interior access to the house, and had only an entrance to the street to admit paying clients indiscriminately.&lt;/ref&gt; A small opening oddly positioned in the wall may have been an aperture for voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999), pp. 39–40. Pollini describes the room as a "private brothel".&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars categorize Room 43 simply as a bedroom ''(cubiculum)'', which often featured erotic imagery,&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Spivey and Michael Squire, ''Panorama of the Classical World'' (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004), p. 56; William E. Dunstan, ''Ancient Rome'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2011), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; and find it unnecessary to conclude that sexual entertainment was offered to guests there.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Centenario - Nymphaeum.jpg|thumb|Painting of a fountain, from the nymphaeum]]

The House of the Centenary is known for its large and diverse collection of paintings in the Third and Fourth [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeiian styles]]. The garden nymphaeum is a particularly rich example of combining painting with architectural elements to create the ambience of a [[Roman villa|country villa]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kondoleon, ''Domestic and Divine: Roman Mosaics in the House of Dionysos'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; A body of water filled with a variety of fish and marine animals was "dramatically" painted on the parapet that encircled the four walls of the nymphaeum; several species are represented accurately enough to identify.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Reese, "Marine Invertebrates, Freshwater Shells, and Land Snails: Evidence from Specimens, Mosaics, Wall Paintings, Sculpture, Jewelry, and Roman Authors," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', pp. 275, 281–282, 284, 290, 302, 305, 309, 310; Liliane Bodson and David Orr, "Amphibians and Reptiles: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Mosaics, Sculpture, Skeletal Remains, and Ancient Authors," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', pp. 330, 333, 338, 340, 342.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of the wall is painted to look like a [[balustrade]] with ivy growing on it, with birds and lizards below. Fountains with [[sphinx]] bases are painted within garden scenes to the sides, and the wall around the entrance depicts game parks; in the foreground is a real fountain, with a faux finish to look like rare marble, from which the water would have run down tiers into a basin.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: Public and Private Life,'' translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider (Harvard University Press, 1998, originally published 1995 in German), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Below the steps and above the garden pool, there was a painting of a river god crowned with reeds, no longer visible.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhemina F. Jashemski, Frederick G. Meyer, and Massimo Ricciardi, "Plants: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Mosaics, Sculpture, Plant Remains, Graffiti, Inscriptions, and Ancient Authors," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition has been characterized as a "grotesque potpourri", an assemblage of elements desirable because they represent the country villa lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, ''Pompeii: Public and Private Life'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Here and in similarly decorated spaces in Pompeii, the owner is concerned with displaying size and quantity and not a harmonious whole.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, ''Pompeii: Public and Private Life'', pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The room to the north of the [[peristyle]] featured delicate ivy and stylized flowering vines as decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Jashemski, Meyer, and Ricciardi, "Plants," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Ducks and lotus leaves also appear together as decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Jashemski, Meyer, and Ricciardi, "Plants," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Grapes and viticulture appear throughout the house, as in a scene of cupids gathering grapes.&lt;ref&gt;Jashemski, Meyer, and Ricciardi, "Plants," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The hunting paintings are by the Pompeiian painter Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A Catalog of Identifiable Figure Painters of Ancient Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Mythological painting===

Mythological subjects include [[Theseus]] as victor over the [[Minotaur]], [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Hermaphroditism and androgyny|Hermaphroditus and Silenus]],&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''A Catalog of Identifiable Figure Painters,'' p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hercules]] and [[Telephus]], and of [[Orestes]] and [[Pylades]] before [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]].&lt;ref&gt;James Zetzel, "Plato with Pillows: Cicero on the Uses of Greek Culture," in ''Myth, History and Culture in Republican Rome: Studies in Honour of T.P. Wiseman'' (University of Exeter Press, 2003), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Another room features [[Selene]] and [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], a ''Venus Piscatrix'' ("[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] the Fisherwoman"), and "floating nymphs."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''A Catalog of Identifiable Figure Painters'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bacchus and Vesuvius====
A painting in the house's ''[[lararium]]'', a shrine to the [[Household deity|household gods]] the [[Lares]], depicts Vesuvius as it may have looked before the eruption,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmina F. Jashemski, "Recently Excavated Gardens and Cultivated Land of the Villas at Boscoreale and Oplontis," in ''Ancient Roman Villa Gardens'' (Dumbarton Oaks, 1987), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; with a single vineyard-covered peak instead of the double-peak profile of today. Although some scholars reject the single-peak hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto De Carolis and Giovanni Patricelli, ''Vesuvius, A.D. 79: The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum'' (Getty Publications, 2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; the painting is generally regarded as the earliest known representation of the volcano,&lt;ref&gt;Annamaria Ciarallo, ''Gardens of Pompeii'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2001), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; even if it should not be taken as a record of what Vesuvius actually looked like.&lt;ref&gt;De Carolis and Patricelli, ''Vesuvius, A.D. 79,'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary sources also describe Vesuvius as covered in grape vines before the eruption. [[Plutarch]] says that vines had grown on it in the 1st century BC, when [[Spartacus]] and his fellow slaves had taken refuge there and cut them down to make rope ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Crassus'' 9.2, as cited by David Sider, ''The Library of the Villa dei Papiri at Heculaneum'' (Getty Publications, 2005), p. 12. Vergil also mentions the vines on the slopes of Vesuvius at ''Georgics'' 2.221–224, as cited by Colin Wells, ''The Roman Empire'' (Harvard University Press, 1984), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The description by the poet [[Martial]] evokes the painting, which shows vines on the slopes in [[quincunx]] arrangement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Here Vesuvius is shaded green with vines; here the noble grape had exuded its juices in vats: these are the ridges which Bacchus loved more than the hills of [[Nysa (Caria)|Nysa]].''&lt;ref&gt;Martial 4.44.1–3: ''Hic est pampineis viridis modo Vesbius umbris, / presserat hic madidos nobilis uua lacus: / haec iuga quam Nysae colles plus Bacchus amavit;'' Jashemski, "Recently Excavated Gardens," p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unusual depiction of Bacchus gives him a body composed of grapes,&lt;ref&gt;De Carolis and Patricelli, ''Vesuvius, A.D. 79,'' p. 43; Jashemski, "Recently Excavated Gardens," p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; which may represent either the [[Ancient Rome and wine#Grape varieties|Aminaea variety]] grown in the area or the eponymous Pompeianum.&lt;ref&gt;Originally known as Murgentina; Alex Butterworth and [[Ray Laurence]], ''Pompeii: The Living City'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; He carries a [[thyrsus]] and has a panther at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' (Blackwell, 1996, originally published 1951 in French), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground is a crested and bearded serpent that embodies the [[Agathodaemon]] or [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Amery and Brian Curran, ''The Lost World of Pompeii'' (Getty Publications, 2002), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre allusions===
[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Centenario - Orest.jpg|thumb|upright|Scene from ''Iphigenia in Tauris'']]

Some of the mythological paintings, including one of [[Medea]], are thought to represent scenes from the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]]. The painting of Hercules may be a scene from the ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Hercules Furens]]'' of either [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Elliot Rutenberg, ''Oedipus of Lucius Annaeus Seneca'' (Bolchazy-Carducci, 1998), p. 28; Éric Csapo, "Mise en scène théâtrale, scène de théâtre artisanale: les mosaïques de Ménandre à Mytilène, leur contexte social et leur tradition iconographique," in ''De la scène aux gradins: théâtre et représentations dramatiques après Alexandre le Grand'' (Presses universitaires du Miral, 1997), pp. 169, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Euripides]]; the other figures would thus be [[Amphitryon]], [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]], and [[Lycus (descendant of Lycus)|Lycus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ling, ''Roman Painting'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; A scene from ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' shows Pylades, Orestes, and Iphigenia.

Another theatrical reference is found in a graffito scrawled on the wall between the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (a bath maintained at a pleasantly warm temperature) and the ''[[caldarium]]'' (an environment more like a steam bath). Reading ''histrionica Actica'',&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 4.5233; John H. Starks, Jr., "Pantomime Actresses in Latin Inscriptions," ''New Directions in Ancient Pantomime'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; "Actica the pantomime,"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase has been read in various ways; ''Actica'' may not be a proper name as such, but an adjectival name of the troupe. As the feminine form of ''histrio'' (originally actor, but by this time pantomime), ''histrionica'' is a ''[[hapax legomenon]]''; Slater, "Pantomime Actresses," p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has been interpreted as a record of fan infatuation, and perhaps an indication that the house hosted performances by theatre troupes.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, "Pantomime Actresses," p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic scenes===
Pompeiian bedrooms were not infrequently decorated with scenes referring to lovemaking, sometimes explicitly human, and sometimes allusive and mythological.

[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Centenario - Cubiculum - Love scene from north wall.jpg|reverse Venus|thumb|left|upright=.75|Painting illustrating the uncommon "reverse upright Venus" position]]
One bedroom at the Centenary features a pair of scenes referring to love affairs between a mortal and a divinity: Selene and Endymion, and [[Cassandra]] with a laurel branch symbolizing her rejection of [[Apollo]] as a lover and his revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Verity Platt, ''Facing the Gods: Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; The "sex club" has both: it is decorated with a painting of Hercules surrounded by ''[[amorini]]'', as well two "pornographic" scenes ''(symplegma)'' similar to those found in brothels.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''A Catalog of Identifiable Figure Painters'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman "pornography" (literally "depiction of prostitutes") focuses on human figures in everyday settings, often with detailed and realistic bedding.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World'', p.112ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both pornographic images in Room 43 show a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Mulier equitans|woman on top]] of a man, one facing him, and the other in the less common "reverse upright Venus" [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex acts and positions|position]], facing away from the man. In the former image, both figures are nude, except that the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Breasts|woman's breasts are covered]] with a strapless "bra" ''(strophium)''; even in the most explicit depictions of sex acts in Roman art, the woman is often wearing the ''strophium''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 73. Fuller description by Clarke, p. 161ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The rarer "reverse upright Venus" position is more often found in scenes set in [[wikt:Nilotic|Nilotic]] [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul G.P. Meyboom and Miguel John Versluys, "The Meaning of Dwarfs in Nilotic Scenes," in ''Nile into Tiber: Egypt in the Roman World. Proceedings of the IIIrd International Conference of Isis Studies, Leiden, May 11–14, 2005'' (Brill, 2007), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hunterheugh Crags''' are part of the Fellsandstone escarpment, {{convert|5|mi|0}} north west of [[Alnwick]], [[Northumberland]], [[England]] and {{convert|9|mi|0}} from the coast. The site is [[moorland]] forming part of the [[Bewick and Beanley Moors SSSI]], although prior to the Bronze Age it is likely to have been thickly forested with [[broadleaf]] [[deciduous]] trees. This site is most famous for the [[cup and ring mark]] art present on the outcrop.

==Place-name meaning==
Hunterheugh derives from Old English ''huntor'' "[[hunting|hunter]]" and ''hoh'' "hill-spur".

== Rock art ==
The first phase of the carvings is all on the natural rock surface and these are now very heavily weathered. The motifs incorporate undulations of the surface into their design so that most are connected to each other by artificial grooves or by a natural rock slope which allows water to flow from one design to the next. This phase is believed to be [[Neolithic]], and probably early Neolithic at that. This is supported by the discovery of what appears to be a broken sandstone axehead 1.2 m from the carved rock outcrop at the base of the topsoil. Such ground and polished axeheads are known from elsewhere in [[Northumberland]].

Phase 1 of the carvings was broken through when the rock dome was quarried at a later date. New carvings were then made on the surfaces exposed by quarrying. These show no attempt to take undulations and variations in the rock (with one exception), none of the designs are inter-connected, and the shapes are more varied and more crudely executed. This phase is believed to be Early [[Bronze Age]] in date and appears to imitate the earlier tradition, but does not share the same sense of positioning.

'''Jai Hind''' ({{Lang-hi|जय हिन्द}}) ({{Lang-bn|জয় হিন্দ}}) is a salutation, slogan, and [[battle cry]] most commonly used in [[India]] to indicate [[patriotism]] towards India (also known as [[Etymology of India|Hind]]). It translates roughly to "Victory to India"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A comprehensive history of modern India |last= Chopra |first= Pram Nath |year= 2003 |publisher= [[Sterling Publishing]]  |isbn= 81-207-2506-9 |page= 283 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RAON5AW4yUEC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=jai+hind+victory+to+india&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=jai%20hind%20victory%20to%20india&amp;f=false |accessdate= 17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Long live India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rise and Fall of the British Empire |last= James |first= Lawrence |year= 1997 |publisher= Macmillan  |isbn= 978-0-312-16985-5&lt;!-- 8120725069--&gt; |page= 548 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4DMS3r_BxOYC&amp;pg=RA4-PA548-IA8&amp;dq=jai+hind+long+live+india&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=jai%20hind%20long%20live%20india&amp;f=false |accessdate= 17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined and was used by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]]&lt;ref name=amzn-brothers&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Against-Raj-Leonard-Gordon/dp/0231074433|title=Brothers Against the Raj|author=Leonard A.

==In popular culture==
A follower of Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], Ramchandra Moreshwar Karkare, of [[Gwalior|Gwalher]] (Gwalior) Madhya Bharat, wrote a patriotic drama ''Jai Hind'' in March 1947 and published a book in [[Hindi]], with the same title. Later, Karkare became Congress president of Central India Province.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[Jai Hind postmark]] was the first commemorative [[postmark]] of Independent India, and was issued on the day of independence, 15 August 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} "जय हिन्द" is also stated on the first, [[List_of_postage_stamps_of_India#1947|Independence series of Indian stamps]].

The phrase is used on [[All India Radio]] at the end of a broadcast.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} It occurs in the patriotic song "[[Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo]]" sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Mamta |title=Filmi &amp; non-filmi songs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=459ay5Ai2l4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Jay+Hind&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Jay%20Hind&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=81-288-0299-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] sent a piece of crocheted, cotton lace made from yarn personally spun by himself, with the central motif ''Jai Hind'', to British Royal couple [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as a wedding gift in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008194238/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |archivedate=October 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has also given its name to
* ''Jai Hind'' (1999), a Hindi film, made by actor-director [[Manoj Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0286728|Jai Hind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julie Ann Brown''' (born August 31, 1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/julie-brown-mn0000263520/biography |title=Julie Brown |first=David |last=Jeffries |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actress, comedian, screen/television writer, singer-songwriter, and television director. Brown is perhaps best known for her work in the 1980s, where she often played a quintessential [[valley girl]] character. Much of her comedy has revolved around the mocking of famous people (with a strong and frequently revisited focus on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).

==Career==
Julie Brown began her career performing in nightclubs.&lt;ref name=TI&gt;{{cite web|title=Julie Brown|publisher=[[The Improv]]|url=http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203119/http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=7551|archivedate=2016-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She began working on television with a guest spot on the sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]''. She also appeared in the 1981 cult film ''[[Bloody Birthday]]''. After a small role in the [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', comedian [[Lily Tomlin]] saw Brown at a [[comedy club]] and gave her her first big break, a part in her [[1981 in film|1981 film]] ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=TI/&gt; Tomlin and Brown eventually became close friends. A string of guest starring appearances in a variety of television shows followed, including: ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'', ''[[Buffalo Bill (TV series)|Buffalo Bill]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' and ''[[Newhart]]''.  Brown also appeared in short films such as "Five Minutes, Miss Brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HM05GRSvC8|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Five Minutes, Miss Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, she released her first [[Extended play|EP]], a five-song album called ''[[Goddess in Progress]]''.&lt;ref name=LT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|title=Valley Girl Is Only One Shade of Julie Brown|date=February 8, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-08/entertainment/ca-387_1_julie-brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, parodies of popular '80s music combined with her valley girl personality, was quickly discovered by the [[Dr. Demento]] Show. The songs "[[Earth Girls Are Easy (Soundtrack)|'Cause I'm a Blonde]]" and "[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]" were given radio airplay across the world. The latter was a spoof on stereotypical 1950s' [[teen tragedy song]]s, with [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s' heads and [[pompon|pompoms]] being blown to pieces.

In 1987, Brown released her first full-length album, ''[[Trapped in the Body of a White Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=November 2, 1987 |title=Picks and Pans Review: Trapped in the Body of a White Girl Vol. 28 No. 18 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097470,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album highlighted her comedic talent and [[valley girl]] personality. The album's highlights were "[[I Like 'em Big and Stupid]]" and the reprised "[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]". (The album was reissued on CD in 2010 by Collector's Choice Music on its Noble Rot label.)&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|b8hxCpAdCJI|''The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music video]]s were recorded and received heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1989, Brown starred in that cable network's comedy and music-video show ''[[Just Say Julie]]''.&lt;ref name=LT/&gt; She played the role of a demanding, controlling, and pessimistic glamour-puss from the valley, making fun of popular music acts while at the same time introducing their music videos. (She was also known as "Miss Julie Brown" at the time to differentiate her from [[Downtown Julie Brown]], who was on the network at the same time.)

Brown's film career began in 1988 with the release of the film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'', written, [[film producer|produced]] by, and starring Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth Girls Are Easy (1989) Review/Film; On Shaving, Furry Aliens Turn Into Valley Guys|first=Caryn|last=James|date=May 12, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DEFD6163DF931A25756C0A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was based loosely on a song by the same name from her debut EP. The film also starred [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Geena Davis]]. Brown cast then-unknown comedians [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Damon Wayans]]. In 1990 Brown had a brief part in the movie ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', as an intellectual stripper.

[[Image:Julie Brown 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Brown performing in 2008 at [[The Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].]]
[[NBC]] commissioned a half-hour [[television pilot|pilot]], ultimately unsold and airing Sunday, July 28, 1991, at 7 p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], titled ''The Julie Show''. Created by Brown, [[Charlie Coffey (writer)|Charlie Coffey]], and [[television director|director]] and [[executive producer]] [[David Mirkin]], it was a comedy about actress Julie Robbins (Brown), who in this initial story, goes to great lengths to land an interview with teen singer Kiki (played by Kim Walker) in the hopes of getting hired as a tabloid-TV celebrity journalist. Developed under the working title ''The Julie Brown Show'', it also starred [[Marian Mercer]] as Julie's mother, June; [[DeLane Matthews]] as Debra Deacon, a reporter on the fictional series ''Inside Scoop''; [[Susan Messing]] as Julie's roommate Cheryl; and [[Kevin O'Rourke]] as ''Inside Scoop'' producer Tony Barnow. Brown was also a producer, with John Ziffren, and performed and co-wrote the [[theme song]]. Walker, Don Sparks, Robin Angers, and Deborah Driggs were guest performers in this production from Mirkinvision and [[New World Communications|New World Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Lovece|Lovece, Frank]]. ''The Television Yearbook 1990-91'' (Perigee Books / Putnam Publishing, 1991), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pilot was filmed for CBS, ''Julie Brown: The Show'', and featured a similar theme, in which Brown was the hostess of a talk show and she would interview actual celebrity guests, interspersed with scripted scenarios. The pilot was aired but the show was not picked up; years later it leaked onto the Internet.

In 1992, Brown starred in her own [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[The Edge (TV series)|The Edge]]''; two of its regulars, [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Wayne Knight]], later became sitcom stars, while [[Tom Kenny]] went on to voice ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. That same year, she released the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[television movie]] ''[[Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful]]'', a satire about [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and her backstage [[documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''. (Brown's co-star was [[Kathy Griffin]].)

Brown followed with another satire, ''[[Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 In. Women|Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women]]'', which lampooned the violence of [[ice skater]] [[Tonya Harding]] toward rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]], as well as that of widely publicized [[castration|castrator]] [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Julie|title=Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women|date=1994-08-21|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109167/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45|last2=Wenk|first2=Richard|accessdate=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has continued to make television guest appearances and contributed voices to various [[cartoon]]s, including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (as the voice of Minerva Mink),'' '' ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' as bratty [[mermaid]] Saleen, and as the original voice of [[Zatanna]] in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' cartoon. Prior to this she also guest starred on a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode as Julie Bruin, a cartoon bear version of herself, in which she guest starred in her own segment ''Just Say Julie Bruin'', a reference to her music video show. The ''Just Say Julie Bruin'' cartoon also was a music video show and in her segment [[Elmer Fudd]] guest starred as Fuddonna, parody of Madonna and a reference to Julie Brown herself regularly mocking her.

Brown appeared as Coach Millie Stoeger in the film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', reprising that role on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] 1996-1999 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series, for which she was also a writer, producer and director. Two regulars from the series, [[Donald Faison]] and [[Elisa Donovan]], later found similarly successful roles, as would featured player [[Christina Milian]] who had a recurring role on the series during its [[UPN]] years.  In 1998, Brown appeared in the parody movie ''[[Plump Fiction]]''. In 2000, she created the series ''[[Strip Mall]]'' for the [[Comedy Central]] network; it ran two seasons.

Since 2004, Brown has been a commentator on [[E!]] network specials, including ''101 Reasons the '90s Ruled'', ''101 Most Starlicious Makeovers'', ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment'', and ''50 Most Outrageous TV Moments''.

In 2005, Brown purchased the rights to her ''Trapped'' album back from the record label and reissued it herself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} She also self-released a single, "[[I Want to Be Gay]]". In late 2007, she also purchased the rights to her 1984 E.P. ''Goddess in Progress'' and re-released it as a full-length record with compiled unreleased tracks recorded during that era.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Brown began touring in late 2007 with her one-woman show, ''Smell the Glamour''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 2008, she co-wrote and appeared as Dee La Duke in the Disney Channel original movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'', which starred [[Demi Lovato]] and the [[Jonas Brothers]]. Brown also joined the cast of the Canadian television series, ''[[Paradise Falls]]'', that same year.

In late 2008 Brown began releasing one-track digital singles, starting with [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-ex-beauty-queens-got-a-gun/id295395743 "The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun"]; it was a rewrite of "Homecoming Queen" with lyrics about [[Sarah Palin]]. This was first aired in September, 2008 on ''[[Stephanie Miller Show|The Stephanie Miller Show]].'' In 2011 she released an album ''Smell The Glamour'', which features satires of [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]] and updated versions of her ''Medusa'' songs.

In the 2010-2011 television season, Brown began a recurring role as Paula Norwood, a neighbor and friend of the Heck family, on the ABC comedy ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''. From 2010 to 2015 she was a writer for ''[[Melissa &amp; Joey]]'', and played a gym teacher in one episode of the show. Also, in 2012 she appeared with [[Downtown Julie Brown]] as a guest judge on ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''.

Brown's parents said "whatever you do, don't become an actress", but after attending [[Los Angeles Valley College]] she enrolled in the well-known San Francisco acting school, [[American Conservatory Theater]], where she met future collaborator Charlie Coffey.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.com/archive/val-gal-get-your-gun-julie-brown-blasts-her-way-onto-mtv-vol-23-no-20/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landscape with Waterfall''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] '''''Landschap met waterval, in de verte een kerk''''')&lt;ref name="Netherlands Institute for Art History - 29 November 2005 - Landschap met waterval, in de verte een kerk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/72175|title=Explore Jacob van Ruisdael - Landschap met waterval, in de verte een kerk|date=29 November 2005|publisher=[[Netherlands Institute for Art History]]|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (c. 1660s) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "198. A WATERFALL NEAR AN OAK WOOD. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. Suppl. 1.]] In the left foreground is a waterfall divided in the middle by a rock ; to the left is a tree-trunk lying half in the stream. In the right foreground is a rocky bank with a birch stem bent to the right. In the 
right middle distance is a great oak wood, traversed by a road on which stand a man and boy conversing with a woman who sits nursing a child. 
To the left of the road is the stream, through which two persons apparently men drive a flock of sheep. Beyond is a wooded slope. In the centre is a view over a cornfield with sheaves ; in the distance is a village with two wind-mills and a church. A fine evening, with rolling clouds and sunlight falling on the cornfield and wood. "This excellent 
picture, in addition to its being one of the largest works of the artist, is singularly grand and rich in its composition, combined with unusual clearness and brilliancy of colouring and the most masterly execution, justly entitling it to the appellation of a chef d'oeuvre" (Sm.).

Signed in full on a stone on the right at foot ; canvas though the Amsterdam catalogue says it is on oak panel 56 inches by 76 1/2 inches. Exhibited at Amsterdam, 1845, No. 134. 
Bought by [[Blount baronets|an ancestor of Sir Charles Blount, Bart.]], on the Continent about the year 1740 (Sm.). In the collection of Sir Charles Blount, Bart., who sold it to Sm. in 1836. Sold by Sm. to [[Adriaan van der Hoop|A. van der Hoop]], Amsterdam, 1837 (for 1450). Bequeathed by A. van der Hoop to Amsterdam with his collection in 1854. In the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest, 1910 catalogue, No. 2075."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/67/mode/1up  Entry 198 for ''''A Waterfall near an Oak Wood''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made of waterfalls. As a warning of the forces of nature, these often included logs or broken tree stumps as silent witness to a more flooded scene than the one depicted. These must have sold well, as most of what remains today of Ruisdael's oeuvre are waterfall scenes. Inspired by the dramatic works of [[Allaert van Everdingen]], Ruisdael also made more Nordic versions (such as ''[[A Waterfall in a Rocky Landscape]]''), which included pine trees and mountains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''Laufás-Edda''' (''Edda Magnúsar Ólafssonar'') is a famous 17th century redaction of the [[Snorra Edda]], which survives in numerous [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] [[manuscript]]s. 

Laufás Edda  was compiled by the Icelandic priest and poet [[Magnús Ólafsson]] (c.1573–1636) on the request of the Icelandic scholar and antiquarian [[Arngrímur Jónsson]]. Magnús began his work at [[Auðkúla]] in 1607 after he had been dismissed from his office as parish minister, and completed his new redaction during the winter of 1608-09. Magnús would later serve as the priest at Laufás parish in Northern Iceland and as a consequence his version of the Edda was falsely referred to as the Laufás Edda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0391.html ''Magnús Ólafsson'' (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XII. Bind)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of his efforts was to make a systematic and encyclopedic version of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]]. Laufás Edda is a rearranged redaction of the Snorra Edda. The myths in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' are presented as a series of examples (apologi or dæmisögur) and the [[kenning]]s of ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' are organized alphabetically. The last part, ''[[Háttatal]]'', was not included.

Due to its popularity, the Laufás redaction later became the basis for the first printed Edition of the Snorra Edda, [[Peder Hansen Resen]]'s [[Edda Islandorum]]. Resen's edition was accompanied by a [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Latin]] translation. The Laufás Edda, especially through Resen's edition, became a convenient and popular work of reference for poets and antiquarians, serving as an encyclopedia for researching both myth and poetic language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Clunies Ross]] and Lars Lönnroth, ''The Norse Muse: Report from an International Research Project''  (''Alvíssmál 9. 1999) [http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/9muse.pdf 3–28] (pdf), here pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">There have been 39 '''''[[FoxTrot]]'' books''' published so far, all by [[Andrews McMeel Publishing, LLC|Andrews McMeel Publishing]]. Of the 39 books, 27 are collections and 12 are anthologies. The anthologies are composed of the two or three previous collections, and include Sunday strips in color.

==Collections==
Beginning with ''Death by Field Trip'', the size and shape of the regular collections changed to accommodate a new Sunday strip layout. The books also became shorter (and much cheaper) to create a larger gap between [[anthology|anthologies]].

This is a list of [[botanical illustrator]]s born or active in Ireland.
[[Botanical illustration]] involves the painting, drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21968">This is the main '''list of [[dance]]s'''.  It is a non-categorized, index list of specific dances.  It may also include dances which could either be considered specific dances or a family of related dances.  For example, [[ballet]], [[ballroom dance]] and [[folk dance]] can be single dance styles or families of related dances. 

See following for categorized lists:
* [[List of dance style categories]]
* [[List of folk dances sorted by origin]]
* [[Novelty and fad dances|List of novelty/fad dances]]
Cats listed on these specialized (categorized) lists should also be included in this general index.

&lt;!--

IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE ADDING AN ENTRY:
Please ONLY add dances with a Wikipedia entry. They are likely to be removed otherwise. Don't add additional information, which should be instead added to the dances' respective articles.

Specific dances are listed below in alphabetical order.  Variants of a specific dance should be listed as indented items, and not as separate items.  For example, Waltz has several variants.  This makes the list easier to read, and avoids redundant links. --&gt;

The '''''Madonna del cardellino''''' or '''''Madonna of the Goldfinch''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], from c. 1505-1506. A 10-year restoration process was completed in 2008, after which the painting was returned to its home at the [[Uffizi]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Pullella |title=Technology helps restore Raphael masterpiece |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/artsNews/idUSTRE49R01M20081028 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the restoration, an antique copy replaced the painting in the gallery.

==Painter==
Raphael is considered to be a “master” of the High Renaissance, a title he shares with [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. He was born in 1483 and died in 1520, living a mere thirty-seven years.  Despite his relatively short lifespan, he was highly influential throughout his time on earth. He produced a vast quantity of work in a variety of media. He was active in architecture, printmaking, painting, and drawing. During the first half of his career, he spent years traveling across Northern Italy and was influenced by the Florentine styles he saw there, causing this stage to be called his Florentine Period. After which, in 1508, he moved to Rome where he continued to work. Many of his commissions came from the Vatican, including the Apostolic Palace, which brought about one of his most famous works, School of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, James H. ''Raphael''. New York : H.N. Abrams, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his relationship with the church, he and Michelangelo were fierce rivals throughout both of their careers, and often competed for the same commissions. 
During his Florentine period, this work, The Madonna Del Cardellino, was painted along with several other well-known Madonnas: The Madonna of the Meadow and La Belle Jardinière. All three share several characteristics: Madonna is clothed in red and blue, the same three subjects are painted, the pyramidal composition, the natural background, and the connection to the church through the representation of books, crosses, or, indeed, the goldfinch.

==Painting==
In this painting, as in most of the Madonnas of his [[Florence|Florentine]] period, Raphael arranged the three figures - [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Jesus|Christ]] and the young [[John the Baptist]] - to fit into a geometrical design. Though the positions of the three bodies are natural, together they form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful, as with Raphael’s various other Madonnas.&lt;ref name="Cuzin, Jean Pierre 1985"&gt;Cuzin, Jean Pierre. ''Raphael : His Life and Works''. Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also clothed in red and blue, also typical, for red signifies the passion of Christ and blue was used to signify the church. Christ and John are still very young, only babies. John holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The background is one typical of Raphael.&lt;ref name="Cuzin, Jean Pierre 1985"/&gt;  The natural setting is diverse and yet all calmly frames the central subject taking place.

The Madonna was a wedding gift from Raphael to his friend Lorenzo Nasi. On November 17, 1548 Nasi's house was destroyed by an earthquake and the painting broke into seventeen pieces. It was immediately taken to be salvaged, and was hastily put back together, though the seams were quite visible. In 2002, George Bonsanti of the Precious Stones organization gave the task of restoration to Patrizia Riitano. During the six-year process that followed, her team worked to remove the years of grime that had degraded the painting's color, and to fix the damage done by the earthquake long ago. Before beginning the project, they studied the work as closely as possible, utilizing resources such as X-rays, CAT scans, reflective infra-red photography, and even lasers. Riitano closely studied the past quick fix layers that had been applied and removed them until the original by Raphael finally shone through. The restoration was completed in 2008, and the painting was put on display in Uffizi.&lt;ref&gt;Popham, Peter. “Return of the Fallen Madonna". ''Independent'' (October 29, 2008): 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Madonna Del Cardellino'', the goldfinch represents Christ’s crucifixion. The reason for its association comes from the legend that its red spot was born at the time of the crucifixion. It flew down over the head of Christ and was taking a thorn from His crown, when it was splashed with the drop of His blood.  The book in Mary’s hand reads ''Sedes Sapientiae'' or ''The Throne of Wisdom''. This term usually is applied to images in which Mary is seated upon a throne, with Jesus on her lap, but in this case, the inscription implies the rock on which Mary sits is her natural throne.

In some versions of Vasari another similar painting is described as the Vallombrosa version but it has never been identified.

===Palais de Tokyo, Paris===
From 2006-2012, Wahler was the director of the [[Palais de Tokyo]], one of the most frequently visited contemporary art centers in Europe. Wahler is known for creating a museum that breaks down barriers between high and low culture and different artistic mediums (such as architecture, fine arts, dance, literature, theatre, and music).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marc-Olivier Wahler Inspires Palais de Tokyo|date=Oct 31, 2011|publisher=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/constantin-bjerke/palais-de-tokyo_b_1066773.html|accessdate=Jan 12, 2013|first=Constantin|last=Bjerke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As director of Palais de Tokyo, he set the current pace of 30 to 40 exhibitions a year. The solo shows have included such artists as [[Tatiana Trouvé]], [[Peter Coffin (artist)|Peter Coffin]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Jonathan Monk]], [[Roman Signer]], [[Christoph Büchel]], [[Paul Laffoley]], [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]], [[Loris Gréaud]], [[Charlotte Posenenske]], [[Micol Assael]], [[Ceal Floyer]], [[Michel Blazy]], [[Ulla von Brandenburg]], [[Camille Henrot]], and [[Oscar Tuazon]].

Wahler's first show at Palais de Tokyo was ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/fo3_content/pdf/editions/pdfpalais1/cinqmilliards.pdf Five Billion Years]'' (2006), which served as a prologue for his six-year curatorial program. His later group shows dealt with the limits between what is visible and invisible: ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/M/programme.php M, News From the Upside-Down]'' (2007), ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/upload/docs/dp_parrino_en.pdf La Marque Noire]'' (2007), ''[http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2008/07/palais-de-tokyo-built-in.php#.UREZ5_JdleA Superdome]'' (2008), ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/upload/docs/GAKONA_PRESSKIT.pdf Gakona]'' (2009), and ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/upload/docs/SPYNUMBERS_PRESSKIT%20.pdf Spy Numbers]'' (2009). Next, ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/upload/docs/PRESSKIT%20CHASING%20NAPOLEON.pdf Chasing Napoleon]'' (2009-2010) examined the notion of disappearance.

In 2011, Wahler curated ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512134110/http://www.dynasty-expo.com/d/en/ Dynasty]'' with Fabrice Hergott, the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art, Paris]]. They exhibited a total of 80 works from 40 French artists under the age of 35 in both the Palais de Tokyo and the Museum of Modern Art, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/the-market/2010-06-29/dynasty-palais-de-tokyo-musee-dart-moderne/print/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Dynasty'', Wahler created the ''[http://archives.palaisdetokyo.com/fo3/low/programme/index.php?page=projets.php&amp;cat2=3 Modules]'', a series of art exhibits which focused on emergent artists. He also created the "Carte Blanche", a still ongoing series which give an artist the opportunity to present a special project covering the entirety of the exhibition space of Palais de Tokyo and offering a kind of map of the artist’s brain, desires and influences. 
A review noted that "under Mr. Wahler, the Palais de Tokyo has become one of the city’s best springboards for young artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|date=October 28, 2011|title=Paris Regains Some of Its Lost Aura in Art World|author=Nicolai Hartvig|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/arts/29iht-scparis29.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahler is also known for adding a rooftop hotel and a rooftop restaurant, to the already existent bookstore and restaurant Tokyo-eat.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite its bourgeois address in the 16th Arrondissement, the Palais de Tokyo is the coolest museum in Paris: risk-taking, roomy and a little rough around the edges" (T Magazine, July 2, 2009). http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/paris-communal-art-meets-dinner-at-the-palais-de-tokyo/&lt;/ref&gt; He installed the [[Lang and Baumann]] artist project [[Everland Hotel]] (a one-room hotel room available to the public) on the museum's roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/the-post-materialist-paris-reborn/ | work=The New York Times | first=Nick | last=Currie | title=The Post-Materialist &amp;#124; Paris Reborn | date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahler removed Everland after a year and replaced it with [[Laurent Grasso]]'s artist project [http://www.nomiya.org/ Nomiya], a one-room restaurant for 12 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wallpaper.com/travel/fab-40-nomiya-restaurant-paris/3934&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalet Society, Paris===
Wahler is the founder and director of a new structure, [http://www.chaletsociety.org The Chalet Society], designed to encourage reflection on contemporary art institutions and to investigate new possibilities for exhibitions by testing forms, spaces, discourses, and protocols. The mobile structure endeavors to develop formats that work on a variety of platforms, similar to open source software that can run on any hardware.
The Chalet Society reacts to the boldest artistic settings and acts itself as a community of artists, collectors, researchers, and other enthusiasts, searching for “poetic consciousness,” an idea attributed to Saul Wahl Katzenellenbogen - crowned King of Poland in 1587. He only reigned for one night but had enough time to pronounce a number of predictions and appeal for the dawn of “poetic consciousness.”

Launched in October 2012 in a pop-up site – a disused school in the heart of Paris – the Chalet Society presented a variety of extraordinary self-taught or unknown artists in collaboration with the Museum of Everything.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/2290/The_Chalet_Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Obscurity to the Center of the City of Light|author=Matthew Rose|date=November 17, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|page=C22|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324439804578115121120184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having tested the limits of the commonly accepted notion of artist, the Chalet Society created the “Tester’s Salon” in the summer of 2013, a project by the art critic Christophe Kihm and the artists Arnaud and Bertrand Dezoteux. Here more than 40 artists were invited to reflect on testing an extensive range of exhibition formats.

In fall 2013 after the self-taught ‘outsider’ artists, the exhibition ''The Hidden World'', designed by the artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]], focused on artists who – while producing for specific commissions – have often got lost behind their intentions. Shaw collected over the past 40 years diverse didactic material, creating “a breathtaking and expansive journey through the myths and beliefs of America.”&lt;ref&gt;Maaike Lauwaert, Artforum, December 2013. http://www.artforum.com/archive/id=44209&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of 'music and emotion' seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]]. It is a branch of [[music psychology]] with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], [[music theory]] and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]].
{{TOC limit}}

==Philosophical approaches==

===Appearance emotionalism ===
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]] and [[Jerrold Levinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/music/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2005). "Artistic Expression and the Hard Case of Pure Music", in: Kieran, M. (Ed.), ''Contemporary Debates in Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art'': 179-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding [[dynamic structure]] and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of [[music psychology]].  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.

===The process theory===
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music, and Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 310-13&lt;/ref&gt; assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.

==Conveying emotion through music==
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development.&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=W. J.|title=The development of music perception and cognition|journal=Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Reading|year=2002|pages=481–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref name="Susino and Schubert, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|author2=Schubert, S.|title=Cross-cultural anger communication in music: Towards a stereotype theory of emotion in music|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2017|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |pages=755–788 |chapter=Chapter 27: Cross-cultural similarities and differences | chapterurl=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/me2/uploads/publications/27-Juslin__Sloboda-Ch-27.pdf|isbn=978-0-19-960496-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists']] approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. [[Emotivism|Emotivists]] argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherer|first=K. R.|author2=Zentner, M. R.|title=Emotional effects of music: production rules|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=361–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=C.|title=Emotions and music: A reply to the cognitivists|journal=The Journal of Aesthestics and Art Criticism|year=1989|volume=47|pages=69–76|jstor=431994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:

:''Experienced Emotion'' = ''Structural features'' × ''Performance features'' × ''Listener features'' × ''Contextual features''

where:

:''Structural features'' = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
:''Performance features'' = Performer skill × Performer state
:''Listener features'' = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
:''Contextual features'' = Location × Event&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[amplitude]], and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as [[melody]], [[tempo]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Chapter16" /&gt; There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrielle |first=A. |last2=Stromboli |first2=E. |title=The influence of musical structure on emotional expression |journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research |year=2001 |pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, [[tempo]] is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as [[mode (music)|mode]], [[loudness]], and [[melody]], also influence the emotional valence of the piece.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"/&gt;

|}

===Performance features===
Performance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

=== Listener features ===
Listener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Contextual features===
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====Conflicting cues====
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|author2=Schellenburg, E. G. |author3=Schimmack, U. |title=Feelings and perceptions of happiness and sadness induced by music: Similarities, differences, and mixed emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=47–56|doi=10.1037/a0016873}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;  The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. T.|author2=Stastny, B. J.|title=It's a bittersweet symphony: Simultaneously mixed emotional responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Emotion|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0024081|volume=11|pages=1469–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

===Specific listener features===

====Development====
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloboda|first=J. A.|author2=Juslin, P. N.|title=Psychological perspectives on music and emotion|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone.&lt;ref name=Nawrot&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nawrot|first=E. S.|title=The Perception of Emotional Expression in Music: Evidence from Infants, Children and Adults|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=75–92|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mote|first=Jasmine|title=The effects of tempo and familiarity on children's affective interpretation of music.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=618–622|doi=10.1037/a0022573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Terwogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=TERWOGT|first=MARK MEERUM|author2=VAN GRINSVEN, FLORA|title=RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS IN MUSIC BY CHILDREN AND ADULTS|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 December 1988|volume=67|issue=3|pages=697–698|doi=10.2466/pms.1988.67.3.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

=====''Infants''=====
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that the motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant.&lt;ref name=Trehub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first+Sandra E.|author2=Nakata, Takayuki|title=Emotion and music in infancy|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2001|volume=SPEC ISSUE, 2001-2002|pages=37–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation.&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.&lt;ref name=Vist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vist|first=Torill|title=Music Experience in Early Childhood: Potential for Emotion Knowledge?|journal=International Journal of Early Childhood|date=16 November 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1007/s13158-011-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Pre-school children''=====
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt; However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music.&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robazza&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBAZZA|first=CLAUDIO |author2=MACALUSO, CRISTINA |author3=D'URSO, VALENTINA|title=EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO MUSIC BY GENDER, AGE, AND EXPERTISE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 October 1994|volume=79|issue=2|pages=939–944|doi=10.2466/pms.1994.79.2.939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Elementary-age children''=====
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;
Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt; All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;

====Personality effects====
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training.&lt;ref name=Ladinig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E. Glenn|title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schellenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|author2=Mankarious, Monika|title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski Measure"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=J. K.|author2=Eerola, T.|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings&lt;ref name=Ladinig /&gt;  as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores,&lt;ref name=Schellenberg /&gt; other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kratus|first=J.|title=A Developmental Study of Children's Interpretation of Emotion in Music|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 1993|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1177/030573569302100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions.&lt;ref name="Policy Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth|journal=Pediatrics|date=19 October 2009|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1488–1494|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2145|pmid=19841124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus /&gt;  Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.

==Eliciting emotion through music==
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s).&lt;ref name=Garrido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrido|first=S.|author2=E. Shubert|title=Individual differences in the enjoyment of negative emotion in music: a literature review and experiment|journal=Music Perception|year=2011|volume=28|pages=279–295|doi=10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;

===Responses to elicited emotion===
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====''Basic emotions''====
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece.&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.

In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;  However, [[Emotivism|emotivists]] purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [[cognitive reappraisal]], to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement.&lt;ref name="Van den Tol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den TOl|first=A.J.M.|author2=Edwards, J.|title=Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad. |journal=Psychology of Music|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|author2=Peynircioglu, Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2010|volume=27|pages=177–182|jstor=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.177|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.

====''Emotional memories and actions''====
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Tol, A. J. M., &amp;  Ritchie, T. D.(book-chapter in press). Emotion memory and music: A critical review and recommendations for future research.Music, Memory and Autobiography. (Eds: Professor Strollo Maria Rosaria and Dr. Romano Alessandra).&lt;/ref&gt; Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;  Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A. J. M. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 440–465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A.

Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model====

Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Juslin &amp; Daniel V ̈astfj ̈all, 'Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, 2008; 559-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.

''Brain Stem Reflex'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'

''Rhythmic Entrainment'':&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, P. (2011). Music and Emotion: seven questions, seven answers. In I. Deliège, J. Davidson, J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Music and the Mind: Essays in Honour of John Sloboda'' (pp.113-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'

''Evaluative Conditioning'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'

''Emotional Contagion'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'

''Visual Imagery'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'

''Episodic memory'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.'&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. B. (1978). The psychology of music. Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Musical expectancy'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'

====Musical expectancy====

With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = P | last2 = Van Tilburg | first2 = W. A. P. | last3 = Van | first3 =  | last4 = den Tol | first4 = A. J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Meaning in music: Deviations from expectation in music polarize in-group and out-group attitudes | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  155–172| doi = 10.1002/ejsp.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA====

In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juslin | first1 = P. N. | year = 2013 | title = From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: towards a unified theory of musical emotions | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

==Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions==

===Evidence for emotion in music===
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Self-report''====
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vieillard|first=S.|author2=Peretz, I. |author3=Gosselin, N. |author4=Khalfa, S. |title=Happy, sad, scary, and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=4|pages=720–752|doi=10.1080/02699930701503567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt;  Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt; It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Physiological responses''====
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;   Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody.&lt;ref name=Chapter19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsson|first=A.|title=Emotion in strong experiences with music|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=431–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Expressive behavior''====
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial [[electromyography]] (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Strength of effects===
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;

====''Conveyed more than elicited''====
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;  Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.

====''Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited''====
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.&lt;ref name=Kallenin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallenin|first=K|author2=Ravaja, N.|title=Emotion perceived and emotion felt: Same and different|journal=Musicae Scientaie|year=2006|volume=10|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/102986490601000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elicited more than conveyed''====
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt; 
Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Emery|title=Locus of emotion: The effect of task order and age on emotion perceived and emotion felt in response to music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=4|pages=344–368|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zentner|first=Marcel|author2=Grandjean, Didier |author3=Scherer, Klaus R. |title=Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=494–521|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.8.4.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a therapeutic tool==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keen MSocSc | first1 = Alexander W. | year = 2005 | title = Using Music as a Therapy Tool to Motivate Troubled Adolescents | url = | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 39 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–373 | doi = 10.1300/J010v39n03_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Felicity A. | last2 = Gleadhill | first2 = Libby M. | last3 = Dingle | first3 = Genevieve A. | year = 2007 | title = Music therapy and emotional exploration: Exposing substance abuse clients to the experiences of non-drug-induced emotions | url = | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 321–330 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child.&lt;ref name=Robb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robb|first=Sheri L.|title=The effect of therapeutic music interventions on the behavior of hospitalized children in isolation: Developing a contextual support model of music therapy|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118–146|doi=10.1093/jmt/37.2.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = Pam | year = 2009 | title = Music - shelter for the frazzled mind?". | url = | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1018–1020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10645">The '''National Theatre of the Deaf''' ('''NTD''') was founded in 1967 and is the oldest [[theatre company]] in the [[United States]] with a continuous history of domestic and international touring and producing original works.&lt;ref name="NTD History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ntd_history.html|title=National Theatre of the Deaf - HISTORY|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTD productions combine [[American Sign Language]] with [[spoken language]] to fulfill the theatre's [[mission statement]] of linking [[Hearing loss|deaf]] and [[hearing]] communities and educating the public about [[Deaf culture|Deaf art]]. The NTD is affiliated with a [[Acting School|drama school]], also founded in 1967, and with the Little Theatre of the Deaf (LTD), established in 1968 to produce shows for a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ltd_about.html|title=ABOUT the Little Theatre of the Deaf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first official performance of the NTD was at [[Wesleyan University]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Theatre-of-the-Deaf|title=National Theatre of the Deaf American Theatre Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTD members participated in the first National and Worldwide Deaf Theatre Conference in 1994. Many deaf actors have earned acclaim through their work with the NTD in performances, conferences, and community outreach. The NTD has been fundamental in the creation of an international Deaf theatre community, and has received several awards, including the [[Tony Award]] for Theatrical Excellence. The company has visited each of the [[Fifty States|50 states]] during over 150 national tours, as well as over 30 countries.

== Founding ==
In 1946, [[Robert Panara]], a [[Gallaudet University]] graduate and newly hired teacher at the [[New York School for the Deaf]], produced a play with [[Bernard Bragg]], a 17-year-old student in Panara's English class.&lt;ref name="Powers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf|last=Powers|first=Helen|date=1972|publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=|isbn=|location=New York|page=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1940s, when Bragg was a student at Gallaudet, Panara left New York School for the Deaf to teach at Gallaudet. While both at Gallaudet, Panara and Bragg conceived of the idea of a theater for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Dr. Edna Levine, a professor of [[Deaf studies]] at [[New York University]], saw Bragg perform a [[one-man show]] in [[New York City]]. She asked him for a meeting and shared her own vision for a national theater for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, they obtained a federal grant from the [[U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] to establish the NTD. Additional grant money was given by the [[Office of Education]].&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company" /&gt; [[Mary E. Switzer]] of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and Boyce R. Williams and Malcolm Norwood of the [[Rehabilitation Services Administration]] were important advocates of funding the NTD.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;

Levine and Bragg worked with [[set designer]] David Hays to establish a mission statement, locate funding, select a location, and assemble a company. The founders also included [[Ann Bancroft]], who played [[Annie Sullivan]] in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]'', and [[Arthur Penn]] and Gene Lasko, directors of ''The Miracle Worker''.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pictures in the Air: The Story of the National Theatre of the Deaf|last=Baldwin|first=Stephen C.|date=1993|publisher=[[Gallaudet University Press]]|year=|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and location==

The founders' mission was to feature sign language in the theater for both deaf and hearing audiences. The founders believed that audience members need to “hear every word and see every word” in all NTD productions.&lt;ref name="NTD Mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ntd_mission.html|title=National Theatre of the Deaf MISSION|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill this mission, productions included both deaf and hearing actors. The language used by the deaf performers included sign language, [[Mime artist|mime]], and [[gesture]], and the hearing actors provided spoken language. Bragg had studied under the French mime [[Marcel Marceau]], and his acting style influenced the early NTD productions.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardbragg.com/biography/|title=Act One: It All Began on Metropolitan Street|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BernardBragg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardbragg.com/|title=Honored With NTD Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BernardBragg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the NTD was located on the campus of the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center]] in [[Waterford, Connecticut]]. In 1983, the NTD moved to [[Chester, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|63-64}} In 2000, the NTD moved to [[Hartford, CT|Hartford, Connecticut]], and in 2004 moved onto the campus of the [[American School for the Deaf]] in [[West Hartford, CT|West Hartford]]. Since 2012, the NTD has again been based at the O'Neill Theatre Center while maintaining a satellite office on the campus of the American School for the Deaf.&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company" /&gt;

"National theater troupe breathes life into words," ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', January 29, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; While some NTD actors have achieved recognition in hearing theatre, a greater number of Deaf actors, including [[Chuck Baird]], Eric Malzkuhn, [[Ed Waterstreet]], Gilberst Eastman, Mary Beth Miller, and Manny Hernandez, have achieved recognition primarily within deaf theatre.

Though not an NTD actor, [[Lauren Ridloff]], the actress cast as Sarah in the 2018 revival of ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'', was nominated in May 2018 for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/theater/tony-awards-nominees-list.htm|title=Tony Awards 2018 Full List of Nominations|last=|first=|date=|website=New York Times|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions, touring, and reception==

Rehearsals and performances occupied most of each day for both company actors and students. The company toured by [[bus]] both domestically and internationally, received only [[Part-time contract|part-time]] pay, and paid [[Out-of-pocket expense|out-of-pocket]] for their travel.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|125-129}} Both the company and the students lived [[dormitory]]-style at the O'Neill Theatre Center while rehearsing, and slept either on the bus or in inexpensive hotels while touring domestically. While touring internationally, the actors stayed in [[Hostel|hostels]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lessons in Laughter: The Autobiography of a Deaf Actor|last=Bragg|first=Bernard|date=1989|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company performed both traditional plays and plays written by Deaf playwrights.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|121-124}} Hearing audiences have typically had positive responses to NTD productions, while Deaf and [[Hard-of-hearing|Hard of Hearing]] audiences have often had mixed reviews. Deaf and Hard of Hearing audience members sometimes expected productions to be more focused around the Deaf experience, and to be less highly dramatized. Some Deaf audience members have seen NTD productions as catering to Hearing audiences, which has generated a negative response. However, many Deaf audience members have responded positively and appreciated NTD productions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|115-116}}

The NTD has been discussed in newspapers such as ''[[Silent News]]'', journals such as the ''Puppetry Journal'', and television shows such as ''Deaf Mosaic'', which aired during the 1980s and 1990s. Many scholars have written about the NTD in books and [[dissertations]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|24-25; 41-42; 55-56; 70-71; 83-84; 95-96; 109-110; 117-118}}

'''The NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph''' (NinKi:UoPDP)[http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] was initiated by [[Bangladesh]]i visual artist [[Firoz Mahmud]] ( ফিরোজ মাহমুদ, フィロズ・マハムド ). This is a drawing photograph project to rhetorically rescue popular icons with geometric structure drawings or make photo image of the people tactically static. His pigeonhole or kind of compartmental examples of doodling were engaged on found images in various printed media and also were found in his sketchbook, books, notebooks and often in his borrowed books. The word '[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AB%E3%82%93%E3%81%8D#Japanese Ninki'] (人気) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word which means be Popular or popularity. The Ninki: UoPDP art Project of drawing on photographs consist of numerous archetypal images of popular celebrities in vague appearance. Their career, character, fame, obscurity, activities and character are insurgent and idiosyncratic. Artist Firoz has started on any image and then specifically on Bengal tiger and more significantly on Japanese [[Sumo]] Wrestler as artist based in [[Japan]] and fascinated by sports, media and interested on humorous aspect of entertainment [[industries]].

==About==
The `Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph` (NinKi:UoPDP)[http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] is [[Firoz Mahmud]]`s one of art projects, started as anonymously. Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. It was initially created for changing the meaning of visual images from the original photo images which Firoz took, collected or found to experiment that how general people react seeing each one's popular icons.

==History==
From the inception when [[Firoz Mahmud]] exposed these drawing photographs, he focused anonymously without using his name at billboards, undergrounds, signage board or in other exhibition venues in Japan. He created this on-going art project in [[Tokyo]] since 2008 as his leisure time drawing doodle on newspapers, magazines, and found images. NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing was first exhibited at the 9th Sharjah Art Biennial in 2009 in Sharjah, UAE. Gradually he exhibited in Museums, galleries and art spaces.Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. One of his first projects of 'Urgency of Proximate Drawing' was exhibited as [http://www.hiroshima-moca.jp/docs/press/dokodemo2011_1.pdf 'Rescued Stardom'] project at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art in Hiroshima Japan where he received a prize.

==Topic of the project and style==
Firoz focuses on celebrities in excited, playful, sporty and happy moments. He draws remarkable lines where they are about to fall or feel hard to gesture in the photographs. Their idolized appearances are highlighted by protective line drawings that display an awareness of the per-formative ethos of iconic expression. The lines underneath the falling position imply that the stardom can`t fall down from the gestures and positions that they are held in.

==Reviews, Comments and Quotes==
The project The NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph [http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] has been featured in many newspapers and magazines. Many critics, artists and art specialists commented on Firoz's NinKi art project, for example:
`Through a very unique point of view, Firoz focuses on a moment of people’s lives. Although his method is very simple, it reconstructs the space in a very strong way. His works give viewers a lot of excitement. ``- Ozawa Tsuyoshi, Artist based in [[Japan]][http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/]
[[New York City]] &amp; [[Dhaka]] based writer &amp; artist [[Naeem Mohaiemen]] wrote on his reviews in [http://www.departmag.com/index.php/en/detail/177/Firoz-wants-to-fight-Tyson Depart art Magazine] that, -
"Firoz's announced plan is to rescue icons from detritus, but something sinister is at play in these brutalist lines. The crazy cat's cradle across a former pugilist's face, a flesh-eating phantasm in its pre-animation wireframe, is channeling Tyson's unmoored, chaotic, fractured id.[http://www.departmag.com/index.php/en/detail/177/Firoz-wants-to-fight-Tyson]

" Firoz has artfully and humorously explored social and emotive issues through his "NINKi :UoPDP" Urgency of Proximate Drawings. I am surprised how he magically rescued the perturbed stars during their danger situation in the photographs. The drawing structures are drawn with geometric patterns that appear like protective hex symbols. All celebrities can eventually remain invincible in their popularity, protected by an uncanny force."

'''Philadelphia/Tri State Artists Equity Association, Inc.''', commonly known as '''Philadelphia Artists Equity''', became an independent organization in 1997. It was founded as a chapter of a national organization of professional fine artists in 1949. Artists Equity works for the protection of artists’ rights and improved working and economic conditions for fine artists.&lt;ref name='Artists Equity'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artistsequity.org/about.html | title = Committed to service: OUR HISTORY | accessdate = 2010-07-02 | date = 2010-07-02 | work = Organization web site | publisher = Philadelphia/Tri State Artists Equity Association, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists Equity worked behind the scenes for the establishment of a [[Philadelphia]] City ordinance, entitled “Aesthetic Ornamentation of City Structures,” which was sponsored by Councilman Henry Sawyer, III, and adopted on his last day as a member of [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]] in the final months of 1959. This ordinance established a requirement for [[Percent for Art|one percent for art]] for city building projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bach | first = Penny Balkin | title = Public Art in Philadelphia | publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year= 1992|isbn=0-87722-822-1|pages= 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2009}}
A '''production coordinator''' (officially called '''production office coordinator''' and abbreviated '''POC''') is a unionized position in [[stagecraft]] under the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) and is governed in Los Angeles by Local 871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ialocal871.org/|title=Local 871's website|publisher=Local 871|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production coordinator serves under the production manager, producer  or UPM to coordinate the various groups and personnel that come together in [[filmmaking]] to a movie and [[video production]] to make a [[television show]]. It is a supervisory  position to the [[Production assistant]] staff. The position requires adept organizational skills, resourcefulness and the ability to handle a  multitude of tasks simultaneously under often high-pressure situations. The POC serves as the gatekeeper of company policy  and is usually responsible for ensuring the rest of the production [[television crew]] follows the requirements of the Production Company or Studio.

The duties of a POC are often undefined and extremely varied ranging from office manager, to human resources, to controller, to accountant. The POC is one of the only positions with the IATSE (USA and Canada) which no longer has a scale or set wage. The IA bylaws simply state the POC’s wage is “subject to negotiation with the Producer”. Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension &amp; Health Plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpiphp.org/faqs/pension_faqs.htm/|title=Motion Picture Pension Plan FAQ|publisher=Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week, which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an "on-call" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week, no matter how many or few hours they work. Working conditions can vary on the medium (half-hour, hour-long television, reality, live, soap and feature) and daily hours can range from 8 to 16 hour days. The POC is often the first person in the office and the last to leave since they hold the responsibility of tending to the needs of the crew. 

More recent attempts have been made by Local 871 to establish a scale rate for the POCs, but to date all have been unsuccessful.

The union has a relaxed jurisdiction over the position since it does not have an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC, but again since it does not have an official job description in its bylaws, many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.

[[File:Qavam House (11993601613).jpg|Front facade of building with painting of "Lion and Sun" (the Qajar royal emblem) on the [[pediment]].|thumb|250px]]
'''Qavam House''' (also widely called "'''Narenjestan e Ghavam'''") is a traditional and historical house in [[Shiraz, Iran]]. It is at walking distance from the Khan Madrassa.

It was built between 1879 and 1886&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroun.com/Museums/IranMuseum/IranMRegion1/Narenjestan.htm Iran Museums: Fars Province (Shiraz), "Narenjestan Garden and Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt; by Mirza Ibrahim Khan. The [[Qavam family]] were merchants originally from [[Qazvin]]. But they soon became active in the government during the [[Zand dynasty]], followed by the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]], and [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as well.

The Qavam "Naranjestan" preserves the elegance and refinement enjoyed by the upper-class families during the 19th century. The paintings on the low ceilings of the house are inspired by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era Europe.

The mirrored porch was a focal point of the house, overlooking a small garden that was designed with fountains, [[date palm]]s, and flowering plants.

During the second Pahlavi era, the House became the headquarters of [[Pahlavi University]]'s [[Asia Institute]], directed by [[Arthur Upham Pope]] and [[Richard Nelson Frye]]. Frye and his family also lived in the house for a while.

The house today is a [[museum]] and is open to the public.

A '''''rotulus''''' (plural: ''rotuli'') is a kind of roll consisting of a long and narrow strip of writing material, historically [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]], that is wound around a wooden axle or rod and is written on its interior face or side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Grout |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/scroll/scrollcodex.html |title=Scroll and Codex |website=Encyclopaedia Romana}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that it is unwound vertically so that the writing runs parallel to the rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whats-on/online/crossing-borders/codex |title=What's On?: From Roll to Codex |website=Bodleian Libraries |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other kind of roll, namely the "[[scroll]]", whose writing runs perpendicular to the rod in multiple columns.

''Rotuli'' were historically used for:

A '''simulacrum''' ([[plural]]: '''simulacra''' from {{lang-la|simulacrum}}, which means "likeness, similarity") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Word of the Day |date=1 May 2003 |publisher=dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217130815/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/05/01.html |archivedate=17 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.&lt;ref&gt;"simulacrum" ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] offers [[photorealism]] as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is sometimes created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real.&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"&gt;Massumi, Brian.

==Philosophy==
Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', [[Plato]] speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek statuary]], which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a [[metaphor]] for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plato |title=The Sophist |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |chapter=Reason in Philosophy |title=Twilight of the Idols |others=Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale |year=1888 |url=http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426104633/http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html#sect3 |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodernism/Philosophy|Postmodernist]] French [[social theorist]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Simulacra and Simulations"&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html Baudrillard Simulacra] retrieved 2 May 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=9 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, [[Gilles Deleuze]], takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or "privileged position" could be "challenged and overturned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deleuze |first=Gilles |title=Difference and Repetition |others=Translated by Paul Patton |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Columbia |year=1968 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze defines simulacra as "those systems in which different relates to different ''by means of'' difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no ''prior [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'', no ''internal resemblance''".&lt;ref&gt;p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]], in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Ethics - An Essay on the Understanding of Evil|others=Translated by Peter Hallward |publisher=Verso |location=London |year=2001 |pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')".

==Recreation==
Recreational simulacra include [[historical reenactment|reenactments of historical events]] or replicas of landmarks, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as [[Fantasyland]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that [[Walt Disney World Resort]] is a copy of a copy, "a simulacrum to the second power".&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ "Disneyworld Company."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152759/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ |date=27 May 2010 }} retrieved 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] argued that at Disney's parks, "we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''Travels in Hyperreality.'' Reproduced in relevant portion at
[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html "The City of Robots"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912200642/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html |date=12 September 2006 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of [[national park]]s, [[Disney's Wilderness Lodge]], environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and [[anthropologist]] Eric Higgs expressed worry that "the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value".&lt;ref&gt;Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html "Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704185846/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html |date=4 July 2007 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist [[Paul McCarthy]] has created entire installations based on ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.

==Caricature==
An interesting example of simulacrum is [[caricature]]. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.

==Iconography==
Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;11) employs the term "simulacrum" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether [[iconic]] or [[aniconic]], in the landscape or greater field of [[Thangka]] art and Tantric Buddhist [[iconography]]. For example, an iconographic [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a [[sacred mountain]] in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an "auspicious canopy" (Sanskrit: [[Chhatra]]) of the [[Ashtamangala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Robert |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-416-2 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] approach a [[cultural universal]] and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the [[human psychology]].

==Word usage==
The Latinised plural ''simulacra'' is interchangeable with the anglicised version ''simulacrums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |title=simulacrum |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712155454/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book Thing was incorporated by a board of neighborhood volunteers. The Book Thing is open on weekends and is run by around 30 volunteers.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

On March 2, 2016, a fire broke out in the early morning, which was extinguished by the Baltimore Fire Department. The fire, which was confined to one room of the warehouse, did not destroy all the contents, but ruined approximately one-third of the books stored there; other rooms suffered smoke and soot deposition only. The Book Thing ceased accepting new book donations, but continues to accept monetary donations via their website. Volunteers assisted with cleanup of books both for disposal and for distribution the following Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jessica|title=Volunteers begin cleanup at The Book Thing|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-book-thing-update-20160305-story.html|accessdate=7 March 2016|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a period of cash donations, fundraisers, and new books, the place was reopened in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Hartman |date=November 10, 2017 |title=After fire, locals donate thousands of books to charity in Maryland |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-book-thing-baltimore-locals-donate-thousands-of-books/ |website=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=November 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fall of the Rebel Angels'''''  is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]].

==Description==
Painted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the [[Book of Revelation]] (12, 2-9)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&amp;version=KJV King James Version, 12, 2-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals the artist's profound debt to [[Hieronymous Bosch]], especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with ''[[Dull Gret|Dulle Griet]]'' and ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'', which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan:Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as ''Dulle Griet'', but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the [[Antwerp]] publisher [[Hieronymous Cock]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare Bruegel's engravings ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Superbia (Pride) - WGA3539.jpg|Pride]]'' and ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Gula (Gluttony) - WGA3541.jpg|Gluttony]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven. [[Pride]] was the sin which caused the fall of [[Lucifer]] and his companions, and the conflict of good and evil, vice and virtue, is a theme which recurs constantly in Bruegel's work.&lt;ref&gt;Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985.

'''''The Flag''''' is a painting by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] (1918), that represents her anxiety about her brother being sent to fight in Europe during [[World War I]], a war that was particularly dangerous due to the uses of new and especially dangerous weapons and tactics, like [[mustard gas]], [[naval mine]]s, high-powered guns, and [[Aviation in World War I|aerial combat]]. It was not displayed until 1968, in part because anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; It is in  the collection of the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!387953~!0#focus|title=The Flag|website=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.mam.org/details.php?id=9929|title=The Flag|website=Milwaukee Art Museum|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|text=Everything seems to be whirling or unbalanced—I'm suspended in the air—can't get my feet on the ground... I should think going to war would be a great relief from this everlasting reading about it—thinking about it—hearing talk about it—whether one believed in it or not—it is a state that exists and experiencing it in reality seems preferable to the way we are all being soaked with it second hand—it is everywhere… it's all like a bad dream.|author=—Georgia O'Keeffe in a letter to [[Paul Strand]].&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA192|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1918, O'Keeffe was in a state of depression and anxiety about the war and did not paint for three months. While she understood why it was important militarily, she found it at odds with [[humanism]] and basic [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roxana Robinson|author2=Georgia O'Keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1989|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-0-87451-906-8|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keeffe's brother, Alexius&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; or Alexis, was stationed in a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during [[World War I]]. She visited him in the fall of 1917 before he was shipped overseas, and was anxious about his fate.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He was one of the first soldiers sent to France and did not believe that he would return to the United States alive.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; In France war had become very dangerous due to chemical and technologically advanced weapons. Poisonous gases were used against troops, which could kill, blind, or severely injure them. High-powered and long-range guns could cause significant destruction. Submarines planted mines in the seas and airplanes dropped weapons from the sky.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/arts/design/review-world-war-i-the-quick-the-dead-the-artists.html|title=World War I — The Quick. The Dead. The Artists|website=New York Times|author=Holland Cotter|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Keeffe found herself at odds with people in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] about the war and was discouraged by attempts to glorify it.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She tried to persuade her male students to continue their education, rather than fight in the war&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 191" /&gt; and she also wanted authorities to create a course for young men about the reasons and causes of war before they engaged in battle.&lt;ref name="ABJ" /&gt; She created a stir when she asked a shop owner to remove Christmas cards from his shop that expressed anti-German sentiment.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; O'Keeffe became quite ill from [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which had killed an estimated 20 million people worldwide, and took a leave of absence from her teaching position at the [[West Texas State Normal College]] in early 1918 to recuperate at a friend's ranch in San Antonio,&lt;ref name="ABJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/156926133/|title=Watercolors Expand View of O'Keeffe|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|author=Malin Wilson|via=newspapers.com|date=April 16, 1998|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she painted ''The Flag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Hopkin Reily|title=Georgia O’Keeffe, A Private Friendship, Part I: Walking the Sun Prairie Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2gHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|date=December 1, 2014|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-63293-042-2|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Flag'', both a political statement and a reflection of her fears, is a red streak "bleeding into bruise-colored clouds".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In December 1917, she wrote that she felt compelled for the first time to paint from a sense of necessity. Her image for the painting was of a flag floating in the wind, similar to a tremble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgia O'Keeffe|author2=Alfred Stieglitz|title=My Faraway One: Selected Letters of Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz: Volume One, 1915–1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkuyi_Fg3YC&amp;pg=PA446|date=June 21, 2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16630-9|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Roxana Barry Robinson]] states, "O'Keeffe sets a drooping flag against a starless, darkening sky. The flag flutters limply, stripped of its stars and stripes; its only color, and that of the pole, is blood red."&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; Alexis died in France due to the effects of mustard gas.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]],&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and people living in Canyon were uneasy due to her anti-war position.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 192" /&gt; ''The Flag'' was in the private collection of Mrs. Harry Lynde Bradley in October 25, 1968, when it was part of a [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] exhibition, and was acquired by the museum in 1977.&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt; The painting is included in the "World War I and American Art" exhibition opened by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in January 2017. After about a four-month run it will travel to the [[New-York Historical Society]], where it will be shown until September 3, 2017.&lt;ref name="MAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Burton was originally attached to direct the 1985 film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'', but [[Martin Scorsese]] read the script at a time when he was unable to get financial backing to complete ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', which was finally completed in 1988; Burton gladly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in directing ''After Hours''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=Filming for Your Life: The Making of After Hours"|type=Bonus feature|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|location=Burbank, California|id=B000286RNE|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Big Top Pee-wee''===
After the [[Pee-wee's Big Adventure|1985 film]], Burton was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salisbury|Burton|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, ''Beetlejuice''.

===''Hot to Trot''===
After the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), and before his hiring of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), [[Warner Bros.]] sent Burton various scripts. He was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality, one of them being ''[[Hot to Trot]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==

===''Conversations with Vincent''===
Burton held a fascination with [[Vincent Price]] films since his childhood. He first worked with the actor on the 1982 television film ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', and a second collaboration on the 1982 short film ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]''. During the production of ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), in which Price portrayed the inventor, Burton conceived the idea of making an independent [[documentary film]] on the actor,&lt;ref name=Vince&gt;Hanke, pp. 116, 187&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[working title]] ''Conversations with Vincent''.&lt;ref name=died&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; With self-financing from his own production company, Burton shot the film in black-and-white over a three-day period at the Vincent Price Gallery in [[East Los Angeles College]] in April 1991. In addition to Price, [[Roger Corman]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] were interviewed. ''Conversations with Vincent'' was stalled when Burton went to work on ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt; and after Price's death in October 1993.&lt;ref name=died/&gt; In December 1994 it was announced that Burton was returning to the hour-long documentary, now titled ''A Visit with Vincent''. Lucy Chase Williams, author of ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', was working as a consultant. The film likely would have been released in the [[direct-to-video]] market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304825,00.html | title = Upcoming Projects for Tim Burton and Keanu Reeves | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1994-12-09 | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was ultimately abandoned and remains unfinished.&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt;

===''Drop Dead Fred''===
Burton was offered the chance to direct ''[[Drop Dead Fred]].'' He turned it down in favor of different projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/drop-dead-fred/257794/drop-dead-fred-looking-back-on-a-cult-classic|title=Drop Dead Fred: Looking Back On A Cult Classic|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=Den of Geeks|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''===
In 1990, Burton hired writer [[Jonathan Gems]] for write a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', entitled ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19751_6-insane-sequels-that-almost-ruined-classic-movies.html|title=6 Insane Sequels That Almost Ruined Classic Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of this project. In early 1991, Burton was still interested in directing the sequel, and hired [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] to rewrite the script, but the two decided to focus on ''Batman Returns''. By  August 1993, producer [[David Geffen]] hired [[Pamela Norris]] (''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') to rewrite the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodie|first=John|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR109942.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=Twentieth, Norris-Clay ink pact|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1993-08-26|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Warner Bros. decided to hire [[Kevin Smith]] to write another script, but he turned down the offer to write the script of the unmade ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later joked that his response was "Didn't we say all we needed to say in the first ''Beetlejuice''? Must we go tropical?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying "The ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian'' script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrante|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony C.

In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], who collaborated with Burton on ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'', to write and produce a sequel to ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=KatzSmith Duo Makes First-Look Warner Bros Deal; Will Bring 'Beetlejuice' Back From Dead|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/katzsmith-duo-makes-first-look-warner-bros-deal-will-bring-beetlejuice-back-from-dead/|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat."

In November 2013, [[Winona Ryder]] hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later.

===''Stay Tuned''===
[[Morgan Creek Productions]] originally wanted Burton to direct ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'' because of his work on ''Beetlejuice'' and his art style, but Burton left the project to direct ''Batman Returns'', the sequel to his [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]], and was replaced by [[Peter Hyams]] while having some of the art styles paying tribute to Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/stay-tuned/55430/looking-back-at-stay-tuned|title=Looking back at Stay Tuned|last=Childs|first=Paul|website=denofgeek|accessdate=February 22, 2018|date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Returns'' would be the last film in the Warner Bros. [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]] that featured Burton and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor.

Burton considered directing ''Go Baby Go'', a beach film in the style of filmmaker [[Russ Meyer]], with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct ''Mars Attacks!'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/2009/6/10/tim-burton-projects-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen.html|title=TIM BURTON projects that NEVER MADE it to the screen|last=Reyes|first=Eli|website=geektyrant|accessdate=July 18, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Geek Love''===
Burton bought the rights to ''[[Geek Love]]'' by [[Katherine Dunn]] in the 1990s. The story, about a traveling circus that uses chemicals to create genuine freaks, seemed perfect for Burton, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview with Dunn, she stated, "He's got the rights. That's half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he'd do. It's a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/2009/6/10/tim-burton-projects-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen.html|title=TIM BURTON projects that NEVER MADE it to the screen|last=Reyes|first=Eli|website=geektyrant|accessdate=July 18, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dinosaurs Attack!''===
Around 1995, writer Jonathan Gems wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of ''[[Dinosaurs Attack!]]'', with Burton as director. However, both Burton and Gems came to the conclusion that the project was too similar to ''Jurassic Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5963344/these-terrifying-dinosaurs-attack-trading-cards-from-the-1980s-traumatized-an-entire-generation|title=These terrifying Dinosaurs Attack! trading cards from the 1980s traumatized an entire generation|first=George|last=Dvorsky|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Toots and the Upside Down House''===
In 1996, when Burton was the CEO and founder of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' stop-motion studio division [[Skellington Productions]], he was going to produce the studio's planned third film, ''Toots and the Upside Down House'', that was based on the book by [[Carol Hughes (author)|Carol Hughes]] where a young girl still grieving over the death of her mother goes to a fantasy world inside her home when her dad still won't pay attention to her, where goblins, fairies and sprites live while helping the fairies battle an evil [[Jack Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='The Advanced Art of Stop-Motion Animation': History of Stop-Motion Feature Films: Part 2 | url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/advanced-art-stop-motion-animation-history-stop-motion-feature-films-part-2 | last=Priebe | first=Ken | publisher=''[[Animation World Network]]'' | quote="The relationship between Disney’s company Miramax and Henry Selick also became strained, as plans for another feature called ''Toots and the Upside Down House'' were abandoned. | accessdate=January 4, 2015 | date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton was attached to produce it, while [[Henry Selick]] was set to direct it (marking the third collaboration between Selick and Burton), with the screenplay written by [[Steven Soderbergh]] and co-produced by Disney's film partner at the time [[Miramax]], which would have made it the first original animated film made by the company.

Burton gave art director Sylvain Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside.

===''Goosebumps''===

===''Tim Burton's Lost in Oz''===
''Tim Burton's Lost in Oz'' would be a television series based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[List of Oz books|The Wizard of Oz]]'' book series. Burton would be its executive producer. A pilot episode was filmed in 2000, but the series became unproduced due to budget constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{MobyGames|game/wizard-of-oz}} - [http://mocagh.org/loadpage.php?getgame=wizardoz The Wizard of Oz] at the Museum of Computer Adventure Game History - [http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Telarium_Corporation.html Telarium Corporation] at Adventureland&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''===
{{More|Ripley's Believe It or Not!#Planned film}}
During the mid-2000s, Burton was scheduled to direct a film based on the famous ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' franchise, with [[Jim Carrey]] portraying [[Robert Ripley]] and a script by ''Ed Wood'' scribes [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]]; the film ran over budget however, and was shelved by [[Paramount Pictures]]. Burton moved on to direct ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. On January 12, 2011, it was reported that Paramount had revived development of the film with screenwriter [[Eric Roth]], with Carrey still attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/01/paramount-reviving-ripleys-believe-it-or-not-with-eric-roth-96116/|title=Paramount Reviving 'Ripley's Believe It Or Not' With Eric Roth|first=Mike Fleming|last=Jr|date=13 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' sequel===
In 2001, [[The Walt Disney Company]] began to consider producing a sequel to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', but rather than using [[stop motion]], Disney wanted to use [[computer animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Fred Topel | title = Director Henry Selick Interview – ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' | date = August 25, 2008 | work = [[About.com]] | url = http://movies.about.com/od/nightmarebeforechristmas/a/nightmare082508.htm | accessdate = September 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. "I was always very protective of ''Nightmare'' not to do sequels or things of that kind," Burton explained. "You know, 'Jack visits [[Thanksgiving]] world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies/|title=News - Entertainment, Music, Movies, Celebrity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Planets of the Apes'' sequel===

===''Batman: The Musical''===
In 2002, Burton, [[Jim Steinman]], and [[David Ives]] had worked on a theatre production called ''Batman: The Musical''. Steinman has revealed five songs from the musical. The first is the opening theme for "Gotham City" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo "The Graveyard Shift"; followed by "The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)", "The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)", "We're Still The Children We Once Were" (the climactic sequence) and "In The Land Of The Pig The Butcher Is King", sung by the corrupt blood-suckers ruling Gotham, covered on the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose]]''. After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the ''Batman: The Musical'' memorial site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071124212821/http://www.freewebs.com/batman_themusical/ Dark Knight of the Soul]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator''===
On July 11, 2005, Burton stated that he and [[Johnny Depp]] didn't have intentions of making a sequel to ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', based on the ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'' novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Willy Wonka's everlasting film plot|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some elements of ''Great Glass Elevator'' were seen at the end of Burton's film.

===''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' musical===
During production on the film ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', a broadway musical was planned to acompany it.

In an interview with ''[[9 (2009 animated film)|9]]'' director [[Shane Acker]]: "I think there is definitely room. I mean, the way we end the film, there is a slight suggestion that it may be a new beginning. And I think we could continue the journey from where we left off and see how these creatures are existing in a world in which the natural environment is coming back and perhaps even threatening them in some way. Do they make the decision to not affect it, or do they try to affect it in some way? And do they still try to hold on to that humanity within them or do they recognize themselves at being machines too and go off on a different trajectory? So there's lots of idea that I think that we could play with and make another story out of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/a-9-sequel|title=Shane Acker reveals possible plot for a sequel to ''9''|date=August 23, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2013|website=joblo.com|publisher="The Arrow"}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

No plans for a sequel have been made, but possibilities were mentioned via the film's 2009 DVD commentary. Director Acker has also mentioned the possibility of a sequel being made because of the lack of darker animated films, claiming that everything is G- and PG-rated with little to no dark elements.

===''The Hunchback of Notre-Dame''===
In March 2011, it was announced that Burton was attached to direct a film of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'', which was supposed to feature and be co-produced by [[Josh Brolin]] but the film has been scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2012/05/11/josh-brolin-hunchback-of-notre-dame/ Josh Brolin Excited To Play 'Funky' Hunchback Of Notre Dame].

===''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales''===
In June 2011, it was reported that Burton was being considered to be selected as the director for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', the fifth installment of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Sam-Raimi-Shawn-Levy-And-Others-Being-Considered-For-Pirates-5-Directing-Job-25007.html|title=Sam Raimi, Shawn Levy And Others Being Considered For Pirates 5 Directing Job - CINEMABLEND|date=1 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he chose to direct ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''.

===''Maleficent''===
Burton was briefly attached to direct ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2011, but chose to pursue ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' and ''Frankenweenie'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tim-burton-wont-direct-disneys-188700|title=Tim Burton Won't Direct Disney's 'Maleficent' (Exclusive)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dark Shadows'' sequel===
On December 7, 2011, Pfeiffer told [[MTV]] that she is hoping sequels will be made for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Kara |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/12/07/michelle-pfeiffer-dark-shadows-sequels |title=Michelle Pfeiffer Hoping For 'Dark Shadows' Sequels |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 2012, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Warner Bros. may want to turn ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' into a [[media franchise|film franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053697 |title='Dark Shadows' sharp enough for franchise? |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2012, [[Collider (website)|Collider]] mentioned that the ending of ''Dark Shadows'' lends itself to a possible [[Dark Shadows (film)#Possible sequel|sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053697 |title='Dark Shadows' sharp enough for franchise? |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date= May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, "No. Because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. The ending had more to do with the soap opera structure of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/johnny-depp-tim-burton-dark-shadows-interview/|title=Johnny Depp and Tim Burton Talk DARK SHADOWS, Pulling from the TV Series, Deleted Scenes, a Sequel and More|date=8 May 2012|publisher=collider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pinocchio''===
[[Robert Downey Jr.]] enlisted Burton to direct a Warner Bros. retelling of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' in 2012.

===''Deep''===
On June 11, 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with [[Valve Corporation]] to create his next animated feature film, ''Deep''. Like ''9'', the film will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). ''Deep'' would of been another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/shane-acker-valve-deep-movie-sandy-178699/|title=’9′ Director Teaming With Valve for Post-Apocalyptic Animated Film, 'Deep'|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been no further announcements. However, despite the silence from Acker, in January 2017, the Facebook profile of the character "the Scientist" was updated with a rather cryptic message. The profile had been inactive since 2009, leading some to speculate the teasing of a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The light has faintly flickered on again beneath the ashes and I have begun the long awaited search for hope...

'''Sir William Allan''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (1782 &amp;ndash; 23 February 1850) was a distinguished Scottish historical painter known for his scenes of Russian life. He became president of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] and was made a Royal Academician.

==Life and work==
[[File:Sir William Allan - Sir Walter Scott, 1771 - 1832. Novelist and poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Scott, novelist and poet - painted by Sir William Allan]]

Allan was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of William Allan Snr., macer, an officer of the [[Court of Session]]. He was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|High School, Edinburgh]], under William Nicol (1744?-1797), the companion of [[Robert Burns]]. Showing an aptitude for art, he was apprenticed to a coach-painter, and studied under [[John Graham (painter)|John Graham]] at the [[Edinburgh College of Art|Trustees' Academy]], with [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], and [[Alexander George Fraser]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

After a few years he came to [[London]], and entered the schools of the [[Royal Academy]]. His first exhibited picture was a ''Gipsy Boy with an Ass'' (1803), in the style of [[John Opie]]. 

In 1805 he travelled, by ship, to [[Russia]], but was wrecked at [[Klaipėda|Memel]], where he raised funds for the remaining journey by painting portraits of the Dutch consul and others. He then proceeded overland to [[St. Petersburg]], passing through a great portion of the Russian army on its way to [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. At the Russian capital he found friends, including Sir [[Alexander Crichton]], physician to the imperial family. Having learned Russian, he travelled in the interior of the country, and spent several years in the [[Ukraine]], making excursions to [[Turkey]], [[Tartary]], and elsewhere, studying the culture of [[Cossacks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Tartars]], and collecting arms and armour. In 1809 his picture ''Russian Peasants keeping their Holiday'' was exhibited at the Royal Academy. 

His wish to return home in 1812 had to be postponed due to the [[French invasion of Russia]], many of the horrors of which he witnessed first-hand.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}
[[File:Allan, David - Bashkirs - 1814.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Bashkirs'' (1814, [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]

Allan was able to return to Edinburgh in 1814, and, in 1815, his picture ''Circassian Captives'' attracted notice at the Royal Academy, though it did not find a purchaser. However, Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (1785–1854) and his brother [[James Wilson (zoologist)|James]] (1795–1856), [[John Gibson Lockhart|John Lockhart]], and others, raised a lottery for it, with 100 subscribers at £10 10s. each, and the picture was won by [[Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss]]. Allan remained in Edinburgh, and though his pictures (including ''Tartar Robbers dividing their Spoil'') did not find purchasers amongst his countrymen, some of them were bought by the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas]] when he visited Edinburgh. Allan afterwards painted some scenes from Scottish history suggested by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, such as ''Death of Archbishop Sharpe'' and ''Knox admonishing Mary Queen of Scots'' (exhibited in 1823 and engraved by [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]]). His ''Death of the Regent Murray'' (exhibited 1825) was purchased by the [[Duke of Bedford]] for 800 guineas, and gained the artist his election as an associate of the Royal Academy. 

In 1826 he was appointed master of the Trustees' School, Edinburgh, an office which he held until a few years before his death.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

[[File:Circassian Chief.jpg|thumb|''Circassian Chief'' (1843)]]
Soon afterwards Allan's health gave way, and he was threatened with blindness. To recuperate he went to [[Rome]], and, after spending a winter there, proceeded to [[Naples]], [[Constantinople]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Greece]]. In 1826 he exhibited ''Auld Robin Gray'' and in 1829 ''Prophet Jonah''. In 1830 he returned to Edinburgh, restored to health. His picture ''Slave Market, Constantinople'' was purchased by Alexander Hill, the publisher, and ''Byron in a Fisherman's Hut after swimming the Hellespont'' (exhibited 1831) by R. Nasmyth, who also bought Allan's portraits of Burns and Sir Walter Scott, which were engraved by John Burnet.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In 1832 Allan was living at 8 Scotland Street in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83399643|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=4|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 he visited [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]]. In 1835 he was elected a Royal Academician, and in 1838, on the death of Sir [[George Watson (painter)|George Watson]], was made president of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1841 he went to St. Petersburg, and in the same year succeeded Wilkie as [[Painter and Limner|limner to the queen]] in Scotland, an office which was, as usual, followed (in 1842) by a knighthood.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20105/page/1504 London Gazette, 3 June 1842, page 1504.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Sir William exhibited ''Battle of Waterloo from the English side'', which was purchased by the [[Duke of Wellington]]. The next year he went again to St. Petersburg, where he painted, for the Czar, ''Peter the Great teaching his Subjects the Art of Shipbuilding''. The last large work which he finished was a second view of the battle of Waterloo, this time from the French side. It was exhibited at [[Westminster Hall]] in 1846, in competition for the decorations of the Houses of Parliament, but was unsuccessful. He visited Germany and France in 1847.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

In his final years Sir William lived at 72 Great King Street, a substantial Georgian townhouse over five storeys, in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Bronchitis]] at his Edinburgh home on 23 February 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Tait's Edinburgh Magazine March 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death Sir William was engaged on a large picture of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].{{sfn|Monkhouse|1885}}

He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] against the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the late Victorian extension.

 |quote= In 1989, a group of women came together for the first WFTV (UK) meeting. A mix of executives, creatives and performers, they included Lynda La Plante, Norma Heyman, Jenne Casarroto, Dawn French, Joan Collins and Janet Street-Porter. [...]  They resolved to take positive action and follow in the footsteps of organisations in Los Angeles and New York City established in the '70s to support women working in the film and TV industries. [...]  In 1990, the first Women in Film awards ceremony was held to recognise the achievements of some of the most successful women the industry could boast. Twenty-five years on, the WFTV Awards is the largest annual celebration of women working in film, TV and digital media in the UK.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
