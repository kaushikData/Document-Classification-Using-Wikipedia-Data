== Discovery ==
Its discovery was based on studying its genetic behavior, i.e., "jumping genes" in maize and published by [[Barbara McClintock]],&lt;ref name="McClintock47"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClintock|first=Barbara | name-list-format = vanc |year=1947|title=Cytogenetic studies of maize and Neurospora|journal=Carnegie Inst.

Genomic analysis of maize show that these elements, which share terminal 11 bp imperfect [[inverted repeat]] sequences, have much sequence heterogeneity, both in length and content. They also include a class of DNA elements that do not transpose in the presence of the Ac element (Du et al. 2011). The chromosome breaking property has been shown to come from pairs of closely positioned elements.&lt;ref name="Huang08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang JT, Dooner HK | title = Macrotransposition and other complex chromosomal restructuring in maize by closely linked transposons in direct orientation | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 2019–32 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18708475 | pmc = 2553603 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.108.060582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers use mutant phenotypes to discover gene functions. Ac/Ds prefer to transpose to nearby genes, affording a way to mutagenize those regions of the genome, and by subsequent genetic crosses, remove the Ac that causes new mutants and instability of a Ds mutant. Collections of Ac/Ds elements that cover the genome and are useful for generating mutants.&lt;ref name="Vollbrecht_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vollbrecht E, Duvick J, Schares JP, Ahern KR, Deewatthanawong P, Xu L, Conrad LJ, Kikuchi K, Kubinec TA, Hall BD, Weeks R, Unger-Wallace E, Muszynski M, Brendel VP, Brutnell TP | title = Genome-wide distribution of transposed Dissociation elements in maize | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1667–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20581308 | pmc = 2910982 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.109.073452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of Ac/Ds toolkits has also been applied to other species like arabidopsis, yeast, and even zebrafish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In corn ==
Activator (Ac)/ Dissociation (Ds) transposable elements were discovered by Barbara McClintock when she was studying the maize genomic composition of the short arm of chromosome 9. She noticed that when chromosome 9 had been exposed to drastic cultural modifications, the progeny had changes such as multiple copies of the short arm or lacking one or more of its parts, as well as other changes.She believed that these changes were due to transposition of “mutable loci” into the genome and that these spontaneous translocations were not random due to where the breaks occurred and where they fused.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt;

Ac/Ds elements have been observed to insert into gene rich regions of the maize genome, they alter the regulation of gene expression and may create unstable insertion alleles, stable derivatives, or excision alleles due to insertion of a transposable element into a gene.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bai L, Brutnell TP | title = The activator/dissociation transposable elements comprise a two-component gene regulatory switch that controls endogenous gene expression in maize | journal = Genetics | volume = 187 | issue = 3 | pages = 749–59 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21196519 | pmc = 3063669 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.110.124149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transposable elements residing at or near a gene prevent gene expression and can also result in a mutation that causes exhibition of the recessive phenotype.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Döring HP, Starlinger P | title = Barbara McClintock's controlling elements: now at the DNA level | journal = Cell | volume = 39 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 253–9 | date = December 1984 | pmid = 6094008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of transposable element locus results in restoration of the gene organization and activity.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt; Ac is 4565 base pairs long and codes for a 3.5 kb open reading frame that synthesizes an 807 amino acid long transposase enzyme.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011" /&gt; Ac elements are autonomous and their movement results in a 4.3 kb insertion.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fedoroff N, Wessler S, Shure M | title = Isolation of the transposable maize controlling elements Ac and Ds | journal = Cell | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 235–42 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6313225 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(83)90226-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ds elements are not autonomous because they cannot produce the transposase  needed for transposition, and can only transpose when it is provided by the Ac element.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff_1983" /&gt; Ds elements have shown to cause a 4.1kB and 2.0 kB insertions.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff_1983" /&gt; The transposable elements were seen in progeny of plants that had undergone stress, and mutations caused by the insertion are like those caused by x-rays, UV light, or chemicals causing events like chromosome breakage and fusion.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt;

There are distinct families of transposon controlling elements that are made up of a combination of elements some that can, and some that cannot, transpose.The families differ in their developmental timing and transposition frequency, as well other types of genetic rearrangements.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff_1983" /&gt; Ac or Ds element insertion near a locus causes unstable mutations. Ds elements are considered non-autonomous because they cannot transpose without the presence of the Ac element, since they themselves cannot produce the enzyme tranposase needed for transposition.However, since Ds elements can utilize the transposase enzyme produced by the Ac elements, it shows that they have the structural information needed for transposition and only lack the information needed to produce the enzyme.Ds elements were identified at the site of a chromosome breakage.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt; Ac and Ds elements are structurally related because insertion of either element brings about similar mutations. They are also similar because their restriction endonuclease cleavage site maps are indistinguishable from each other.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff_1983" /&gt;

Different mutants display different levels of gene expression, which largely depends on the presence or absence of the transposable element somewhere else in the genome.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; The different function of the elements are detected as altered temporal or spatial patterns of somatic reversions or reversible inactivation of the entire element.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Some excision events of these elements restore gene function and can be detected as somatic reversions.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; If Ac or Ds insertions in an exon, and the transposable elements are excised leaving some of the duplicated base pairs behind, it alters the protein structure either by causing mutations  such as frame shift mutations or the addition of amino acids.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; In some cases, unstable Ds or Ac induced mutant can give rise to a stable recessive mutant.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Ac determines the mutation process and the mutable loci as well as their timing.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt; Ac transposase does not influence transcription initiation site selection, and large numbers of Ac elements may inhibit the expression of Ds by reducing the rate of transcription initiation instead of affecting the transcription site selection.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011" /&gt; Ac transposase is also capable of suppressing gene expression when Ac or Ds inserts in 5’ untranslated region using target sites.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011" /&gt; Ac or Ds element insertion sites have been characterized by the presence of different direct duplications of 6-10 base pairs prior to insertions, indicating that Ac transposase may have preference for short duplication as insertion sites.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Transposition of both Ac and Ds occurs during development of a tissue and is under precise control which is determined by the number of Ac loci present, their organization, and their position in the chromosome complement.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt; The transposable elements not only entirely remove or alter the gene function via insertion, but can also exert a mutator activity when they leave the position where they had visited the chromosome.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Induced disturbances in quantity and organization of the heterochromatic elements of the chromosome could give rise to a series of alterations in its structure, behavior, and in genic reactions that can alter phenotypic expression.&lt;ref name="McClintock50" /&gt;

The Ac and Ds elements share two properties that are common for transposable elements.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; One is that at the site of their insertion, a short DNA sequence is 8 base pairs long, and is duplicated and borders exactly at the Ac or Ds sequence.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Second, the sequences of several Ds elements terminate in an inverted repeat of the nucleotide sequence TAGGATGAAA.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; The Ds elements shows quite some degree of similarity with the Ac elements, such as the Ds9 element which is a complemental mutant of Ac and only differs in the open reading frame 1.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Other Ds elements differ from the Ac element by internal deletions.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt;

As Ac copy number increases, the expression of genes flanking the Ds promoter insertion are negatively regulated, which is called the negative dosage effect.&lt;ref name="Kunze_1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunze R, Stochaj U, Laufs J, Starlinger P | title = Transcription of transposable element Activator (Ac) of Zea mays L | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 1555–63 | date = June 1987 | pmid = 16453772 | pmc = 553524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ds flanking gene expression is inhibited in the presence of the autonomous Ac element.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011" /&gt; As the Ac element copy number increases, transposition events that require Ac occur at a later time during endosperm development.&lt;ref name="Kunze_1987" /&gt; Ac causes no or few chromosome breaks.  In the absence of Ac, Ds caused mutations are stable.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; By identifying alleles that suppress the Ac element they could be used for functional genomics studies.&lt;ref name="Bai_2011" /&gt; The properties of transposable elements can also be altered in a clonally heritable fashion.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Ds elements can be used as building blocks for complicated structures like the double Ds or the 30kb transposon-like insertion which is terminated by Ds elements.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Ds elements can generate long direct inverted duplicates of a chromosome segment, indicating that Ds elements are able to mobilize DNA sequences unrelated to themselves, this can provide a mechanism for rearrangement of genetic information.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt; Since small duplication of host DNA created by the insertion of the elements are left over in a slightly altered form after excision of the transposable element, they may indicate that plant transposable elements play a role in the evolution of genes.&lt;ref name="Döring_1983" /&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Allopatric speciation''' (from Ancient Greek ἄλλος, ''allos'', meaning "other", and πατρίς, ''patris'', "fatherland"), also referred to as '''geographic speciation''', '''vicariant speciation''', or its earlier name, the '''dumbbell model''',&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation | author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr | date=2004 | pages=1–545 | publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=978-0-87893-091-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}} is a mode of [[speciation]] that occurs when biological [[population]]s of the same [[species]] become isolated from each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with [[gene flow]].

Various geographic changes can arise such as the [[continental drift|movement of continents]], and the formation of mountains, islands, bodies of water, or glaciers. Human activity such as [[agriculture]] or developments can also change the distribution of species populations. These factors can substantially alter a region's [[geography]], resulting in the separation of a species population into isolated subpopulations. The vicariant populations then undergo [[Genetics|genetic]] changes as they become subjected to different [[Natural selection|selective pressures]], experience [[genetic drift]], and accumulate different [[mutation]]s in the separated populations [[gene pool]]s. The barriers prevent the exchange of genetic information between the two populations leading to [[reproductive isolation]]. If the two populations come into contact they will be unable to reproduce—effectively speciating. Other isolating factors such as [[Biological dispersal|population dispersal]] leading to [[emigration]] can cause speciation (for instance, the dispersal and isolation of a species on an oceanic island) and is considered a special case of allopatric speciation called [[peripatric speciation]].

Allopatric speciation is typically subdivided into two major models: vicariance and peripatric. Both models differ from one another by virtue of their population sizes and geographic isolating mechanisms. The terms '''allopatry''' and '''vicariance''' are often used in [[biogeography]] to describe the relationship between [[organism]]s whose [[Range (biology)|ranges]] do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other—they do not occur together or only occur within in a narrow zone of contact. Historically, the language used to refer to modes of speciation directly reflected biogeographical distributions.&lt;ref name="LanguageSpeciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Language of Speciation | author=Richard G. Harrison | journal=Evolution | year=2012 | volume=66 | issue=12 | pages=3643–3657 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01785.x | pmid=23206125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, allopatry is a geographical distribution opposed to [[sympatry]] (speciation within the same area). Furthermore, the terms allopatric, vicariant, and geographical speciation are often used interchangeably in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="LanguageSpeciation"/&gt; This article will follow a similar theme, with the exception of special cases such as peripatric, centrifugal, among others.

Observation of nature creates difficulties in witnessing allopatric speciation from "start-to-finish" as it operates as a dynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1970 | pages=279 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0674690134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this arises a host of various issues in [[Species problem|defining species]], defining isolating barriers, measuring [[reproductive isolation]], among others. Nevertheless, verbal and mathematical models, laboratory experiments, and empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the occurrence of allopatric speciation in nature.&lt;ref name="eLS2003"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Howard | first =Daniel  J. | title =Speciation: Allopatric  | journal =ELS | date =2003 | doi =10.1038/npg.els.0001748| isbn =978-0470016176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87-105}} Mathematical modeling of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation supports the plausibility of allopatric speciation; whereas laboratory experiments of ''[[Drosophila]]'' and other animal and plant species have confirmed that reproductive isolation evolves as a byproduct of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87}}

== Vicariance model ==
[[File:Allopatric Speciation Schematic.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|A population becomes separated by a geographic barrier; [[reproductive isolation]] develops, resulting in two separate species.]]
Speciation by vicariance is widely regarded as the most common form of speciation;&lt;ref name="eLS2003"/&gt; and is the primary model of allopatric speciation. Vicariance is a process by which the geographical range of an individual [[taxon]], or a whole [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], is split into discontinuous populations ([[disjunct distribution]]s) by the formation of an extrinsic barrier to the exchange of genes: that is, a barrier arising externally to a species. These extrinsic barriers often arise from various [[Geology|geologic]]-caused, [[Topography|topographic]] changes such as: the formation of mountains ([[orogeny]]); the formation of rivers or bodies of water; [[Glacial period|glaciation]]; the formation or elimination of [[land bridge]]s; the [[continental drift|movement of continents]] over time (by [[tectonic plates]]); or island formation, including [[sky island]]s. These can change the distribution of species populations. The emergence of suitable or unsuitable [[habitat]] configurations may arise from these changes and can originate by changes in [[climate]] or even large scale human activities (for example, agricultural, [[civil engineering]] developments, and [[habitat fragmentation]]). Among others, these many factors can alter a regions geography in substantial ways, resulting in the separation of a species population into isolated subpopulations. The vicariant populations then undergo [[genotypic]] or [[phenotypic]] divergence as: (a) they become subjected to different selective pressures, (b) they independently undergo [[genetic drift]], and (c) different [[mutation]]s arise in the [[gene pool]]s of the populations. The extrinsic barriers prevent the exchange of genetic information between the two populations, inevitably leading to differentiation due to the [[Ecology|ecologically]] different habitats they experience; selective pressure then invariably leads to complete [[reproductive isolation]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|86}} Furthermore, a species' proclivity to remain in its [[ecological niche]] (see [[phylogenetic niche conservatism]]) through changing environmental conditions may also play a role in isolating populations from one another, driving the evolution of new lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation and Ecology Revisited: Phylogenetic Niche Conservatism and the Origin of Species | author=John J. Wiens | journal=Evolution | year=2004 | volume=58 | issue=1 | pages=193–197 | doi=10.1554/03-447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Niche Conservatism: Integrating Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation Biology | author=John J.

Allopatric speciation can be represented as the extreme on a [[gene flow]] continuum.

=== Reproductive isolation ===

Reproductive isolation acts as the primary mechanism driving genetic divergence in allopatry&lt;ref name="Theory and speciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation | author=Michael Turelli| author2=Nicholas H.

Since species pairs who diverged in allopatry often exhibit pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms, investigation of the earliest stages in the life cycle of the species can indicate whether or not divergence occurred due to a pre-zygotic or post-zygotic factor. However, establishing the specific mechanism may not be accurate, as a species pair continually diverges over time. For example, if a plant experiences a [[Polyploid|chromosome duplication event]], reproduction will occur, but [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrids will result—functioning as a form of post-zygotic isolation. Subsequently, the newly formed species pair may experience pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction as selection, acting on each species independently, will ultimately lead to genetic changes making hybrids impossible. From the researchers perspective, the current isolating mechanism may not reflect the past isolating mechanism.&lt;ref name="Theory and speciation"/&gt;

=== Reinforcement ===
{{Main article|Reinforcement (speciation)}}
Reinforcement has been a contentious factor in speciation.&lt;ref name="eLS2012"&gt;{{Cite book | last= Hvala | first= John A. | last2 =Wood | first2 =Troy E. |title =Speciation: Introduction | journal =ELS | date =2012 | doi =10.1002/9780470015902.a0001709.pub3| isbn= 978-0470016176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more often invoked in [[sympatric speciation]] studies, as it requires gene flow between two populations. However, reinforcement may also play a role in allopatric speciation, whereby the reproductive barrier is removed, reuniting the two previously isolated populations. Upon [[secondary contact]], individuals reproduce, creating low-[[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] hybrids.&lt;ref name=Hoskinetal2005&gt;{{Citation |title=Reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation | author=Conrad J.

Reinforcement can play a role in all geographic modes (and other non-geographic modes) of speciation as long as gene flow is present and viable hybrids can be formed. The production of inviable hybrids is a form of [[Character displacement|reproductive character displacement]], under which most definitions is the completion of a speciation event.&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation"/&gt;

Research has well established the fact that [[Biological specificity|interspecific]] mate discrimination occurs to a greater extent between sympatric populations than it does in purely allopatric populations; however, other factors have been proposed to account for the observed patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Reinforcement and other consequences of sympatry | author=Mohamed A.

[[File:Allopatric Speciation with Reinforcement Schematic.svg|center|thumb|upright=3.5|In allopatric speciation, a species population becomes separated by a geographic barrier, whereby reproductive isolation evolves producing two separate species.

=== Mathematical models ===
Developed in the context of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, mathematical scenarios model both prezygotic and postzygotic isolation with respect to the effects of genetic drift, selection, [[sexual selection]], or various combinations of the three. [[Masatoshi Nei]] and colleagues were the first to develop a [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral]], [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] model of speciation by genetic drift alone. Both selection and drift can lead to postzygotic isolation, supporting the fact that two geographically separated populations can evolve reproductive isolation&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87}}—sometimes occurring rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A Mechanism for Rapid Allopatric Speciation | author=Christopher J.

Mathematical models concerning reproductive isolation-by distance have shown that populations can experience increasing reproductive isolation that correlates directly with physical, geographical distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Isolation by distance | author=Sewall Wright | journal=Genetics | year=1943 | volume=28 | issue= | pages=114–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Isolation by distance in equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations | author=Montgomery Slatkin | journal=Evolution | year=1993 | volume=47 | issue=1 | pages=264–279 | doi= 10.2307/2410134| pmid=28568097 | jstor=2410134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exemplified in models of [[ring species]];&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation" /&gt; however, it has been argued that ring species are a special case, representing reproductive isolation-by distance, and demonstrate parapatric speciation instead&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|102}}—as parapatric speciation represents speciation occurring along a [[Cline (biology)|cline]].

== Other models ==
Various alternative models have been developed concerning allopatric speciation. Special cases of vicariant speciation have been studied in great detail, one of which is peripatric speciation, whereby a small subset of a species population becomes isolated geographically; and centrifugal speciation, an alternative model of peripatric speciation concerning expansion and contraction of a species range.&lt;ref name="eLS2003"/&gt; Other minor allopatric models have also been developed are discussed below.

=== Peripatric ===
[[File:Peripatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|In peripatric speciation, a small, isolated population on the periphery of a central population evolves reproductive isolation due to the reduction or elimination of gene flow between the two.]] 
{{Main article|Peripatric speciation}}
Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} If a small population of a species becomes isolated (''e.g.'' a population of birds on an oceanic island), selection can act on the population independent of the parent population. Given both geographic separation and enough time, speciation can result as a byproduct.&lt;ref name="Theory and speciation"/&gt; It can be distinguished from allopatric speciation by three important features: 1) the size of the isolated population, 2) the strong selection imposed by the dispersal and colonization into novel environments, and 3) the potential effects of [[genetic drift]] on small populations.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} However, it can often be difficult for researchers to determine if peripatric speciation occurred as vicariant explanations can be invoked due to the fact that both models posit the absence of gene flow between the populations.&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{Citation |title=Divergence at the edges: peripatric isolation in the montane spiny throated reed frog complex | author=Lucinda P. Lawson |displayauthors=etal | journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology | year=2015 | volume=15 | issue=128 | pages=128 | doi=10.1186/s12862-015-0384-3 | pmid=26126573 | pmc=4487588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the isolated population is important because individuals colonizing a new habitat likely contain only a small sample of the genetic variation of the original population. This promotes divergence due to strong selective pressures, leading to the rapid [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] of an [[allele]] within the descendant population. This gives rise to the potential for genetic incompatibilities to evolve. These incompatibilities cause reproductive isolation, giving rise to rapid speciation events.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105-106}} Models of peripatry are supported mostly by species distribution patterns in nature. Oceanic islands and [[archipelago]]s provide the strongest empirical evidence that peripatric speciation occurs.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106-110}}

=== Centrifugal ===
[[Peripatric speciation#Centrifugal speciation|Centrifugal speciation]] is a variant, alternative model of peripatric speciation. This model contrasts with peripatric speciation by virtue of the origin of the genetic novelty that leads to reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{Citation |title=Patterns of Parapatric Speciation | author=Sergey Gavrilets |displayauthors=etal | journal=Evolution | year=2000 | volume=54 | issue=4 | pages=1126–1134 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1126:pops]2.0.co;2| citeseerx=10.1.1.42.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a population of a species experiences a period of geographic range expansion and contraction, it may leave small, fragmented, peripherally isolated populations behind. These isolated populations will contain samples of the genetic variation from the larger parent population. This variation leads to a higher likelihood of ecological niche specialization and the evolution of reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="eLS2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Centrifugal speciation | author=W.

=== Microallopatric ===
[[File:Female Cobalt Blue Zebra Cichlid.JPG|right|thumb|upright|A female [[Maylandia callainos|cobalt blue zebra cichlid]].]]

=== Modes with secondary contact ===
{{See also|Ecological speciation}}
Ecological speciation can occur allopatrically, sympatrically, or parapatrically; the only requirement being that it occurs as a result of adaptation to different ecological or micro-ecological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nosil|first=P.|title=Ecological Speciation|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199587117|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological allopatry is a reverse-ordered form of allopatric speciation in conjunction with [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].&lt;ref name="Johannesson2010"/&gt; First, divergent selection separates a non-allopatric population emerging from pre-zygotic barriers, from which genetic differences evolve due to the obstruction of complete gene flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Natural selection in action during speciation | author=Sara Via | journal=PNAS | year=2009 | volume=106 | issue= Suppl 1| pages=9939–9946 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901397106| pmid=19528641 | pmc=2702801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms allo-parapatric and allo-sympatric have been used to describe speciation scenarios where divergence occurs in allopatry but speciation occurs only upon secondary contact.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|112}} These are effectively models of reinforcement&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sympatric speciation in animals: new wine in old bottles | author=Guy L.

As allopatric speciation is widely accepted as a common mode of speciation, the scientific literature is abundant with studies documenting its existence. The biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] was the first to summarize the contemporary literature of the time in 1942 and 1963.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|91}} Many of the examples he set forth remain conclusive; however, modern research supports geographic speciation with molecular phylogenetics&lt;ref name=BarracloughVogler2000&gt;{{Citation |title=Detecting the Geographical Pattern of Speciation from Species-Level Phylogenies | author=Timothy G.

Allen Orr]]'s 2004 publication ''Speciation''. They list six mainstream arguments that lend support to the concept of vicariant speciation:
*Closely related species pairs, more often than not, reside in geographic ranges adjacent to one another, separated by a geographic or climatic barrier.
*Young species pairs (or sister species) often occur in allopatry, even without a known barrier.
*In occurrences where several pairs of related species share a range, they are distributed in abutting patterns, with borders exhibiting [[Hybrid zone|zones of hybridization]].
*In regions where geographic isolation is doubtful, species do not exhibit sister pairs.
*Correlation of genetic differences between an array of distantly related species that correspond to known current or historical geographic barriers.
*Measures of reproductive isolation increases with the greater geographic distance of separation between two species pairs. (This has been often referred to as [[Isolation by distance|reproductive isolation by distance]].&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation" /&gt;)

A negative value of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; denotes negative assortive mating, a positive value denotes positive assortive mating (i. e. expressing reproductive isolation), and a [[Null (mathematics)|null value]] (of zero) means the populations are experiencing [[Panmixia|random mating]].&lt;ref name=ABF&amp;AO2002/&gt;

The experimental evidence has solidly established the fact that reproductive isolation evolves as a by-product of selection.&lt;ref name="Rice&amp;Hostert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|90}} Reproductive isolation has been shown to arise from [[pleiotropy]] (''i.e.'' indirect selection acting on genes that code for more than one trait)—what has been referred to as [[genetic hitchhiking]].&lt;ref name="Rice&amp;Hostert" /&gt; Limitations and controversies exist relating to whether laboratory experiments can accurately reflect the long-scale process of allopatric speciation that occurs in nature. Experiments often fall beneath 100 generations, far less than expected, as [[Speciation in the fossil record|rates of speciation]] in nature are thought to be much larger.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87}} Furthermore, rates specifically concerning the evolution of reproductive isolation in ''Drosophila'' are significantly higher than what is practiced in laboratory settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title="Patterns of Speciation in Drosophila" Revisited | author=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne | author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr | journal=Evolution | year=1997 | volume=51 | issue=1 | pages=295–303 | doi= 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb02412.x| pmid=28568795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using index ''Y'' presented previously, a survey of 25 allopatric speciation experiments (included in the table below) found that reproductive isolation was not as strong as typically maintained and that laboratory environments have not been well-suited for modeling allopatric speciation.&lt;ref name=ABF&amp;AO2002/&gt; Nevertheless, numerous experiments have shown pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation in vicariance, some in less than 100 generations.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87}}

Below is a non-exhaustive table of the laboratory experiments conducted on allopatric speciation. The first column indicates the species used in the referenced study, where the "Trait" column refers to the specific characteristic selected for or against in that species. The "Generations" column refers to the number of generations in each experiment performed. If more than one experiment was formed generations are separated by semicolons or dashes (given as a range). Some studies provide a duration in which the experiment was conducted. The "Mode" column indicates if the study modeled vicariant or peripatric speciation (this may not be explicitly. [[Directional selection|Direct selection]] refers to selection imposed to promote reproductive isolation whereas indirect selection implies isolation occurring as a pleiotropic byproduct of natural selection; whereas divergent selection implies deliberate selection of each allopatric population in opposite directions (''e.g.'' one line with more bristles and the other line with less). Some studies performed experiments modeling or controlling for genetic drift. Reproductive isolation occurred pre-zygotically, post-zygotically, both, or not at all). It is important to note that many of the studies conducted contain multiple experiments within—a resolution of which this table does not reflect.

{{main|History of speciation}}
Early speciation research typically reflected geographic distributions and were thus termed geographic, semi-geographic, and non-geographic.&lt;ref name="LanguageSpeciation"/&gt; Geographic speciation corresponds to today's usage of the term allopatric speciation, and in 1868, [[Moritz Wagner]] was the first to propose the concept&lt;ref name=Jordan1905&gt;{{Citation |title=The Origin of Species Through Isolation | author=David Starr Jordan | journal=Science | year=1905 | volume=22 | issue=566 | pages=545–562 | doi=10.1126/science.22.566.545| pmid=17832412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he used the term ''Separationstheorie''.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010&gt;{{Citation |title=Why was Darwin's view of species rejected by twentieth century biologists? | author=James Mallet | journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy | year=2010 | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=497–527 | doi=10.1007/s10539-010-9213-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was later interpreted by [[Ernst Mayr]] as a form of [[founder effect]] speciation as it focused primarily on small geographically isolated populations.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt;

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], an evolutionary biologist and a strong proponent of the importance of natural selection, highlighted the role of geographic isolation in promoting speciation,&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation"/&gt; in the process coining the term "sympatric speciation" in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst 1942. ''Systematics and origin of species''. Columbia University Press, New York. p148&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy exists as to whether [[Charles Darwin]] recognized a true geographical-based model of speciation in his publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt; In chapter 11, "Geographical Distribution", Darwin discusses geographic barriers to migration, stating for example that "barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions [of the world]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the Origin of Species |date=1859 |publisher=Murray |page=347 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; F. J. Sulloway contends that Darwin's position on speciation was "misleading" at the least&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sulloway FJ | year = 1979 | title = Geographic isolation in Darwin's thinking: the vicissitudes of a crucial idea | url = | journal = Studies in the History of Biology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 23–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have later misinformed Wagner and [[David Starr Jordan]] into believing that Darwin viewed sympatric speciation as the most important mode of speciation.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|83}} Nevertheless, Darwin never fully accepted Wagner's concept of geographical speciation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt;

[[Image:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Ernst Mayr in 1994]]
David Starr Jordan played a significant role in promoting allopatric speciation in the early 20th century, providing a wealth of evidence from nature to support the theory.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name=Jordan1905/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Law of Geminate Species | author=David Starr Jordan | journal=American Naturalist | year=1908 | volume=42 | issue=494 | pages=73–80 | doi=10.1086/278905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, the biologist Ernst Mayr was the first to encapsulate the then contemporary literature in his 1942 publication ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species|Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist]]'' and in his subsequent 1963 publication ''[[Animal Species and Evolution]]''. Like Jordan's works, they relied on direct observations of nature, documenting the occurrence of allopatric speciation, of which is widely accepted today.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|83-84}} Prior to this research, [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] published ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' in 1937 where he formulated the genetic framework for how speciation could occur.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Other scientists noted the existence of allopatrically distributed pairs of species in nature such as [[Joel Asaph Allen]] (who coined the term "Jordan's Law", whereby closely related, geographically isolated species are often found divided by a physical barrier&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|91}}) and [[Robert Greenleaf Leavitt]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mutations and the Geographic Distribution of Nearly Related Species in Plants and Animals | author=Joel Asaph Allen | journal=American Naturalist | year=1907 | volume=41 | issue=490 | pages=653–655 | doi=10.1086/278852}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is thought that Wagner, [[Karl Jordan]], and David Starr Jordan played a large role in the formation of allopatric speciation as an evolutionary concept;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Growth of Biological Thought | edition= | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1982 | pages=561–566 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0674364462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Mayr and Dobzhansky contributed to the formation of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].

The late 20th century saw the development of mathematical models of allopatric speciation, leading to the clear theoretical plausibility that geographic isolation can result in the reproductive isolation of two populations.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|87}}

Since the 1940s, allopatric speciation has been accepted.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{Citation |title=The speciation revolution | author=James Mallet | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year=2001 | volume=14 | issue= 6| pages=887–888 | doi= 10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is widely regarded as the most common form of speciation taking place in nature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|84}} However, this is not without controversy, as both parapatric and sympatric speciation are both considered tenable modes of speciation that occur in nature.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Some researchers even consider there to be a bias in reporting of positive allopatric speciation events, and in one study reviewing 73 speciation papers published in 2009, only 30 percent that suggested allopatric speciation as the primary explanation for the patterns observed considered other modes of speciation as possible.&lt;ref name="Johannesson2010"/&gt;

Contemporary research relies largely on multiple lines of evidence to determine the mode of a speciation event; that is, determining patterns of geographic distribution in conjunction with phylogenetic relatedness based on molecular techniques.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|123-124}} This method was effectively introduced by [[John D. Lynch]] in 1986 and numerous researchers have employed it and similar methods, yielding enlightening results.&lt;ref name=Dendrobatid&gt;{{Citation |title=Integrating Phylogenetics and Environmental Niche Models to Explore Speciation Mechanisms in Dendrobatid Frogs | author=Catherine H. Graham| author2=Santiago R. Ron Juan C. Santos| author3=Christopher J.

Lomolino]], among other biologists specializing in ecology and biogeography. Similarly, full analytical approaches have been proposed and applied to determine which speciation mode a species underwent in the past using various approaches or combinations thereof: species-level phylogenies, range overlaps, symmetry in range sizes between sister species pairs, and [[Biological dispersal|species movements]] within geographic ranges.&lt;ref name=BarracloughVogler2000/&gt; [[Molecular clock]] dating methods are also often employed to accurately gauge divergence times that reflect the fossil or geological record&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|93}} (such as with the snapping shrimp separated by the closure of the Isthmus of Panama&lt;ref name=NKnowltonRoyalSoc/&gt; or speciation events within the genus ''[[Cyclamen]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Cyclamen: time, sea and speciation biogeography using a temporally calibrated phylogeny | author=C.

'''American University in Bulgaria''' (or '''AUBG''') is a private university located in [[Blagoevgrad]], [[Bulgaria]]. Established in 1991, today AUBG has about 1,000 students from over 40 countries on 5 continents (as of Fall 2018). Close to 15% of the students are international.

AUBG is an education leader for the seventh consecutive year according to the national university ranking 2017 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Tops Bulgaria’s University Ranking System in Five Programs |url=https://www.aubg.edu/rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five programs evaluated – Business Administration (BUS), Journalism and Mass Communication (JMC), Economics (ECO), Political Science and International Relations (POS), and Computer Science (COS) – are all top-ranked, with Business Administration and Political Science and International Relations rated as the best in Bulgaria. Additionally, AUBG graduates in BUS, ECO, JMC and POS are among the highest paid professionals in the country. AUBG also boasts the lowest unemployment rate in four programs: ECO, COS, JMC and POS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Tops Bulgaria’s University Ranking System in Five Programs |url=https://www.aubg.edu/rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1991, the American University in Bulgaria is the first American-style, liberal arts undergraduate education institution in Eastern Europe. The university is a cooperative venture established with the support of the U.S. and Bulgarian governments, the Open Society Institute, the City of Blagoevgrad, and the University of Maine.
When it opened its doors in September 1991, AUBG welcomed a first-year class of 208 students and 16 full-time faculty members. Nowadays, around 1100 students from over 40 countries live and study in AUBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG History |url=https://www.aubg.edu/quick-facts|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2018, twenty-three classes of around 5,000 students had graduated from AUBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Alumni |url=https://www.aubg.edu/news/aubg-salutes-class-of-2017-at-the-23rd-commencement-ceremony-1272|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The AUBG mission is "to educate students of outstanding potential in a community of academic excellence, diversity, and respect and to prepare them for democratic and ethical leadership in serving the needs of the region and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUBG Mission|url=http://www.aubg.edu/mission-values|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university fulfills its mission by providing scholarships and financial aid to deserving students from the region and beyond.

The university has three sources of funding: its endowment (which came largely from gifts from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[Soros Foundation]]), gifts, and tuition. Friends from all over the world, among them, John Dimitry Panitza, Anna Tchaprachikoff, Minko Balkanski, Atanas Zamphiroff, the America for Bulgaria Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=America for Bulgaria Foundation |url=http://www.us4bg.org/|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; have supported the university throughout the years.

==Accreditation==
Baccalaureate degrees conferred by AUBG are accredited in both Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neaa.government.bg/ |title=Republic Of Bulgaria - Council Of Ministers National Evaluation And Accreditation Agency |publisher=Neaa.government.bg |date= |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States. AUBG is institutionally accredited in the United States from the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref name=us1&gt;{{cite web |title=NEASC: Roster of Institutions |url=https://cihe.neasc.org/about-our-institutions/roster#Overseas |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university also issues a European Diploma Supplement (part of [[Europass]]), which confers automatic recognition of the AUBG degree throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Diploma Supplement |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/doc1239_en.htm |accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
[[File:AUBG Tops Bulgaria's University Ranking.jpg|thumb|Graduating students]]
AUBG graduates top global success rankings with 99.8 percent employed or enrolled in grad school within a few months of graduation.{{cite web |title=AUBG Tops Bulgaria’s University Ranking System in Five Programs |url=https://www.aubg.edu/rankings}}/ref&gt; Further, 65 percent of graduating students receive more than one job offer or higher degree program acceptance letter when they applied for work or a higher degree upon completing their studies at AUBG. Approximately 20 percent of graduates earn more than $100,000/year and over 20 percent of alumni from 1995-2005 who are currently working in the U.S. earn more than $250,000/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aubg.edu/alumni-placement-and-salary-survey |title=Alumni Placement and Salary Survey: 2016 edition findings |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, AUBG is an undisputed education leader for seventh consecutive year according to the national university ranking 2017 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsvu.mon.bg/rsvu3/?locale=en |title=AUBG Tops Bulgaria’s University Ranking |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five programs evaluated – Business Administration (BUS), Journalism and Mass Communication (JMC), Economics (ECO), Political Science and International Relations (POS), and Computer Science (COS) – are all top-ranked, with Business Administration and Political Science and International Relations rated as the best in Bulgaria. Additionally, AUBG graduates in BUS, ECO, JMC and POS are among the highest paid professionals in the country.

The Bulgarian University Ranking System has been developed to help degree-seekers choose a university. The system compiles information and data on more than 100 indicators, which measure different aspects of university activities. These include: teaching and learning, university environment, welfare and administrative services, science and research, prestige, career development, relevance to the labor market and regional engagement. The indicators are based on statistical data collected from various sources, including sociological surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsvu.mon.bg/rsvu3/ |title=Министерство на образованието и науката: Рейтингова система на висшите училища в България |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
[[File:AUBG Classroom Environment.jpg|thumb|Classroom Environment]]
The university follows the traditional American-style of education liberal arts. At AUBG, students benefit from small class-sizes, interactive classroom environment, and close interaction with professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=liberal+ arts + expleined|url=https://www.aubg.edu/liberal-arts-explained |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60% of the students graduate from AUBG with double majors or a major and a minor. More than half of graduating seniors complete double majors, while many undergraduates supplement their main field of study with a minor in one of 18 disciplines offered at AUBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=majors|url=https://www.aubg.edu/majors |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university employs 70 faculty members from over 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=faculty|url=https://www.aubg.edu/faculty |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUBG maintains close relationships with universities both in Bulgaria and abroad. In the United States, AUBG students can choose to spend a year or a semester at one of several hundred universities through the [[International Student Exchange Program]] (ISEP).

== Characteristics ==
An individual with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a steady rhythm. Before it was a known disorder, it was thought that these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in [[Schizophrenia]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder]] are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Arrhythmic Song Exposure Increases ZENK Expression in Auditory Cortical Areas and Nucleus Taeniae of the Adult Zebra Finch|date = September 26, 2014|journal = US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0108841|pmid = 25259620|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first = Brenton G.|pmc=4178233|volume=9|pages=e108841 | last1 = Lampen | first1 = J | last2 = Jones | first2 = K | last3 = McAuley | first3 = JD | last4 = Chang | first4 = SE | last5 = Wade | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological bases of music ==
The [[cerebellum]] houses the center for fine motor skills. These are needed in order to play the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[temporal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]] are necessary for listening and recalling different musical aspects from lyrics, reading the music, and performing.

Memory centers are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], and the process of listening to music originates there.

[[Neuroplasticity]] allows the brain to grow and change, especially in the [[Auditory cortex|auditory]] and [[motor cortex]]. Listening and playing music helps both of these areas of the brain to develop more, which was found to be correlated to having an improves auditory imagery in many performers in a study conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://brainworldmagazine.com/music-rhythm-and-the-brain-2/|title = Music, Rhythm and the Brain|date = March 7, 2011|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = Brain World|publisher = Brain World|last = Jun, M.D.|first = Passion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar diagnoses ==
Auditory arrhythmia can also be confused with something called [[beat deafness]]. Beat deafness is a form of congenital [[amusia]], which is a person's inability to move in time to the music, or feel a musical rhythm. It is believed by researchers that beat deafness stems from a connection problem between the brain's auditory cortex and inferior frontal lobe. A postdoctoral researcher with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal studied a case where a man could not feel a rhythm in any sense. Not only did he have difficulty dancing, but he was unable to tap his foot or snap his fingers along with the beat of the music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference between beat deafness and auditory arrhythmia, however, is that beat deafness is most likely something you are born with, whereas the arrhythmia most likely comes from damage, which was the case in the research done on "Mathieu," the first known case of beat-deafness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/03/15/6247114-cant-feel-the-rhythm-you-may-be-beat-deaf?lite|title = Can't feel the rhythm? You may be 'beat-deaf'|date = Mar 15, 2011|accessdate = February 19, 2015|website = The Body Odd|publisher = NBC News|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, a former musician known as H.J. suffered damage from a [[Temporoparietal junction|temporoparietal infarct]], which is an area of dead tissue due to lack of adequate blood supply. The infarct was believed to have been caused by a problem during a coronary angiography, which is a test to show the insides of an individual's coronary arteries. H.J. suffered difficulties with creating a steady beat, an inability to distinguish between different sets of rhythms, and also experienced difficulties when playing his instruments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rhythmic problems in animals other than humans ==
Research was conducted on birds such as the Zebra Finch because this species has parallels to humans' vocal learning patterns and neurological structures. Adult zebra finches were placed in similar conditions, all exposed to nine rhythmic and nine arrhythmic songs for 30 second increments. After the stimulus was presented, the brains were studied for areas of high ZENK concentration, ZENK being an [[immunohistochemical]] used to detect neural activation. It was found in the finches that those exposed to the arrhythmic music had much higher levels of the ZENK gene, and it has been discovered that there is a correlation with humans having higher brain activity in these locations with arrhythmic functioning. Gaining an understanding of how to change the deficiencies in these animals can help lead to changes in the future for humans with auditory arrhythmia and other serious psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Auditory processing in those with autism ==
Those diagnosed with [[autism]] tend to have many difficulties processing auditory stimuli. For example, they most often endure language and speech delays, [[hyperacusis]], have difficulties communicating in large social groups, and may experience difficulties hearing certain voices in a noisy environment. These qualities make quality of life difficult, by inhibiting their ability to fully participate in social and educational circumstances in various parts of their lives. As shown in research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, [[efferent pathways]] throughout the brain help to control various functions throughout the body. For example, in those with autism, pathways running through to the [[middle ear]] muscles make it difficult for the person to focus on a single voice when there is a lot of background noise. Raising eyelids was also found to hinder the [[stapedius]] muscle by tensing it, which in turn makes it difficult for these individuals to hear other talking when there is background noise present. The laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles located in the throat make [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] difficult to understand for people with autism. During research, tasks and tests were conducted to see if there is a correlation between [[cardiac rhythm]]s, [[respiratory sinus arrhythmias]], and [[auditory processing]], or auditory arrhythmia. Because these symptoms tend to go hand in hand, researchers were looking to see if there was a possibility of improving auditory processing. If researchers learn how to effectively improve auditory sensations in people diagnose with autism, then there is a possibility that they can then begin finding the improvement for those only suffering from auditory arrhythmia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and auditory processing in autism: Modifiable deficits of an integrated social engagement system?|last = Porges|first = Stephen W.|date = November 29, 2012|journal = Psychophysiology of Relationships|doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2012.11.009|pmid = 23201146|last2 = Macellaio|first2 = Matthew|last3 = Stanfill|first3 = Shannon D.|last4 = McCue|first4 = Kimberly|last5 = Lewis|first5 = Gregory F.|last6 = Harden|first6 = Emily R.|last7 = Handelman|first7 = Mika|last8 = Denver|first8 = John|last9 = Bazhenova|first9 = Olga V.|pmc=3610863|volume=88|pages=261–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research ==
The Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago Therapeutic School and Center for Autism Research has conducted studies on auditory processing in individuals with autism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal has found that beat and tone deafness are likely genetic, and believe that it is because of a miswiring between the auditory cortex and inferior frontal cortex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They were also major researchers on Mathieu's case of beat deafness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands show that there is an association with an improves ability for auditory imagery and music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; McGill University also studied Mathieu's case, along with another individual known as Marjorie. The studies conducted show that true beat deafness is an extremely rare disorder, because out of all the individuals who applied thinking they were beat deaf, Marjorie and Mathieu were the only two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/11/12/why-some-people-just-cant-dance-or-clap-to-the-beat/|title = Why some people just can’t dance or clap to the beat|date = November 12, 2014|accessdate = February 21, 2015|website = The Washington Post|publisher = |last = Philip|first = Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.J.'s case has been studied in Victoria, Australia at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University. The data collected caused researchers to believe that the right temporal auditory cortex plays a large role in an individual's ability to maintain a steady rhythm, and has provided a platform for future [[neuropsychological]] research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110620">'''Bahá'í studies''' refers to the scholarly study of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], its [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history]] and [[Bahá'í literature|literature]].  Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Bahá'í administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

==Bahá'í review==
{{main|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Bahá'í review|review]] by the [[Bahá'í administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form

A '''computer emergency response team''' ('''CERT''') is an expert group that handles [[computer security]] incidents. Alternative names for such groups include '''computer emergency readiness team''' and '''computer security incident response team''' ('''CSIRT''').

==History==
The name "Computer Emergency Response Team" was first used in 1988 by the [[CERT Coordination Center]] (CERT-CC) at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU). The abbreviation CERT of the historic name was picked up by other teams around the world. Some teams took on the more specific name of CSIRT to point out the task of handling computer security incidents instead of other [[tech support]] work, and because CMU was threatening to take legal action against individuals or organisations who referred to any other team than CERT-CC as a CERT. After the turn of the century, CMU relaxed its position, and the terms CERT and CSIRT are now used interchangeably.

The history of CERTs is linked to the existence of [[malware]], especially [[computer worm]]s and [[computer virus|viruses]]. Whenever a new [[technology]] arrives, its misuse is not long in following. The first worm in the [[IBM]] [[VNET]] was covered up. Shortly after, a worm hit the [[Internet]] on 3 November 1988, when the so-called [[Morris Worm]] paralysed a good percentage of it.  This led to the formation of the first computer emergency response team at Carnegie Mellon University under [[United States government|U.S. Government]] contract. With the massive growth in the use of information and communications technologies over the subsequent years, the now-generic term 'CERT'/'CSIRT' refers to an essential part of most large organisations' structures. In many organisations the CERT evolves into a [[information security operations center]].

In [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], a '''time-constructible function''' is a function ''f'' from [[natural numbers]] to natural numbers with the property that ''f''(''n'') can be constructed from ''n'' by a [[Turing machine]] in the time of order ''f''(''n''). The purpose of such a definition is to exclude functions that do not provide an upper bound on the runtime of some Turing machine.

==Time-constructible definitions==
There are two different definitions of a time-constructible function. In the first definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In the second definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, outputs the binary representation of ''f''(''n'') in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time (a unary representation may be used instead, since the two can be interconverted in ''O''(''f''(''n'')) time).

There is also a notion of a fully time-constructible function. A function ''f'' is called '''fully time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps. This definition is slightly less general than the first two but, for most applications, either definition can be used.

==Space-constructible definitions==
Similarly, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Equivalently, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of ''n'' ones, outputs the binary (or unary) representation of ''f''(''n''), while using only ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) space.

Also, a function ''f'' is '''fully space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells.

==Examples==
All the commonly used functions ''f''(''n'') (such as ''n'', ''n&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'', 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) are time- and space-constructible, as long as ''f''(''n'') is at least ''cn'' for a constant ''c'' &gt; 0. No function which is ''[[little-o notation|o]]''(''n'') can be time-constructible unless it is eventually constant, since there is insufficient time to read the entire input. However, {{tmath|\log(n)}} is a space-constructible function.

==Applications==
Time-constructible functions are used in complexity theory results such as the [[time hierarchy theorem]]. They are important because the time hierarchy theorem relies on Turing machines that must determine in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time whether an algorithm has taken more than ''f''(''n'') steps.  This is, of course, impossible without being able to calculate ''f''(''n'') in that time.  Such results are typically true for all natural functions ''f'' but not necessarily true for artificially constructed ''f''. To formulate them precisely, it is necessary to have a precise definition for ''a natural function f'' for which the theorem is true. Time-constructible functions are often used to provide such definition.

Space-constructible functions are used similarly, for example in the [[space hierarchy theorem]].

'''Critical ionization velocity''' (CIV), or '''critical velocity''' (CV), is the relative velocity between a neutral [[gas]] and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (an ionized gas), at which the neutral gas will start to [[ionize]]. If more energy is supplied, the velocity of the atoms or molecules will not exceed the critical ionization velocity until the gas becomes almost fully ionized.

The phenomenon was predicted by Swedish engineer and plasma scientist, [[Hannes Alfvén]], in connection with his model on the origin of the [[Solar System]] (1942).&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén "On the cosmogony of the Solar System", in ''Stockholms Observatoriums Annaler'' (1942) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/StoAn/0014//0000042.000.html Part I] [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1942StoAn..14....5A Part II] [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1942StoAn..14....9A Part III]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1954QB501.A53......&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c08806 On the Origin of the Solar System]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1960RvMP...32..710A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c08305 Collision between a nonionized gas and a magnetized plasma], ''Rev. Mod. Phys.''., vol. 32, p. 710, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, no known mechanism was available to explain the phenomenon, but the theory was subsequently demonstrated in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="U.V. Fahleson 1961"&gt;U.V. Fahleson, "Experiments with plasma moving through neutral gas", Phys. Fluids, 4 123 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research by Brenning and Axnäs (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Brenning, N ., Axnas, I: "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1988Ap%26SS.144...15B&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c28386 Critical ionization velocity interactions : Some unsolved problems]", (1988) ''Astrophys. Space Sci''. 144 15&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a [[Lower hybrid oscillation|''lower hybrid'']] plasma [[instability]] is involved in transferring energy from the larger ions to electrons so that they have sufficient energy to ionize. Application of the theory to astronomy through a number of experiments have produced mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;R. Torbert,: "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1988AdSpR...8Q..39T&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c02285 Review of ionospheric CIV experiments]", XXVIIth COSPAR Meet., (1988) Helsinki, Finland, paper XIII.2. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lai, Shu T. 2001 p. 471-506"&gt;Lai, Shu T., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001RvGeo..39..471L&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 A review of critical ionization velocity] (2001) ''Reviews of Geophysics'', Volume 39, Issue 4, p. 471-506&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm carried out the first laboratory tests, and found that (a) the relative velocity between a plasma and neutral gas could be increased to the critical velocity, but then additional energy put into the system went into ionizing the neutral gas, rather than into
increasing the relative velocity, (b) the critical velocity is roughly independent of the pressure and magnetic field.&lt;ref name="U.V. Fahleson 1961"/&gt;

In 1973, Lars Danielsson published a review of critical ionization velocity, and concluded that the existence of the phenomenon "is proved by sufficient experimental evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Lars Danielsson, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1973Ap%26SS..24..459D&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03369 Review of the Critical Velocity of Gas-Plasma Interaction. I: Experimental Observations]", ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' (1973)
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Alfvén reported that "The first observation of the critical velocity effect under cosmic conditions was reported by Manka et al. (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Manka, R. H., et al., "Evidence for acceleration of lunar ions", in ''Lunar Science III'', C. Watkins, ed., (The Lunar Science Institute, Houston, Tx.): 504. (1972)
&lt;/ref&gt; from the Moon. When an abandoned lunar [391] excursion module was made to impact on the dark side of the Moon not very far from the terminator, a gas cloud was produced which when it had expanded so that it was hit by the solar wind gave rise to superthermal electrons."&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch21.htm Mass Distribution and the Critical Velocity]", ''Evolution of the Solar System'' (1976)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, critical ionization velocity has been recognised for some time, and is seen in the penumbra produced by a [[dense plasma focus]] device (or plasma gun). Its existence in cosmic plasmas has not been confirmed.

In 1986, Gerhard Haerendel, suggested that critical velocity ionization may stabilize the plasma flow in a cometary coma,.&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"&gt;G. Haerendel: "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986GeoRL..13..255H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c32239 Plasma flow and critical velocity ionization in cometary comae]", (1986) ''Geophys. Res. Lett''. 13 25 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, E. Golbraikh and M. Filippov argued that critical ionization velocity could play a role in [[coronal mass ejection]]s and [[solar flare]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Golbraikh, E. I.; Filippov, M. A., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992ssts.rept..345G&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 Possible manifestation of the critical ionization velocity phenomenon in the solar corona] (1992), ''ESA, Study of the Solar-Terrestrial System''.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1992, [[Anthony Peratt]] and [[Gerrit Verschuur]] suggested that interstellar neutral hydrogen emissions bore the signature of critical velocity ionization,.&lt;ref&gt;Peratt, Anthony; Verschuur, Gerrit, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002APS..DPPQP1017P&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03435 The Critical Ionization Velocity Signature Manifested in Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen Emission Profile Structure], (1992), ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'', Vol. 34, p.766
&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 review of the phenomenon by Shu T. Lai reports that ".. laboratory experiments, and computer simulations have all shown CIV as feasible and reasonably understood, although all CIV experiments in space have yielded negative results with perhaps three exceptions".&lt;ref name="Lai, Shu T. 2001 p. 471-506"/&gt;

Also in 2001, C. Konz, et al., ".. discuss the critical velocity effect as a possible explanation for the observed Hα emission [..] in the Galactic halo near the edges of cold gas clouds of the Magellanic Stream"&lt;ref&gt;Konz, C.; Lesch, H.; Birk, G. T.; Wiechen, H., "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001ApJ...548..249K&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=4521318e0206624 The Critical Velocity Effect as a Cause for the Hα Emission from the Magellanic Stream]" (2001) in ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Volume 548, Issue 1, pp. 249-252&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIV phenomenon has been also demonstrated in different Low Temperature Plasma (LTP) laboratory experiments where a plasma and a neutral gas are in relative motion across a magnetic field such as magnetrons. Simulations involving plasma accelerated in a gas similar to the cross-field LTP experiments shows rotating instabilities moving at a velocity close to the critical ionization velocity&lt;ref&gt;Boeuf, J.

Mathematically, the critical ionization velocity of a neutral cloud, that is, when the cloud begins to become ionized, is when the relative kinetic energy is equal to the ionization energy, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = eV_{ion}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''eV&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ionization potential of the atoms or molecules in the gas cloud, ''m'' is the mass, ''v'' is the velocity. The phenomenon is also called the ''Critical velocity ionization'',&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"/&gt; and also ''Critical velocity effect'',.&lt;ref&gt;Petelski, E. F.; Fahr, H. J.; Ripken, H. W.; Brenning, N.; Axnas, I., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1980A&amp;A....87...20P Enhanced interaction of the solar wind and the interstellar neutral gas by virtue of a critical velocity effect] (1980)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfvén considered a neutral gas cloud entering the Solar System, and noted that a neutral atom will fall towards the Sun under the influence of gravity, and its kinetic energy will increase. If their motion is random, collisions will cause the gas temperature to rise, so that at a certain distance from the Sun, the gas will ionize. Alfvén writes that the ionization potential of the gas, V&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;, occurs when:

:&lt;math&gt;eV_{ion} = E_g = \frac{k M m}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, at a distance of:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{i} = E_g = \frac{k M m}{eV_{ion}} = 6.9\cdot 10^{-20}M \frac{m'}{V_{ion}} = 13.5\cdot 10^{13} \frac{m'}{V_{ion}} cm&lt;/math&gt;

(where r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ion distance from the Sun of mass ''M'', ''m''' is the atom weight, ''V&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in volts, ''k'' is the gravitational constant). Then when the gas becomes ionized, electromagnetic forces come into effect, of which the most important is the magnetic force which is usually greater than the gravitational force which gives rise to a magnetic repulsion from the Sun. In other words, a neutral gas falling from infinity toward the Sun is stopped at a distance r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; where it will accumulate, and perhaps condense into planets.

Alfvén found that by taking a gas cloud with an average ionisation voltage of 12&amp;nbsp;V, and average atomic weight of 7, then the distance r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is found to coincide with the orbit of Jupiter.

The critical ionization velocity of hydrogen 50.9&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s (50.9&amp;nbsp;km/s), and helium is 34.3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;cm/s (34.3&amp;nbsp;km/s).&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"&gt;Hannes Alfvén, Evolution of the Solar System (1980) "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch21.htm 21. Mass Distribution And The Critical Velocity]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background  ===

Alfvén discusses his thoughts behind critical velocity, in his NASA publications Evolution of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; After criticising the "Inadequacy of the Homogeneous Disc Theory", he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;".. it is more attractive to turn to the alternative that the secondary bodies derive from matter falling in from "infinity" (a distance large compared to. the satellite orbit). This matter (after being stopped and given sufficient angular momentum) accumulates at specific distances from the central body. Such a process may take place when atoms or molecules in free fall reach a kinetic energy equal to their ionization energy. At this stage, the gas can become ionized by the process discussed in sec. 21.4; the ionized gas can then be stopped by the magnetic field of the central body and receive angular momentum by transfer from the central body as described in sec. 16.3.".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Design theory''' is a subfield of [[design research]] concerned with various theoretical approaches towards understanding and delineating design principles, design knowledge, and design practice.

== History ==

Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the [[philosophy of design]] to a search for a [[design science]].

The essay "Ornament and Crime" by [[Adolf Loos]] from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's ''Vers une architecture'',&lt;ref name="Corbusier 1923"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture" (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Papanek]]'s ''Design for the real world'' (1972).

In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the [[De Stijl]] movement promoted a geometrical abstract, "ascetic" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the [[Bauhaus]] movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.

For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/cephad-centre-philosophy-design/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

An example of early design science was Altshuller's ''Theory of inventive problem solving'', known as [[TRIZ]], from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 ''The sciences of the artificial'' began a more scientific basis to the study of design. &lt;ref name="simon1996"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon|title='The Sciences of the Artificial|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=0-262-69191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the further development of fields such as [[design methods]], [[design research]], [[design science]] and [[design thinking]] has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7248">The '''fitness-density covariance''' is a [[coexistence theory|coexistence mechanism]] that can allow similar species to coexist because they are in different locations.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=General Theory of Competitive Coexistence in Spatially-Varying Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=November 2000|volume=58|issue=3|pages=211–237|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486|pmid=11120650}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect will be the strongest if species are completely segregated, but can also work if their populations overlap somewhat.  If a fitness-density covariance is operating, then when a species becomes very rare, its population will shift to predominantly locations with favorable conditions (e.g., less competition or good [[habitat]]). Similarly, when a species becomes very common, then conditions will worsen where they are most common, and they will spread into areas where conditions are less favorable.  This negative feedback can help species avoid being driven extinct by competition, and it can prevent stronger species from becoming too common and crowding out other species.

Along with [[storage effect]]s and [[relative nonlinearity|relative nonlinearities]], fitness-density covariances make up the three variation-dependent mechanisms of [[coexistence theory|modern coexistence theory]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Mechanisms of Maintenance of Species Diversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=November 2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=343–366|doi=10.1146/Annurev.Ecolsys.31.1.343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical derivation==
Here, we will consider competition between ''n'' species.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  We will define ''N''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') as the number of individuals of species ''j'' at patch ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') the fitness (i.e., the per-capita contribution of individual to the next time period through survival and reproduction) of individuals of species ''j''s at patch ''x'' and time ''t''.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(t) will be determined by many things, including [[habitat]], [[intraspecific competition]], and [[interspecific competition]] at ''x''.  Thus, if there are currently ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals at ''x'', then they will contribute ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') individuals to the next time period (i.e., ''t''+1).  Those individuals may stay at ''x'', or they may move; the net contribution of ''x'' to next year's population will be the same.

With our definitions in place, we want to calculate the finite rate of increase of species ''j'' (i.e., its population-wide growth rate), &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is defined such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{N_j(t+1)}/ \overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where each average is across all space.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  In essence, it is the average fitness of members of species ''j'' in year ''t''.  We can calculate ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''+1) by summing ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') across all patches, giving
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \frac{N_{xj}(t)\lambda_{xj}(t)}{\overline{N_j(t)}} , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is the number of patches.  Defining &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_j(t)}&lt;/math&gt; as species ''j'''s relative density at ''x'', this equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \frac{1}{X}\sum_X \nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}\lambda_{xj}(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the theorem that &lt;math&gt;\overline{XY} = \overline{X}~\overline{Y} + \mbox{cov}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\nu_{xj}}\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\nu_{xj} = N_{xj}(t)/\overline{N_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, its average will be 1.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t) = \overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xj}, \lambda_{xj}(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, we have partitioned &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt; into two key parts: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; calculates the fitness of an individual, on average in any given site.  Thus, if species are distributed uniformly across the landscape, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)=\overline{\lambda_{xj}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. If, however, they are distributed non-randomly across the environment, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be non-zero.  If individuals are found predominantly in good sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be positive; if they are found predominantly in poor sites, then cov(''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''xj''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;xj&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')) will be negative.

To analyze how species coexist, we perform an [[invasion analysis]].&lt;ref name="Chesson2000review" /&gt;  In short, we remove one species (called the "invader") from the environment, and allow the other species (called the "residents") to come the equilibrium (so that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident).  We then determine if the invader has a positive growth rate.  If each species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then they can coexist.

Because &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for each resident, we can calculate the invader's growth rate, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = \tilde{\lambda_i}(t) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum (\tilde{\lambda_r}(t) - 1),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n''-1 is the number of residents (since ''n'' is the number of species), and the sum is over all residents (and thus represents an average).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;  Using our formula for &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we find that
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) = [\overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) ] - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum [\overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)}+ \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))- 1].&lt;/math&gt;
This rearranges to
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_i}(t) =1+ \left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right]+ \Delta \kappa .&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \kappa = \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xi}, \lambda_{xi}(t)) - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum \mbox{cov}(\nu_{xr}, \lambda_{xr}(t))&lt;/math&gt;
is the fitness-density covariance, and &lt;math&gt;\left[ \overline{\lambda_{xi}(t)} -\frac{1}{n-1} \sum \overline{\lambda_{xr}(t)} \right] &lt;/math&gt; contains all other mechanisms (such as the [[storage effect|spatial storage effect]]).&lt;ref name="Chesson2000space" /&gt;

Thus, if Δ''κ'' is positive, then the invader's population is more able to build up its population in good areas (i.e., ''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'' is higher where ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') is large), compared to the residents.  This can occur if the invader builds up in good areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xi&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is very positive) or if the residents are forced into poor areas (i.e., cov(''ν&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;xr&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) is less positive, or negative).  In either case, species gain an advantage when they are invaders, a key point of any [[coexistence theory#Stabilizing mechanisms|stabilizing mechanism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Floor hockey''' is a family of indoor [[hockey]] games. 5 variations exist: three variations in the style of [[ice hockey]], and the other two in the style of [[bandy]], one of which is called [[floorball]] in English speaking regions.
Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as [[roller sports]] under the title of [[roller hockey]]. [[Quad hockey]] uses [[quad skates]] and looks similar to bandy, while [[inline hockey]] uses [[inline skates]] and is of the ice hockey variation.
All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a
curved end.&lt;ref&gt;“Floor Hockey Rules,” http://sportsvite.com/sports/FloorHockey/rules{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floor hockey games differ from [[street hockey]] in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=158|chapter=floor hockey|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bandy in a training format known as [[dryland training]].

==History==
Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Samuel Perry Jacks]], better known as "Sam Jacks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportshall.ca/stories.html?proID=491&amp;catID=all&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in [[Toronto]]. His achievement was later recognized by the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. “Ice Hockey”&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[ringette]] was introduced as a sport in the Winter [[Special Olympics]] in 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1970, the [[Special Olympics]] added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floor Hockey: Sport History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110631/http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|archive-date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|publisher= Special Olympics – Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Ball Hockey Association]] (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey.&lt;ref&gt;“Canadian Ball Hockey Association History,” The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.&lt;ref&gt;“CBHA Who We Are”, The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor [[Puck (sports)|puck]], a ring made of felt or other material ( [[Gym Ringette]] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard [[ice hockey]], field hockey or [[bandy]] sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.

==Variations==

One variation, especially popular in [[Europe]], is [[floorball]]. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

Another variation, [[cosom hockey]], uses plastic sticks and pucks, while [[gym ringette]] uses circular rings and sticks with no blade.

[[Power hockey]] is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs.
Knee pads are required for the goal keeper

== Rules ==

Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code.

With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into overtime in order to determine a winner.  Overtime rules vary, but typically include [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]].

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced.  A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a [[power play (sport)|power play]], but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
*  Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
*  Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player’s forward progress by pulling him or her back
*  Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body
*  Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
*  High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
*  Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
*  Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind

Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,&lt;ref name="nirsa.org"&gt;“NIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,” Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, http://www.nirsa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Sports/IntramuralRules/im_floorhockey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

'''Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|eɪ|g|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/frege "Frege"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈɡɔtloːp ˈfreːɡə|lang}}; 8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925) was a German [[philosopher]], [[Mathematical logic|logician]], and [[mathematics|mathematician]].  He is understood by many to be the father of [[analytic philosophy]], concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.

His contributions include the development of modern logic in the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and work in the [[foundations of mathematics]].  His book the ''[[Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' is the seminal text of the [[logicist]] project, and is cited by [[Michael Dummett]] as where to pinpoint the [[linguistic turn]].  His philosophical papers "[[On Sense and Reference]]" ("Über Sinn und Bedeutung") and "The Thought" ("Der Gedanke") are widely cited.

== Life ==

=== Childhood (1848–69) ===
Frege was born in 1848 in [[Wismar]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (today part of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]). His father Carl (Karl) Alexander Frege (1809–1866) was the co-founder and headmaster of a girls' high school until his death. After Carl's death, the school was led by Frege's mother Auguste Wilhelmine Sophie Frege (née Bialloblotzky, 12 January 1815 – 14 October 1898); her mother was Auguste Amalia Maria Ballhorn, a descendant of [[Philipp Melanchthon]]&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Kreiser, ''Gottlob Frege: Leben - Werk - Zeit'', Felix Meiner Verlag, 2013, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and her father was Johann Heinrich Siegfried Bialloblotzky, a descendant of a [[Poles|Polish]] noble family who left Poland in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt Richter, [http://www.genetalogie.de/gg/alfrege.pdf "Ahnenliste des Mathematikers Gottlob Frege, 1848-1925"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In childhood, Frege encountered philosophies that would guide his future scientific career. For example, his father wrote a [[textbook]] on the German language for children aged 9–13, entitled ''Hülfsbuch zum Unterrichte in der deutschen Sprache für Kinder von 9 bis 13 Jahren'' (2nd ed., Wismar 1850; 3rd ed., Wismar and Ludwigslust: Hinstorff, 1862), the first section of which dealt with the structure and [[logic]] of [[language]].

Frege studied at a [[gymnasium (school)|''gymnasium'']] in Wismar and graduated in 1869. His teacher Gustav Adolf Leo Sachse (5 November 1843 – 1 September 1909), who was a poet, played the most important role in determining Frege's future scientific career, encouraging him to continue his studies at the [[University of Jena]].

=== Studies at University: Jena and Göttingen (1869–74) ===
Frege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the [[North German Confederation]]. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was [[Ernst Karl Abbe]] (1840–1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence.

His other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806–86; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of [[plane (geometry)|planes]], analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); [[Hermann Schaeffer|Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer]] (1824–1900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other [[electronics|electronic machines]]); and the philosopher [[Kuno Fischer]] (1824–1907; Kantian and critical philosophy).

Starting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Göttingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of [[Alfred Clebsch|Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch]] (1833–72; analytical geometry), [[Ernst Christian Julius Schering]] (1824–97; function theory), [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] (1804–91; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845–1915; theory of electricity), and [[Hermann Lotze]] (1817–81; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures.

In 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of "Ueber&lt;!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--&gt; eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginären Gebilde in der Ebene" ("On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points.

Frege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 – 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.

== Work as a logician ==
{{Main|Begriffsschrift}}
Though his education and early mathematical work focused primarily on geometry, Frege's work soon turned to logic. His {{Citation | title = [[Begriffsschrift]], eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens | place = Halle a/S | publisher = Verlag von Louis Nebert | year = 1879 |trans-title=Concept-Script: A Formal Language for Pure Thought Modeled on that of Arithmetic}} marked a turning point in the history of logic. The ''Begriffsschrift'' broke new ground, including a rigorous treatment of the ideas of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. Frege's goal was to show that mathematics grows out of [[logic]], and in so doing, he devised techniques that took him far beyond the Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic propositional logic that had come down to him in the logical tradition.

[[File:Begriffsschrift Titel.png|right|thumb|250px|Title page to ''Begriffsschrift'' (1879)]] In effect, Frege invented [[axiomatization|axiomatic]] [[predicate logic]], in large part thanks to his invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]], which eventually became ubiquitous in [[mathematics]] and logic, and which solved the [[problem of multiple generality]]. Previous logic had dealt with the [[logical constant]]s ''and'', ''or'', ''if... then...'', ''not'', and ''some'' and ''all'', but iterations of these operations, especially "some" and "all", were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like "every boy loves some girl" and "some girl is loved by every boy" could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege's formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of "every boy loves some girl who loves some boy who loves some girl" and similar sentences, in complete parallel with his treatment of, say, "every boy is foolish".

A frequently noted example is that Aristotle's logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like [[Euclid's theorem]], a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of [[prime number]]s. Frege's "conceptual notation" however can represent such inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Horsten, Leon and Pettigrew, Richard, "Introduction" in ''The Continuum Companion to Philosophical Logic'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (3 vols., 1910–13) (by [[Bertrand Russell]], 1872–1970, and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], 1861–1947), to Russell's [[theory of descriptions]], to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s (1906–78) [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorems]], and to [[Alfred Tarski]]'s (1901–83) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.

One of Frege's stated purposes was to isolate genuinely logical principles of inference, so that in the proper representation of mathematical proof, one would at no point appeal to "intuition". If there was an intuitive element, it was to be isolated and represented separately as an axiom: from there on, the proof was to be purely logical and without gaps. Having exhibited this possibility, Frege's larger purpose was to defend the view that [[arithmetic]] is a branch of logic, a view known as [[logicism]]: unlike geometry, arithmetic was to be shown to have no basis in "intuition", and no need for non-logical axioms. Already in the 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' important preliminary theorems, for example a generalized form of [[law of trichotomy]], were derived within what Frege understood to be pure logic.

This idea was formulated in non-symbolic terms in his ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884). Later, in his ''Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903; vol. 2 was published at his own expense), Frege attempted to derive, by use of his symbolism, all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical. Most of these axioms were carried over from his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', though not without some significant changes. The one truly new principle was one he called the {{nowrap|[[Basic Law V]]}}: the "value-range" of the function ''f''(''x'') is the same as the "value-range" of the function ''g''(''x'') if and only if ∀''x''[''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')].

The crucial case of the law may be formulated in modern notation as follows. Let {''x''|''Fx''} denote the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of the [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] ''Fx'', i.e., the set of all Fs, and similarly for ''Gx''. Then Basic Law V says that the predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gx'' have the same extension [[iff]] ∀x[''Fx'' ↔ ''Gx'']. The set of Fs is the same as the set of Gs just in case every F is a G and every G is an F. (The case is special because what is here being called the extension of a predicate, or a set, is only one type of "value-range" of a function.)

In a famous episode, Bertrand Russell wrote to Frege, just as Vol. 2 of the ''Grundgesetze'' was about to go to press in 1903, showing that [[Russell's paradox]] could be derived from Frege's Basic Law V. It is easy to define the relation of ''membership'' of a set or extension in Frege's system; Russell then drew attention to "the set of things ''x'' that are such that ''x'' is not a member of ''x''". The system of the ''Grundgesetze'' entails that the set thus characterised ''both'' is ''and'' is not a member of itself, and is thus inconsistent. Frege wrote a hasty, last-minute Appendix to Vol. 2, deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying Basic Law V. Frege opened the Appendix with the exceptionally honest comment: "Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion." (This letter and Frege's reply are translated in [[Jean van Heijenoort]] 1967.)

Frege's proposed remedy was subsequently shown to imply that there is but one object in the [[universe of discourse]], and hence is worthless (indeed, this would make for a contradiction in Frege's system if he had axiomatized the idea, fundamental to his discussion, that the True and the False are distinct objects; see, for example, [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] 1973), but recent work has shown that much of the program of the ''Grundgesetze'' might be salvaged in other ways:
* Basic Law V can be weakened in other ways. The best-known way is due to philosopher and mathematical logician [[George Boolos]] (1940–1996), who was an expert on the work of Frege. A "concept" ''F'' is "small" if the objects falling under ''F'' cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the universe of discourse, that is, unless: ∃''R''[''R'' is 1-to-1 &amp; ∀''x''∃''y''(''xRy'' &amp; ''Fy'')]. Now weaken V to V*: a "concept" ''F'' and a "concept" ''G'' have the same "extension" if and only if neither ''F'' nor ''G'' is small or ∀''x''(''Fx'' ↔ ''Gx''). V* is consistent if [[second-order arithmetic]] is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic.
* Basic Law V can simply be replaced with [[Hume's principle]], which says that the number of ''F''s is the same as the number of ''G''s if and only if the ''F''s can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the ''G''s. This principle, too, is consistent if second-order arithmetic is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic. This result is termed [[Frege's theorem]] because it was noticed that in developing arithmetic, Frege's use of Basic Law V is restricted to a proof of Hume's principle; it is from this, in turn, that arithmetical principles are derived. On Hume's principle and Frege's theorem, see "Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-logic/ Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] at plato.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
* Frege's logic, now known as [[second-order logic]], can be weakened to so-called [[Impredicativity|predicative]] second-order logic. Predicative second-order logic plus Basic Law V is provably consistent by [[finitism|finitistic]] or [[Mathematical constructivism|constructive]] methods, but it can interpret only very weak fragments of arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burgess, John|title=Fixing Frege|year=2005|isbn=0-691-12231-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's work in logic had little international attention until 1903 when Russell wrote an appendix to ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' stating his differences with Frege. The diagrammatic notation
that Frege used had no antecedents (and has had no imitators since). Moreover, until Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (3 vols.) appeared in 1910–13, the dominant approach to [[mathematical logic]] was still that of [[George Boole]] (1815–64) and his intellectual descendants, especially [[Ernst Schröder]] (1841–1902). Frege's logical ideas nevertheless spread through the writings of his student [[Rudolf Carnap]] (1891–1970) and other admirers, particularly Bertrand Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889–1951).

== Philosopher ==
Frege is one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]], whose work on logic and language gave rise to the [[linguistic turn]] in philosophy. His contributions to the [[philosophy of language]] include:
* [[Function (mathematics)|Function]]–argument analysis of the [[proposition]];
* Distinction between [[concept and object]] (''Begriff und Gegenstand'');
* Principle of [[compositionality]];
* [[Context principle]];
* Distinction between the [[sense and reference]] (''Sinn und Bedeutung'') of names and other expressions, sometimes said to involve a [[mediated reference theory]].

As a philosopher of mathematics, Frege attacked the [[psychologism|psychologistic]] appeal to mental explanations of the content of judgment of the meaning of sentences. His original purpose was very far from answering general questions about meaning; instead, he devised his logic to explore the foundations of arithmetic, undertaking to answer questions such as "What is a number?" or "What objects do number-words ("one", "two", etc.) refer to?" But in pursuing these matters, he eventually found himself analysing and explaining what meaning is, and thus came to several conclusions that proved highly consequential for the subsequent course of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language.

It should be kept in mind that Frege was employed as a mathematician, not a philosopher, and he published his philosophical papers in scholarly journals that often were hard to access outside of the German-speaking world. He never published a philosophical monograph other than ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', much of which was mathematical in content, and the first collections of his writings appeared only after World War II. A volume of English translations of Frege's philosophical essays first appeared in 1952, edited by students of Wittgenstein, [[Peter Geach]] (1916-2013) and [[Max Black]] (1909–88), with the bibliographic assistance of Wittgenstein (see Geach, ed. 1975, Introduction). Despite the generous praise of Russell and Wittgenstein, Frege was little known as a philosopher during his lifetime. His ideas spread chiefly through those he influenced, such as Russell, Wittgenstein, and Carnap, and through work on logic and semantics by Polish logicians.

== Sense and reference ==
{{Main|Sense and reference}}
Frege's 1892 paper, "On Sense and Reference" ("Über Sinn und Bedeutung"), introduced his influential distinction between ''sense'' ("Sinn") and ''reference'' ("Bedeutung", which has also been translated as "meaning", or "denotation"). While conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature (reference), Frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance: their sense and their reference.

''Reference'', (or, "Bedeutung") applied to [[proper names]], where a given expression (say the expression "Tom") simply refers to the entity bearing the name (the person named Tom). Frege also held that propositions had a referential relationship with their truth-value (in other words, a statement "refers" to the truth-value it takes). By contrast, the ''sense'' (or "Sinn") associated with a complete sentence is the thought it expresses. The sense of an expression is said to be the "mode of presentation" of the item referred to, and there can be multiple modes of representation for the same referent.

The distinction can be illustrated thus: In their ordinary uses, the name "Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor", which for logical purposes is an unanalyzable whole, and the functional expression "the Prince of Wales", which contains the significant parts "the prince of ξ" and "Wales", have the same ''reference'', namely, the person best known as Prince Charles. But the ''sense'' of the word "Wales" is a part of the sense of the latter expression, but no part of the sense of the "full name" of Prince Charles.

These distinctions were disputed by Bertrand Russell, especially in his paper "[[On Denoting]]"; the controversy has continued into the present, fueled especially by [[Saul Kripke]]'s famous lectures "[[Naming and Necessity]]".

== 1924 diary ==
Frege's published philosophical writings were of a very technical nature and divorced from practical issues, so much so that Frege scholar [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] expresses his "shock to discover, while reading Frege's diary, that his hero was an anti-Semite."&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, Reuben, ''What Is Mathematics, Really?'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] his political opinions became more radical. In the last year of his life, at the age of 76, his diary contains extreme [[right-wing]] political opinions, opposing the parliamentary system, democrats, liberals, Catholics, the French and Jews, who he thought ought to be deprived of political rights and, preferably, expelled from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dummett: ''Frege: Philosophy of Language'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frege confided "that he had once thought of himself as a liberal and was an admirer of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]", but then sympathized with General [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Some interpretations have been written about that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Sluga]]: ''Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany'', pp. 99ff. Sluga's source was an article by Eckart Menzler-Trott: "Ich wünsch die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit: Das politische Testament des deutschen Mathematikers und Logikers Gottlob Frege". In: ''Forum'', vol. 36, no. 432, 20 December 1989, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diary contains a critique of [[universal suffrage]] and socialism. Frege had friendly relations with Jews in real life: among his students was [[Gershom Scholem]] who much valued his teacher;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Frege.html|title=Frege biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/frege.htm|title=Frege, Gottlob – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he encouraged [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to leave for England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/philo/files/2011/01/Frege-WittCorrespondence.pdf Juliet Floyd, The Frege-Wittgenstein Correspondence: Interpretive Themes]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1924 diary was published posthumously in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Gabriel, Wolfgang Kienzler (editors): "Gottlob Freges politisches Tagebuch". In: ''Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie'', vol. 42, 1994, pp. 1057–98. Introduction by the editors on pp. 1057–66. This article has been translated into English, in: ''Inquiry'', vol. 39, 1996, pp. 303–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Frege apparently never spoke in public about his political viewpoints.

== Personality ==
Frege was described by his students as a highly introverted person, seldom entering into dialogue, mostly facing the blackboard while lecturing though being witty and sometimes bitterly sarcastic.&lt;ref&gt;''Frege's Lectures on Logic'', ed. by Erich H. Reck and [[Steve Awodey]], Open Court Publishing, 2004, pp. 18–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a comparative approach to the study of all aspects of human [[organizations]] and does so by relying heavily on [[case studies]].

Borrowing from [[Charles Tilly]], historical institutionalism is a method apt for measuring "big structures, large processes, and [making] huge comparisons".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. (1984). "Big structures, Large Processes, and Huge Comparisons".&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical institutionalism has generated some of the most important books in the fields of sociology, political science and economics. In fact, some of these studies have inspired policy and its scholars have received numerous awards. Although historical institutionalism proper is fairly new (ca. 1979), it identifies with the great traditions in history, philosophy, politics, sociology and economics.

==Old and new institutionalism==
[[Institutions]] have been always central to [[social science]] but they have not been addressed with the same emphasis and manner in every approach. Before and after the turn of the twentieth century, several scholars were writing about institutions, but they had not developed a theory of institutions yet. Most of these approaches relied heavily on the study of formal institutions (i.e. the law) (see [[hermeneutics]]). Moreover, they were highly [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and, thus, prescriptive (i.e. Weber prescribed the professionalization of bureaucracy in order to have a modern state). This is often called "old institutionalism".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the 1950s, [[structural-functionalism]] blurred the study of institutions. They were more concerned about the variability of the [[modernization]] process across countries and about prescribing and generalizing at the systemic level rather than acknowledging the different paths that [[Development studies|development]] can take. (i.e. [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], ''The Civic Culture'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The new institutionalism begins with the works of [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], ''Political Order in Changing Societies''; [[Barrington Moore]]'s, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'', and more specifically [[Theda Skocpol]]'s, ''States and Social Revolutions''. These books spawned the new [[research program]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

As stated above, before HI arrived, institutions were only treated as the formal rules of behavior (i.e. the law). In contrast, historical institutionalism has loosened the definition of institutions. In this new approach, institutions can take the shape of a formal bureaucratic structure but also an ideology or an informal custom. The significance of this change of approach is that historical institutionalism denies that power and history have only one source as past approaches (i.e. the state) and has given agency to all kinds of social groups and behaviors (e.g. in ''[[Weapons of the Weak]]'', [[James C. Scott|James Scott]] acknowledges the power of "gossip" in political life.) In emphasizing the participation of all kind of groups, not just elites or the state, historical institutionalism offers a dynamic approach to history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Moreover, HI avoids prescription. On the contrary, since historical institutionalism is interested in the richness and different paths that a [[revolution]] or an [[economic reform]] can take given that different groups participate in each case, they are sensitive to the differences that can occur when following a particular political design (i.e. democracy). In that sense, it also avoids the teleological determinism of past approaches. For historical institutionalists, actors are both produced by, and are producers of, history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==The treatment of history==
Unlike most western scholars who preceded them, including [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[classical Marxism|classical Marxists]], [[empiricism|empiricists]], [[dialectic]]al thinkers and [[positivism|positivists]], historical institutionalists do not accept that history necessarily develops in a straightforward, linear fashion. Instead, they examine the conditions under which a particular trajectory was followed and not others, a phenomenon that [[Gabriel Almond]] refers to as the "historical cure".&lt;ref&gt;Almond, Gabriel. (1956). "Comparative Political Systems." ''Journal of Politics'', 18, pp. 391-409&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, specifying why particular paths were ''not'' taken is as important as specifying the actual trajectory of history.

As opposed to the old institutionalists, they postulate that history will not necessarily lead to a "happy" outcome (i.e. "[[fascism]] or [[democracy]] as the end of history").

The most basic concept with which historical institutionalists work is the concept of [[path dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Martin, R., 2012. (Re) Placing path dependence: a response to the debate. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.179-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Theda Skocpol and Paul Pierson write that [[path dependence]] does not have yet a clear definition, but can express the idea that "outcomes at a 'critical juncture' trigger feedback mechanisms [negative or positive] that reinforce the recurrence of a particular pattern into the future". In their view, the significance of path dependence is that:

: "once actors have ventured far down a particular path, they are likely to find it very difficult to reverse course…The "path not taken" or the political alternatives that were once quite plausible may become irretrievably lost. 'Path dependence analysis' highlights the role of what [[Arthur Stinchcombe]] has termed 'historical causation' in which dynamics triggered by an event or process at one point in time reproduce themselves, even in the absence of the recurrence of the original event or process".&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul &amp; Skocpol, Theda. 2002. "Historical Institutionalism in Contemporary Political Science", in Ira Katznelson &amp; Helen V. Milner (eds). Political Science: State of the Discipline. New York: W.W. Norton: 693-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related crux of historical institutionalism is that temporal sequences matter: outcomes depend upon the timing of [[exogenous]] factors (such as inter-state competition or economic crisis) in relation to particular institutional configurations (such as the level of [[bureaucratic]] professionalism or degree of state autonomy from class forces).&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Theda Skocpol]] suggests that the [[democracy|democratic]] outcome of the [[English Civil War]] was a result of the fact that the comparatively weak English [[The Crown|Crown]] lacked the [[military]] capacity to fight the landed upper-class. In contrast, the rise of rapid [[industrialization]] and [[fascism]] in [[Prussia]] when faced with international security threats was because the Prussian state was a "highly bureaucratic and centralized agrarian state" composed by "men closely ties to landed [[notables]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skocpol, Theda. (1973). A Critical Review of Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy. "Politics and Society", 4(1), pp. 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Ertman]], in his account of state building in [[medieval]] and early modern [[Europe]], argues that variations in the type of [[regime]] built in Europe during this period can be traced to one macro-international factor and two historical institutional factors. At the macro-structural level, the "timing of the onset of sustained geopolitical competition" created an atmosphere of insecurity that appeared best addressed by consolidating state power. The timing of the onset of competition is critical for Ertman's explanation. States that faced competitive pressures early had to consolidate through [[patrimonial structures]], since the development of modern bureaucratic techniques had not yet arrived. States faced with competitive pressures later could on the other hand, could take advantage of advancements in training and knowledge to promote a more technical oriented [[civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;Ertman, Thomas. (1997). "Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Richard. (2002, October). "In Debate: The Casual Focus of Historical Institutionalism". Paper presented at Temple University course seminar on Authoritarian Regimes, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Historical institutionalism is not a unified intellectual enterprise (see also [[new institutionalism]]). Some scholars are oriented towards treating history as the outcome of rational and purposeful behavior based on the idea of equilibrium (see [[rational choice]]). They rely heavily on quantitative approaches. Others, more qualitative oriented scholars, reject the idea of rationality and instead emphasize the idea that randomness and accidents matter in political and social outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;S. Steinmo, K. Thelen, and F. Longstreth, eds., Structuring Politics: Historical Institutionalism in Comparative Analysis, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; There are unsolvable [[epistemological]] differences between both approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert et al. Analytic Narratives, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However given the historicity of both approaches, and given their focus on institutions, both can fall under "historical institutionalism".
* It could be said that path dependence claims causality because every juncture must be considered causal to further developments. (i.e. Z couldn't occur without W, X and Y) In that sense, it is more deterministic than statistical analysis because the latter acknowledge only probabilistic relations among variables. "Correlation is not causation".
* Path dependence, in the economic sense, is also subjective because it involves the judgment of the researcher in determining which historical [[conjunctures]] had an effect on the outcome why others don't (selecting on the dependent variable).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The subjectivity becomes accentuated because one can claim that the smallest historical event can shape the larger outcomes. (For example, if a man got drunk, and the next morning, he was involved in manufacturing 20 rifles that were sent to the same regiment, the rifles would not aim right and the battle would be lost and then the war). Where should we trace the causal thread? How much history is needed?

'''I.A.Recordings''' was founded in 1982 by a small group of volunteers, to record past and present [[industries]] on film and video, as a resource for [[industrial archaeology]] (I.A.).

When possible, they capture the processes and activities of an industry while it is still working; but moving pictures also add an extra dimension to the recording of industrial remains.

All the footage they shoot is kept in a storage archive for posterity}.&lt;ref name="BUFVC"&gt;Ballantyne, James (ed.): "Researchers Guide to British film &amp; television collections", page 142. British Universities Film &amp; Video Council 1993. {{ISBN|0-901299-64-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, they produce edited programmes from some of the material, to make it available to the public on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="IAR_Home"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org], "I.A.Recordings home page" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Their first project in 1982 was to work with the historian W.K.V.Gale to record the famous John Bradley Rolling Mill in the [[English Midlands]], as it was due to close within a week and was the last of its kind in the area.

Since then they have recorded many industries, several of which have since closed.&lt;ref name="BUFVC" /&gt; They have also produced several documentary history programmes, particularly about inland waterways ([[canals]]) and [[mining]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO"&gt;Vernon, R.W. (ed.): "National Association of Mining History Organisations Mining Heritage Guide", page 98. National Association of Mining History Organisations 2006. {{ISBN|0-9517437-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings started in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] but have since recorded sites in Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, [[Poland]], Spain and the United States.&lt;ref name="IAR_AZ"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org/subjidx.html], "I.A.Recordings A-Z Subject Index" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

They have developed their own specialist [[video]] technology such as helmet-mounted cameras for use underground and [[MineCam]], a remote-controlled camera for mine shaft exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, Mike (ed.): "Cave Radio &amp; Electronics Group Journal Number 22", pages 3 - 6. British Cave Research Association 1995. ISSN 1361-4800&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings use [[broadcast]] equipment and techniques and since 2005, [[High Definition Video]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO" /&gt;

By 2008, they had over 38,000 minutes of original footage in the archive, but as they are voluntary they have only had time to edit a relatively small amount for release on DVD.

==Major subjects==
Subjects already available for public viewing include a [[brickworks]] employing hand-moulders, making brass hames for horse harnesses, many [[locksmith]] workshops in [[Willenhall]] recorded for the Lock Museum, making files by hand, a history of the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] made for the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]], a history of the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]], building new canal tunnels in 1984 and 1989, the last run of '[[Tom Pudding]]' compartment boats, a history of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], an underground tour of the ancient Clive Copper Mine, a history of [[Snailbeach]] Lead Mine, many mines in Ireland including Glengowla, Avoca, [[Glendalough]], Glendasan, Glenmalur, Tara, [[Silvermines]], Shalee, [[Allihies]]; [[Bunmahon]] and Tankardstown on the [[Copper Coast]]; and [[Ballycorus Leadmines|Ballycorus]]; [[Drakelow Tunnels]] underground factory, Carrs and other lead and zinc mines in the [[Nenthead]] area, working and disused [[Cornwall|Cornish]] mines including [[South Crofty]], [[Geevor]], Cligga Head, Rosevale, Taylor's &amp; Michell's shafts near [[Redruth]], Tolgus Tin Company, [[Wheal Jane]] and Kennall Vale Gunpowder Works; mines around [[Llangollen]], [[Pontneddfechan]] Gunpowder Works, carrying pottery on the [[Caldon Canal]], [[Donisthorpe]] Colliery, Alan Paine Knitwear, [[Bagworth]] Colliery, Helsington [[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] Mill, a [[steam-powered]] [[dredger]], dry barrel [[coopering]], Morse's Level coal mine, [[Charlecote]] water-powered [[flour mill]], stone [[quarrying]] and cutting in the [[Forest of Dean]], carrying newsprint and sewage effluent by canal, rescuing an ancient Severn [[trow]] sailing barge and then sailing it after restoration, the abandoned [[Wren's Nest]] limestone mines, a tanker carrying diesel on the [[River Humber]] and [[Aire and Calder navigation]], compartment boats taking coal to [[Ferrybridge power station]], an oak bark [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] works, large [[dragline]] excavators mining [[open pit]] coal, [[Annesley]]-Bentinck colliery, mines around [[Linares, Jaén|Linares, Spain]], and ancient mines in the [[Harz]] mountains of Germany.

The '''International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES)''' is an annual conference in the field of [[operations research]]. Two tracks are held simultaneously, covering domain independent methodologies and technologies and also practical work developed in specific application areas. These tracks are present in the conference not only in technical sessions but also in [[poster session]]s, [[keynote]] lectures and [[tutorials]].

The works presented in the conference are published in the conference [[proceedings]] and are made available at the SCITEPRESS [[digital library]]. Usually, it's established a cooperation with [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] for a post-publication with some of the conference  best papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pinson|first1=Eric|last2=Valente|first2=Fernando|last3=Vitoriano|first3=Begoña|title=Operations Research and Enterprise Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTY3CwAAQBAJ|publisher=Springer|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Werra|first1=Dominique|last2=Parlier|first2=Greg H.|last3=Vitoriano|first3=Begoña|title=Operations Research and Enterprise Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTY3CwAAQBAJ|publisher=Springer|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first edition of ICORES was held in 2012 in conjunction with the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence ([[ICAART]]) and the International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods ([[ICPRAM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87488">'''Italian Renaissance painting''' is the painting of the period beginning in the late 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political states, some independent but others controlled by external powers. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Antonello da Messina who travelled from Sicily to Venice via Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] is renowned as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]], and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and [[Renaissance architecture]].

Italian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the [[High Renaissance]] (1495–1520), and [[Mannerism]] (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods.  

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter [[Giotto]] and includes [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Orcagna]] and [[Altichiero]].
The Early Renaissance style was started by [[Masaccio]] and then further developed by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Verrocchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].  The High Renaissance period was that of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Coreggio]], [[Giorgione]], the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]].  The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of [[Michelangelo]], as well as [[Pontormo]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bronzino]] and [[Tintoretto]].

The influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.

===Philosophy===
A number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology.  The resulting interest in [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Paolo Uccello]].

===Science and technology===
Simultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] and Islamic scholars.
The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of [[oil paint]] and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.

===Society===
The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential inlaw [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in [[fresco]] of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the life of a saint, particularly [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. There were also many [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings on the theme of [[Salvation]] and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned [[altarpiece]]s, which were painted in [[tempera]] on [[panel painting|panel]] and later in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]]. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the ''Madonna and Child''.

Throughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', and religious, such as [[Simone Martini]]'s fresco of the ''[[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maestà]]'', in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]].

Portraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by [[Simone Martini]], 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, [[John Hawkwood]] by [[Uccello]] in [[Florence Cathedral]] and its companion portraying [[Niccolò da Tolentino]] by [[Andrea del Castagno]].

During the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and [[Medici]] families in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s cycle in the [[Sassetti Chapel]]. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]] and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as [[Bronzino]].

With the growth of [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanism]], artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]] ''for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]]''.

Other motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]'' that [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] painted for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family at [[Mantua]]. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as ''the Concert'' by [[Lorenzo Costa]] of about 1490.

Important events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's ''[[Battle of San Romano]]'', as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature.  The writings of [[Dante]], Voragine's ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and [[Boccaccio]]'s Decameron were important sources of themes.

In all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Christiansen, ''Italian Painting'', (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours are rich and luminous, the figures are elongated and stylised.]]

===Traditions of 13th-century Tuscan painting===
The art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, [[Cimabue]] of [[Florence]] and [[Duccio]] of [[Siena]]. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, [[Guido of Siena]], [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]] and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting.&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Duccio'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In these [[tempera]] paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, [[Pietro Cavallini]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===Giotto===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

Joseph of Arimethea holds the shroud. In Heaven, small angels are shrieking and tearing their hair.]]
[[Giotto]], (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', (1568)&lt;/ref&gt; Giotto, possibly influenced by [[Pietro Cavallini]] and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of [[fresco]]es of ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of the Virgin'' that he painted in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] set a new standard for narrative pictures. His ''Ognissanti Madonna'' hangs in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's ''Santa Trinita Madonna'' and Duccio's ''Ruccellai Madonna'' where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.&lt;ref&gt;All three are reproduced and compared at [[Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Eimerl&gt;Sarel Eimerl, The World of Giotto, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taddeo Gaddi Shepherds.jpg|thumb|left|Taddeo Gaddi: ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' (detail), Santa Croce|alt= Fresco painted in grey, yellow and black. A blaze of yellow light comes from the upper right from an angel not visible in this detail. A startled shepherd lying on the ground is twisting around to see the angel. The light from the angel touches the mountainside, figures and sheep.]]

===Giotto's contemporaries===
Giotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him,  or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' in the [[Baroncelli Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

The paintings in the ''Upper Church'' of the [[Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi]], are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding [[Pietro Cavallini]].&lt;ref name=Eimerl/&gt; A late painting by [[Cimabue]] in the ''Lower Church'' at Assisi, of the ''Madonna and St. Francis'', also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.

===Mortality and redemption===
[[File:Orcagna Triumph of Death detail 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Orcagna]]: ''The Triumph of Death'' (detail), c.&amp;nbsp;1350, Museum of Santa Croce|alt= A small section of a badly damaged fresco showing people who are doomed to Hell. While horrible demons are clutching at them, the humans are intent on pursuing their evil ways of murder and seduction, seeming ignorant of their precarious state on the edge of a pit.]]
A common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the ''[[Last Judgement]]'', which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's [[Scrovegni Chapel]], is painted on the inner west wall. The [[Black Death]] of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of [[Hell]].

These include the ''Triumph of Death'' by Giotto's pupil [[Orcagna]], now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the ''Triumph of Death'' in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]] by an unknown painter, perhaps [[Francesco Traini]] or [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

Two important fresco painters were active in [[Padua]] in the late 14th century, [[Altichiero]] and [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]]. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]]'s Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare [[Apocalypse]] cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of [[Altichiero]]'s ''Crucifixion'' at the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]], also in [[Padua]]. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. Giovanni Foffani, ''Frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi'', (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Simone Martini 077.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.50|[[Simone Martini]]: ''The Annunciation'', 1333, Uffizi, is International Gothic in style.|alt= An altarpiece with a golden background and a frame surmounted by five richly carved Gothic pediments.

The figures are elongated, stylised and marked by elegance. There are saints in the side panels.]]

In Florence, at the ''Spanish Chapel'' of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], Andrea Bonaiuti&lt;!---don't link because it goes to the wrong page.---&gt; was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the [[Dominican Order]] in particular. His fresco ''Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church'' is remarkable for its depiction of [[Florence Cathedral]], complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===International Gothic===
During the later 14th century, [[International Gothic]] was the style that dominated Tuscan painting.  It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

In the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his [[convent]] of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of [[Giotto]]. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of [[Jesus]], many of them being scenes of ''[[the Crucifixion]]''. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florence===
The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistry of St. John]], the oldest remaining church in the city.  The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing ''the Sacrifice of Isaac''.

Two of the panels from the competition have survived, those by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M&gt;R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of [[Baptistry doors]] took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of [[linear perspective]], the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art.

===Masaccio - Brancacci Chapel===
{{main|Brancacci Chapel}}

The first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of ''the Life of St. Peter'' in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.

More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the [[Brancacci Chapel]], his ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|Tribute Money]]'' fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work.  As well, the figures of ''[[Adam and Eve]] being expelled from Eden'', painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of ''Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit''. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The ''Tribute Money'' was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=OC&gt;Ornella Casazza, ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of linear perspective===
[[File:Paolo Uccello 043.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|Paolo Uccello: ''The Presentation of the Virgin'' shows his experiments with perspective and light.|alt=Fresco. A scene in muted colours showing the porch of a temple, with a steep flight of steps. The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest.]]
During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of [[linear perspective]] was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside [[Florence Cathedral]] and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous [[trompe l'oeil]] niche around the ''Holy Trinity'' he painted at [[Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

According to Vasari, [[Paolo Uccello]] was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three [[Battle of San Romano]] paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.

In the 1450s [[Piero della Francesca]], in paintings such as ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]'', demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as  by [[Perugino]] in his ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]'' (1481-82) in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

The ruler sits to the left on a throne. The building is Ancient Roman in style. To the right, two richly dressed men and a barefooted youth stand in a courtyard, much closer to the viewer, so appearing larger.]]

===Understanding of light===
[[Giotto]] used tonality to create form. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. [[Paolo Uccello]], a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in ''terra verde'' or "green earth", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of [[John Hawkwood]] on the wall of [[Florence Cathedral]]. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Annarita Paolieri, ''Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piero della Francesca]] carried his study of light further. In the ''Flagellation'' he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], revered by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the large Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] were named in her honour.

The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by [[Bernardo Daddi]], set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by [[Orcagna]]. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as [[Orsanmichele]].

Depictions of the [[Madonna and Child]] were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]] and [[Masaccio]].

In the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. [[Luca della Robbia]], famous for his ''cantoria gallery'' at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly [[Andrea della Robbia]], was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as [[Jesus]], and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.

Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Verrocchio]] and [[Davide Ghirlandaio]]. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the [[Medici]]; [[Perugino]], whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and  [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' have survived. Even [[Michelangelo]] who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', while for [[Raphael]], they are among his most popular and numerous works.

===Andrea Mantegna in Padua and Mantua===
One of the most influential painters of northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]] of [[Padua]], who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor [[Donatello]] was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero [[Erasmo da Narni|Gattemelata]], still visible on its plinth in the square outside the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]]. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.

At only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the ''Lives of Saints James and Christopher'' for the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the transept of the[[church of the Eremitani]], near the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Diana Davies, Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental  [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno altarpiece]], created for the abbot of the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], [[Verona]] from 1457 to 1459.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt; This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy&lt;ref name=EL&gt;Elena Lanzanova, trans. Giorgina Arcuri, ''[http://www.arcadja.com/artmagazine/en/2008/06/23/restoration-of-mantegna’s-san-zeno-altarpiece-in-florence/ Restoration Of Mantegna’S San Zeno Altarpiece In Florence]'', Arcadja, (2008-06-23), (accessed: 2012-07-13)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474–1555 Verona), edit: 2000–2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the [[Camera degli Sposi]] for the [[Gonzaga family]] in [[Mantua]], dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a [[trompe l'oeil]] view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;  Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.

===Antonello da Messina===
In 1442 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] became [[Kingdom of Naples|ruler of Naples]], bringing with him a collection of [[Flemish painting]]s and setting up a [[Humanism|Humanist Academy]]. [[Antonello da Messina]] seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, [[Petrus Christus]], in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; Antonello went to [[Venice]] in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 563; Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Antonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Antonello da Messina)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'', demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited [[Piero della Francesca]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

==Progression Towards the High Renaissance==

===Patronage and Humanism===

In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.

In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established [[Marsilio Ficino]] as his resident [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosopher, and facilitated his translation of [[Plato]] and his teaching of [[Platonic philosophy]], which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or "platonic" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson, ''Lorenzo the Magnificent'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval]] period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of [[Classical mythology]] began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new [[Eve]], symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the [[Virgin Mary]] herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Primavera'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the [[Sassetti Chapel]] at Santa Trinita and the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. In these cycles of the ''Life of St Francis'' and the ''Life of the Virgin Mary'' and ''Life of John the Baptist'' there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, [[Agnolo Poliziano]]. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

===Flemish influence===
From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of [[oil paint]]. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.

In 1483 the huge altarpiece of ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|the Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' painted by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a [[still life]] of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Papal commission===

The scene is like Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, above, which is based on it. There is a similar townscape and circular building in perspective, with an ancient Roman triumphal arch to either side. In the foreground, Jesus gives the keys of Heaven to St Peter, who is kneeling. To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them.]]In 1477 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] replaced the derelict old chapel at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.

In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. This fresco cycle was to depict ''Stories of the Life of Moses'' on one side of the chapel, and ''Stories of the Life of Christ'' on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. ''The Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''Finding of Moses'' were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an [[altarpiece]] of the ''Assumption of the Virgin''  between them. These  paintings, all by Perugino, were later  destroyed to paint Michelangelo's ''Last Judgement''.[[File:Ghirlandaio,_Domenico_-_Calling_of_the_Apostles_-_1481.jpg|thumb|380px|Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop:''[[Vocation of the Apostles]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]]|alt=Rectangular fresco]]
The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. 
The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged [[Pharaoh]]s and the devil himself. Each painting required a [[landscape]]. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in [[Botticelli]]'s scene of ''The Purification of the Leper'', there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case ''[[The Temptation of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|The Temptations of Christ]]''.

[[Perugino]]'s scene of ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Perugino)|Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]''  is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two [[triumphal arch]]es, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian [[baptistry]] or a Roman [[Mausoleum]].&lt;ref name=Giaco&gt;{{cite book|first=Massimo|last= Giacometti|title=The Sistine Chapel|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995.

Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129; Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael,&lt;ref&gt;Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129; Wurdram pg. 147; Johann Joachim Winklemann, ''Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525&lt;ref&gt;Kugler; Honour and Flemming, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Lanzi.&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the [[Last Supper|''Last Supper'']], started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture'', 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.  The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.

===Leonardo da Vinci===
[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the [[Florence]] workshop of [[Verrocchio]] before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence.  Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.

The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism.]]
Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed [[cadaver]]s from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.

Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's ''Adam and Eve''. Leonardo's ''Last Supper'', painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium.  Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of ''the Last Supper'', but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.

More than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of "atmosphere". In his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c.1503-1517) and ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's "sfumato" or "smoke".  He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents.  Another significant work of Leonardo's was ''[[The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonardo da Vinci" in ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.&lt;ref&gt; name=Vasari/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Michelangelo: ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life.]]
In 1508 [[Pope Julius II]] succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor [[Michelangelo]] (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.

The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt; It is the [[twelve apostles]], and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme  went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.&lt;ref name=TLT&gt;T.L.Taylor, ''The Vision of Michelangelo'', Sydney University, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficially, the ceiling is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], of such beauty that according to the biographer [[Vasari]], it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of [[platonic love]]. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.&lt;ref name=TLT/&gt;

Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. [[Raphael]], who was given a preview by [[Bramante]] after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], his portrait of Michelangelo himself in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard König, ''Michelangelo'', (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldschieder, ''Michelangelo'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

===Raphael===
With [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]]'s (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.

Raphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the [[Umbria]]n workshop of [[Perugino]], an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the ''Betrothal of the Virgin'', which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's ''Christ giving the Keys to Peter''.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

Raphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which ''the [[School of Athens]]'' (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.

This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of [[Plato]], whom Raphael has famously modelled upon [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The brooding figure of [[Heraclitus]] who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]], and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources identify this figure as [[Il Sodoma]], but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being ''La Belle Jardinière'' ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the [[Louvre]]. His larger work, the ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'', used as a design for countless [[stained glass]] windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, ''Raphael, the Life and Legacy'', (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cuzin, ''Raphael, his Life and Works'', (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giovanni Bellini=== 
[[File:Giovanni bellini, madonna di brera, 1510, 01 adjusted.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Giovanni Bellini: ''[[Madonna and Child (Bellini, Milan, 1510)|The Brera Madonna]]'']]
[[File:Pala di San Zaccaria (Venezia).jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Giovanni Bellini]], ''The [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]''|alt= Oil painting. A large altarpiece in which the Madonna sits on a raised throne, with four saints and an angel as described in the article.]] A leader of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] of painting, [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]], his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Antonello da Messina]], but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter.  He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 120; Ruanch pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 655; Wundram pg. 120; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; He was first the teacher of [[Giorgione]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi ''One Thousand Years of Painting'', Electa, Milan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as ''[[Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan]]'' (1501),&lt;ref&gt; Wundrum Pag. 147 and Pg.121; Hartt, Pg. 645&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Baptism of Christ (Bellini)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1500–1502). Bellini, like [[Raphael]], also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. 

Traditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the ''Madonna and Child'', the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. [[Piero della Francesca]] used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as [[Masaccio]] had used it as the setting for his ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. 

Bellini used this same form, known as ''Sacred Conversations'', in several of his later altarpieces [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece|such as that]] for the Venetian church of [[San Zaccaria]] (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of [[loggia]] opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a [[viola]] making them brighter than [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Jerome|Saint Jerome]] in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|title=Giovanni Bellini|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgione===

Despite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35)&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt; and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5),&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 645; Raunch pg. 388; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. 

One is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism,&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 165; Raunch pg.646; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 145 and pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the ''Tempest'' one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103; Stokstad pg. 682; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388; Hartt pg. 647; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'', illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 648; Luffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents [[Adam and Eve]] in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting attributed to him, ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'', may represent the [[Magi]] planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'', 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titian===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Titian: ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]''|alt= whose dynamic three-tier composition and colour scheme established him as the preeminent painter north of Rome.]]

[[Titian]] (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392; Stokstad pg. 684; Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Wundram pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time;&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(Wundram  pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pesaro Madonna]], 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Stokstad 684&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending  structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]], 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg.649&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement;&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 176; Raunch pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt; The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 649; Stokstad pg. 685&lt;/ref&gt;  

Titian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Highly notable are the ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'',1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait.  

As Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 650&lt;/ref&gt; so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correggio===

[[File:Cathedral (Parma) - Assumption by Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Correggio:  ''[[Assumption of the Virgin]]]]

[[Correggio]] (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his [[Vision of St. John on Patmos|''Vision of St. John the Evangelist'']], 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the [[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|''Assumption of the Virgin'']], 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639; Raunch pg. 383; Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion:  the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  

In those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Zuffi pg. 132; Raunch pg.383; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Hartt pg. 638&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt; which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Zuffi pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Janson pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Significant High Renaissance Painters===

[[Andrea del Sarto]] (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'',1517.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 635&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 724&lt;/ref&gt; also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 126; Raunch 398&lt;/ref&gt; While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch 398; Zuffi pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 127; Raunch pg. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Influence of Italian Renaissance painting==
The lives of both [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]] extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Antonello da Messina]] and [[Raphael]]  adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as [[Mannerism]], and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period.

The artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]], although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. [[Rembrandt]]'s knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including [[Poussin]] and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of [[stained glass]] makers extending into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and later ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], to [[el Greco]], [[Carracci family|Carracci]], [[Caravaggio]],  [[Rubens]], [[Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] to both the [[Classical Revival|Classical]] and the [[Romantic art|Romantic]] painters of the 19th century such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the [[Royal Academy]], were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the [[National Gallery, London]], were formed.

'''''Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur''''' was painted by Polish Jewish artist [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] in 1878. It depicts [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] in the midst of the [[Yom Kippur]] service, on one of the holiest days of the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]].

Yom Kippur is the Jewish holiday of repentance, a time for Jews to repent for their sins and reflect on their behaviour in the past and coming year. As Soussloff writes in Jewish Identity in Modern Art History, “Yom Kippur is also the occasion in the Jewish year when the dead are solemnly commemorated (in the service called [[Yizkor]]), and Gottlieb has injected into this picture several prominent self-memorials.” In his book Painting a People, [[Ezra Mendelsohn]] confirms that Gottlieb’s subject in this painting is the Days of Atonement: “Nathan Samuely, who discussed the work with Gottlieb in 1878, does specifically connect it, in his German essay on the artist published in 1885, with Yom Kippur, and informs us that the artist himself had the idea of painting it during the days of repentance preceding this holiday.”

The painting is composed of glazed (semi-transparent) oil paint. Gottlieb used the technique of impasto (wide, three-dimensional brushstrokes), and physically created patterns from the paint. This contributes to the painting's richness and depth.

==Content==
The figures in the painting appear solemn, and some appear to be in anguish, particularly the central figure (the artist himself), leaning his head on his hand. The adult men are wearing [[talith|tallitot]] (ritual garments often referred to in English as prayer shawls) and [[Kippah|kippot]] (head coverings). There is a [[Torah scroll]] in the center of the composition, stained glass windows in the back, and candles on the top left. Women look on from the [[Mechitza|women's balcony]]; it has been suggested that one of the women is a depiction of Laura, the artist's fiancée.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur |url=http://www.tamuseum.org.il/en/collection-work/8224 |website=Tel Aviv Museum of Art |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist Maurycy Gottlieb appears in the painting three different times, depicted in different stages of his life. In one self-portrait he is an adult, in another he is a young child, and in the third self-portrait he is depicted as an adolescent. Ezra Mendelsohn writes, “Maurycy himself stands, in a colorful, exotic-looking [[Tallit|talith]], with head in hand. On the left we have the artist as a small boy, wearing a medallion with his initials written in Hebrew. On the extreme right is a young male figure, perhaps again Maurycy, reading from the prayer book alongside a man who might well be his father. Malinowski assumes that this is the case when he says that the painting presents ‘an account of [the artist's] whole life’.”

It has been suggested that the artist placed his fiancée Laura among the female worshippers, at the right of the column whispering to another woman (perhaps her mother), and to the left of the column, holding a [[Mahzor|prayerbook]] in hand. In the painting, many of the figures are people that are close to Gottlieb or people he knew at the time. As said by the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]], Maurycy Gottlieb created this work of art at the young age of 22 years old; a year later, Gottlieb would pass away. Most of the 20 figures depicted here represent people close to the artist.

==Themes and motifs==
There are many characteristics that create a somber tone within this painting. Author Jonathan Boyarin described motifs present in the image as “sadness, nostalgia, and beautification. There is no religious ecstasy, no intensity of emotion, only a pervasive melancholy.” The holiday of [[Yom Kippur]] is a solemn holiday when it is said that the Book of Life is sealed, and the fates of all those living are decided for the coming year. Certainly this aspect of the occasion would contribute to the sobriety of its depiction.

The somber character of the painting may also reflect the time in which it was painted. During the late 19th century, Jews in what is now [[History of the Jews in Ukraine#Russian Empire and Austrian rule|Ukraine]] were living under the auspices of the Russian Empire, in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Antisemitic discrimination was systemic and everpresent, and [[pogrom]]s and [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|expulsions]] occurred. Living under this regime in a time of deep antisemitic discrimination and political instability may have had a major impact on Gottlieb's work.

However, the painting may also evoke the anguish Gottlieb experienced in his personal life. Gottlieb may have suffered from depression, and in fact referenced his own suicide in the painting. The mantle of the Torah scroll is inscribed with a Hebrew dedication: “... donated in memory of ... R. Moshe [Maurycy’s [[Hebrew name]]] Gottlieb, the righteous of blessed memory.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur |url=http://www.tamuseum.org.il/en/collection-work/8224 |website=Tel Aviv Museum of Art |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the painting's completion, the aforementioned Laura married another man, breaking her engagement with Gottlieb. He became ill and died shortly thereafter; some believe as a result of physical ailment, but others suspect it was death by suicide due to deep depression.

'''Knuckle-walking''' is a form of [[quadrupedal]] walking in which the forelimbs hold the [[finger]]s in a partially flexed posture that allows body weight to press down on the ground through the [[knuckle]]s.  In technical terms, knuckle-walking is locomotion with the manus (Latin for hand) distally flexed on contact with the substratum.

[[Gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s use this style of [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] as do [[anteater]]s and [[platypus]]es.

Anthropologists once thought that the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans engaged in knuckle-walking, and humans evolved upright walking from knuckle-walking: a view thought to be supported by reanalysis of overlooked features on hominid fossils.&lt;ref name=Stokstad2000&gt;{{Cite journal |date=24 March 2000 |author=Stokstad, Erik |title=Hominid ancestors may have knuckle walked |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=287 |pages=2131–2132 |doi = 10.1126/science.287.5461.2131a |issue=5461  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich01"/&gt;

Since then, scientists discovered ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'', a human-like hominid descended from the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. ''Ar. ramidus'' engaged in upright walking, but not knuckle-walking. This leads scientists to conclude that chimpanzees evolved knuckle-walking after they split from humans 6 million years ago, and humans evolved upright walking without knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbons|first1=A.|title=A New Kind of Ancestor: Ardipithecus Unveiled|journal=Science|date=1 October 2009|volume=326|issue=5949|pages=36–40|doi=10.1126/science.326_36|pmid=19797636|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/211155/files/PAL_E4410.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apes==
Chimpanzees and gorillas engage in knuckle-walking.&lt;ref name="Rich01"/&gt; This form of [[hand-walking]] posture allows these tree climbers to use their hands for terrestrial locomotion while retaining long fingers for gripping and climbing. It may also allow small objects to be carried in the fingers while walking on all fours. This is the most common type of movement for gorillas, although they also practice [[bipedalism]].

Their knuckle-walking involves flexing the tips of their fingers and carrying their body weight down on the dorsal surface of their middle [[phalanges]]. The outer fingers are held clear off the ground. The wrist is held in a stable, locked position during the support phase of knuckle-walking by means of strongly ﬂexed [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joints]], and extended [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s. The palm as a result is positioned perpendicular to the ground and in-line with the forearm.&lt;ref name="Rich01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richmond | first1 = BG | last2 = Begun | first2 = DR | last3 = Strait | first3 = DS | title = Origin of human bipedalism: The knuckle-walking hypothesis revisited | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/anthropology/Faculty/Begun/originbip.pdf | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = Suppl 33 | pages = 70–105 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11786992 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10019 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090719065111/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/anthropology/Faculty/Begun/originbip.pdf | archivedate = 19 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.20994 | last1 = Wunderlich | first1 = RE | authorlink2 = William L.

There are differences between knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas: juvenile chimpanzees engage in less knuckle-walking than juvenile gorillas. Another difference is that the hand bones of gorillas lack key features that were once thought to limit the extension of the wrist during knuckle-walking in chimpanzees. For example, the ridges and concavities features of the [[capitate]] and [[hamate]] bones have been interpreted to enhance stability of weight-bearing; on this basis, they have been used to identify knuckle-walking in fossils. These are found in all chimpanzees but in only two out of five gorillas. They are also less prominent when found in gorillas. They are however found in primates that do not knuckle-walk.&lt;ref name="Kivell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kivell T.L. and Schmitt, D.|year=2009|title=Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor.|journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|volume=106|issue=34|pages=14241–6|pmid=19667206|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901280106|pmc=2732797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that chimpanzee knuckle-walking and gorilla knuckle-walking are biomechanically and posturally distinct. Gorillas use a form of knuckle-walking which is "columnar". In this forelimb posture, the hand and wrist joints are aligned in a relatively straight, neutral posture. In contrast, chimpanzees use an extended wrist posture. These differences underlie the different characteristics of their hand bones.&lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;

The difference has been attributed to the greater locomotion of chimpanzees in trees, compared to gorillas. The former frequently engage in both knuckle-walking and palm-walking branches. As a result, to preserve their balance in trees chimpanzees, like other primates in trees, often extended their wrists. This need has produced different wrist bone anatomy and, through this, a different form of knuckle-walking.&lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;

Knuckle-walking has been reported in some [[baboon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330430217 | last1 = Hausfater | first1 = G. | year = 1975 | title = Knuckle walking by a baboon (''Papio cynocephalus'') | url = | journal = Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 303–6 | pmid = 1180360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that fossils attributed to ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'' had specialized wrist morphology that was retained from an earlier knuckle-walking ancestor.&lt;ref name="Rich01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richmond00"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35006045 | last1 = Richmond | first1 = BG | last2 = Strait | first2 = DS. | year = 2000 | title = Evidence that humans evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 404 | issue = 6776| pages = 382–5 | pmid = 10746723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pangolin]]s also sometimes walk on their knuckles. Another possible knuckle-walking [[taxon]] was the extinct [[chalicothere]]s, which looked something like a cross between a [[Equidae|horse]] and a gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tassy P.|year=1978|title=Chalicotherium: le ''cheval-gorille''|journal=La Recherche|volume=87|pages=283–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ground sloth]]s may have also walked on their knuckles.

==Advantages==
Knuckle-walking tends to evolve when the fingers of the forelimb are specialized for tasks other than locomotion on the ground. In the gorilla the fingers are used for the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins the fingers have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past the fingers to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling.&lt;ref name="Fish"/&gt;

It has been argued that knuckle-walking of chimpanzees and gorillas originally started from fist-walking as found in orangutans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuttle | first1 = RH.  | year = 1969 | title = Knuckle-walking and the problem of human origins | url = | journal = Science | volume = 166 | issue = 908| pages = 953–61 | doi = 10.1126/science.166.3908.953 | pmid = 5388380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; African apes most likely diverged from ancestral arboreal apes (similar to orangutans) who were adapted to distribute their weight among tree branches and forest canopies. Adjustments made for terrestrial locomotion early on may have involved fist-walking, later evolving into knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuttle | first1 = RH.  | year = 2005 | title = Knuckle-Walking and the evolution of hominoid hands | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–206 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330260207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of knuckle-walking==
There are competing hypotheses as to how knuckle-walking evolved as a form of locomotion, stemming from comparisons between African apes. High magnitudes of integration would indicate homoplasy of knuckle-walking in gorillas and chimpanzees, in which a trait is shared or similar between two species but is not derived from a common ancestor. However, results show that they are not characterized by such high magnitudes, which does not support independent evolution of knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = S.A. | year = 2010 | title = Morphological integration and the evolution of knuckle-walking | journal = J. Hum. Evol. | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 432–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between gorillas and chimpanzees have been suggested to support a common origin for knuckle-walking, such as manual pressure distribution when practicing this form of locomotion. On the other hand, their behavioral differences have been hypothesized to suggest convergent evolution, or homoplasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis| last1 = Matarazzo | first1 = S.A. | year = 2013 | title = Knuckle-Walking Signal in the Manual Phalanges and Metacarpals of the Great Apes |url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1760&amp;context=open_access_dissertations | type= Ph.D. Dissertation | issue = 755 | pages = vi–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis proposes that African apes came from a bipedal ancestor, as there are no differences in hemoglobin between ''Pan'' and ''Homo'', suggesting that their divergence occurred relatively recently. Examining protein sequence changes suggests that ''Gorilla'' diverged before the clade ''Homo-Pan'', meaning that ancestral bipedalism would require parallel evolution of knuckle-walking in separate chimpanzee and gorilla radiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelstein | first1 = S.J. | year = 1987 | title = An Alternative Paradigm for Hominoid Evolution | journal = Hum. Evol. | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–74 | doi=10.1007/bf02436404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that chimpanzees practice both arboreal and knuckle-walking locomotion implies that knuckle-walking evolved from an arboreal ancestor as a solution for terrestrial travel, while still maintaining competent climbing skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richmond et. al | first1 = B.G. | year = 2001 | title = Origin of Human Bipedalism: The Knuckle-Walking Hypothesis Revisited | journal = Yearbook of Physical Anthropology | volume = 44 | pages = 70–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that not all features associated with knuckle-walking are identical to the beings who practice it, as it suggests possible developmental differences. For example, brachiation and suspension are almost certainly homologous between siamangs and gibbons, yet they differ substantially in the relative growth of their locomotor skeletons. Differences in carpal growth are not necessarily a consequence of their function, as it could be related to differences in body mass, growth, etc.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is important to keep this in mind when examining similarities and differences between African apes themselves, as well as knuckle-walkers and humans, when developing hypotheses on locomotive evolution.

==Human evolution==
One theory of the origins of human bipedality is that it evolved from a terrestrial knuckle-walking ancestor. This theory is opposed to the theory that such bipedalism arose from a more generalized arboreal ape ancestor. The terrestrial knuckle-walking theory argues that early [[hominin]] wrist and hand bones retain morphological evidence of early knuckle-walking.&lt;ref name="Rich01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richmond00"/&gt; The argument is not that they were knuckle-walkers themselves but that it is an example of "phylogenetic 'lag'".&lt;ref name="Rich01"/&gt; "The retention of knuckle-walking morphology in the earliest hominids indicates that bipedalism evolved from an ancestor already adapted for terrestrial locomotion. ... Pre-bipedal locomotion is probably best characterized as a repertoire consisting of terrestrial knuckle-walking, arboreal climbing and occasional suspensory activities, not unlike that observed in chimpanzees today".&lt;ref name="Richmond00"/&gt; See [[Vestigiality]].

It has however been suggested that knuckle-walking evolved independently and separately in Pan and gorillas and so was not present in the human ancestors.&lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dainton | first1 = M | last2 = Macho | first2 = GA | title = Did knuckle walking evolve twice? | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–94 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10068065 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.1998.0265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is supported by the evidence that gorillas and chimpanzees differ in their knuckle-walking related wrist anatomy and in the biomechanics of their knuckle-walking.&lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;

Kivell and Schmitt note "Features found in the hominin fossil record that have traditionally been associated with a broad definition of knuckle-walking are more likely reflecting the habitual Pan-like use of extended wrist postures that are particularly advantageous in an arboreal environment. This, in turn, suggests that human bipedality evolved from a more arboreal ancestor occupying a generalized locomotor and ecological niche common to all living apes".&lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;

Arguments for the independent evolution of knuckle-walking &lt;ref name="Kivell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainton"/&gt; have not gone without criticism, however.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; A more recent study of morphological integration in human and great ape wrists suggests that knuckle-walking did not evolve independently in gorillas and chimpanzees, which "places the emergence of hominins and the evolution of bipedalism in the context of a knuckle-walking background." &lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Williams, S.A.|year=2010|title=Morphological integration and the evolution of knuckle-walking.|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=58|issue=5|pages=432–440|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.03.005|pmid=20409573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related forms of hand-walking==
Primates can walk on their hands in other ways than on their knuckles. They can walk on fists such as [[orangutan]]s. In this body weight is borne on the back of the [[proximal phalanges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mentalities of Gorillas and Orangutans: Comparative Perspectives|first1= Sue Taylor|last1= Parker|first2= Robert W.|last2= Mitchell|first3= H.

Quadrupedal primate walking can be done on the palms. This occurs in many primates when walking on all fours on tree branches.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rose, M.D.|year=1973|title=Quadrupedalism in primates.|journal=Primates|volume=14|issue=4|pages=337–357|doi=10.1007/BF01731356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.21039 | last1 = Patel | first1 = BA. | year = 2009 | title = Not so fast: Speed effects on forelimb kinematics in cercopithecine monkeys and implications for digitigrade postures in primates | url = | journal = Am.

A few older children and some adults retain the ability to walk quadrupedally, even after acquiring bipedalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Aleš Hrdlička|Hrdlicka, A.]]|year=1931|title=Children Who Run On All Fours, and Other Animal-like Behaviors in the Human Child.|publisher=McGraw-Hill, New York|oclc=653743}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[BBC2]] and ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' in ''[[The Family That Walks On All Fours]]'' reported on the [[Ulas family]] in which five individuals grew up walking normally upon the palms of their hands and fully extended legs due to a  recessive genetic [[mutation]] that causes a non-progressive [[congenital]] [[ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]] that impairs the balance needed for bipedality.&lt;ref name="Hand-walkers"&gt;[[Nicholas Humphrey|Humphrey, N.]], [[Keynes family|Keynes, R.]] &amp; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, J.

The '''Leloir Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] research center in [[Buenos Aires]] specializing in [[biochemistry]], [[cellular biology]], [[molecular biology]], and related activities.

==Overview==
The research center was inaugurated in 1947 by way of an initiative of [[University of Buenos Aires]] Physiology Professors [[Bernardo Houssay]] and [[Luis Leloir]]. The project was funded by the philanthropic support of local textile industrialist [[Jaime Campomar]], and Dr. Houssay devoted a share of the proceeds from the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology]] he earned that year to the establishment of the institute. Initially located in a [[belle époque]] building in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of Buenos Aires, the institute was first directed by Dr. Leloir and, following Campomar's death in 1956, it became a recipient of an endowment from both the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]], both in the [[United States]]. The institute was formally named the '''Campomar Institute of Research in Biochemistry''' in 1958, when it was relocated to a utilitarian building belonging to the city's health ministry in the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] section, nearby.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.leloir.org.ar/en/History.htm Leloir Institute: history]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leloir Cardini.JPG|left|thumb|210px|Drs. Luis Leloir (''left'') and Carlos Cardini at work in the institute's former facilities (1960).]]
Dr. Leloir's work at the institute on [[nucleotide]]s and their role in human [[metabolic pathway]]s earned him the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology. This became known as “Leloir's pathway” and was a significant advance for [[biochemistry]]. As a consequence of this 1957 discovery, the cause of a congenital disease called  [[galactosemia]] was first identified; not detected in time, it can cause mental retardation, cataracts and cirrhosis. Numerous other colleagues of his at the institute became well known in their fields, as well. These have included Enrico Cabib, Carlos Cardini, Ranwell Caputto, Alejandro Paladini, and Raúl Trucco, among others. The continued support of the Campomar Foundation allowed the institute to relocate to its current facilities in 1983.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Located in the [[Caballito, Buenos Aires|Caballito]] section of the city and facing [[Parque Centenario]], the new facilities total over 6,900 m² (74,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) and include laboratories, teaching facilities, an auditorium and the National Biochemistry Reference Library. It was renamed the '''Leloir Institute''' in recognition of its longtime director (who died in 1987), in 2001. That year, the center initiated its program of "repatriation of researchers," in a bid to both incorporate new scientific staff, as well as to help reverse the long-standing [[brain drain]] suffered by the Argentine scientific community.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The center maintains numerous cooperation agreements with not only prominent local research centers such as the [[CONICET]] and [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Exact Sciences; but also respected international centers, such as [[Partners Harvard Medical International]], the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Inis Biotech, and the [[Weizmann Institute]]. It hosts 24 research teams and 170 scientists, whose varied specialties include [[neuroscience]], [[cellular biology]], [[oncology]], [[gene therapy]], [[epidemiology]], [[biotechnology]] and [[structural biology]]; among its associated fellows is the recipient of 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology, Dr. [[César Milstein]]. Construction started on the institute's new annex in 2007, consisting of 2,900 m² (31,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) of space for imaging, as well as for expanded research on cell cultures and biophysics. These investments continue the Leloir Institute's tradition as a leader in [[science and technology in Argentina]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10001">'''Lived religion''' is the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Holism|holistic]] framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in [[religious studies]]. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of [[sociology of religion]] "la religion vécue."&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Scholars==

===Robert Orsi===
[[Robert A. Orsi]] is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Grace Craddock Nagle Chair in Catholic Studies at [[Northwestern University]]. He researches, writes, and teaches about religion in the United States, in the past and in contemporary contexts, with a particular focus on American Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/orsi/&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi’s book ''The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950'', won several prizes including the Jesuit National Book Award and is an example study of lived religion.

Orsi defines lived religion as including “the work of social agents/actors themselves as narrators and interpreters (and reinterpreters) of their own experiences and histories, recognizing that the stories we tell about others exist alongside the many and varied story they tell of them selves”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi understands lived religion to be centered on the actions and interpretations of religious person.

In order to study and write about lived religion Orsi suggests a broad field of study in terms of topic matter and methodology. Orsi describes his own process of studying lived religion for ''Madonna On 115th Street'' as wide in scope: “I came to realize that I was learning as much from how people were to me as from what they were telling me, as much as what was going on around the stories as from the stories themselves.” &lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a narrow archival study, Orsi’s focus on non-traditional forms of research demands that scholars give attention to institutions ''and'' persons, texts ''and'' rituals, practices ''and'' theology, things and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In order to study lived religion, Orsi advocates for a complex academic lens where almost anything can hold meaning and serve as a source or text for study.   [[File:La Madonna col Bambino.JPG|thumb|La Madonna col Bambino]]

In ''The Madonna Of 115th Street'', Orsi studies the lived religion of Catholic Italian immigrants in [[Harlem]] New York. Orsi focuses on a particular religious celebration known as the [[Feast day|festa]] for [[The Madonna]] and the social structures that create and layer the event. Through observations, story telling, conversations and research Orsi weaves a picture of life for this immigrant community. In his book, Orsi explores and explains various internal traditions, cultures, and power and social dynamicss in order to illustrate the various religious meanings and significance for community in Italian Harlem.

Orsi talks about the importance of dynamic subject matter covered by the study of lived religion: “the study of lived religion is shaped by and shapes the way family life is organized, for instance; how the dead are buried, children disciplined, the past and present imagined, moral boundaries established and challenged, home constructed, maintained and destroyed, the gods and spirits worshiped and importuned and so on”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orsi's critique of popular religion===

Orsi critiques popular religion as being a limited framework and method for studying religion. Orsi claims that popular religion is “unclear, misleading, and tendentious”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi notes that popular religion is concerned only with the practices of “common folk” and distinguishing popular religion practices as separate from “official religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to The Madonna on 115th Street, he writes, “popular religion served to seal off certain expressions of religious life from unspecified but obviously normative religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi is concerned with the limitations of popular religions because he sees it as potentially authorizing legitimacy and boundaries in religious practices and beliefs. For Orsi, the implied intent in popular religion is to highlight the primitive, ignorant, and often marginalized practitioners of popular religion as a means of “policing religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi’s scholarly move to lived religion as a theoretical framework was an attempt to provide a more holistic approach to religious studies and also highlights the perspective that “religious practices and understandings only have meaning in relations to other cultural forms and in relations to the life experiences and actual circumstance of the people using them”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

===David D. Hall===
[[David D. Hall]] has been a faculty member at [[Harvard Divinity School]] since 1989. Hall was Bartlett Professor of New England Church History until 2008, when he became Bartlett Research Professor.&lt;ref&gt;http://hds.harvard.edu/people/david-d-hall&lt;/ref&gt; Hall writes extensively on religion and society in seventeenth-century New England and England. Hall edited a series of essays titled ''Lived Religion In America: Toward a History Of Practice'', which is a foundational compilation in the study of lived religion. Hall’s book covers topics including gift exchange, cremation, hymn singing and many other essays on lived and practiced religious belief. Many of Hall's students have gone on to become notable scholars in the field of lived religion.

Hall defines lived religion as “rooted less in sociology than cultural and ethnographical approaches to the study of religion and American religious history.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;   He instead sees lived religion as the study of the context and content about the practices of religious laity and their “everyday thinking.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall believes that using lived religion as an approach to the study of religion allows for a wider interpretation of meaning and also provides an opportunity for historians to examine the past and present from many angles. For Hall, lived religion “does not depend on any single method or discipline.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall also acknowledges the limitations of lived religion. Hall suggests that as a field, lived religion is “fluid, mobile, and incompletely structured.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. xii,quoting Danièle Hervieu-Léger&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall calls lived religion an “imperfect tool” noting that even with a dynamic study of laity it is impossible to fully understand any one person’s religious practices, especially when summarizing from a single location be it time or place.

===Hall's critique of popular religion===
Hall distinguishes the study of lived religion from popular religion by saying that popular religion is concerned with hierarchy and opposition in religious beliefs and practices. Hall writes, “popular religion has therefore come to signify the space that emerged between official or learned Christianity and the profane (or ‘pagan’) culture.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall critiques popular religion as imposing normative perspectives on practices.

'''MarBEF Data System''' (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning) was a project of the [[European Union]]'s [[Network of Excellence]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp6/instr_noe.htm Network of Excellence]''&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a platform to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine [[biodiversity]], with informative links to researchers, industry, stakeholders and the general public. The program was funded by the EU and formally ended in 2009.&lt;ref name="marbeone"/&gt; The data system's online '''Register of Resources''' (RoR) includes the details of over 1,000 European [[marine biology]] experts and their affiliated institutions and publications.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt;

MarBEF consisted of 94 [[Europe|European]] marine institutes and the work done was published in 415 scientific articles.&lt;ref name="clamereu"/&gt; While the initial MarBEF project has ended, work continues through numerous projects within the MarBEF "umbrella" including, the '''European Ocean Biogeographic Information System''', the '''European Register of Marine Species''', the '''''European Marine Gazetteer''''', and includes a related '''Marine Biodiversity''' Wiki and '''MarBEF Open Archive'''.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt;

==Organization history==
===Founding===
The program was funded by the [[European Union]] (EU), with [[Euro|€]]8,707,000 coming from the [[European Commission]] and having a total cost of €8,782,025.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/project_summaries/fp6/marine_environment/marbef.pdf|title=MarBEF|publisher=European Commission: Marine &amp; Coastal Research|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was a framework for marine entities, intended to integrate and disseminate the knowledge on [[marine biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org/modules.php?name=Description Overview of MarBEF goals]&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the [[Sixth Framework Programme]] of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org MarBEF website]&lt;/ref&gt; MarBEF consisted of 94 [[Europe|European]] marine institutes from 24 countries and was coordinated by the Dutch Institute for Ecology (NIOO).&lt;ref name="EC"/&gt; 

To accomplish its goals MarBEF participated in and/or supported multiple conferences and [[Academic conference|workshops]] to educate and strengthen collaboration between members of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocoml.org/news/archive-news/coml-marbef-eurocoml-modelling-workshop|title=CoML-MarBEF-EuroCoML modelling workshop|publisher=European Census of Marine Life|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marine-biodiversity.org/endorsing/|title=Endorsing Organisations|publisher=World Conference on Marine Biodiversity|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years and end===
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
The program formally ended in 2009.&lt;ref name="marbeone"/&gt;
While the initial MarBEF project has ended, work continues through numerous projects within the MarBEF "umbrella" including, the European Ocean Biogeographic Information System, the European Register of Marine Species, the ''European Marine Gazetteer'', and includes a related Marine Biodiversity [[Wiki]] and MarBEF Open Archive.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt;

{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
This project continued after the end of MarBEF in 2009.&lt;ref name="EuroMarine"/&gt; 

===''European Marine Gazetteer''===
''European Marine Gazetteer'' was the MarBEF database of geographic co ck(names, information, maps), made available for download by the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org/data/gazetteer.php?p=browser European Marine Gazetteer webpage] &lt;/ref&gt;

===European Register of Marine Species (ERMS)===
The European Register of Marine Species (commonly known by the [[acronym]] ERMS) is an authoritative [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] list of species occurring in the European [[marine environment]]. The ERMS was founded in 1998 by grant from the EU's ''[http://cordis.europa.eu/mast/ Marine Science and Technology Programme]'' and the project covers species of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Animalia]], [[Plantae]], [[Fungi]] and [[Protoctista]] occurring in the marine environment over a wide geographic range. The marine area within the scope of the ERMS includes the [[continental shelf]] seas of Europe as well as the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] shelf, [[Baltic Sea]]s and [[deep-sea]] areas.&lt;ref name="ERMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marbef.org/data/erms.php|title=The European Register of Marine Species|publisher=MarBEF|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database contains the records of tens of thousands of marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marbef.org/data/aphia.php?p=stats|title=Statistics|publisher=MarBEF|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;ERMS executive committee
The executive committee of the project includes: Dr. Mark Costello (Chief editor) of the [[University of Auckland]], Prof. Philippe Bouchet of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], Prof. Geoff Boxshall of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], and Mr. Ward Appeltans from [[UNESCO]]'s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.&lt;ref name="ERMS"/&gt;

====World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)====
{{Main|World Register of Marine Species}}
The [[World Register of Marine Species]] grew out of the ERMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php|title=About|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily funded by the [[European Union]] and hosted by the [[Flanders Marine Institute]] in [[Ostend]], Belgium.  WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] and the [[Encyclopedia of Life]]. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the [[Census of Marine Life]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14206-how-many-species-live-in-the-sea.html|title=How many species live in the sea? |date=2008-06-25 |author=Catherine Brahic|publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IML-Kuskvillan.jpg|thumb|Kuskvillan at the Mittag Leffler Institute.]]

The '''Mittag-Leffler Institute''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] research institute located in [[Djursholm]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]]. It invites scholars to participate in year-long or half-year programs in specialized mathematical subjects. The Institute is run by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] on behalf of research societies representing all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

The Institute's main building was originally the residence of [[Magnus Gustaf (Gösta) Mittag-Leffler]], who donated it along with his extensive mathematics library. At his death in 1927, however, Mittag-Leffler's fortune was insufficient to set up an active research institute, which began operation only in 1969 under the leadership of [[Lennart Carleson]].

The journals [[Acta Mathematica]] and [[Arkiv för Matematik]] are published by the institute. For a number of years at the beginning of the 20th century, Mittag's villa hosted a celebratory dinner for [[Nobel Prize]] laureates.

==Notable visitors==

Each year the institute invites the best mathematician in their fields to work on specific mathematical themes. Some notable past visitors include:

[[Louis Billera]], [[Sy Friedman]], [[John B. Garnett]], [[Roger Heath-Brown]], [[Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurður Helgason]], [[Helge Holden]], [[Harry Kesten]], [[Donald Knuth]], [[George Lusztig]], [[Paul Malliavin]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Lynn Steen]], [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Günter M. Ziegler]], [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Kenneth Falconer]].

The '''National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires''' (''Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la Provincia de Buenos Aires'' or UNNOBA hereafter) is a [[national university]] with head office and campus in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junín]], [[Argentina]]. This city concentrates 80% of the activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |title = Guillermo Tamarit: "La centralidad del proyecto UNNOBA está en Junín y eso nadie lo discute" |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = April 29, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034000/http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |archivedate = May 2, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 2 out of 3 students take classes there.&lt;ref name="inscriptos"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=23549 |title = Aumenta la cantidad de inscriptos en Genética, Informática e Ingenieria y decrece en Abogacia |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = December 29, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has also a campus in [[Pergamino, Buenos Aires Province|Pergamino]] city.

The UNNOBA was created on December 16, 2002, as the composition between the [[w:es:Centro Universitario Regional Junín|Junín Regional University Center]] (CURJ), started in 1990, which reached 15,000 students, and the [[w:es:Centro Regional Universitario de Pergamino|Pergamino Regional University Center]] (CRUP), established a year later, which had 2,600 students.

The University may establish more branches in other locations of the influence area which covers the northwest of the province of Buenos Aires, southern Santa Fe and Córdoba and northeast of La Pampa.

The university and the municipality of Junín, are the mainstays of the Buenos Aires Northwestern Technological Center (''Polo Tecnológico del Noroeste Bonaerense'') and the Regional Research Laboratory in Biofuels, both projects located in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junin]]. On the other hand, the Pergamino Biotechnology Center the School of Agricultural, Environmental and Natural Sciences (ECANA in Spanish) are being developed in [[Pergamino]]. It also has agreements with the [[National Agricultural Technology Institute]] (INTA) and the [[Maiztegui National Human Viral Disease Institute]] (INEVH) of [[Pergamino]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9595">[[File:Pushdown-overview.svg|thumb|right|A nested stack automaton has the same devices as a [[pushdown automaton]], but has less restrictions for using them.]]
In [[automata theory]], a '''nested stack automaton''' is a [[finite state machine|finite automaton]] that can make use of a [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] containing data which can be additional stacks.&lt;ref name="aho"&gt; {{cite journal | last = [[Alfred Aho|Aho]] | first = Alfred | year = 1969 | title = Nested stack automata | journal = [[Journal of the ACM]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–406 | issn = 0004-5411 | url = http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=321529&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE,&amp;CFID=21501966&amp;CFTOKEN=95121590 | doi = 10.1145/321526.321529 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  
Like a [[stack automaton]], a nested stack automaton may step up or down in the stack, and read the current symbol; in addition, it may at any place create a new stack, operate on that one, eventually destroy it, and continue operating on the old stack. This way, stacks can be nested recursively to an arbitrary depth; however, the automaton always operates on the innermost stack only.

A nested stack automaton is capable of recognizing an [[indexed language]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = [[Barbara Partee|Partee]] | first = Barbara |author2=Alice ter Meulen |author3=Robert E. Wall  | title = Mathematical Methods in Linguistics | year = 1990 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | pages = 536–542 | isbn = 978-90-277-2245-4 }} &lt;/ref&gt; and in fact the class of indexed languages is exactly the class of languages accepted by one-way [[nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]] nested stack automata.&lt;ref name="aho" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John E. Hopcroft, Jeffrey D. Ullman| title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}} Here:p.390&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nested stack automata should not be confused with [[embedded pushdown automata]], which have less computational power.{{citation needed|reason=The claim is currently supported only by the order in which both notions appear in the 'Automata theory: formal languages and formal grammars' overview table below.|date=February 2014}}

==Formal definition==
===Automaton===
A (nondeterministic two-way) nested stack automaton is a tuple ‹''Q'',Σ,Γ,δ,''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''F'',[,],''']'''› where
* ''Q'', Σ, and Γ is a nonempty finite set of states, input symbols, and stack symbols, respectively,
* [, ], and ''']''' are distinct special symbols not contained in Σ ∪ Γ,
** [ is used as left endmarker for both the input string and a (sub)stack string,
** ] is used as right endmarker for these strings,
** ''']''' is used as the final endmarker of the string denoting the whole stack.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Aho originally used "$", "¢", and "#" instead of "[", "]", and "''']'''", respectively. See Aho (1969), p.385 top.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An extended input alphabet is defined by Σ' = Σ ∪ {[,]}, an extended stack alphabet by Γ' = Γ ∪ {]}, and the set of input move directions by ''D'' = {-1,0,+1}.
* δ, the finite control, is a mapping from ''Q'' × Σ' × (Γ' ∪ [Γ' ∪ {''']''', [''']'''}) into finite subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × ([Γ&lt;sup&gt;[[Kleene star|*]]&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ''D''), such that δ maps&lt;ref group=note&gt;Juxataposition denotes [[string concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|string (set) concatenation]], and has a higher binding priority than set union ∪. For example, [Γ' denotes the set of all length-2 strings starting with "[" and ending with a symbol from Γ'.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || ''Q'' × Σ' × [Γ || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × [Γ&lt;sup&gt;[[Kleene star|*]]&lt;/sup&gt;  || (pushdown mode),
|-
| || ''Q'' × Σ' × Γ'  || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × ''D''  || (reading mode),
|-
| || ''Q'' × Σ' × [Γ'  || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × {+1}  || (reading mode),
|-
| || ''Q'' × Σ' × {''']'''}  || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × {-1}  || (reading mode),
|-
| || ''Q'' × Σ' × (Γ' ∪ [Γ')  || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × [Γ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]  || (stack creation mode), and
|-
| || ''Q'' × Σ' × {[''']'''}  || into subsets of ''Q'' × ''D'' × {[[empty string|ε]]},  || (stack destruction mode),
|}
:Informally, the top symbol of a (sub)stack together with its preceding left endmarker "[" is viewed as a single symbol;&lt;ref&gt;Aho (1969), p.385 top&lt;/ref&gt; then δ reads 
:* the current state, 
:* the current input symbol, and 
:* the current stack symbol, 
: and outputs 
:* the next state, 
:* the direction in which to move on the input, and
:* the direction in which to move on the stack, or the string of symbols to replace the topmost stack symbol.
* ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''Q'' is the initial state,
* ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ Γ is the initial stack symbol,
* ''F'' ⊆ ''Q'' is the set of final states.
===Configuration===
A '''configuration''', or '''instantaneous description''' of such an automaton consists in a triple 
‹
''q'',
[''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...&lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;], 
[''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...&lt;u&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;...''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sub&gt;''']'''
›,
where
* ''q'' ∈ ''Q'' is the current state,

When automata are allowed to re-read their input ("[[Two-way automaton|two-way automata]]"), nested stacks do not result in additional language recognition capabilities, compared to plain stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=C.

'''''O Přirozenosti Rostlin''''' (''On the Nature of Plants'') is a [[Czech language|Czech]] [[botanical]] text written by [[Friedrich von Berchtold]] and [[Jan Svatopluk Presl]], and published in [[Prague]] in 1820.{{sfn|Berchtold|Presl|1820}} A later expanded edition in three volumes was published between 1823 and 1835. The full title of the 1820 work is ''O přirozenosti Rostlin, obsahugjcj gednánj o žiwobytj rostlin pro sebe a z ohledu giných žiwoků, podlé stawu nyněgss ylo znanj, pýtwu rostlin; názwoslowj audů; hospodářstwj gegich; rozssjřenj po semi a způsob rostlinář zřjditi a zacowati'' (Praha: Krala Wiljma Endersa 1820)  but is generally referred to as ''O Prirozenosti Rostlin'', and the standardised abbreviations is ''Prir. Rostlin''.&lt;ref name=ipni1/&gt;

The later edition is ''O přirozenosti rostlin aneb rostlinář, obsahugjcj popsánj a wyobrazenj rostlin podlé řádů přirozených zpořádané pfirozenych, s zewrubným wyznamenánjm wlastnostj, užitečnosti a škodliwosti, obzwlástě wywodin a zlodin, spůsobu wydobýwánj, poslednjch dobroty a porušenosti neygistěgšjho poznánj a skaušenj, též spůsobu užitecných sázenj chowánj a rozmnožwánj.

There were some copy-editing and usage issues with how the previous version was written, as well, which I've addressed. If this doesn't work let's discuss in Talk.</comment>

In [[geology]], '''permafrost''' is ground,&lt;ref name=Osterkamp/&gt; including [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or (cryotic) [[soil]], at or below the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C}} for two or more years. Most permafrost is located in high [[latitude]]s (in and around the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic regions]]), but at lower latitudes '''alpine permafrost''' occurs at higher [[elevation]]s. Ground ice is not always present, as may be in the case of non-porous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material. Permafrost accounts for 0.022% of total water on Earth&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian. Beginning in 1942, Siemon William Muller delved into the relevant Russian literature held by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[United States Geological Survey Library|U.S. Geological Survey Library]] so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943",&lt;ref name=Arctic&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=H.

. The middle zone is permanently frozen as “permafrost”, and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing. Note the importance of the vertical 0° C line: It denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth.---&gt;]]
Permafrost is [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[sediment]] that is frozen for more than two consecutive years. In areas not overlain by ice, it exists beneath a layer of soil, rock or sediment, which freezes and thaws annually and is called the "active layer".&lt;ref name = "Definition"&gt;

Active layer thickness varies with the season, but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick (shallow along the Arctic coast; deep in southern Siberia and the [[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]).

===Continuity of coverage===
Permafrost typically forms in any [[climate]] where the mean annual air temperature is less than the freezing point of [[water]]. Exceptions are found in moist-wintered forest climates, such as in Northern Scandinavia and the North-Eastern part of European Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], where snow acts as an insulating blanket. Glaciated areas may be exceptions. Since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat, [[Glacier#Types|temperate glaciers]], which are near the [[Pressure melting point|pressure-melting]] point throughout, may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;

====Discontinuous permafrost====
Typically, the below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature, with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth as a result of the geothermal crustal gradient. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northerly [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]—creating ''discontinuous permafrost''. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between {{convert|-5|and|0|C|F}}. In the moist-wintered areas mentioned before, there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to {{convert|-2|°C|°F}}. Discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into ''extensive discontinuous permafrost'', where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between {{convert|-2|and|-4|C|F}}, and ''sporadic permafrost'', where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between {{convert|0|and|-2|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="BrownPéwé"&gt;

=== Subsea permafrost ===
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions.&lt;ref name=IPA/&gt; These areas formed during the last ice age, when a larger portion of Earth's water was bound up in ice sheets on land and when sea levels were low. As the ice sheets melted to again become seawater, the permafrost became submerged shelves under relatively warm and salty boundary conditions, compared to surface permafrost. Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment. According to Osterkamp, subsea permafrost is a factor in the "design, construction, and operation of coastal facilities, structures founded on the seabed, artificial islands, sub-sea pipelines, and wells drilled for exploration and production."&lt;ref name=Osterkamp&gt;

When the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent (ice to dry soil by mass) it is classified as ''massive'' ice.

Buried surface ice may derive from snow, frozen lake or sea ice, [[aufeis]] (stranded river ice) and—probably the most prevalent—buried glacial ice.&lt;ref&gt;Astakhov, 1986; Kaplanskaya and Tarnogradskiy, 1986; Astakhov and Isayeva, 1988; French, 1990; Lacelle et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrasedimental ice forms by in-place freezing of subterranean waters and is dominated by segregational ice which results from the crystallizational differentiation taking place during the freezing of wet sediments, accompanied by water migrating to the freezing front.&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;

Intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across Canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;&lt;!----ref&gt;Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966; Mackay, 1971, 1973, 1989; Harry et al., 1988; French and Harry, 1990; Pollard, 1990; Mackay and Dallimore, 1992; French, 1998; Pollard, 1991; Murton et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Russian investigators including I.A.

===Carbon cycle in permafrost===
The [[permafrost carbon cycle]] (Arctic Carbon Cycle) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes, to the atmosphere, back to vegetation, and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes. Some of this carbon is transferred to the ocean and other portions of the globe through the global carbon cycle. The cycle includes the exchange of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] between terrestrial components and the atmosphere, as well as the transfer of carbon between land and water as methane, [[dissolved organic carbon]], [[dissolved inorganic carbon]], particulate inorganic carbon and particulate organic carbon.&lt;ref name=mcguire&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1890/08-2025.1 |author=McGuire, A.D., Anderson, L.G., Christensen, T.R., Dallimore, S., Guo, L., Hayes, D.J., Heimann, M., Lorenson, T.D., Macdonald, R.W., and Roulet, N. |title=Sensitivity of the carbon cycle in the Arctic to climate change |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=523–555 |year=2009 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2025.1|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-000E-D87B-C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change effects==
Arctic permafrost has been diminishing for many centuries. The consequence is thawing soil, which may be weaker, and release of methane, which contributes to an increased rate of global warming as part of a feedback loop.

===Historical changes===
[[File:Beaufort Permafrost2.JPG|thumb|right|Recently thawed Arctic permafrost and coastal erosion on the Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, near [[Point Lonely Short Range Radar Site|Point Lonely, Alaska]] in 2013.]]

The ground can consist of many substrate materials, including bedrock, sediment, organic matter, water or ice. Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.

By definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grosse, G. |author2=Romanovsky, V. |author3=Nelson, F.E. |author4=Brown, J. |author5=Lewkowicz, A.G. |title=Why Permafrost Is Thawing, Not Melting |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]] |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=87 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1029/2010EO090003 |url=http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/sites/default/files/Grosse%20et%20al%202010%20EOS.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2010EOSTr..91...87G}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy is when a freezer door is left open, although the ice in the freezer may change phase to a liquid, the food solids will not experience a phase change. In aggregate, the food ''thaws'' but does not ''melt''. ''Melting'' implies the phase change of all solids to liquid. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D8163DF93BA2575BC0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=Dead Trees and Shriveling Glaciers as Alaska Melts|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=1998-08-18|accessdate=2007-12-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Here and there, roadside utility poles destabilized by the melting tilt at crazy angles.

===Effect on slope stability===
Over the past century, an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded. It is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing, which is thought to be linked to climate change. Permafrost thawing is thought to have contributed to the 1987 [[Val Pola landslide]] that killed 22 people in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.|first=Dramis,|last2=M.|first2=Govi,|last3=M.|first3=Guglielmin,|last4=G.|first4=Mortara,|date=1995-01-01|title=Mountain permafrost and slope instability in the Italian Alps: The Val Pola Landslide|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/ppp.3430060108/abstract|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1002/ppp.3430060108|issn=1099-1530|pages=73–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mountain ranges, much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost. As climate warms, permafrost thaws, which results in a less stable mountain structure, and ultimately more slope failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Increasing temperatures allow deeper active layer depths, resulting in increased water infiltration. Ice within the soil melts, causing loss of soil strength, accelerated movement, and potential debris flows.

===Ecological consequences===
In the northern circumpolar region, permafrost contains 1700 billion tons of organic material equaling almost half of all organic material in all soils.&lt;ref name="Tarnocai 2009"/&gt; This pool was built up over thousands of years and is only slowly degraded under the cold conditions in the Arctic.

Formation of permafrost has significant consequences for ecological systems, primarily due to constraints imposed upon rooting zones, but also due to limitations on den and [[burrow]] geometries for [[fauna]] requiring subsurface homes. Secondary effects impact [[species]] dependent on plants and animals whose habitat is constrained by the permafrost. One of the most widespread examples is the dominance of [[Black Spruce]] in extensive permafrost areas, since this species can tolerate rooting pattern constrained to the near surface.&lt;ref&gt;C.

One gram of soil from the active layer may include more than one billion bacteria cells.

One estimate suggests that 110–231 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents (about half from carbon dioxide and the other half from methane) will be emitted by 2040, and 850–1400 billion tons by 2100.&lt;ref name="Schuur 2011"/&gt; This corresponds to an average annual emission rate of 4–8 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents in the period 2011–2040 and annually 10–16 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents in the period 2011–2100 as a result of thawing permafrost. For comparison, the anthropogenic emission of all greenhouse gases in 2010 is approximately 48 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2011. Bridging the Emissions Gap.

==Other issues==
The [[International Permafrost Association]] (IPA) is an integrator of issues regarding permafrost. It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.

===Construction on permafrost===
Building on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1–2 metres/3.3–6.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.&lt;ref name="ASCE"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called "[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]".

The ''Permafrost Research Institute'' in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about {{convert|-5|C}}.

===Revival of organisms preserved in permafrost===
In 2012, Russian researchers proved that permafrost can serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving of ''[[Silene stenophylla]]'' from 30,000 year old tissue found in an [[Ice Age]] squirrel burrow in the [[Siberian]] permafrost. This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds. The study demonstrated that tissue can survive ice preservation for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13755">'''Phytosociology''' is the branch of science which deals with [[plant communities]], their composition and development, and the relationships between the [[species]] within them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; A phytosociological system is a system for classifying these communities. 

== History ==
Rooted in [[phytogeography]] and as such considered sometimes a field of [[geobotany]], phytosociology emerged simultaneously in Poland ([[Józef Paczoski|Paczoski]]), France ([[Josias Braun-Blanquet|Braun-Blanquet]]) and Sweden (Du Rietz), but hardly penetrated in Anglo-Saxon world, where prevailed the [[Community_(ecology)#Individualistic_theory|continuum concept of community]], opposed to the concept of [[plant association]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Decocq, G. (2016). Moving from Patterns to Processes: A Challenge for the Phytosociology of the Twenty-First Century? In: Box, E. O. (Ed.). ''Vegetation Structure and Function at Multiple Spatial, Temporal and Conceptual Scales''. Springer. pp. 407-424, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LwHNCwAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "phytosociology" was coined in 1896 by Paczoski.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotnov TA. 1970-1979. Phytocoenology. In: The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd ed. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Phytocoenology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The aim of phytosociology is to achieve a sufficient empirical model of [[vegetation]] using [[plant]] ''[[taxa]]'' combinations that characterize univocally vegetation units. Vegetation units as understood by phytosociologists may express largely abstract vegetation concepts (e.g. the set of all hard-leaved [[evergreen forest]]s of western [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] area) or actual readily recognizable vegetation types (e.g. cork-oak oceanic forests on [[Pleistocene]] dunes with dense canopy in SW-[[Iberian Peninsula]]). Such conceptual units are called "syntaxa" (singular "syntaxon") and can be set in a hierarchy system called "synsystem" or syntaxonomic system. The act of creation, amelioration or adjusting the synsystem is called "syntaxonomy". Therefore, the syntaxonomic system is putatively a sufficient empirical representation of vegetation of a given territory. An ''International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iavs.org/Resources/Classification/International-Code-of-Phytosociological-Nomenclatu.aspx |title=The International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;, issuing the rules for naming "syntaxa" exists and its use has increased among vegetation scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=H E |last2=Moravec |first2=J |last3=Theurillat |first3=J-P |date=Oct 2000 |title=International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature |journal=Journal of Vegetation Science |volume=11 | issue=5| pages=739–768|jstor=3236580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association model==
The basic unit of syntaxonomy is the "[[Association (ecology)|association]]", defined by its characteristic combination of plant taxa, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] features, physiognomy, biogeographical area, role in ecological succession, historical (e.g. history of use by humans) and paleo-biogeographical relationships. The association is sometimes viewed as a concrete phytocoenosis (the plant component of a [[biocoenosis]]). Associations with floristic and territorial affinities{{what?|reason=what does that mean?|date=December 2016}} can be grouped in larger ecological conceptual units (i.e. syntaxa) called "alliances". Similar alliances may be grouped in "orders" and orders in vegetation "classes". The setting of syntaxa in such a hierarchy makes up the syntaxonomical system, or the reference model of the given vegetation and territory.

This science began with [[Charles Flahault]] and continued in earnest with the work of [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]] (1884–1980).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Vegetation complexes==
Nowadays, phytosociologists try to include higher levels of complexity in the perception of vegetation, namely by describing whole successional units (vegetation series) or, in general, vegetation complexes. These lie in the scope of Landscape Phytosociology. Other developments include the use of [[multivariate statistics]] for the definition of "syntaxa" and their environmental interpretation.

On the one hand, some authors consider phytosociology to be in the scope of contemporary vegetation science, a successful approach because of its highly descriptive and predictive powers, and its usefulness in nature management issues. On the other hand, there are numerous critics who have focused on several methodological limitations: the absence of statistical approaches, the complexity and non-stability of the nomenclatural system, the mistakes in the predictive models, and certain basic assumptions.

==Habitat-type classification==
Even if in continental Europe, a complete synsystem describing vegetation types has been developed and it is a basis for habitat-type classification (e.g. NATURA 2000 typology and habitat network), there are numerous scientific experts who do not have a positive opinion about the suitability for phytosociology to be the main [[geobotany|geobotanical]] approach for managing vegetation systems. An important point of disagreement is the floristic-phytosociological assumption that the forest patches of the Mediterranean species of pines mainly derived from afforestations, non-stables and incidentals.

==Data collections==
Phytosociological data contain information collected in relevés (or plots) listing each species cover-abundance values and the measured environmental variables. This data is conveniently databanked in a program like TURBOVEG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hennekens | first1 = SM | last2 = Schaminée | first2 = JHJ | year = 2001 | title = TURBOVEG, a comprehensive data base management system for vegetation data | url = | journal = Journal of Vegetation Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 589–591 | doi=10.2307/3237010| jstor = 3237010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for editing, storage and export to other applications.

Data is usually classified and sorted using TWINSPAN&lt;ref&gt;Hill MO (1979) TWINSPAN: A FORTRAN Programme for arranging multivariate data in an ordered two-way table by classification of the individuals and attributes. Ecology and Systematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; in host programs like [[JUICE (software)|JUICE]] to create realistic species-relevé associations. Further patterns are investigated using clustering and resemblance methods, and [[Ordination (statistics)|ordination techniques]] available in software packages like CANOCO&lt;ref&gt;ter Braak CJF, Šmilauer P (2002) CANOCO Reference manual and CanoDraw for Windows User’s guide: Software for Canonical Community Ordination (version 4.5).

[[File:plastic hinges.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a structure featuring plastic hinges]]

In the [[structural engineering]] [[beam theory]] term, plastic hinge, is used to describe the deformation of a section of a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] where [[plastic bending]] occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[earthquake engineering]] '''plastic hinge''' is also a type of energy [[damping]] device allowing [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] rotation [deformation] of an otherwise rigid column connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mceer.buffalo.edu/education/reu/04Proceedings/12Long_Bergad.pdf Analysis of Rotational Column with Plastic Hinge] Michael Long and Corey Bergad, retrieved November 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastic behaviour==
In plastic [[Limit state design|limit analysis]] of structural members subjected to bending, it is assumed that an abrupt transition from elastic to ideally plastic behaviour occurs at a certain value of moment, known as [[Plastic Moment|plastic moment]] (M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). Member behaviour between M&lt;sub&gt;yp&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be elastic.  When M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is reached, a plastic hinge is formed in the member. In contrast to a [[friction]]less hinge permitting free rotation, it is postulated that the plastic hinge allows large rotations to occur at constant plastic moment M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.

Plastic hinges extend along short lengths of beams. Actual values of these lengths depend on cross-sections and load distributions. But detailed analyses have shown that it is sufficiently accurate to consider beams rigid-plastic, with plasticity confined to plastic hinges at points. While this assumption is sufficient for [[Limit state design|limit state analysis]], finite element formulations are available to account for the spread of plasticity along plastic hinge lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2006)132:2(244) | volume=132 | title=Plastic Hinge Integration Methods for Force-Based Beam–Column Elements | year=2006 | journal=Journal of Structural Engineering | pages=244–252 | last1 = Scott | first1 = Michael H. | last2 = Fenves | first2 = Gregory L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By inserting a plastic hinge at a plastic limit load into a statically determinate beam, a kinematic mechanism permitting an unbounded displacement of the system can be formed. It is known as the collapse mechanism. For each degree of static indeterminacy of the beam, an additional plastic hinge must be added to form a collapse mechanism

Sufficient number of plastic hinges(N) required to make a collapse mechanism (unstable structure):

N=Degree of static indeterminacy + 1

When a moss first grows from the [[spore]], it start as a ''germ tube'' which lengthens and branches into a filamentous complex known as a ''protonema'', which develops into a leafy [[gametophore]], the adult form of a [[gametophyte]] in [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anbg.gov.au/bryophyte/life-cycle-in-nutshell.html Life Cycle - in a nutshell - bryophyte]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss spores germinate to form an [[algae]]-like filamentous structure called the protonema. It represents the juvenile [[gametophyte]]. While the protonema is growing by apical cell division, at some stage, under the influence of the [[phytohormone]] [[cytokinin]], [[bud]]s are induced which grow by three-faced apical cells. These give rise to [[gametophore]]s, stems and leaf like structures (bryophytes do not have true leaves ([[megaphyll]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reski|first=R.|date=1998|title=Development, Genetics and Molecular Biology of Mosses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1438-8677.1998.tb00670.x/abstract|journal=Botanica Acta|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1998.tb00670.x|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protonema are characteristic of all mosses and some liverworts but are absent from hornworts.

[[File:Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece, Forest Women by Artist Mumbiram.jpeg|thumb|Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece "Forest Women" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

'''Rasa Renaissance''' is a movement in the art of painting that makes evocation of rasas (emotional moods) the prime aim in the creation and appreciation of a work of art. [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] is the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art produces through the personalities, their expression and the situation presented in a painting. Rasa is a [[Sanskrit]] word that denotes the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art brings about. Rasa Theory is a theory of aesthetic criticism that has been prevalent in appreciation of literary works in Sanskrit language for millenniums (see: [[Indian aesthetics|Indian aesthetic]]).

The idea of Rasa Renaissance evolved in the last quarter of the twentieth century in the domain of painting, as a countermovement to [[abstract art |abstract]] and conceptual art. Rasa Renaissance is led by artist, philosopher and Sanskrit scholar Dr. [[Mumbiram]] of India (Ph.D. Berkeley California). In the twentieth century, the art of painting progressively became dissociated from depiction of personalities in real-world situations. It concerned itself with exploration of forms and colours for their own sake. It became more or less an exercise in clever intellectual sophistication. Art of Rasa Renaissance presupposes personalities in various situations, and in various emotional states, as being central to a work of art.

== Rasa art and personalist art ==
The emotions that the creator of a painting has in mind, the emotions that personalities who appear in a painting share with each other, as also the emotions that are aroused in the viewer of a painting, are all of concern in appreciation of a work of rasa art.
As emotions are states in the minds of personalities, rasa art presupposes depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states to be the subject matter of a rasa painting. Painting that concerns itself with depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states is "personalist art". The realm of personalist art is '''personalism'''.

== Personalist and impersonalist in history of art ==
Throughout the long history of art there has always been personalist as well as impersonal art. Portraits of kings, demigods, gods, mythological figures, saints as also ordinary people are examples of personalist art. Scenes in the lives of important as well as ordinary people are other examples. There were also battle scenes, domestic scenes, mythological and religious events. Impersonal Art existed in the form of landscapes, still-life and decorative designs. Till the late 19th century, art remained more or less representational. The beginning of the 20th century saw art indulging in deliberate distortions in depictions of personalities as well as inanimate objects. Soon afterwards, art saw itself dissociating from representation of real-world objects and personalities. Exploration of colours and forms for their own sake, without reference to any real-world entities became the subject matter of abstract paintings. Art became impersonal.

== Origins of personalist art and Rasa Renaissance ==
The idea of Rasa Renaissance first appeared in the art and writings of artist [[Mumbiram]] of India. The idea of personalist art first appears in two articles that Mumbiram wrote in 1985 in his native Marathi language in Pune's ''Ravivar Sakal''. "In Search of an Art that transcends Culture" and "The Practice of Personalist Art". In these autobiographical articles, Mumbiram describes his affectionate rapport with his artist grandfather, his success as a prodigious child artist, his giving up art to devote himself to mathematics, his years in the graduate school at Berkeley, his ''déjà vu'' with art, his search for art that does not align itself with any culture (''sanskritinirapeksha''), his falling in love with Krishna and his arrival back in India as a personalist artist.

Here Mumbiram calls his own art ''Vyaktisaapeksha Kalaa''. ''Saapekshataa'' would translate to relativity. ''Saapeksha'' would translate to 'depending on' or 'in expectation of'. ''Kalaa'' translates to Art, Art in reference to persons - Art in the context of persons. This is where the usage ''Personalist Art'' first appears.

In an article appearing in the ''Sunday Maharashtra Herald'', "Waiting in the Wings" in 1986, journalist Ashok Gopal introduces Mumbiram: "Mumbiram calls his Art Personalist Art..." The same article carries an Artist's Manifesto which makes clear reference to Personalism: "Personalism is a frontal attack on materialism on the aesthetic front", "Personalism leaves no room for the existential void".

The idea of Rasa Theory as basic to appreciation of art appears in an article about Mumbiram appearing in Mumbai's ''Sunday Observer'' in 1988 written by Sudhir Sonalkar. An interview with Mumbiram for the Mumbai tabloid ''Mid-Day'' has Mumbiram talking about Rasa Theory.

Distant Drummer Publishing has produced ''High Five of Love'', a five-volume ensemble of English translations of Sanskrit Rasa classics wherein Mumbiram's original Rasa art is juxtaposed with Rasa literature. A catalog of exhibition of Mumbiram's ''Book Readers: Love on the Gutenberg Galaxy'' cites Rasa theory of aesthetic appreciation as relevant to appreciation of Mumbiram's art. It also gives an extensive bibliography of classical works on Rasa theory. Another extensive catalog of Mumbiram's work is titled: ''Rasa Renaissance''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "I let him persuade me", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "I let him persuade me" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== ''Prema vivarta'' mood ==
According to [[Vaishnavism]] theology, Krishna is Rasaraj, the supreme source of all rasas. Depictions of incidents in Krishna's biography are most attractive subjects for Rasa art. In the ''prema vivarta'' mood of attachment to Krishna, everything in the phenomenal world appears to the lover of Krishna as a ''[[déjà vu]]'' of something related to Krishna. Many Rasa masterpieces are made in the prema vivarta mood. Ashok Gopal quotes Mumbiram: "My raven-dark rambunctious, roaming, rag-picking girlfriends remind me of Krishna and his boys in the forests of Vrindavan."

== Comparison with the Pre-Raphaelites (a paradigm shift) ==
[[Pre-Raphaelites]] were rebelling against the 'stodgy' Royal Academy. Somehow the romance was missing in the artists' lives. This group formed a secret brotherhood. Real life muses inspired their works. The inspiration was reflected in their paintings. The real lives of the artists and their works had a symbiotic relationship between them.

Rasa art, or art of Rasa Renaissance, is rebelling against the far more 'stodgy' art establishment of the twentieth century. Art degenerated into creation of 'brand equity' in logos. Depiction of persons was pigeonholed into the category of 'figurative' and 'representational' art for the less intelligent simpletons. Art museums, auction houses, art galleries and art schools all descended into a rut of vested interests. Rasa Renaissance rebels by bringing back into the purview of contemporary art the noble situations of human existence, the innate beauty of personalities and love amongst individuals. By the standards of the Rasa Theory of aesthetics, only Personalist Art can genuinely evoke rasas. So-called 'abstract' art is merely Impersonal Art, severely limited in its ability to invoke any rasa.

The Pre-Raphaelites used muses as models. They used monochrome, posed photographs of their muses/models to achieve realism. They spent considerable effort in painting carpets and folds in clothing. They strived to make paintings appear 'as good as' colour photographs.

Rasa art is inspired by real-life muses. They are not professional models. They are from an entirely different milieu. The artist meets them through personal encounter of the [[Romanticism|romantic type]]. Living in an era when color photography and photoshop are commonplace, rasa art is predominantly charcoal renderings. They are effortless quick live renderings. They don't aspire for photorealism. The person is of prime importance. The surroundings are not even depicted. The drama of the meeting and also the rendering is the 'high' the artist and the muses share. The admirers meet the artist in equally surprising ways. They are thrilled to be caught in the real life milieu of a classical painter. They are impulsively inspired to buy the work from the artist himself, from the environment where the work was produced.

== Personalism in theology, love and art ==
According to tenets of Personalism, an Impersonal paradigm of divinity gives rise to the existential void and absence of values.
Love of impersonal objects, in preference to love of individuals, gives rise to materialism. Impersonalism in art is epitomized in abstract art.

Proponents of Rasa Renaissance see distortions in painting as sarcastic and cynical expressions. Rasa Art strives for simplicity, innocence, faith and devotion. Rasa Art strives for honesty to an indigenous aesthetic and an awareness of one's own beauty. Personalism sees man made in the image of God. There is no room for 'existential void'. Personalism focuses attention on love and grace amongst individuals, in preference to fascination with matter.

'''Reinforced concrete''' (RC) ''(also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC)'' is a [[composite material]] in which [[concrete]]'s relatively low [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] and [[ductility]] are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars ([[rebar]]) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable [[fracture mechanics|cracking]] and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (concrete in compression, reinforcement in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as [[Prestressed concrete|pre-tensioning]] and [[Prestressed concrete|post-tensioning]].
 
For a strong, [[Ductility|ductile]] and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least:
* High relative [[Strength of materials|strength]]
* High toleration of [[ultimate tensile strength|tensile strain]]
* Good [[Adhesion|bond]] to the concrete, irrespective of pH, moisture, and similar factors
* Thermal compatibility, not causing unacceptable stresses (such as expansion or contraction) in response to changing temperatures.
* Durability in the concrete environment, irrespective of corrosion or sustained stress for example.

Joseph Monier, a French gardener and known to be one of the principal inventors of reinforced concrete, was granted a patent for reinforced flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh to a mortar shell. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more advanced technique of reinforcing concrete columns and girders with iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is less known if he even knew how much reinforcing actually improved concrete's [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]].&lt;ref name=Mörsch&gt;{{cite book |last=Mörsch |first=Emil |title=Concrete-steel Construction: (Der Eisenbetonbau) |year=1909 |publisher=The Engineering News Publishing Company |pages=204–210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZI1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1877 the use of concrete construction, though dating back to the Roman Empire, and having been reintroduced in the early 1800s, was not yet a proven scientific technology. American New Yorker [[Thaddeus Hyatt]] published a report titled ''An Account of Some Experiments with Portland-Cement-Concrete Combined with Iron as a Building Material, with Reference to Economy of Metal in Construction and for Security against Fire in the Making of Roofs, Floors, and Walking Surfaces'' where he reported his experiments on the behavior of reinforced concrete. His work played a major role in the evolution of concrete construction as a proven and studied science. Without Hyatt's work, more dangerous trial and error methods would have largely been depended on for the advancement in the technology.&lt;ref name="Condit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Peter|title=Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture |date=1920–1981|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0-7735-2564-5|pages=58–60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Zttxa_oHcEC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Thaddeus+Hyatt+concrete&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k2wHydvwT8&amp;sig=eosFTGCY_MzzyvHTUkc2EDRnvTU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=htYKU6bPG-bbyQHv3oDoAw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Thaddeus%20Hyatt%20concrete&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:de:Gustav Adolf Wayss|G. A. Wayss]] was a German civil engineer and a pioneer of the iron and steel concrete construction. In 1879, Wayss bought the German rights to Monier's patents and in 1884, he started the first commercial use for reinforced concrete in his firm [[:de:Wayss &amp; Freytag|Wayss &amp; Freytag]]. Up until the 1890s, Wayss and his firm greatly contributed to the advancement of Monier's system of reinforcing and established it as a well-developed scientific technology.&lt;ref name=Mörsch/&gt;

[[Ernest L. Ransome]] was an English-born engineer and early innovator of the reinforced concrete techniques in the end of the 19th century. With the knowledge of reinforced concrete developed during the previous 50 years, Ransome innovated nearly all styles and techniques of the previous known inventors of reinforced concrete. Ransome's key innovation was to twist the reinforcing steel bar improving bonding with the concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mars|first1=Roman|title=Episode 81: Rebar and the Alvord Lake Bridge|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-81-rebar-and-the-alvord-lake-bridge/|website=[[99% Invisible]]|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining increasing fame from his concrete constructed buildings, Ransome was able to build two of the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Peter|title=Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture|date=1920–1981|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0-7735-2564-5|pages=61–64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Zttxa_oHcEC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first concrete buildings constructed in the United States, was a private home, designed by William Ward in 1871. The home was designed to be fireproof for his wife.

One of the first skyscrapers made with reinforced concrete was the 16-story [[Ingalls Building]] in Cincinnati, constructed in 1904.&lt;ref name=CIVL1101/&gt;

The first reinforced concrete building in Southern California was the [[Homer Laughlin Building|Laughlin Annex]] in Downtown Los Angeles, constructed in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUUAAAAYAAJ |title=Los Angeles from the Mountains to the Sea |volume=2 |last=McGroarty |first=John Steven |publisher=American Historical Society |year=1921 |location=Los Angeles, CA |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Annual Report of the City Auditor, City of Los Angeles, California for the Year Ending June 30 |publisher=Los Angeles City Auditor |year=1905 |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=71–73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_k4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, 16 building permits were reportedly issued for reinforced concrete buildings in the City of Los Angeles, including the [[Hazard's Pavilion#Clune's Auditorium|Temple Auditorium]] and 8-story Hayward Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Williams |first=D. |date=February 1907 |title=What Builders are Doing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oidPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |journal=Carpentry and Building |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=W.P.H. |date=April 19, 1906 |title=Reinforced Concrete Buildings at Los Angeles, Cal. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jg1HAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=449 |journal=Engineering News-Record |volume=55 |page=449 |department=Letters to the Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1906 a magnitude [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|7.8 earthquake]] struck San Francisco. The strong ground shaking and subsequent fire destroyed much of the city and killed thousands. The use of reinforced concrete after the earthquake was highly promoted within the U.S. construction industry due to its non-combustibility and perceived superior seismic performance relative to masonry.

In 1906, a partial collapse of the Bixby Hotel in Long Beach killed 10 workers during construction when shoring was removed prematurely. This event spurred a scrutiny of concrete erection practices and building inspections. The structure was constructed of reinforced concrete frames with hollow clay tile ribbed flooring and hollow clay tile infill walls. This practice was strongly questioned by experts and recommendations for “pure” concrete construction using reinforced concrete for the floors and walls as well as the frames were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |author1=Austin, J.

Many different types of structures and components of structures can be built using reinforced concrete including [[Concrete slab|slab]]s, [[wall]]s, [[beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]], [[framing (construction)|frame]]s and more.

Reinforced concrete can be classified as [[precast]] or [[concrete|cast-in-place concrete]].

Designing and implementing the most efficient floor system is key to creating optimal building structures. Small changes in the design of a floor system can have significant impact on material costs, construction schedule, ultimate strength, operating costs, occupancy levels and end use of a building.

Without reinforcement, constructing modern structures with concrete material would not be possible.

The aggregates used for making concrete should be free from harmful substances like organic impurities, silt, clay, lignite etc. Typical concrete mixes have high resistance to [[compression (physical)|compressive]] [[stress (physics)|stress]]es (about {{convert|4000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}); however, any appreciable [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (''e.g.,'' due to [[bending]]) will break the microscopic rigid lattice, resulting in cracking and separation of the concrete. For this reason, typical non-reinforced concrete must be well supported to prevent the development of tension.

If a material with high strength in tension, such as [[steel]], is placed in concrete, then the composite material, reinforced concrete, resists not only compression but also bending and other direct tensile actions. A composite section where the concrete resists compression and reinforcement "[[rebar]]" resists tension can be made into almost any shape and size for the construction industry.

===Key characteristics===
Three physical characteristics give reinforced concrete its special properties:

# The [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of concrete is similar to that of steel, eliminating large internal stresses due to differences in [[heat|thermal]] expansion or contraction.
# When the cement paste within the concrete hardens, this conforms to the surface details of the steel, permitting any stress to be transmitted efficiently between the different materials. Usually steel bars are roughened or corrugated to further improve the [[chemical bond|bond]] or cohesion between the concrete and steel.
# The [[pH|alkaline]] chemical environment provided by the [[alkali]] reserve (KOH, NaOH) and the [[portlandite]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) contained in the hardened cement paste causes a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] film to form on the surface of the steel, making it much more resistant to [[corrosion]] than it would be in neutral or acidic conditions. When the cement paste is exposed to the air and meteoric water reacts with the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, portlandite and the [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (CSH) of the hardened cement paste become progressively carbonated and the high pH gradually decreases from 13.5 – 12.5 to 8.5, the pH of water in equilibrium with [[calcite]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and the steel is no longer passivated.

As a rule of thumb, only to give an idea on orders of magnitude, steel is protected at pH above ~11 but starts to corrode below ~10 depending on steel characteristics and local physico-chemical conditions when concrete becomes carbonated. [[Concrete degradation#Carbonation|carbonatation of concrete]] along with [[chloride]] ingress are amongst the chief reasons for the failure of [[reinforcement bar]]s in concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=WebCorr Corrosion Consulting Services |last=Qiu |first=Jianhai |url=http://www.corrosionclinic.com/corrosion_resources/corrosion_control_concrete_structures_p1.htm |title=Emerging Corrosion Control Technologies for Repair and Rehabilitation of Concrete Structures |at=page 1 |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative cross-sectional [[area]] of steel required for typical reinforced concrete is usually quite small and varies from 1% for most beams and slabs to 6% for some columns. [[rebar|Reinforcing bars]] are normally round in cross-section and vary in diameter. Reinforced concrete structures sometimes have provisions such as ventilated hollow cores to control their moisture &amp; humidity.

Distribution of concrete (in spite of reinforcement) strength characteristics along the cross-section of vertical reinforced concrete elements is inhomogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf "Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-In-Situ Elements In Frame-Type Buildings"]. {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of composite action of reinforcement and concrete===
The reinforcement in a RC structure, such as a steel bar, has to undergo the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete in order to prevent discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length. This load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops in the vicinity of the steel-concrete interface.

===Anchorage (bond) in concrete: Codes of specifications===
Because the actual bond stress varies along the length of a bar anchored in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress. The main requirement for safety against bond failure is to provide a sufficient extension of the length of the bar beyond the point where the steel is required to develop its yield stress and this length must be at least equal to its development length. However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs or hooks or mechanical end plates. The same concept applies to lap splice length mentioned in the codes where splices (overlapping) provided between two adjacent bars in order to maintain the required continuity of stress in the splice zone.

===Anti-corrosion measures===
In wet and cold climates, reinforced concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures that may be exposed to [[deicing]] salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or [[stainless steel]] rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar. Reference ASTM standard specifications '''A1035/A1035M''' Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Low-carbon, Chromium, Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement, '''A767''' Standard Specification for Hot Dip Galvanised Reinforcing Bars, '''A775''' Standard Specification for Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars and '''A955''' Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Stainless Bars for Concrete Reinforcement.&lt;!-- [[American Concrete Institute|ACI]] 440 provides information about properties and design of FRP reinforced concrete structures. The Canadian [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] 806 and 807 providing the same information in form of a real standard. In addition the Canadian Highway Design Code is the first standard allowing for composites in bridge construction. --&gt;

Another, cheaper way of protecting rebars is coating them with [[zinc phosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of zinc phosphate chemical conversion coating on corrosion behaviour of mild steel in alkaline medium: protection of rebars in reinforced concrete |first=Florica |last=Simescu |first2=Hassane |last2=Idrissi |publisher=National Institute for Materials Science |journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=December 19, 2008 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1468-6996/9/4/045009/meta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407020551/http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1468-6996/9/4/045009/meta |archive-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc phosphate slowly reacts with [[calcium]] cations and the [[hydroxyl]] anions present in the cement pore water and forms a stable [[hydroxyapatite]] layer.

Penetrating sealants typically must be applied some time after curing. Sealants include paint, plastic foams, films and [[aluminum foil]], felts or fabric mats sealed with tar, and layers of [[bentonite]] clay, sometimes used to seal roadbeds.

[[Corrosion inhibitor]]s, such as [[calcium]] [[nitrite]] [Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], can also be added to the water mix before pouring concrete. Generally, 1–2&amp;nbsp;wt.&amp;nbsp;% of [Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent corrosion of the rebars. The [[nitrite]] anion is a mild [[oxidizer]] that oxidizes the soluble and mobile [[ferrous ion]]s (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This causes the passivation of steel at the [[anodic]] oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than [[nitrate]], which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.

==Reinforcement and terminology of beams==
[[File:Rebarbeams.JPG|thumb|right|Two intersecting beams integral to parking garage slab that will contain both reinforcing steel and the wiring, junction boxes and other electrical components necessary to install the overhead lighting for the garage level beneath it.]]

A beam bends under [[bending moment]], resulting in a small curvature. At the outer face (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stress, while at the inner face (compressive face) it experiences compressive stress.

A '''singly reinforced''' beam is one in which the concrete element is only reinforced near the tensile face and the reinforcement, called tension steel, is designed to resist the tension.

A '''doubly reinforced''' beam is one in which besides the tensile reinforcement the concrete element is also reinforced near the compressive face to help the concrete resist compression. The latter reinforcement is called compression steel. When the compression zone of a concrete is inadequate to resist the compressive moment (positive moment), extra reinforcement has to be provided if the architect limits the dimensions of the section.

An '''under-reinforced''' beam is one in which the tension capacity of the tensile reinforcement is smaller than the combined compression capacity of the concrete and the compression steel (under-reinforced at tensile face). When the reinforced concrete element is subject to increasing bending moment, the tension steel yields while the concrete does not reach its ultimate failure condition. As the tension steel yields and stretches, an "under-reinforced" concrete also yields in a ductile manner, exhibiting a large deformation and warning before its ultimate failure. In this case the yield stress of the steel governs the design.

An '''over-reinforced''' beam is one in which the tension capacity of the tension steel is greater than the combined compression capacity of the concrete and the compression steel (over-reinforced at tensile face). So the "over-reinforced concrete" beam fails by crushing of the compressive-zone concrete and before the tension zone steel yields, which does not provide any warning before failure as the failure is instantaneous.

A '''balanced-reinforced''' beam is one in which both the compressive and tensile zones reach yielding at the same imposed load on the beam, and the concrete will crush and the tensile steel will yield at the same time. This design criterion is however as risky as over-reinforced concrete, because failure is sudden as the concrete crushes at the same time of the tensile steel yields, which gives a very little warning of distress in tension failure.&lt;ref&gt;Nilson, Darwin, Dolan. ''Design of Concrete Structures''. the MacGraw-Hill Education, 2003. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel-reinforced concrete moment-carrying elements should normally be designed to be under-reinforced so that users of the structure will receive warning of impending collapse.

The '''characteristic strength''' is the strength of a material where less than 5% of the specimen shows lower strength.

The '''design strength''' or '''nominal strength''' is the strength of a material, including a material-safety factor. The value of the safety factor generally ranges from 0.75 to 0.85 in [[Permissible stress design]].

The '''ultimate limit state''' is the theoretical failure point with a certain probability. It is stated under factored loads and factored resistances.

Reinforced concrete structures are normally designed according to rules and regulations or recommendation of a code such as ACI-318, CEB, Eurocode 2 or the like. WSD, USD or LRFD methods are used in design of RC structural members. Analysis and design of RC members can be carried out by using linear or non-linear approaches. When applying safety factors, building codes normally propose linear approaches, but for some cases non-linear approaches.

== Prestressed concrete ==
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}

Prestressing concrete is a technique that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force. Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.

== Common failure modes of steel reinforced concrete ==
Reinforced concrete can fail due to inadequate strength, leading to mechanical failure, or due to a reduction in its durability. Corrosion and freeze/thaw cycles may damage poorly designed or constructed reinforced concrete. When rebar corrodes, the oxidation products ([[rust]]) expand and tends to flake, cracking the concrete and unbonding the rebar from the concrete. Typical mechanisms leading to durability problems are discussed below.

=== Mechanical failure ===
Cracking of the concrete section is nearly impossible to prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a [[limit state design#Serviceability Limit State|serviceability]] failure in [[limit state design]]. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.

Ultimate failure leading to collapse can be caused by crushing the concrete, which occurs when compressive stresses exceed its strength, by [[yield (engineering)|yielding]] or failure of the rebar when bending or shear stresses exceed the strength of the reinforcement, or by bond failure between the concrete and the rebar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Remote sensing and photogrammetry techniques in diagnostics of concrete structures |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306359709_Remote_sensing_and_photogrammetry_techniques_in_diagnostics_of_concrete_structures |journal=Computers and Concrete |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=405–420 |doi=10.12989/cac.2016.18.3.405 |access-date=2016-12-14 |author1=Janowski, A. |author2=Nagrodzka-Godycka, K. |author3=Szulwic, J. |author4=Ziółkowski, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbonation ===
[[File:Concrete wall cracking as steel reinforcing corrodes and swells 9058.jpg|left|thumb|Concrete wall cracking as steel reinforcing corrodes and swells. Rust has a lower density than metal, so it expands as it forms, cracking the decorative cladding off the wall as well as damaging the structural concrete. The breakage of material from a surface is called ''spalling''.]]
[[File:Concrete wall cracking as its steel reinforcing cracks and swells 9061v.jpg|left|thumb|Detailed view of spalling probably caused by a too thin layer of concrete between the steel and the surface, accompanied by corrosion from external exposure.]]

{{main|carbonation}}
Carbonation, or neutralisation, is a chemical reaction between [[carbon dioxide]] in the air and [[calcium hydroxide]] and hydrated [[calcium silicate]] in the concrete.

When a concrete structure is designed, it is usual to specify the [[concrete cover]] for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or [[building code]]s. If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a [[cover meter]]. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.

One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to [[drill]] a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with [[phenolphthalein]] indicator solution. This solution turns [[pink]] when in contact with alkaline concrete, making it possible to see the depth of carbonation. Using an existing hole does not suffice because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.

===Chlorides===
[[Chloride]]s, including [[sodium chloride]], can promote the corrosion of embedded [[steel]] [[rebar]] if present in sufficiently high concentration. Chloride anions induce both localized corrosion ([[pitting corrosion]]) and generalized corrosion of steel reinforcements. For this reason, one should only use fresh raw water or potable water for mixing concrete, ensure that the coarse and fine aggregates do not contain chlorides, rather than admixtures which might contain chlorides.
[[File:RebarCloseup.jpg|thumb|right|Rebar for foundations and walls of a sewage pump station.]]
[[File:Paulins Kill Viaduct in Hainesburg, NJ.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Paulins Kill Viaduct]], Hainesburg, New Jersey, is 115 feet (35 m) tall and 1,100 feet (335 m) long, and was heralded as the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world when it was completed in 1910 as part of the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]] rail line project. The [[Lackawanna Railroad]] was a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete.]]

It was once common for [[calcium chloride]] to be used as an admixture to promote rapid set-up of the concrete. It was also mistakenly believed that it would prevent freezing. However, this practice fell into disfavor once the deleterious effects of chlorides became known. It should be avoided whenever possible.

The use of de-icing salts on roadways, used to lower the [[freezing point]] of water, is probably one of the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of [[epoxy|epoxy-coated]] reinforcing bars and the application of [[cathodic protection]] has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.

Another important source of chloride ions is [[sea water]]. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5&amp;nbsp;wt.% [[salts]]. These salts include [[sodium chloride]], [[magnesium sulfate]], [[calcium sulfate]], and [[bicarbonate]]s. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and migrate with the water into the [[capillary|capillaries]] of the concrete. Chloride ions, which make up about 50% of these ions, are particularly aggressive as a cause of corrosion of carbon steel reinforcement bars.

In the 1960s and 1970s it was also relatively common for [[magnesite]], a [[chloride]] rich [[carbonate mineral]], to be used as a floor-topping material. This was done principally as a levelling and sound attenuating layer. However it is now known that when these materials come into contact with moisture they produce a weak solution of [[hydrochloric acid]] due to the presence of [[chloride]]s in the magnesite. Over a period of time (typically decades), the solution causes [[corrosion]] of the embedded [[steel]] [[rebar]]s. This was most commonly found in wet areas or areas repeatedly exposed to moisture.

===Alkali silica reaction===
{{Main|Alkali–silica reaction}}

This a reaction of [[amorphous]] [[silica]] ([[chalcedony]], [[chert]], [[siliceous]] [[limestone]]) sometimes present in the [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]s with the [[hydroxyl]] ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) from the cement pore solution. Poorly crystallized silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dissolves and dissociates at high pH (12.5 - 13.5) in alkaline water. The soluble dissociated [[silicic acid]] reacts in the porewater with the [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) present in the [[cement]] paste to form an expansive [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (CSH). The [[alkali–silica reaction]] (ASR) causes localised swelling responsible for [[tensile stress]] and [[Fracture|cracking]]. The conditions required for alkali silica reaction are threefold:
(1) aggregate containing an alkali-reactive constituent (amorphous silica), (2) sufficient availability of hydroxyl ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and (3) sufficient moisture, above 75% [[relative humidity]] (RH) within the concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4014172 |title=Concrete Cancer |website=h2g2 |publisher=BBC |date=March 15, 2012 |orig-year=2005 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cementindustry.co.uk/main.asp?page=272 |title=Special Section: South West Alkali Incident |website=the cement industry |publisher=British Cement Association |date=4 January 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029112122/http://www.cementindustry.co.uk/main.asp?page=272 |archivedate=October 29, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is sometimes popularly referred to as "[[concrete cancer]]". This reaction occurs independently of the presence of rebars; massive concrete structures such as [[dam]]s can be affected.

===Conversion of high alumina cement===
Resistant to weak acids and especially sulfates, this cement cures quickly and has very high durability and strength. It was frequently used after [[World War II]] to make precast concrete objects. However, it can lose strength with heat or time (conversion), especially when not properly cured. After the collapse of three roofs made of prestressed concrete beams using high alumina cement, this cement was [[ban (law)|banned]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1976. Subsequent inquiries into the matter showed that the beams were improperly manufactured, but the ban remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quest-tech.co.uk/hac.htm |title=High Alumina Cement |accessdate=2009-10-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050911210803/http://www.quest-tech.co.uk/hac.htm |archivedate = 2005-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulphates===
[[Sulfate]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the soil or in groundwater, in sufficient concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., [[ettringite]] or [[thaumasite]], which can lead to early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower in the soil mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.

==Steel plate construction==
{{Main|Steel plate construction}}
In steel plate construction, stringers join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced concrete construction by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel is on the outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.

==Fiber-reinforced concrete==
{{Main|Fiber reinforced concrete}}
Fiber reinforcement is mainly used in [[shotcrete]], but can also be used in normal concrete. Fiber-reinforced normal concrete is mostly used for on-ground floors and pavements, but can also be considered for a wide range of construction parts (beams, pillars, foundations, etc.), either alone or with hand-tied rebars.

Concrete reinforced with fibers (which are usually steel, [[glass]], [[Fiber-reinforced plastic|plastic fibers]]) or Cellulose polymer fibre is less expensive than hand-tied rebar.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), but it will not increase the concrete tensile strength. A normal-size fiber for European shotcrete (1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, 45&amp;nbsp;mm length—steel or plastic) will increase the concrete's tensile strength.  Fiber reinforcement is most often used to supplement or partially replace primary rebar, and in some cases it can be designed to fully replace rebar.

Steel is the strongest commonly available fiber,{{Citation needed|reason=I thought Aramid fibers were stronger, need a reliable source for this statement as it may not be fact based or is out-of-date.|date=December 2017}} and comes in different lengths (30 to 80&amp;nbsp;mm in Europe) and shapes (end-hooks). Steel fibers can only be used on surfaces that can tolerate or avoid corrosion and rust stains. In some cases, a steel-fiber surface is faced with other materials.

Glass fiber is inexpensive and corrosion-proof, but not as ductile as steel. Recently, spun [[basalt fiber]], long available in [[Eastern Europe]], has become available in the U.S. and Western Europe. Basalt fibre is stronger and less expensive than glass, but historically has not resisted the alkaline environment of [[Portland cement]] well enough to be used as direct reinforcement. New materials use plastic binders to isolate the basalt fiber from the cement.

The premium fibers are [[graphite]]-reinforced plastic fibers, which are nearly as strong as steel, lighter in weight, and corrosion-proof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Some experiments have had promising early results with [[carbon nanotubes]], but the material is still far too expensive for any building.{{Citation needed|reason=this statement needs substantiation|date=December 2017}}

==Non-steel reinforcement==
There is considerable overlap between the subjects of non-steel reinforcement and fiber-reinforcement of concrete. The introduction of non-steel reinforcement of concrete is relatively recent; it takes two major forms: non-metallic rebar rods, and non-steel (usually also non-metallic) fibres incorporated into the cement matrix. For example, there is increasing interest in [[Glass fiber reinforced concrete|glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC)]] and in various applications of polymer fibres incorporated into concrete. Although currently there is not much suggestion that such materials will replace metal rebar, some of them have major advantages in specific applications, and there also are new applications in which metal rebar simply is not an option. However, the design and application of non-steel reinforcing is fraught with challenges. For one thing, concrete is a highly alkaline environment, in which many materials, including most kinds of glass, have a poor [[service life]]. Also, the behaviour of such reinforcing materials differs from the behaviour of metals, for instance in terms of shear strength, creep and elasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=BS EN 1169:1999 Precast concrete products.

[[Fibre-reinforced plastic|Fibre-reinforced plastic/polymer]] (FRP) and [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP) consist of fibres of [[polymer]], glass, carbon, aramid or other polymers or high-strength fibres set in a resin matrix to form a rebar rod, or grid, or fibres. These rebars are installed in much the same manner as steel rebars. The cost is higher but, suitably applied, the structures have advantages, in particular a dramatic reduction in problems related to [[corrosion]], either by intrinsic concrete alkalinity or by external corrosive fluids that might penetrate the concrete. These structures can be significantly lighter and usually have a longer [[service life]]. The cost of these materials has dropped dramatically since their widespread adoption in the aerospace industry and by the military.

In particular, FRP rods are useful for structures where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, [[MRI]] machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require [[non-magnetic]] buildings. Again, [[toll booths]] that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to [[radio waves]]. Also, where the [[design life]] of the concrete structure is more important than its initial costs, non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of reinforcing steel is a major cause of failure. In such situations corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the [[intertidal zone]]. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where it is likely that the concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of [[Balcony|balconies]] when [[balustrade]]s are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the floor structure is likely to be many times the service life of the [[waterproofing]] building membrane.

Plastic reinforcement often is [[Strength of materials|stronger]], or at least has a better [[Specific strength|strength to weight ratio]] than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective [[concrete cover]] as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50&amp;nbsp;mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the [[whole-life cost]] will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.

The [[material properties]] of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, so there are differences in the design considerations. FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that [[Deflection (engineering)|deflections]] are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an [[Deformation (engineering)|elastic deformability]] comparable to the plastic deformability (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly water-tightness will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than steel rebar, and accordingly require different design approaches for [[reinforced concrete column]]s.

One drawback to the use of FRP reinforcement is their limited fire resistance. Where fire safety is a consideration, structures employing FRP have to maintain their strength and the anchoring of the forces at temperatures to be expected in the event of fire. For purposes of [[fireproofing]], an adequate thickness of cement concrete cover or protective cladding is necessary. The addition of 1&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of polypropylene fibers to concrete has been shown to reduce [[spall]]ing during a simulated fire.&lt;ref name="tunnel"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/files/project/3372/Airside_Road_Tunnel.pdf |page=645 |title=Proceedings of the Rapid Excavation &amp; Tunneling Conference, New Orleans, June 2003 |chapter=Chapter 57: The Airside Road Tunnel, Heathrow Airport, England |author= Arthur W.

Darby, A., The Airside Road Tunnel, Heathrow Airport, England,

Another problem is the effectiveness of shear reinforcement. FRP [[rebar]] stirrups formed by bending before hardening generally perform relatively poorly in comparison to steel stirrups or to structures with straight fibres. When strained, the zone between the straight and curved regions are subject to strong bending, shear, and longitudinal stresses. Special design techniques are necessary to deal with such problems.

There is growing interest in applying external reinforcement to existing structures using advanced materials such as composite (fiberglass, basalt, carbon) rebar, which can impart exceptional strength. Worldwide, there are a number of brands of composite rebar recognized by different countries, such as Aslan, DACOT, V-rod, and ComBar. The number of projects using composite rebar increases day by day around the world, in countries ranging from USA, Russia, and South Korea to Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33799">'''Mythology''' is the [[myth and ritual|main component]] of '''Religion'''. It refers to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the [[supernatural]] or [[sacred]]. Religion is the broader term, besides mythological system, it includes [[ritual]]. A given [[mythology]] is almost always associated with a certain religion such as [[Greek mythology]] with [[Ancient Greek religion]]. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a [[legend]] or [[Folklore|folktale]]. 

There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

==Introduction==
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
The relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of "myth" one uses. By [[Robert Graves]]'s definition, a religion's [[Traditional story|traditional stories]] are "myths" if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal's definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all [[Narrative|stories]] are myths. By the [[Folklore studies|folklorists]]' definition, all myths are religious (or "sacred") stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]] (e.g., the stories in the [[Book of Genesis]]) are myths; however, some religious stories that don't explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of famous [[saint]]s) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=KERYGMA AND MYTH by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics edited by Hans Werner Bartsch |last=Bultmann |first=Rudolf |year=2005 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |url=https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/the-mythological-element-in-the-message-of-the-new-testament-and-the-problem-of-its-re-interpretation-part-i/ |page=21}}: "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=315}}: religious traditions are, essentially, mythic traditions}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=144-145}}: "At the core of every religious tradition there is found a narrative vision, a myth unifying ultimate reality and value, a story that is expressed, transmitted, and revitalized by a variety of ancillary strategies."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction, xi}}: "Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers — narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics — and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Gieysztor|1982|p=5}}: "Przez mitologię, stanowiącą część główną religii, rozumiemy system personifikacji, alegorii i symboliki, które wyrażały stosunek człowieka do świata. "}} For example, in the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levack |first1=Brian P. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=48-49 |isbn=0-19-515669-2 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' provides the following summary and examples:{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction}}{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Religion and Myth}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers—narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics—and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems. […] It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;difficult to believe that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|conceived in a dream by a white elephant]], so we call that story a myth as well. But, of course, stories such as the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Sea of Reeds]] for the fleeing [[Israelites|Hebrews]], [[Muhammad]]’s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], and the dead [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus rising from the tomb]] are just as clearly [[Irrationality|irrational]] narratives to which a [[Hindu]] or a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] might understandably apply the word “myth.” All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of [[reality]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most definitions of "myth" limit myths to stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5. See Buxton, p. 18: "There are three elements in [my] definition [of mythology]. '''The least problematic''' is the notion of ''story'': a 'myth' is a narrative, a set of events structured into a sequence". (Bolding added)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.
===Theology and myth===
The term [[theology]] for the first time appears in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica |title=Theology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818084404/https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of “believers” to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hege |first=Brent A. R.|title=Myth, History, and the Resurrection in German Protestant Theology |year=2017 |p=132 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=SSA6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutically]], theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the [[Bible|biblical texts]]. [[Dogma|Dogmatically]], theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion===
''[[Religion]]'' is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or [[Divinity|divine]], and the [[moral code]]s, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a [[deity]] or higher being, [[eschatology]], practices of [[worship]], practices of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. Some religions do not include all these features. For instance, belief in a deity is not essential to [[Buddhism]].

===Mythology===
The term ''[[mythology]]'' usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mythology", ''OED'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word "myth" itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:
* 2007: According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary, "Myth: "1 a: a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the [[world view]] of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon. b: [[Parable]], [[Allegory]]. 2 a: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone; especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of [[society]]. 2b: an unfounded or false notion. 3: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence. 4: the whole body of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Myth", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:

* 1968: The [[classicist]] [[Robert Graves]] defines myths as "whatever religious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student's experience that he cannot believe them to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1968, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973: Another classicist, GS Kirk, rejects the notion that all myths are religious or sacred. In the category of "myth", he includes many legendary accounts that are "[[Secularity|secular]]" for all practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk 1973, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: [[Folklorist]]s define a myth as "a sacred [[narrative]] explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form".&lt;ref&gt;Dundes 1997, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: In religious studies, the word "myth" is usually reserved for stories whose main characters are gods or [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: The classicist Richard Buxton defines a myth as "a socially powerful traditional story".&lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: Robert A. Segal, professor of theories of religion at the [[Lancaster University]], defines "myth" broadly as any story whose "main figures [are] personalities -- divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Plato's Good."&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"/&gt;

==Similarities between different religious mythologies==

Given any of the above definitions of "myth", the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:
* an initial [[Paradise]] preceding ordinary historical time&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the story of a god who undergoes death and resurrection ([[life-death-rebirth deity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/weekly/aa052902a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paganlibrary.com/reference/pagan_resurrection_myths.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mythical geography of many religions involves an ''[[axis mundi]]'', or Cosmic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader'', 1976, pp. 372-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many myths feature a global flood.&lt;ref&gt;For some examples, see Bierlein 2004, pp. 121-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Creation myth]]s
* [[Supreme deity (disambiguation)|Supreme deity]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;
* [[Hero's journey]]

The similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.

==Contrasts between different religious mythologies==

Though there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing [[creation myth|agency]] to one or more [[deities]] or other [[supernatural]] forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance,  the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[parable of the arrow]] warns against such speculations as "[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?", viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"The Parable of the Arrow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic views==
In [[academia]], the term "myth" often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 1, 8-10; ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories "mythology", leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism'', English professor Howard Schwartz writes, "the definition of 'mythology' offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;See Armstrong, pp. 122-27. For example, an 18th century intellectual movement called [[deism]] rejected myths about divine intervention, limiting God's role to that of a first cause (Robinson), and a 20th century movement led by the theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] sought to "demythologize" Christianity, reinterpreting its myths as psychological allegory (Segal, pp. 47-51; Muthuraj). Some 19th and early 20th century secular scholars predicted that science would replace myth, even in religion. The anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] argued that science was pushing traditional mythology out of religion, which would henceforth consist only of metaphysics and ethics (Segal, p. 14). And the anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] even wrote, "In the last analysis, magic, religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis" (Frazer, p. 712).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"&gt;Muthuraj&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of "the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a 'supernaturalistic' worldview". He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church's ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, "Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God". [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for "Religionless Christianity".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]], a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;According to religious thought, said Eliade, myths establish models for human behavior, and "the more religious man is, the more paradigmatic models does he possess as a guide to his attitudes and actions" (Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 100). Eliade believed that modern novels, ideologies, customs, and pastimes contain "mythological elements" (Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 181-93), and that some mythological elements fall within the "transconscious", which Eliade defined as a set of universal human images, symbols, and sentiments (Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 16-17).&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Eliade wrote about "sky and sky gods" when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the "death of God" theology. He spoke of "God up there" when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Joseph Campbell]] believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Campbell claimed that mythology's primary function is "that of eliciting and supporting a sense of awe before the mystery of being" (Campbell, p. 519), and that mythology also serves "to initiate the individual into the order of realities of his own psyche" (Campbell, p. 521).&lt;/ref&gt; In responding to the interview question "How would you define mythology?", Joseph Campbell answered:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Thou Are That, p. 111 [in:] James W. Menzies, True Myth, s. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious views==
Most religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and "true" but also historically accurate and [[revelation|divinely revealed]] and that calling such stories "myths" disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.

===Opposition to categorizing all sacred stories as myths===
====Modern-day opposition====
Some religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as "myth". Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] Father [[John Hardon|John A. Hardon]] insists that "Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious."&lt;ref&gt;Hardon&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian theologian [[Carl F. H. Henry]] insisted that "Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth".&lt;ref&gt;Carl F. H. Henry, quoted by Mohler&lt;/ref&gt;

====The roots of the popular meaning of "myth"====
Especially within Christianity, objection to the word "myth" rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term "myth" (Greek ''muthos'') to mean "fable, fiction, lie"; as a result, the early Christian theologians used "myth" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 1968, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word "myth" is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression "Christian mythology", as used in academic discourse,&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse. A myth, in this latter sense of the word, is a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture .... Using the original Greek term ''mythos'' is perhaps a better way to distinguish this more positive and all-encompassing definition of the word.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may offend Christians for this reason.

In addition, this early Christian use of the term "myth" passed into popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when essential [[sacred mysteries]] and teachings are described as ''myth'', in modern English, the word often still implies that it is "idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; This description could be taken as a direct attack on [[religious belief]], quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though "myth" usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes "falsehood", as in the "[[Christ myth theory]]". The original term "[[mythos]]" (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt;

===Non-opposition to categorizing sacred stories as myths===
Modern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion's sacred stories as "myths". They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.

====Christianity====
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s love of myths and devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith came together in his assertion that [[mythology]] is the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien wrote that myths held "fundamental things".&lt;ref&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed these beliefs in his poem ''[[Mythopoeia]]'' circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of "sub-creation" within God's primary creation.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''Mythopoeia'', circa 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem in part says creation is "myth-woven and elf-patterned":

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... There is no [[firmament]],
only a void, unless a jewelled tent
myth-woven and [[elf]]-patterned; and no earth,
unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.&lt;/poem&gt;|JRR Tolkien}}

Tolkien's opinion was adopted by another [[Christianity|Christian]] writer, [[C. S. Lewis]], in their conversations: "Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] freely called the Christ story a "true myth", and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,&lt;ref&gt;letter to Arthur Greeves, quoted by Brown&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father [[Andrew Greeley]], freely applies the term "myth" to Christianity. In his book ''Myths of Religion'', he defends this terminology:&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, ''Myths of Religion''; quoted in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a "Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition
and the Natural Sciences" in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites.&lt;ref name="Bratcher"&gt;Bratcher&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the "mythopoetic" use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:&lt;ref name="Bratcher"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "myth" as used here does not mean "false" or "fiction." Even in my old and yellowed Webster's, "fiction" is the ''third'' meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning "myth" refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Judaism====
Some [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars, including [[Dov Noy]], a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and [[Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)|Howard Schwartz]], Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as "mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Schram&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz authored the book ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism''. It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxv&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Schwartz states that the word "myth", as used in the book, "is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"/&gt;

====Neopaganism====
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] frequently refer to their sacred stories as "myths". [[Asatru]], a modern-day revival of Germanic Paganism, holds "that the [[Eddas]], Myths and [[saga|Norse Sagas]] are the divinely inspired wisdom of [its] religion".&lt;ref&gt;"About Us"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wicca]], another Neopagan movement, also applies the term "mythology" to its stories.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wheel of the Year / the Sabbats"; "What is Wicca?"; "Workshops and Talks"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Root hair curling''' is the process by which the [[root hair]]s of [[legume]] plants curl around bacteria to allow an infection into the cortical cells of the roots to form a [[nitrogen fixing]] nodule.

Legume plants, just like all plants, need nitrogen in order to grow.  Legumes include plants such as alfalfa, beans, peanuts, and lentils.  Nitrogen is available in excess in the air, but it that form is not actually usable by plants.  The gaseous form (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) must be reduced to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in a process known as [[nitrogen fixation]].&lt;ref name="Wagner_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner SC | date = 2011 | title = Biological Nitrogen Fixation | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | page = 15 | url = https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/biological-nitrogen-fixation-23570419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This nitrogen fixation can occur in many ways, including bacterial symbiosis, adding ammonia-based fertilizer to the soil and ammonia accumulation from decaying matter. The problem is that plant cannot fix nitrogen with their own processes, so they use bacterial [[Symbiosis|symbioses]].&lt;ref name="Wagner_2011" /&gt;  Different plants associate with different bacteria, but legume plants symbiose with ''[[Rhizobium]]'' bacteria.  These bacteria associate with the roots of the plant, since that is where plants take up nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barber SA, Walker JM, Vasey EH | title = Mechanisms for movement of plant nutrients from soil and fertilizer to plant root. | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | date = May 1963 | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–7 | doi = 10.1021/jf60127a017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process by which legumes associate with ''Rhizobium'' includes many proteins and chemicals.  First of all, the legume root itself will release flavonoids in order to attract ''Rhizobium'' to itself. Flavonoids will also activate specific genes in the bacteria that initiate nodule formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eckardt NA | title = The Role of Flavonoids in Root Nodule Development and Auxin Transport in Medicago truncatula | journal = The Plant Cell | date = June 2006 | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1539–1540 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.106.044768 | pmc = 1488913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These genes are called ''nod'' genes, and they excrete [[Nod factor|''nod'' factors]].&lt;ref name="Esseling_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esseling JJ, Lhuissier FG, Emons AM | title = Nod factor-induced root hair curling: continuous polar growth towards the point of nod factor application | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 132 | issue = 4 | pages = 1982–8 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12913154 | pmc = 181283 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.021634 | url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/132/4/1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ''nod'' factors initiate the actual curling of the root.  The curling begins with the very tip of the root hair curling around the ''Rhizobium''.  Within the root tip, a small tube called the infection thread forms, which provides a pathway for the ''Rhizobium'' to travel into the root epidermal cells as the root hair continues to curl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Joan | last1 = Slonczewski | first2 = John Watkins | last2 = Foster | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951925510 | title = Microbiology: An Evolving Science | isbn = 0393614034 | edition = Fourth | location = New York | oclc = 951925510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial curling can even be by ''nod'' factor alone.&lt;ref name="Esseling_2003" /&gt;  An experiment by Esseling et. al. demonstrated this.  These experimenters isolated ''nod'' factor and applied the chemical at specific points on the root hair. The root hairs curled in the direction of the application, demonstrating the action of a root hair that is attempting to curl around a bacterium.  Even application on lateral roots caused curling.  This demonstrated that the ''nod'' factor, not the bacterium itself, causes the stimulation of the curling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14261">'''Science by press conference''' (or '''science by press release''') is the practice by which scientists put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="techreview1989"&gt;Jerome F (1989). Science by press conference. ''[[Technology Review]]'' July 1989, No. 92, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disparagingly.&lt;ref name="hall2004"&gt;Hall, Stephen S. (2004). ''Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|978-0-618-49221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to associate the target with people promoting scientific "findings" of questionable scientific merit who turn to the media for attention when they are unlikely to win the approval of the professional scientific community.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to [[independent review]] with a "thorough examination by the scientific community" before they are widely publicized.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; The standard practice is to publish a paper in a [[peer-review]]ed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-[[attention seeking]] way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== History of the term ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at [[Stanford University Medical School]], in a 1980 letter which appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="Andreopoulos1980"&gt;Andreopoulos Spyros  (March 27, 1980). Gene Cloning by Press Conference. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 1980; 302:743–746&lt;/ref&gt; Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of [[biotechnology]] startups, including [[Biogen]] and [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=Merchants of immortality: chasing the dream of human life extension |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-49221-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]] which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.&lt;ref name="angell1991"&gt;Angell, Marcia and Kassirer, Jerome P. (November 7, 1991). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199111073251910 The Ingelfinger Rule Revisited.] ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable examples of science by press conference ===

* In 1989, chemists [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved [[cold fusion]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilford1989"&gt;Wilford, John Noble (April 24, 1989). [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0716FE38580C778EDDAD0894D1484D81 Fusion Furor: Science's Human Face.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; (Highlighting the complexity of defining the term, Pons and Fleischman technically had an accepted paper in press at a peer-reviewed journal at the time of their press conference, though that was not widely acknowledged at the time and the quality of the paper and its review were subsequently criticized.&lt;ref name="Lewenstein1992"&gt;Lewenstein, Bruce V. (1992). Cold Fusion and Hot History. Osiris, 2nd series, 7, 135–163.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* In 1998, [[Andrew Wakefield]] held a press conference to claim that the [[MMR vaccine]] caused [[autism]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; In January 2011, an article by [[Brian Deer]] and its accompanying editorial in ''[[BMJ]]'' identified Wakefield's work as an "elaborate fraud".&lt;ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume=  342|title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRWakefield&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132692497/journal-study-linking-vaccine-to-autism-was-fraud |publisher=NPR | agency= Associated Press |title= Study linking vaccine to autism was fraud  |date= 2011-01-05 |accessdate= 2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='discredited'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7012267.ece |title=Lancet journal retracts Andrew Wakefield MMR scare paper |author=Rose, David |date=2010-02-03 |work=Times Online |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nGfAGGJ9?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7012267.ece |archivedate=2010-02-03 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, a group called [[Clonaid]] held a press conference to announce they had successfully achieved [[human cloning]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;
* In 2005, the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences (ERF) reported their findings from testing [[aspartame]] on rats. Their studies were widely criticized and later discounted.&lt;ref name=Lofstedt&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lofstedt | first = Ragnar | authorlink = Ragnar Löfstedt | title = Risk communication, media amplification and the aspartame scare| journal = Risk Management | volume = 10  | issue = 4 | pages = 257–284 | date = Oct 2008 | doi = 10.1057/rm.2008.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2012, [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]] held a press conference to claim that [[genetically modified food]] caused terrible cancers in rats, on the eve of the publication of a scientific paper, a book publication, and a movie release, and in the runup to the vote on the GM food labeling initiative, [[California Proposition 37]].  As the [[Séralini affair]] unfolded, it was revealed that Séralini required journalists to sign [[confidentiality agreements]] in order to receive pre-prints of the paper, to prevent them from discussing the paper with independent scientists.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/490158a |title=Hyped GM maize study faces growing scrutiny |year=2012 |last1=Butler |first1=Declan |journal=Nature |volume=490 |issue=7419 |pages=158 |pmid=23060167|bibcode = 2012Natur.490..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientific paper was retracted in 2013.&lt;ref name=Elsevier2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Announces Article Retraction from Journal Food and Chemical Toxicology|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases became notorious examples of "science by press conference" precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later either rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==
[[File:201609 KDGS nr28.jpg|thumb|Martina Franzen on a German congress of sociology, 2016]]
Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences.&lt;ref name=Winsten&gt;{{cite journal |author=J A Winsten |title=Science and the media: the boundaries of truth |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |year=1985 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.4.1.5 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/5.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to "avoid losing credit" for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market like opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. [[Biotechnology]] companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name="angell1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

In recent years, sociologists of science have recast discussion about "science by press conference". They point to the increasing presence of media conversation across all aspects of culture, and argue that science is subject to many of the same social forces as other aspects of culture. They have described the increased "medialization" of science, and suggest that both science and society are changed by this process.&lt;ref name="Rödder"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Simone |editor1-last=Rödder |editor2-first=Martina |editor2-last=Franzen |editor3-first=Peter |editor3-last=Weingart |title=The sciences' media connection : public communication and its repercussions |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht/New York |isbn=9789400720848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation; the fact that they often do not can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

A common example of science by press conference occurs when the media report that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, like [[HIV]] treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of [[AIDS]] [[activism]] in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists' ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase "science by press conference". [[AIDS denialist]] groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and [[AIDS]] research, particularly [[Robert Gallo]]'s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalichman, Seth C. |title=Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-387-79475-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Science+by+press+conference%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Science%20by%20press%20conference%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |doi= |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the [[SARS]] outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons.

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase "science by press conference".&lt;ref name="pmid18165635"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox RA, Djulbegovic B, Moffitt HL, Guyatt GH, Montori VM |title=Randomized trials in oncology stopped early for benefit |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=18–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18165635 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6259 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term "science by press conference" does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===
{{Main|Video game writing}}
With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E.

Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">A '''signomial''' is an algebraic [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one or more independent variables.  It is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multi-dimensional [[polynomial]]s—an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers (rather than just non-negative integers) while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive (so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered).

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector of real, positive numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)^T&lt;/math&gt;

Then a signomial function has the form

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^M \left(c_i \prod_{j=1}^n x_j^{a_{ij}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; and the exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers.  Signomials are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scaling.

If we restrict all &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to be positive, then the function f is a [[posynomial]]. Consequently, each signomial is either a posynomial, the negative of a posynomial, or the difference of two posynomials.  If, in addition, all exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are  non-negative integers, then the signomial becomes a [[polynomial]] whose domain is the positive [[orthant]].

For example, 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2.7 x_1^2x_2^{-1/3}x_3^{0.7} - 2x_1^{-4}x_3^{2/5}&lt;/math&gt;

is a signomial. 

The term "signomial" was introduced by Richard J. Duffin and Elmor L. Peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization—published in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A recent introductory exposition involves [[optimization problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maranas and C. Floudas, ''Global optimization in generalized geometric programming'', pp. 351–370, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[nonlinear optimization]] problems with [[constrained optimization|constraints]] and/or [[objective function|objectives]] defined by signomials are normally harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials (because, unlike posynomials, signomials are not guaranteed to be [[convex set|globally convex]]), signomial  optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of real-world nonlinear optimization problems.

'''Sky islands''' are isolated mountains surrounded by radically different lowland environments. The term originally referred to those found near the southern borders of Arizona and New Mexico, and has extended to similarly isolated high-altitude forests. The isolation has significant implications for these natural habitats. The [[American Southwest]] region began warming up between ∼20,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years BP and atmospheric temperatures increased substantially, resulting in the formation of vast deserts that isolated the Sky Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Favé |first=M., Johnson |date=2015 |title=Past climate change on Sky Islands drives novelty in a core developmental gene network and its phenotype |url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Past+climate+change+on+Sky+Islands+drives+novelty+in+a+core+developmental+gene+network+and+its+phenotype&amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+evolutionary+biology&amp;rft.au=Fav%C3%A9%2C+Marie-Julie&amp;rft.au=Johnson%2C+Robert+A&amp;rft.au=Cover%2C+Stefan&amp;rft.au=Handschuh%2C+Stephan&amp;rft.date=2015&amp;rft.eissn=1471-2148&amp;rft.volume=15&amp;rft.spage=183&amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F26338531&amp;rft.externalDocID=26338531&amp;paramdict=en-US |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=15 |page=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Endemism]], [[altitudinal migration]], and [[relict]] populations are some of the natural phenomena to be found on sky islands.

The complex dynamics of [[species richness]] on sky islands draws attention from the discipline of [[biogeography]], and likewise the [[biodiversity]] is of concern to [[conservation biology]]. One of the key elements of a sky island is separation by physical distance from the other mountain ranges, resulting in a habitat island, such as a forest surrounded by desert.

Some sky islands serve as [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for boreal species stranded by warming climates since the [[last glacial period]]. In other cases, localized populations of plants and animals tend towards [[speciation]], similar to oceanic islands such as the [[Galápagos Islands]] of [[Ecuador]].

==Origin of the term==
The sky island concept originated in 1943 when Natt N. Dodge, in an article in ''Arizona Highways'' magazine, referred to the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] in southeastern Arizona as a "mountain island in a desert sea".&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In about the same era, the term was used to refer to high alpine, unglaciated, ancient topographic landform surfaces on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, California. 
&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularized by nature writer Weldon Heald, a resident of southeastern Arizona. In his 1967 book, ''Sky Island'', he demonstrated the concept by describing a drive from the town of [[Rodeo, New Mexico]], in the western [[Chihuahuan desert]], to a peak in the Chiricahua Mountains, {{convert|35|miles|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} away and {{convert|5600|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} higher in elevation. Ascending from the hot, arid desert, to grasslands, then to oak-pine woodland, pine forest, and finally to spruce-fir-aspen forest. His book mentions the concept of [[biome]], but prefers the terminology of [[life zone]]s, and makes reference to the work of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]]. The book also describes the wildlife and living conditions of the Chiricahuas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Characteristics==
The [[Madrean sky islands]] are probably the most studied sky islands in the world. Found in the U.S. states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] and the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], these numerous mountains form links in a chain connecting the northern end of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the southern [[Colorado Plateau]]. Sky Islands of the central and northern mountains in the United States are often called [[island range]]s, especially by populations within view of such islands of mountains surrounded by plains such as those found within the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]].

[[File:Catalina Mountains elev7000.JPG|thumb|left|View from above {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]], showing pines and snow in the foreground and desert beyond]]
Some more northerly examples are the [[Crazy Mountains]], [[Castle Mountains (Montana)|Castle Mountains]], [[Bears Paw Mountains]], [[Highwood Mountains]], and [[Little Rocky Mountains]], all in the US state of [[Montana]].  Each of these ranges is forested and has tundra and snowpack above treeline, but is not connected to any other range by forested ridges; the ranges are completely surrounded by treeless prairie and/or semi-arid scrubland below.  Other well-known sky islands of North America are the [[Great Basin]] montane forests, such as the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] in California, and the [[Spring Mountains]] near Las Vegas, [[Nevada]]. One of the unique aspects of the sky islands of the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] region is the mix of floristic affinities, that is, the trees and plants of higher elevations are more characteristic of northern latitudes, while the flora of the lower elevations has ties to the desert and the mountains further south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some montane species apparently evolved within their current range, adapting to their local environment, such as the [[Mount Lyell shrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These bears historically made use of the forests and meadows found in the Madrean sky islands, as well as lower-elevation habitats such as [[riparian zone]]s. (Grizzlies were extirpated from the region in the 20th century.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These birds live in high elevations when free of snow, and instead of migrating south for the winter, they migrate ''down''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Confusing the matter somewhat is the potential for an archipelago of sky islands or even the valleys between them to act not only as a barrier to [[biological dispersal]], but also as a path for migration. Examples of birds and mammals making use of the Madrean archipelago to extend their ranges northward are the [[elegant trogon]] and [[white-nosed coati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

__NOTOC__
A '''tension-leg platform''' (TLP) or '''extended tension leg platform''' (ETLP) is a vertically [[geotechnical engineering#Floating-moored structures|moored floating structure]] normally used for the offshore production of [[crude oil|oil]] or [[natural gas|gas]], and is particularly suited for water depths greater than 300 metres (about 1000&amp;nbsp;ft) and less than 1500 metres (about 4900&amp;nbsp;ft). Use of tension-leg platforms has also been proposed for wind turbines.

The platform is permanently moored by means of tethers or tendons grouped at each of the structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively high [[Axis of rotation|axial]] [[stiffness]] (low [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), such that virtually all vertical motion of the platform is eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production [[wellhead]]s on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the [[seafloor]]. This allows a simpler [[well completion]] and gives better control over the production from the [[Petroleum|oil]] or [[gas]] [[oil reservoir|reservoir]], and easier access for downhole intervention operations.

TLPs have been in use since the early 1980s. The first tension leg platform&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT&gt;[http://everything.but.architecture.pagesperso-orange.fr/Oilrig/oilrig.htm Reconversion d’une plate-forme offshore]&lt;/ref&gt; was built for Conoco's [[Hutton oilfield|Hutton field]] in the North Sea in the early 1980s. The hull was built in the dry-dock at Highland Fabricator's Nigg yard in the north of Scotland, with the deck section built nearby at McDermott's yard at Ardersier. The two parts were mated in the Moray Firth in 1984.

The Hutton TLP was originally designed for a service life of 25 years in Nord Sea depth of 100 to 1000 metres. It had 16 tension legs. Its weight varied between 46,500 and 55,000 tons when moored to the seabed, but up to 61,580 tons when floating freely.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; The total area of its living quarters was about 3,500 square metres and accommodated over a 100 cabins though only 40 people were necessary to maintain the structure in place.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt;

The hull of the Hutton TLP has been separated from the topsides. Topsides have been redeployed to the [[Prirazlomnoye field]] in the Barents Sea, while the hull was reportedly sold to a project in the Gulf of Mexico (although the hull has been moored in Cromarty Firth since 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilrig-photos.com/picture/number1709.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger TLPs will normally have a full drilling rig on the platform with which to drill and intervene on the wells. The smaller TLPs may have a workover rig, or in a few cases no production wellheads located on the platform at all.

==Use for wind turbines==
Although the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] explored the concept of TLPs for [[Floating wind turbine|offshore wind turbines]] in September 2006, architects had studied the idea as early as 2003.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; Earlier offshore wind turbines cost more to produce, stood on towers dug deep into the ocean floor, were only possible in depths of at most {{convert|50|ft|m}}, and generated 1.5 megawatts for onshore units and 3.5 megawatts for conventional offshore setups. In contrast, TLP installation was calculated to cost a third as much. TLPs float, and researchers estimate they can operate in depths between 100 and {{convert|650|ft|m}} and farther away from land, and they can generate 5.0 megawatts.&lt;ref name=FLOW&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060918_floating_windmills.html Floating Ocean Windmills Designed to Generate More Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer simulation]]s project that in a [[hurricane]] TLPs would shift 0.9 m to 1.8 m and the turbine blades would cycle above wave peaks. MIT and NREL researchers say dampers could be used to reduce motion in the event of a [[natural disaster]].&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

MIT and NREL researchers plan to install a half-scale prototype south of [[Cape Cod]]. Sclavounos said, "We'd have a little unit sitting out there to show that this thing can float and behave the way we're saying it will."&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Occult World''''' is a book originally published in 1881 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}} It was the first [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work by the author; according to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], this book "gave sensational publicity to [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] [[Paranormal|phenomena]]" and the [[Mahatma Letters|letters]] from the [[mahatma]]s, and drew the attention of the London [[Society for Psychical Research]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Kuhn]] wrote that this book by Sinnett "was the first direct statement to the West of the existence of the [[mahatma|Masters]] and their activity as sponsors for the Theosophical Society." In his opinion, the author convincingly took over the major objective of confirming the "surpassing knowledge and sublime wisdom" of these "supermen."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=151}}}}

== History of compilation and publication ==
In September and October 1880 [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] visited Sinnett at [[Simla]].{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky had been in sincere friendship with Sinnett and his wife Patience.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett expressed serious interest in the work and teachings of the Theosophical Society, and it prompted Blavatsky help him into contact and correspondence with two [[adept]]s who sponsored the Society, the mahatmas [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} He was able to gather the material for his first theosophical book, which was based mostly on his notes of Blavatsky's [[occult]] work, and which "made her name widely known, though it contained nothing from her pen."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}

In the second half of 1880, Anglo-Indian newspaper [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']] published several individual and collective reports of witnesses of Blavatsky's occult phenomena, in particular on 7 November 1880 a report which was written by Sinnett himself.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. V}} In 1881, he incorporated these reports into his book. In February 1881 Kuthumi, writing that he is interested in Sinnett's book and its success, gave permission to use his letters: "I lay no restrictions upon your making use of anything I may have written to you..., having full confidence in your tact and judgment as to what should be printed and how it should be presented."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}} In March 1881 the Sinnetts went on vacation to England, expecting to find a publisher for ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=18}}{{refn|group=note|1 March 1881 Kuthumi wished Sinnett to return from Europe "with a good book" in his hand.{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 107}}}} The book was published in June 1881 during the author's stay in London. In July 1881 Sinnett returned to India, and on the next day after the arrival he received a letter in which Kuthumi congratulated him on the publication.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=19}} Kuthumi wrote: "When the first hum and ding-dong of adverse criticism is hushed, thoughtful men will read and ponder over the book."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 9}}

The book is dedicated by author "to '''the Mahatma [[Koot Hoomi]]''' whose gracious friendship has given the present writer his title to claim the attention of the European world."{{sfn|Sinnett|1895}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=90}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
The book begins with the author's allegation that there is a school of thought which modern culture has forgotten, and that the metaphysics, and to a large degree the present physical science, "have been groping for centuries blindly after knowledge which occult philosophy has enjoyed in full measure all the while." Sinnett takes the liberty to express his belief that his knowledge is certainly true.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=152}} He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have come into some contact with persons who are heirs of a greater knowledge concerning the mysteries of Nature and humanity than modern culture has yet evolved... Modern science has accomplished grand results by the open method of investigation, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel... But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=2–4|Kuhn|1992|2p=152}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sinnett explains that "the ultimate development" of an occultist requires him to comply with "absolute physical purity." The candidate is obliged from the beginning to provide evidence that he is willing to comply with this requirement. Throughout the trial period, he should observe complete celibacy, and to refrain from all physical pleasures. However, this way of life does not presuppose any particular rigid discipline or hard asceticism, or "withdrawal from the world."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in ordinary society from being in some of the preliminary stages of training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the sublime achievement of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakir, the ''[[yogi]]'' of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumulates with his sanctity—of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=26–27|Kuhn|1992|2pp=153–154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult correspondence ===
On 29 September 1880 during an evening walk with Mrs. Sinnett, Blavatsky, responding to the suddenly expressed desire of her companion to get a little note from one of the [[Mahatma|"Brothers"]], tore off a corner of a letter received that day, and held it in her hand until it disappeared. Then Blavatsky asked her to specify where there should be a note. Mrs. Sinnett pointed to a tree, and then among its branches, she found the same corner of the paper, but now it contained a brief message written in English and signed in Tibetan symbols.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=61–63|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{sfn|Olcott|2011|pp=231–232}}&lt;br/&gt;According to Barborka, this note was the first message of the mahatmas, which had come in response to an oral request, and after it Sinnett decided to write his first letter to the "Unknown Brother."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{refn|group=note|This note is stored in the department of rare manuscripts of the [[British Library]]. Barborka wrote: "The folds of the paper and holes made when the note was pinned onto the twig are clearly visible."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=18}}}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it 'to the Unknown Brother', and gave it to her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=92–93|Barborka|1973|2p=59}}{{refn|group=note|[[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} Kuhn wrote: "Sinnett was the channel of transmission, and to him the two Masters sent a long series of letters on philosophical and other subjects, they themselves remaining in the background."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult phenomena ===
During Blavatsky's first visit to the Sinnetts' house at [[Allahabad]], they were able to observe, in addition to the raps, one more phenomenon. For a few days they had gone with their guest to Benares, where they had settled at a house which had been lent by the maharaja of Vizianagaram. One evening after dinner, they sat in the great hall of the house. "Suddenly three or four flowers – cut roses – fell" right between them.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1p=51|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that the many theosophical phenomena can be found in a book by Sinnett ''The Occult World,'' which mentions the following things: "knocking at will, tingling of invisible bells, the carrying and 'materialization' of all sorts of objects, and above all, 'precipitation' of letters sent by 'astral' means."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}}}

At Simla a picnic was planned, and a group of six men had intended to go into the forest. The supplies were designed for six men, but a seventh person suddenly joined the group. In preparation for the midday meal, the lack of a coffee cup and saucer was revealed. Someone jestingly suggested to Blavatsky to materialize the additional cup. Blavatsky held a "mental conversation" with one of her outlying "Brothers" and then pointed to a specific place, overgrown with grass and bushes. One of the participants began to dig there with a knife. After some time a white object was found, which was a tea-cup, and near it was a saucer, and as such they were no different from the other six cups and saucers brought from the Sinnetts' house. Plant roots around the utensils were found intact, and it has reportedly been proved that no one pre-dug there. When Mrs. Sinnett reached the house she counted the cups and saucers of this design and found one extra cup and saucer. However, it was impossible to buy such utensils at Simla.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=66–68|Kuhn|1992|2pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|Olcott stated about the phenomenon with a tea-cup: "To complete this part of my narrative, I will state that Mrs. Sinnett and I, reaching the house first, on the return of our party, went straight to the butler's pantry, and found the three other cups of the nine which she had left of the original dozen, put away on an upper shelf with their handles broken, and otherwise dilapidated. The seventh cup produced at the picnic had, therefore, not formed pan {{sic}} of her broken set."{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|It should be noted that Sinnett's reports on Blavatsky's phenomena at Simla "were the cause of much of the misunderstanding and suffering she had to endure for the rest of her life."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}} Nonetheless, [[Manly Palmer Hall|Hall]] stated: "Madam Blavatsky's greatest 'miracles' are her books, and by her writings she is elevated far beyond the reach of her calumniators. Her literary accomplishments and not materialized tea-cups are the hallmark of her genius."{{sfn|Hall|1931|p=92}}}}&lt;br/&gt; This outing had one more event, when it turned out that they could not make coffee because all the water bottles were empty, and the water in the nearest stream was dirty. Their servants, sent to the brewery, were unable to get water. Then Blavatsky put the empty bottle into one of the baskets, and then pulled it out, already filled with clean water.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=73–74|Kuhn|1992|2p=82}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|The major disciple of Kuthumi known as the [[Djwal Khul|"Disinherited"]] made a postscript to the letter of his Master: "The bottle filled with water I filled with my own hand—was one of the four only that the servants had in the baskets."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}}}}

During another outing occurred the "incident with pillow." Blavatsky turned to Sinnett with the question of where he would like to find a thing that Kuthumi is going to send. Sinnett decided to choose the most inconvenient place and pointed to one of several cushions, but at the insistence of his wife, he chose another. Once the firmly sewn pillow was ripped, they found among the feathers a note from Kuthumi and the brooch, which Mrs. Sinnett left at home.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=109–111|Kuhn|1992|2p=83}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. X}}{{refn|group=note|"The skilled occultist is able to shift his consciousness from one to another plane of manifestation. In short, his control over the vibrational energies of the [[Akasha]] makes him veritably lord of all the physical creation."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}}}}

"While the letters [from the mahatmas] are the most valuable portion of the book," the most likely cause of its widespread popularity was the occult phenomena described by the author, which he observed personally.{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}{{refn|group=note|Lavoie wrote that ''The Occult World'' contains a description of the various phenomena, which were performed by Blavatsky in the presence of the author.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=33}} [[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson]] noted that while staying in the author's home, Blavatsky "performed an astounding series of paranormal phenomena" which were reported in ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Johnson|1995|p=21}}}}

== Criticism ==
[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}} In the [[Hodgson Report]] Blavatsky's phenomena described in the book by Sinnett are discussed in a section "''The Occult World'' Phenomena".{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|pp=256–273}} At the end of this section, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Hodgson]] claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in ''The Occult World'' can be accounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance with those 'scientific modes of investigation' which he explicitly declares (''Occult World,'' p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task he attempted."{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|p=273}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] (with irony in relation to Sinnett) stated that from the analysis of the phenomena described in ''The Occult World'' in the Hodgson Report, "we can draw a conclusion: what a 'serious and honest' ''researcher'' we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern Theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}} Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, "a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by [[Vernon Harrison]] of the SPR effectively demolished... the conclusions of the Report."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=14}}{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Criticism}}

An American [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[Henry Kiddle]] addressed in 1883 in a London spiritualist magazine ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' letter to the editor,{{sfn|Neff|2003|loc=Ch. X}} in which he said that after reading Sinnett's book ''The Occult World,'' he was "very greatly surprised,"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}} when he discovered that one of Kuthumi's letters published in the book contains text which "was for the most part quite simply the copy of a lecture," which he made at Lake Pleasant 15 August 1880,{{sfnm|Guénon|2004|1p=40|Lavoie|2012|2p=253}} and published the same month in ''[[Banner of Light]].'' In this connection, Kiddle asked: "As Mr. Sinnett's book did not appear till a considerable time afterwards (about a year, I think), it is certain that I did not quote, consciously or unconsciously, from its pages. How, then, did it get into Kuthumi's mysterious letter?"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}}&lt;br/&gt;
According to Guénon, "the Professor Kiddle incident" was the first strike to hit the Theosophical Society overtly. He wrote that Sinnett has presented in the fourth edition of ''The Occult World'' "a rather awkward explanation," which came from Kuthumi himself.{{refn|group=note|In December 1883 Sinnett received from the mahatma a clarification on the matter,{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 93}} and it was published in an appendix to the fourth edition of ''The Occult World''.}} Kuthumi stated that what looked like plagiarism was due to the awkwardness and carelessness of a pupil. The "Master" was forced to admit that he was negligent when he allowed his letter to be sent without checking and correction.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=51}} He has written so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The letter in question was framed by me while on a journey and on horseback. It was dictated mentally in the direction of and precipitated by a young ''chela'' not yet expert at this branch of psychic chemistry, and who had to transcribe it from the hardly visible imprint. Half of it, therefore, was omitted, and the other half more or less distorted by the 'artist'. When asked by him at the time whether I would look over and correct it, I answered—imprudently, I confess—'Anyhow will do, my boy; it is of no great importance if you skip a few words.' I was physically very tired by a ride of forty-eight hours consecutively, and (physically again) half asleep. Besides this, I had very important business to attend to psychically, and therefore little remained of me to devote to that letter. When I awoke I found it had already been sent on, and as I was not then anticipating its publication, I never gave it from that time a thought... Yet had I dictated my letter in the form it now appears in print, it would certainly look suspicious, and however far from what is generally called plagiarism, yet in the absence of any inverted commas it would lay a foundation for censure. But I did nothing of the kind, as the original impression now before me clearly shows."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=212–213|Lavoie|2012|2p=254}}{{refn|group=note|"When a Mr. Henry Kiddle, an American lecturer on Spiritualism, accused the writer of the Mahatma Letters of having plagiarized whole passages from his lecture delivered at Mt. Pleasant, New York, in 1880, a year prior to the publication of ''The Occult World'', the Master [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] explained in a letter to Mr. Sinnett that the apparent forgery of words and ideas came about through a bit of carelessness on his part in the precipitation of his ideas through a chela. While dictating the letter to the latter, he had caught himself 'listening in' on Mr. Kiddle's address being delivered at the moment in America; and as a consequence the chela took down portions of the actual lecture as reflected from the mind of K.H."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=157}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Probability Broach''''' is a 1979 novel by American [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Neil Smith]]. It is set in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]], the so-called [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatin]] Universe, where a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] society has formed on the [[North American]] continent, styled the [[North American Confederacy]] (''NAC''). This history was created when the [[Declaration of Independence]] has the word ''unanimous'' added to the preamble, to read that governments "derive their just power from the ''unanimous'' [[consent of the governed]]".

==Plot summary==
Edward William "Win" Bear is a [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] who works for the [[Denver Police Department]] in a version of the [[United States]] in an alternate history of 1987 to be controlled by an anti-business, [[ecofascism|ecofascist]] faction complete with a new police force created in 1984 called the Federal Security Police (FSP, or "SecPol" as it is more commonly known) reminiscent of the [[Gestapo]]. [[Henry M. Jackson]] is [[President of the United States|president]], citizens' freedoms are very limited, and many laws and regulations have been passed. Examples include [[hoarding]] precious metals, such as silver and gold, is illegal and due to strict [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control policies]], only the police and citizens with federal permits are allowed to carry guns.

Bear is called to investigate the unusual murder of physicist Vaughn Meiss; he eventually finds himself projected into the [[North American Confederacy]] by means of the "Probability Broach", an inter-dimensional conduit originally developed as a means for [[interstellar travel]] in the North American Confederacy by a [[bottlenose dolphin]] physicist, named Ooloorie Eckickeck P'Wheet, and her human compatriot, Dr. Dora Jayne Thorens.

Win encounters his NAC counterpart, Edward William "Ed" Bear, and Ed's neighbors, most notably the "healer" Clarissa Olson and Lucy Kropotkin, who is later revealed to be 135 years old. Lucy's life becomes the vantage point by which Win is acclimated to life in the NAC and Laporte, the NAC equivalent to Denver. Win and Ed unravel the mystery of the Meiss murder and learn that he was killed to hide an effort by SecPol to conquer the NAC with the help of [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] forces on the NAC side, led by John Jay Madison, a.k.a. the infamous [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expatriate and 1918 war hero [[Manfred von Richthofen]], known here as the Red Knight of Prussia. Win, Ed, Lucy and Clarissa lead the effort to notify the nascent NAC government of the threat. En route to the meeting of the [[Continental Congress]], Ed and Clarissa are kidnapped, leaving Win and Lucy to reveal the plot.

After fighting (and winning) a duel with a SecPol agent, Win and Lucy rescue their friends and track Madison and the Hamiltonians to a small town outside Laporte. Win sets off an explosion that eliminates all of the Hamiltonians.

Win elects to remain in the NAC and marries Clarissa. Ed marries Lucy, who at the time of the story is awaiting a delayed "regeneration" because of an accident involving massive radiation exposure, and they then set out for the asteroid belt to build a new life for themselves on the NAC frontier.

The Continental Congress agrees to begin a massive propaganda campaign to force Win's United States (and the rest of the globe) toward a similar [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatinist]] revolution.

==Awards==
''The Probability Broach'' won the 1982 [[Prometheus Award]], which L. Neil Smith himself had created, and which is awarded by the Libertarian Futurist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfs.org/awards.htm Prometheus Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

He goes on to say, "This essay will introduce a number of the various approaches that have been brought to bear upon this work. In reviewing these wide-ranging approaches it will be possible both to define the questions that have shaped the reception of this work and to formulate some possibilities for future research."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Theodore Psalter 03.jpg|alt=Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.|thumb|&lt;blockquote&gt;Colophon of the Theodore Psalter--MS 19352, f 208&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]

==The Psalter==
The ''[[Psalms]]'' are a book within the ''Old Testament,'' written in metered [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], or twelve-syllable poetic lines, and are thought to be [[Musical instrument|musical]]. They have been compared to a harp, or other instruments of music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Byzantine psalters stand out in historically because of the religious and spiritual artistic qualities the [[Byzantine Empire]] was known for. This includes images and icons painted by hand. The [[art]] within the Byzantine psalters were specifically unique because of the history surrounding the creation and use of images two centuries before during opposition to icons in the [[Iconoclastic controversy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|last=Cormack|first=Robin|publisher=Oxford University Press, U.K.|date=November 26, 2000|isbn=978-0195046526|location=Oxford, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[psalter]] is a [[book]] made specifically to contain the 150 psalms from the book of [[Psalms]].  Psalters have also included the odes or [[canticle]]s, which are songs or prayers in song form from the [[Old Testament]]. Psalters were created purely for [[Liturgical book|liturgical]] purposes, and the Psalms were the most popular books of the ''Old Testament'' in Byzantium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The ''Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'' observed, "Like a garden, the book of ''Psalms'' contains, and puts in musical form everything that is to be found in other books, and shows, in addition, its own particular qualities."&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford dictionary of Byzantium|date=1991|publisher=Oxford Univ.

]]Barber wrote in "Essay One" of the ''Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile,'' "Completed in Constantinople in February 1066, the 208 folios of this [[Manuscript culture|manuscript]] include 440 separate [[Images and Words|images]], making this the most fully [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] Psalter to come down from the [[Byzantine Empire]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile|last=Barber|first=Charles|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=February 5, 2001|isbn=978-0252025853|location=Illinois|pages=Essay}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;He further writes, "Before entering upon this [[Historiography|historiographical]] discussion the manuscript itself should be introduced. In recent years this Psalter has come to be known as the ''Theodore Psalter'', a name that memorializes the [[scribe]] mentioned in the manuscript's [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]], (folio 208r). In its modern binding, the manuscript is 208 folios in length and gathered into twenty-six [[Units of paper quantity|quires]]. Each quire is numbered in the lower margin of its opening folio (except where cut) in [[carmine]] and black and on the final folio in black."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Barber adds, "The prayer of dedication and the colophon found that the final opening of the manuscript (folios 207v-208r) provide precise information on the production of this manuscript. The colophon, written on folio 208r can be translated as follows: "This volume of the divine ''Psalms'' was completed in the month of February of the fourth [[indiction]] of the year 6574 [i.e. 1066 C.E.] on the order of the divinely inspired felker and [[synkellos]] Michael, abbot of the all-holy and all-blessed monastery."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Barber added, "The name of the monastery is lost, but from other evidence within the manuscript we know that it was the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Stoudios Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second part of the colophon reads,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Written and written in [[gold]] by the hand of Theodore the [[Archpriest|protopresbyter]] of this monastery and scribe from Caesarea, whose shepherd and luminary was the glorious and brilliant Basil, who was truly great and was also so named."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Professor Barber continues, "First, there is Theodore from Caesaera. He describes himself as an archpriest and scribe of the monastery. Furthermore, he has defined himself within this last role in two ways: he has both written and written in gold this manuscript. Clearly, Theodore should be identified with the hands-on production of this work. The second name is the abbot of the monastery, Michael, who is described as the divinely inspired father and synkellos of the monastery and about whom we have no other firm information. The colophon shows that Michael is to be understood as the patron of this book, which was made at his order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Monastery of Stoudios|Stoudios Monastery]] was known for its rigorous academic and artistic excellence, and especially in the Byzantine style of religious icons. A ''[[protopresbyteros]]'' is an [[archpriest]]—a kind of clerk and monk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Liturgy and the Psalms==
The Byzantine Empire witnessed a very prolific movement in the creation of art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The legalization of [[Christianity]] by [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] in 313 inspired works of art linked to this new religious movement, specifically [[Icons, Abstract Thee|icons,]] and they became very popular, and the quintessential art form from Byzantine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Church services created and inspired by religious devotion were called liturgical services.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|page=1240}} [[Liturgy]] was the concept behind icons, ceremonies or rituals, and the creation of religious books. The act of reading the Psalms was not new. It was thought that icons created a mental universe for the reader imbued with images derived from texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkes-Teeples|first1=Steven|last2=Groen|first2=Bert|last3=Alexopoulos|first3=Stefanos|title=Studies on the liturgies of the Christian east : selected papers of the Third International Congress of the Society of Oriental Liturgy, Volos, May 26-30, 2010|date=2013|publisher=Peeters|location=Leuven|isbn=9789042927490|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art History Professor Herbert L. Kessler believes such manuscripts were created to transport the reader to a different place, a place with high spiritual aspirations. He mentions an illuminated manuscript, the Gospel of St. Luke, and writes, "This eleventh-century manuscript demonstrates a trend of the High Middle Ages in which transcendental contemplation was initiated by abstract means. Here, thin washes of celestial colors elevate the animal flesh itself, the vellum on which words and pictures are elsewhere inscribed, to guide the viewer's thoughts from the physical world toward (though not all the way to) the invisible God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Medieval Art|last=Kessler|first=Herbert L.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1551115351|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations and Images==
[[File:Theodore Psalter page 099v. Ps.76.21 - Moses and Aaron.jpg|thumb|Theodore Psalter--Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.]]
The ''Theodore Psalter'' features 440 miniatures, or illustrations. They are ‘marginal’ miniatures; they appear in the margins of the book. The miniatures include illustrations from the [[Gospel]]s, liturgical illustrations and [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] miniatures, or stories about Christ.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|page=2046}} The word ''miniature'' means illustration, and originates with the word ''minium'', which had nothing to do with size or the word ‘minimum’. Instead, the word refers to the red lead of the pencils used in the 9th Century for these psalters. Throughout the psalter there are both red and blue lines connecting the miniatures to text, much like the way we today link text to photos or other websites.

The ''Theodore Psalter'' miniatures convey allegorical meaning from the ''Psalms'' or the ''Odes'', and have "an extra layer of meaning supplied by images displaying vigorous anti-Iconoclastic propaganda".&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;{{rp|page=1753}} One example is Mathew commenting on the Psalms.

There are animals: goats and dogs: mice and birds including pelicans; a dragon and unicorn; and a Tree of Life. There are men playing music, and vegetation.

Professor Barber continues his commentary on the Psalter, "The image and prayer on folio 207v develop our understanding of Michael's possession of the book. A blessing bust of Christ can be assumed in the medallion. Below and to the right is a standing figure of David, clearly labeled, wearing royal costume and carrying a psaltery. Between them, and now almost lost, is the faint trace of a third figure. This bearded man carries a book in his left hand, looks up toward Christ, and gestures with his right hand. He is identified by the text written around him: "Our most Holy Father Michael, the abbot and synkellos, the Stoudite says...He says, "Savior, take hold of the finished book of your prophet and wise king." The image and text together indicate that thePsalter is shown in the left hand of Michael. David is identified as the author of the Psalms, but it is Michael who possesses, for the moment, the Psalter. (see Essay 3). It is his to give to Christ. The manuscript's final opening provides a writer-producer (Theodore), a patron-pssessor (Michael), an ordinary author (David), and a national recipient (Christ). In addition, the texts indicate that the manuscript was completed in February 1066. Taken together, this information provides rare precise details on the location of the production and the possession of a Byzantine Illuminated manuscript. As such, the Theodore Psalter necessarily provides a fixed point in any discussion of eleventh-century Constantinopolitan illumination."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This kind of scene occurs throughout the Psalter, and there are surprising examples.

Professor Robin Cormack writes in his book ''Byzantine Art'' about the ''Theodore Psalter.'' Patriarch Nikephoros, an Orthodox patriarch who supported the use of icons 250 years before, during the Iconoclastic Debate, appears in the text, and there are conversations, but there is a surprising twist. He is replaced by a monk who had lived at the monastery at the same time. That monk was Theodore the Studite who was made a saint after his death, and who had been persecuted for actively supporting the making and the using icons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Professor Cormack writes, "The prominent role of Patriarch Nikephoros, as triumphant iconophile is replaced with portraits of the monk St. Theodore the Studite. Natural though it was to celebrate a past member of the community in which the manuscript was made, it slants the opposition to iconoclasm away from patriarch to monk."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Theodore Psalter page 134r. Ps. 101.7.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the Theodore Psalter. Courtesy of the British Library.]]
There is another interesting detail, and that is the image of the pelican in the manuscript. Eriko Tsuji wrote an article about the Theodore Psalter and the appearance of the image of a pelican, " Where both the Chludov (Moscow, Historical Museum, 129d) and the Barberini Psalters show a bird nesting on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17 ("There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them," the Theodore Psalter has precisely the same composition at Psalms 101:7, "I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl in the ruined house").  Theodore must have moved the miniature intentionally because he added a new motif instead of the bird on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17. The illustration of the bird on a column was regarded as a pelican in the Theodore Psalter because of the relationship to the word "Pelican" in the text. Though the miniature of the pelican itself is now lost, we have a photograph of the miniature of Crucifixion interpreting a fable of the pelican. It is obvious among the monks of the monastery that the pelican can be considered as an image of the Passion of Christ. The miniature cycle of the Theodore Psalter was devised for the abbot of the monastery. By examining the miniatures as a product of the highly intellectual culture of the monastery, we can speculate that the modification by Theodore is a reflection of the interests and concerns of the Stoudios monastery in the eleventh century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsuji|first=Eriko|volume=61 |issue=1 |date=2011|title=The Iconography of the Pelican in the Scriptorium of the Stoudios Monastery.|url=|journal=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experience of the Icon ==
Art historian and Stanford professor Bissera Pentcheva points out that the icon must be experienced with the senses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Focusing on the Byzantine icon, this study plunges into the realm of senses and performative objects. To us, the Greek word for icon, designates portraits of Christ, Mary, angels, saints, and prophets painted in encaustic or tempera on wooden boards. By contrast, ''eikon'' in Byzantium had a wide semantic spectrum ranging from hallowed bodies permeated by the Spirit, such as the Stylite saintes or the Eucharist, to imprinted images on the surfaces of metal, stone, and earth. Eikon designated matter imbued with divine pneuma, releasing charis, or grace. As matter, this object was meant to be physically experienced. Touch, smell, taste, and sound were part of "seeing" an eikon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pentcheva|first1=Bissera|title=Sensual icon : space, ritual, and the senses in byzantium.|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Univ Press|location=University Park|isbn=9780271035833|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Text and Script==
There are two kinds of script used in the ''Theodore Psalter.'' One is called m''ajuscule'', and is a kind of calligraphy consisting of large or upper case letters. In the Theodore Psalter the m''ajuscule'' lettering appears in gold. The other kind of text or script used in the manuscript is a smaller text called ''[[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]]''. It is also a kind of [[calligraphy]] established in the 8th and 9th century by [[Charlemagne]] and revived during the [[Italian Renaissance]]''. Minuscule'' is the foundational script that forms the basis of the present day Roman [[letter case|upper and lower case]] type. These small letters appear in red and gold throughout the text, and the cover has those same colors in majuscule. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Professor Barber adds, "the predominant script is a ''minuscule perlschrift'' typical of the eleventh century. A gilded ''majuscule'' is used for emphasized passages and titles. The text is written beneath the ruled line in brown ink, although certain passages, titles, and initial letters of Psalm verses are written in gold on carmine ink. A varied system of marks in carmine or blue link text and image is in this manuscript." Barber adds that the (ruling) pattern is relatively uncommon. "The text block is ruled for a single column of text and measures approximately 10.6 cm by 15.2 cm. The number of text lines varies between twenty and twenty-four; normally these are consistent within a quire. The Psalter contains 151 Psalms (folios 1-189r), a unique telve-syllable poem on the early life of David (folios 189v-191r), a prayer for the abbot of a monastery (folios 191v-192), ten biblical odes (folios 192v-208r), and a dedication and colophon (folios 207v and 208r). The Psalms and Odes are numbered next to their titles and the Psalm text is divided into hathismata and doxai, reflecting common monastic practice.Numerous initial letters are ornamented, although the significance of the distribution of these letters is not disclosed by their occurrence."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile|last=Barber|first=Charles|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=February 5, 2001|isbn=978-0252025853|location=Illinois|pages=Essay One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Combinations of Art and Text in the Theodore Psalter==
[[File:Theodore Psalter, Pslam 26, 1066.jpg|thumb|Theodore Psalter-Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.]]
The relationship of icons and text, especially religious text, is an ongoing topic of interest to scholars.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Liz James writes:  "Art and text, the interface between images and words, is one of the oldest issues in art history. Are works of art and writings different but parallel forms of expression? Are they intertwined and interdependent?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;She goes on to ask, "Can art ever stand alone and apart from text or is it always enmeshed in the meanings expressed in the written and the oral that make it perpetually exposed to subjective interpretation? Byzantium was a culture in which the interactions between word and image underpinned, in many ways, the whole meaning of art. For the Byzantines, as a People of the Book, the interface between images and words, and, above all, Christ, the Word of God, was crucial. The dynamic between art and text in Byzantium is essential for understanding Byzantine society, where the correct relationship between the two was critical to the well being of the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=edited by Liz|title=Art and text in Byzantine culture|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521834094|pages=1|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==British Library==
The ''Theodore Psalter'' is now in the [[British Library]] in London. A great deal of work has gone into preserving and digitizing this psalter, now almost a thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_19352 | title=Digitised Manuscripts - Add MS 19352 |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of technology attempt to explain the factors that shape technological innovation as well as the impact of technology on society and culture. Most contemporary theories of technology reject two previous views: the [[Linear model of innovation|linear model of technological innovation]] and [[technological determinism]]. To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts. To challenge technological determinism, today's theories of technology emphasize the scope of technical choice, which is greater than most laypeople realize; as science and technology scholars like to say, "It could have been different." For this reason, theorists who take these positions typically argue for greater public involvement in technological decision-making.

== Social theories ==
'Social' theories focus on how humans and technology affect each other. Some theories focus on how decisions are made with humans and technology: humans and technology are equal in the decision, humans drive technology, and vice versa. The interactions used in a majority of the theories on this page look at individual human's interactions with technology, but there is a sub-group for a group of people interacting with technology. The theories described are purposefully vague and ambiguous, since the circumstances for the theories change as human culture and technology innovations change.

=== Descriptive approaches ===

* [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) – argues that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Key concepts include:
** '''interpretive flexibility''': "Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted ... By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed." 
** '''Relevant social group''': shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact
** ''''''Closure''' and stabilization''': when the relevant social group has reached a consensus 
** '''Wider context:''' "the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values, which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact" 
: Key authors include MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985).

* [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) –  posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors. It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1992). Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts. In Bijker, W. and Law, J., editors, Shaping Technology/Building Society. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt; argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competences, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the '''inscription''' of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to '''embody''' them. Key authors include [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1997). On Actor Network Theory: a few clarifications&lt;/ref&gt; and Callon (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Callon, M. (1999). Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of Saint Brieuc Bay. In Biagioli, M., editor, The Science Studies Reader, pages 67–83. Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Structuration theory]] – defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices,enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Key authors include DeSanctis and Poole (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Desanctis, G. and Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory. Organization Science, 5(2):121-147&lt;/ref&gt;, and Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Systems theory]] – considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include [[reverse salient]]s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, [[operational closure]], and [[autopoietic autonomy]]. Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Activity theory]] - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system.

=== Critical approaches ===

[[Critical theory]] goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the [[status quo]] and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; definition, "a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. 
 
Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of [[Andrew Feenberg]] including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).

* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Helen Nissenbaum]] (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Group Theories ===
There are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).

* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976&lt;ref&gt;Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of "presence": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.
* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571&lt;/ref&gt; shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with "rich" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.
* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.
* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis &amp; Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication.
* The [[social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)]] (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer-mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe &amp; M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161–198). Chichester: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;;Spears &amp; Lea, 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or "deindividuated"). It provided an alternative explanation for these "[[deindividuation]] effects" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make "salient" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two.
* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174.&lt;/ref&gt; theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).

=== Other Stances ===
Additionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 16(1):20-50.&lt;/ref&gt; considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 17(3):282-312.&lt;/ref&gt; treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological "statements" and "counterstatements" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.

An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]]&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].
In the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of [[economic growth]] ([[Carlota Perez]])&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Analytic theories ==

Finally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.

For example, Markus and Robey (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.

Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:
# '''Technological imperative:''' focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency
# '''Strategic choice:''' focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users
# '''Technology as a trigger of structural change:''' views technology as a social object

[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis]] and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: 
# '''Decision-making:''' the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches
# '''Institutional school:''' technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power
# '''An integrated perspective (social technology):''' soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory

Bimber (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79–100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:
# '''Normative:''' an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)
# '''Nomological:''' a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). 
# '''''[[Unintended consequence]]s:''''' a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)

'''VBS2''' ('''Virtual Battlespace 2''') is the successor of the battlefield simulation system [[VBS1]]. It was developed in close cooperation with the [[USMC]], [[Australian Defence Force]] and other military customers of VBS1. VBS2 was officially launched on 17 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbs2.com/site/press_vbs_lch.html Bohemia Interactive announces the official release of VBS2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

VBS2 offers realistic [[virtual battlefield|battlefield simulations]] and the ability to operate land, sea, and air vehicles. Instructors may create new scenarios and then engage the simulation from multiple viewpoints. The squad-management system enables participants to issue orders to squad members.

VBS2 was designed for federal, state, and local government agencies and can be specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of military, law enforcement, [[homeland defense]], [[loadmaster]], and [[first responder]] training environments.

VBS2 may be used to teach doctrine, [[military tactics|tactics]], techniques, and procedures during [[squad]] and [[platoon]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], [[Defense (military)|defensive]], and [[patrolling]] operations. VBS2 delivers a synthetic environment for the practical exercise of the [[leadership]] and organizational behavior skills required to successfully execute unit missions.

VBS2 is suitable for training small teams in urban tactics, entire combat teams in [[combined arms]] operations or even non-military usage such as emergency response procedures in lethal and non-lethal environments or terrain visualization.

VBS2 is based on the VBS2[[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, also used in the video game [[Arma 2]].

==Technology==

The simulation engine driving VBS2 is [[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, developed by [[Bohemia Interactive]]. VBS2 allows a user to develop large terrain areas, over {{convert|10,000|km2}} in size (at any terrain resolution) and populate the terrain area with millions of objects in accordance with VMAP shape data, and then texture-map the entire representation with high-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photography.

Once the terrain representation is exported into VBS2, the simulation engine will provide a simulation of the real world, incorporating moving trees and grass, ground clutter, ambient animal life, shadows, dynamic lighting, weather and time of day.

A new streaming capability provides an efficient means of loading complex terrain areas as object and texture data is processed only when required. View distances are now typically five times greater than in [[VBS1]] (depending on [[CPU|processor]] speed) – [[culling (computer graphics)|level of detail cull]]ing has been improved to allow [[attack helicopter]]s and armoured vehicles to engage at realistic ranges, and [[forward observer]]s to call [[artillery]] fire from greater distances.

==Features==

VBS2 supports large [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] network sessions allowing [[join-in-progress]] and improved administrator functionality. VBS2 provides improved simulation of complex urban areas, including destructible buildings, round penetration through walls and operable and destructible doors. Weapon platforms are capable of thermal imaging, simulation of fire control systems and turret override. Multiple vehicle turrets are possible. Weapon [[ballistics]] have been improved.

The After-Action-Review module allows detailed review of a completed training mission, with every player, AI, vehicle movement being recorded, as well as any bullet path and any destruction to objects or terrain.

The VBS2 terrain editing tool, Visitor 3, will support direct import of terrain and shape data to recreate any area of operation in the simulation. VBS2 also includes real-time [[command and control]] functionality for large numbers of AI or human participants.

The VBS1 [[High level architecture (simulation)|HLA]]/[[Distributed Interactive Simulation|DIS]] gateway is updated and improved for VBS2 to meet HLA and DIS compliance.

==History==

In 2001, Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA) was formed to take Operation Flashpoint and develop a militarised version suitable for Tactical training. By late 2001, the US Marine Corps was provided an alpha version of VBS1 and from their feedback, the after actions review (AAR) tool was added. The Australian Army used VBS1 for experimentation in 2003 and training trials in 2004 with the software being accepted, in 2005, as an Infantry and combined arms operations training tool.
In 2006 Calytrix Technologies developed LVCGame as a HLA and DIS gateway for VBS to allow constructive simulation entities and VBS entities to interact in wider exercises. VBS2 was released in beta in early 2007 and trialed as part of the ADF's Combined Arms Tactical Training (CATT) events. BIA then used feedback from both the ADF and USMC to finalize VBS2 throughout 2007 with the Virtual Tool Kit addition being released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simulationaustralia.org.au/archive/simtect/2007/Abstracts/97.html |title=SimTecT 2007 - The Evolution of 1st-Person Trainers: A Case-Study with VBS and HLA Integration |publisher=Simulationaustralia.org.au |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2009 the [[United States Army]] announced a new training program of record called Games for Training (GFT).  VBS2 was selected as the first person simulation flagship for the GFT program.  This announcement replaced a DARPA initiative known as [[DARWARS Ambush! Convoy Simulator]] which was subsequently retired as a training tool. Games for Training is currently managed by the TRADOC Capability Manager Gaming, located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Virtual reality sex''' (in short: VR sex) is a technology that allows the user to receive tactile sensations from remote participants, or fictional characters through the use of computer-controlled [[sex toys]]. Usually the user also wears a [[virtual reality headset]] so he/she can see and interact with the partner.

==Examples==

===BKK Cybersex Cup===
The BKK Cybersex Cup consists of a [[virtual reality headset]] and masturbation cup. It also comes with a mobile app which allows the users to customize their own 3D girlfriend based on their preferred body, skin tone, hairstyle and outfit. The masturbation cup has a built in motion sensor which is capable of simulating the movement and transmission of the action via Bluetooth to any smartphone that runs the 3D girlfriend app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ean-online.com/company-news/crowdfunging-campaign-for-bkk-cybersex-cup/ |title=Crowdfunding Campaign for BKK Cybersex Cup – EAN Online Erotic Industry News |publisher=Ean-online.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Mandy Stadtmiller2015-05-30 03:04:23 UTC |url=http://mashable.com/2015/05/29/virtual-reality-sex/#tG.aEr8Wkkqn |title=Virtual reality sex is coming — and the toys are already here |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/for-science-i-tested-one-of-the-worlds-first-virtual-reality-sex-toys |title=For Science, I Tested the Latest Virtual Reality Sex Toy |publisher=VICE |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VirtuaDolls===
The American company Eos created the VirtuaDolls which consists a silicone sheath into which a man inserts his [[penis]]. In concert with a mechanized gripper for “intelligent stroke movement,” this allows for the VirtuaDolls controller to sync up the sensation to the action. For immersive experience, it also comes with six interchangeable sleeves with different textures to allow for varying sensations and contains a pressure sensor that determines the occupant’s position within the sheath. An optional vacuum attachment adds suction capabilities and an easy-clean system. The VirtuaDolls controller is also bundled with a video game titled ''Girls of Arcadia'' in which users carry out missions to rescue girls and are rewarded by the end of the missions in having sex with them. In January 2016, the company launched an [[Indiegogo]] campaign to raise funds for the product, but after being swamped with orders, the creators suspended the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jasper Hamill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/virtual-reality-male-sex-toy-7299079 |title=Makers of 'mindblowing' sex robot with virtual vagina swamped with orders - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulton |first=Will |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/virtuadolls-indiegogo/ |title=Why VirtuaDolls VR Porn Controller Suspended Its Indiegogo |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, it was relaunched on Indiegogo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/the-adult-vr-game-controller-virtuadolls-is-back-on-indiegogo-3433313 |title=The adult VR game controller 'VirtuaDolls' is back on IndieGoGo |publisher=Gamezone.com |date=2016-02-05 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dormancy}}'''Winter rest''' (from the [[German language|German]] term ''Winterruhe'') is a state of reduced activity of [[plant]]s and [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s living in extratropical regions of the [[Earth|world]] during the more hostile environmental conditions of [[winter]]. In this state, they save energy during cold weather while they have limited access to food sources.

==Plants==
[[Deciduous]] trees lose their foliage in the winter. Tree [[growth rings]] are a result of winter rest, as there is rapid growth in the warmer [[spring (season)|spring]], then slower growth later in the year.

[[Perennial plant|Perennial]] and [[Biennial plant|biennial]] [[herbaceous plants]] lose their frost-sensitive, above-ground parts before the winter, and regrow in the spring. Herbaceous plants that are [[Annual plant|annual]], producing seeds before the winter, can also be considered to have winter rest in some form, because their seeds may stay inactive over the winter before [[germinating]]. Annual plants which have seeds that germinate before winter also have winter rest. [[Winter cereals]], for example, which are sown in the [[fall]] and germinate before the frost, become dormant during the winter and actually require a few weeks of cold before they are able to flower.

==Animals==
Winter rest in an animal is different from true [[hibernation]], since the [[metabolism]] is not reduced drastically. The body temperature is not significantly lowered, however the [[heart rate]] is reduced. This means that animals like the [[raccoon]] can quickly become active again if temperatures rise or the snow melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=MacClintock | first=Dorcas | title=A Natural History of Raccoons | publisher=The Blackburn Press | location=Caldwell, New Jersey | year=1981 | isbn=978-1-930665-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that winter rest are [[European badger|badgers]] and [[brown bear]]s.
