      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2344">'''Aerospace architecture''' is broadly defined to encompass [[architecture|architectural]] design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems; [[space vehicle]]s, [[space station]]s, habitats and lunar and [[planetary surface construction]] bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems.

The [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) Design Engineering Technical Committee (DETC) meets several times a year to discuss policy, education, standards, and practice issues pertaining to aerospace architecture. See http://www.spacearchitect.org/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4293">The [[Architects Act 1997|Architects Act]] was amended in 2008 by a [[statutory instrument]] made by a minister of the United Kingdom government under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;An unofficial copy of the amended text of the Act may be found on [http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/Architects_Act_1997_:_amendment_of_June_2008_under_the_European_Communities_Act_1972 RIBApedia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119141914/http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/Architects_Act_1997_%3A_amendment_of_June_2008_under_the_European_Communities_Act_1972 |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the '''Architects (Recognition of European Qualifications etc and Saving and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2008''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100808053418/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081331_en.pdf S.I. 2008 No. 1331]&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force on 20 June 2008.  An Explanatory Memorandum was issued with the Regulations and a fuller Explanatory Memorandum presented to Parliament.

The Architects Act 1997 had resulted from the policy of allowing certain restrictions to apply (for well over 60 years, in the United Kingdom) to the use of the simple word "[[architect]]" in connection with a statutory [[Register of Architects]] operated under Westminster primary legislation by which the executant body was renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]] from 1997 (previously the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]]).  The amendment (under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]) has introduced pages of complicated text to a piece of legislation which was otherwise tolerably trim, neat and comprehensible in its consolidated form in the 1997 Act.  But the amendment has been made pursuant to a European Directive made in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:255:0022:01:EN:HTML Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council]&lt;/ref&gt; and the treaty obligations binding upon the United Kingdom and other states of the European Union, and in that respect an amendment under the European Directive was inevitable.

==Non-departmental public body==

The [[Architects Registration Board]] has been assigned the function of the "[[competent authority]]" which has to be designated by every [[European Union]] state. It has been classed as a "[[non-departmental public body]]" in the language being used by government departments.  The majority of the Board is appointed by one such government department under the provisions of the Architects Act 1997.

==Impact==

In connection with architects registration in the United Kingdom it is likely that as a result of the amendment of 2008 there will be a commensurate need to expand the human and other resources employed for giving effect to the additional activity prescribed for the Architects Registration Board to perform; and that the impact upon the annual fee which the Act enables the Board to demand is unlikely to be favourable to architects in the United Kingdom who, by application or retention, choose to become registrants on what, by the amendment, has become "Part 1" of the Register. The general effect on teaching and practice, or on the inter-disciplinary process in the service of the built environment, is uncertain.  Independent observers may consider (as had the author of the Warne Report, concerning the reform of architects registration which preceded the amending legislation of 1996) that the public is best served by means of statutory regulations of universal application (such as [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]]) on the one hand and arrangements free from the taint of [[monopoly]] on the other (for which see the article on the [[Warne Report]] and the legislative changes concerning trade descriptions and consumer protection, introduced in May 2008, that are referred to in the article on [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10336">'''Asymptotology''' has been defined as “the art of dealing with applied mathematical systems in [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]s”&lt;ref&gt;Kruskal M.D., Asymptotology, in ''Mathematical Models in [[Physical science|Physical Sciences]]'' (eds. S. Drobot and P. A. Viebrock), Proceedings of the conference at the University of Notre Dame, 1962, (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963) 17-48. [http://w3.pppl.gov/~hammett/work/2009/Kruskal62_Asymptotology_MATT160_ocr.pdf (preprint version)]
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as “the science about the synthesis of simplicity and exactness by means of localization.&lt;ref&gt;Barantsev R.G. Asymptotic versus classical mathematics // Topics in Math. Analysis.  Singapore e.a.: 1989, 49–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

The field of [[asymptotics]] is normally first encountered in school [[geometry]] with the introduction of the [[asymptote]], a line to which a curve tends at infinity.  The word Ασύμπτωτος (asymptotos) in Greek means non-coincident and puts strong emphasis on the point that approximation does not turn into coincidence.  It is a salient feature of asymptotics, but this property alone does not entirely cover the idea of [[asymptotics]] and, etymologically, the term seems to be quite insufficient.

==Perturbation theory, small and large parameters==

In [[physics]] and other fields of [[science]], one frequently comes across problems of an asymptotic nature, such as damping, orbiting, [[asymptotic stability|stabilization]] of a perturbed motion, etc.  Their solutions lend themselves to [[asymptotic analysis]] ([[perturbation theory]]), which is widely used in modern [[applied mathematics]], [[mechanics]] and [[physics]].  But asymptotic methods put a claim on being more than a part of classical mathematics.  [[K. Friedrichs]] said: “Asymptotic description is not only a convenient tool in the mathematical analysis of nature, it has some more fundamental significance”. [[Martin Kruskal|M. Kruskal]] introduced the special term asymptotology, defined above, and called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology to a science.
	A general term is capable of possessing significant heuristic value.  In his essay "The Future of Mathematics",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Poincare_Future.html The Future of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Poincaré]] wrote the following.
{{quote| text=
The invention of a new word will often be sufficient to bring out the relation, and the word will be creative.... It is hardly possible to believe what economy of thought, as Mach used to say, can be effected by a well-chosen term.... Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.... When language has been well chosen, one is astonished to find that all demonstrations made for a known object apply immediately to many new objects: nothing requires to be changed, not even the terms, since the names have become the same.... The bare fact, then, has sometimes no great interest ... it only acquires a value when some more careful thinker perceives the connection it brings out, and symbolizes it by a term.
}}

In addition, “the success of ‘[[cybernetics]]’, ‘[[attractor]]s’ and ‘[[catastrophe theory]]’ illustrates the fruitfulness of word creation as scientific research”.&lt;ref&gt;V. Arnol’d&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every physical theory, formulated in the most general manner, is rather difficult from a mathematical point of view.  Therefore, both at the genesis of the theory and its further development, the simplest limiting cases, which allow analytical solutions, are of particular importance.  In those limits, the number of equations usually decreases, their order reduces, nonlinear equations can be replaced by linear ones, the initial system becomes averaged in a certain sense, and so on.

All these idealizations, different as they may seem, increase the degree of symmetry of the mathematical model of the phenomenon under consideration.

==Asymptotic approach==

In essence, the asymptotic approach to a complex problem consists in treating the insufficiently symmetrical governing system as close to a certain symmetrical one as possible.

In attempting to obtain a better approximation of the exact solution to the given problem, it is crucial that the determination of corrective solutions, which depart from the limit case, be much simpler than directly investigating the governing system.  At first sight, the possibilities of such an approach seem restricted to varying the parameters determining the system only within a narrow range.  However, experience in the investigation of different physical problems shows that if the system’s parameters have changed sufficiently and the system has deviated far from the symmetrical limit case, another limit system, often with less obvious symmetries can be found, to which an asymptotic analysis is also applicable.  This allows one to describe the system’s behavior on the basis of a small number of limit cases over the whole range of parameter variations.  Such an approach corresponds to the maximum level of intuition, promotes further insights, and eventually leads to the formulation of new physical concepts.  It is also important that [[asymptotic methods]] help to establish the connection between different physical theories.
The aim of the asymptotic approach is to simplify the object.  This simplification is attained by decreasing the vicinity of the singularity under consideration.  It is typical that the accuracy of asymptotic expansions grows with localization.  Exactness and simplicity are commonly regarded as mutually exclusive notions.  When tending to simplicity, we sacrifice exactness, and trying to achieve exactness, we expect no simplicity.  Under localization, however, the antipodes converge; the contradiction is resolved in a synthesis called asymptotics.  In other words, simplicity and exactness are coupled by an “uncertainty principle” relation while the domain size serves as a small parameter&amp;nbsp;– a measure of uncertainty.

==Asymptotic uncertainty principle==

Let us illustrate the “asymptotic uncertainty principle”.  Take the expansion of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in an asymptotic sequence &lt;math&gt;{\phi_n(x)}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

A partial sum of the series is designated by &lt;math&gt;S_N(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the exactness of approximation at a given &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is estimated by &lt;math&gt;\Delta_N(x) = |f(x) - S_N(x)|&lt;/math&gt;.  Simplicity is characterized here by the number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and the locality by the length of interval &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Based on known properties of the [[asymptotic expansion]], we consider the pair wise interrelation of values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.  At a fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the expansion initially converges, i.e., the exactness increases at the cost of simplicity.  If we fix &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the exactness and the interval size begin to compete.  The smaller the interval, the given value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is reached more simply.

We illustrate these regularities using a simple example.  Consider the exponential integral function: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(y) = \int_{-\infty}^y e^{\zeta} \zeta^{-1} d{\zeta},  y &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating by parts, we obtain the following asymptotic expansion &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(y) \sim e^y \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (n-1)! y^{-n}, \; y&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Put &lt;math&gt;f(x) = -e-y \operatorname{Ei}(y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = -x-1&lt;/math&gt;. Calculating the partial sums of this series and the values &lt;math&gt;\Delta_N(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for different &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; yields:

  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;	&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;     &lt;math&gt;\Delta_1&lt;/math&gt;      &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2&lt;/math&gt;      &lt;math&gt;\Delta_3&lt;/math&gt;      &lt;math&gt;\Delta_4&lt;/math&gt;      &lt;math&gt;\Delta_5&lt;/math&gt;	&lt;math&gt;\Delta_6&lt;/math&gt;      &lt;math&gt;\Delta_7&lt;/math&gt;
  1/3	0.262	0.071	0.040	0.034	0.040	0.060	0.106	0.223
  1/5	0.171	0.029	0.011	0.006	0.004	0.0035	0.0040	0.0043
  1/7	0.127	0.016	0.005	0.002	0.001	0.0006	0.0005	0.0004

Thus, at a given &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the exactness first increases with the growth of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and then decreases (so one has an asymptotic expansion).  For a given &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, one may observe an improvement of exactness with diminishing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, is it worth using asymptotic analysis if [[computers]] and [[numerical methods]] have reached such an advanced state?  As [[David Crighton|D. G. Crighton]] has mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;Crighton, D. G., "Asymptotics&amp;nbsp;– an indispensible complement to thought, computation and experiment in Applied Mathematical modelling".  In ''Proceedings of the Seventh Eur. Conf. Math. in Industry (March 2–6, 1993, Montecatini Terme)''. A.Fasano, M.Primicerio (eds.) Stuttgart: B.G. Teubner, 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| text= Design of computational or experimental schemes without the guidance of asymptotic information is wasteful at best, dangerous at worst, because of the possible failure to identify crucial (stiff) features of the process and their localization in coordinate and parameter space.  Moreover, all experience suggests that asymptotic solutions are useful numerically far beyond their nominal range of validity, and can often be used directly, at least at a preliminary product design stage, for example, saving the need for accurate computation until the final design stage where many variables have been restricted to narrow ranges.}}

==History==

Beginning in the 1950s, atomic gardens were a part of [[Atoms for Peace]], a program to develop peaceful&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; uses of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] energy after [[World War II]]. Gamma gardens were established in laboratories in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], parts of the former [[USSR]], [[India]],&lt;ref name="Auto15-1"/&gt; and [[Japan]]. Though these gardens were initially designed with the aim of testing the effects of [[radiation]] on plant life, research gradually turned towards using radiation to introduce beneficial mutations that could give plants useful characteristics. Such characteristics include increased resilience to adverse weather, or a faster growth rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the Atomic Gardening Society was established in 1959 by [[Muriel Howorth]], an atomic activist from the [[United Kingdom]], in conjunction with a growing movement to bring atomic energy and experimentation into the lives of ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/atom-garden-eden/|title=Atom in the Garden of Eden|last=Mars|first=Roman|date=|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2017-04-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Howorth published a book entitled "Atomic Gardening for the Layman" along a similar theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/downloads/atomic-gardening-for-the-layman/|title=Atomic Gardening for the Layman|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=|website=www.atomicgardening.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Atomic Gardening Society utilized an early form of [[crowd-sourcing]], in which members received irradiated seeds, planted them in their gardens, and sent reports back to Howorth detailing the results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/1960/02/21/the-atomic-gardening-society/|title=The Atomic Gardening Society|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=1960-02-21|website=Atomic Gardening: A timeline of events|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howorth herself made national news upon growing a two-foot-tall peanut plant after planting an irradiated nut.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The youngest member of the society was Christopher Abbey (15), a student at Eastbourne College and the son of a dentist, who received a certificate of merit for propagating several species of irradiated seeds to maturity. Irradiated seeds were sold to the public by C.J. Speas, a [[Tennessee]] dentist who had obtained a license for a cobalt-60 source; and sold seeds produced in a backyard cinderblock bunker. Speas did so upon seeing an opportunity for amateur gardeners to get involved in testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Howorth, in an effort to give the members of her society a broader selection, began ordering seeds from Speas in large quantities. By 1960, Speas had reportedly shipped Howorth over three and a half million seeds, which were then distributed to nearly a thousand individual Society members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Despite the initial enthusiasm, the Atomic Gardening Society declined by the mid 1960s. This was due to a combination of a shifting political climate away from [[atomic energy]] and a failure on the part of the [[crowd sourced]] Society to produce noteworthy results.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution Made to Order: Plant Breeding and Technological Innovation in Twentieth-Century America.|last=Curry|first=Helen Anne|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2016|isbn=9780226390116|location=Chicago, IL, US|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, large-scale gamma gardens remained in use, and a number of commercial plant varieties were developed and released by laboratories and private companies alike.&lt;ref name="Garden History Girl"/&gt;

Gamma gardens were typically five acres in size, and were arranged in a circular pattern with a retractable radiation source in the middle. Plants were usually laid out like slices of a pie, stemming from the central radiation source; this pattern produced a range of radiation doses over the radius from the center. Radioactive bombardment would take place for around twenty hours, after which scientists wearing protective equipment would enter the garden and assess the results.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The plants nearest the center usually died, while the ones further out often featured "tumors and other growth abnormalities". Beyond these were the plants of interest, with a higher than usual range of mutations, though not to the damaging extent of those closer to the radiation source.&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; These gamma gardens have continued to operate on largely the same designs as those conceived in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Twilley"/&gt;

Research into the potential benefits of atomic gardening has continued, most notably through a joint operation between the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the U.N.'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Japan's [[Institute of Radiation Breeding]] is well-known for its modern-day usage of atomic gardening techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/archive/nias/eng/org/GR/IRB/|title=Institute of Radiation Breeding|last=|first=|date=|website=www.naro.affrc.go.jp|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The popularity of atomic gardening coincided with a [[postwar]] society seeking to put newly-discovered [[atomic energy]] to use. Many scientists and members of the public believed that atomic energy could be harnessed to address a great number of worldwide issues, including famine and energy shortages, leading them to embrace the new atomic era.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Some scientists that had worked on the military application of atomic energy in the past invested in or sponsored programs dedicated to bringing more peaceful applications of atomic energy to the public domain, and this included atomic gardening. As public skepticism of atomic energy grew, and as [[nuclear arsenal]]s continued to increase in size across the globe, atomic gardening fell out favor, along with other Atoms for Peace initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/1966/03/01/whatever-happened-to-the-atomic-garden/|title=Disillusionment and Demise|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=1966-03-01|website=Atomic Gardening: A timeline of events|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Fiction trivia|date=April 2015}}

Atomic gardens are part of the background of the plot of ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' which features the growth of irradiated seeds as a science fair project.&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; The [[Dilbert]] comic strip contains a reference to atomic gardening in form of sentient broccoli.&lt;ref name="Dilbert"/&gt;

[[Hardcore punk]] band [[Bad Religion]] published the song "Atomic Garden" on the 1992 album ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5408">In [[industrial and organizational psychology]], '''biodata''' is biographical data.&lt;ref&gt;Wood &amp; Payne, (1998). ''Competency based recruitment and selection''. Chapter 5 "Application form design and sifting". New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Biodata is “...factual kinds of questions about life and work experiences, as well as items involving opinions, values, beliefs, and attitudes that reflect a historical perspective.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lautenschlager, G.

The basis of biodata’s predictive abilities is the axiom that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mael, F. A. |year=2001|title=A conceptual rationale for the domain and attributes of biodata items|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2001.tb00698.x|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=44|issue=4|pages= 763–927}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biographical information is not expected to predict all future behaviours but it is useful in personnel selection in that it can give an indication of probable future behaviours based on an individual’s prior learning history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mumford, M. D. |author2=Costanza, D.P. |author3=Connelly, M.S. |author4=Johnson, J.F. |year=1996|title=Item generation procedures and background data scales: Implications for construct and criterion-related validity|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1996.tb01804.x|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=49|issue=2|pages= 360–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biodata instruments (also called [[Biographical Information Blanks]]) have an advantage over personality and interest inventories in that they can capture directly the past behaviour of a person, probably the best predictor of his or her future actions.{{Cn|date=June 2018}} These measures deal with facts about the person’s life, not introspections and subjective judgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stricker, L.

Over the years, personnel selection has relied on standardized psychological tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reilly, R. R. |author2= Chao, G.

The mean coefficient for a standardized test of g is 0.51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmidt, F.L. |author2= Hunter, J.E. |year=1998|title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262|url=http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=124|issue=2|pages= 262–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of 58 studies on biodata found coefficients that ranged from 0.32 to 0.46 with a mean validity of 0.35.  The mean validity of interviews was found to be 0.19. research has indicated a validity coefficient of 0.29 for unstructured interviews and 0.31 for structured interviews but interview results can be affected by interviewer biases and have been challenged in a number of different court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harris, M. M. |author2= Schaubroeck, J. |year=1988|title=A Meta-Analysis Of Self-Supervisor, Self-Peer, and Peer-Supervisor Ratings|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=41|pages= 43–62|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1988.tb00631.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, biodata has been shown to be a valid and reliable means to predict future performance based on an applicant’s past performance.  A well-constructed biodata instrument is legally defendable and unlike the interview, is not susceptible to error due to rater biases or the halo effect.  It has proven its worth in personnel selection as a cost effective tool.&lt;ref&gt;Kuschnereit, F. and Spinner, B. (June 1997).  "Improving The Accuracy of Biodata Questionnaires".  Paper presented at the 58th Annual Convention of the Canadian Psychological Association, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[South Asian]] community ([[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]]), a biodata is essentially a [[Resume|résumé]]. The purpose is similar to that of a résumé, to eliminate some candidates from the pool of prospective suitors before meeting others.  The biodata generally contains the same type of information as a résumé (i.e. objective, work history, salary information, educational background), but may also include physical attributes, such as height, weight, hair/skin/eye color, and a photo.

Biological aspects of fluorine describes the effects of fluorine-containing compounds with life.  Fluorine (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) itself is very rare in everyday life, but hundreds of fluorine-containing compounds occur as minerals, medicines, pesticides, and materials.  Naturally occurring organofluorine compounds are extremely rare. Nonetheless, twenty percent of all commercialized pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, examples being [[Lipitor]] and [[Prozac]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;G. Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B. McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aigueperse&gt;{{citation | first1 = Jean | last1 = Aigueperse | first2 = Paul | last2 = Mollard | first3 = Didier | last3 = Devilliers | first4= Marius | last4 = Chemla | first5 =  Robert | last5 = Faron | first6 = Renée | last6 = Romano | first7 = Jean Pierre | last7 = Cuer | contribution = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic | editor-last = Ullmann | title = Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2005 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | place = Weinheim|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307| isbn = 3527306730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manmade fluorinated compounds have also played a role in several noteworthy environmental concerns. [[Chlorofluorocarbons]], once major components of numerous commercial aerosol products, have proven damaging to Earth's ozone layer and resulted in the wide-reaching [[Montreal Protocol]] (though in truth the [[chlorine]] in CFCs is the destructive actor, fluorine is an important part of these molecules because it makes them very stable and long-lived). Similarly, the stability of many organofluorine compounds has raised the issue of [[Persistent organic pollutant|biopersistence]]. Long-lived molecules from waterproofing sprays, for example [[PFOA]] and [[PFOS]], are found worldwide in the tissues of wildlife and humans, including newborn children.

Fluorine biology is also relevant to a number of cutting-edge technologies. PFCs ([[perfluorocarbons]]) are capable of holding enough oxygen to support human [[liquid breathing]]. Organofluorine in the form of its radioisotope [[Fluorine-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]] is also at the heart of a modern medical imaging technique known as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). A PET scan produces three-dimensional colored images of parts of the body that use a lot of sugar, particularly the brain or tumors.

{{Main|Fluoride therapy|Water fluoridation}}

Since the mid-20th century, it has been discerned from population studies (though incompletely understood) that fluoride reduces tooth decay. Initially, researchers hypothesized that fluoride helped by converting tooth enamel from the more acid-soluble mineral [[hydroxyapatite]] to the less acid-soluble mineral fluorapatite. However, more recent studies showed no difference in the frequency of [[caries]] (cavities) amongst teeth that were pre-fluoridated to different degrees. Current thinking is that fluoride prevents cavities primarily by helping teeth that are in the very early stages of tooth decay.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 090526-F-1333S-023 A service member embarked aboard the Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH 20) gives a Fluoride treatment to a patient during a Continuing Promise 2009 medical civil service projec.jpg|thumb|alt=white man holding plastic tray with brown goop in it and sticking a small stick into a black boy's open mouth|Topical fluoride treatment in Panama]]

When teeth begin to decay from the acid of sugar-consuming bacteria, calcium is lost (''demineralization'').  However, teeth have a limited ability to recover calcium if decay is not too far advanced (''remineralization'').  Fluoride appears to reduce demineralization and increase remineralization.  Also, there is some evidence that fluoride interferes with the bacteria that consume sugars in the mouth and make tooth-destroying acids.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt;  In any case, it is only the fluoride that is directly present in the mouth ([[topical medication|topical treatment]]) that prevents cavities.  Fluoride ions that are swallowed do not benefit the teeth.&lt;ref name=Pizzo&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pizzo G. |author2=Piscopo, M. R. |author3=Pizzo, I. |author4=Giuliana, G. |title= Community water fluoridation and caries prevention: a critical review |journal= Clinical Oral Investigation |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–193 |year=2007 |pmid=17333303 |doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6|url=http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/chris/Pizzo-2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a [[public water supply]] to reduce tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recommendations and Reports |volume=50 |issue=RR–14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use began in the 1940s, following studies of children in a region where water is naturally fluoridated.

Sodium fluoride, [[tin(II) fluoride|tin difluoride]], and, most commonly, [[sodium monofluorophosphate]], are used in [[toothpaste]]. In 1955, the first fluoride toothpaste was introduced in the United States. Now, almost all toothpaste in developed countries is fluoridated. For example, 95% of European toothpaste contains fluoride.&lt;ref name="Dental caries"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dental caries: The disease and its clinical management|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-3889-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZfXWhSmG1UC&amp;pg=PA518|author=Fejerskov, Ole|author2=Kidd, Edwina|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gels and foams are often advised for special patient groups, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy to the head (cancer patients). The patient receives a four-minute application of a high amount of fluoride. Varnishes, which can be more quickly applied, exist and perform a similar function. Fluoride is also contained in prescription and non-prescription mouthwashes and is a trace component of foods manufactured using fluoridated water supplies.&lt;ref name="Crest continuing ed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cracher |first=Connie Myers |title=Current concepts in preventive dentistry |url=http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/education/ce334/ce334.pdf |publisher=dentalcare.com |accessdate=20 January 2012 |page=12 |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172105/http://www.dentalcare.com/media/en-US/education/ce334/ce334.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical applications==
===Pharmaceuticals===
[[File:Prozac pills.jpg|thumb|alt=large image of just a capsule with words Prozac and DISTA visible|Prozac: one of several notable fluorine-containing drugs]]

Of all commercialized pharmaceutical drugs, twenty percent contain fluorine, including important drugs in many different pharmaceutical classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's building blocks: An A–Z guide to the elements |edition=2nd |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-960563-7 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine is often added to drug molecules as even a single atom can greatly change the chemical properties of the molecule in desirable ways.

Because of the considerable stability of the carbon-fluorine bond, many drugs are fluorinated to delay their [[drug metabolism|metabolism]], which is the chemical process in which the drugs are turned into compounds that allows them to be eliminated. This prolongs their [[half-life|half-lives]] and allows for longer times between dosing and activation. For example, an [[aromatic ring]] may prevent the metabolism of a drug, but this presents a safety problem, because some aromatic compounds are metabolized in the body into poisonous [[epoxide]]s by the organism's native [[enzyme]]s. Substituting a fluorine into a [[Arene substitution patterns|''para'']] position, however, protects the aromatic ring and prevents the epoxide from being produced.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Adding fluorine to biologically active organics increases their [[lipophilicity]] (ability to dissolve in fats), because the [[carbon–fluorine bond]] is even more hydrophobic than the [[carbon–hydrogen bond]]. This effect often increases a drug's [[bioavailability]] because of increased cell membrane penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swinson |first=Joel |journal=PharmaChem |title = Fluorine – A vital element in the medicine chest |year=2005 |pages=26–27 |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url=http://www.halocarbon.com/halocarbon_media/swinson_109.pdf |publisher=Pharmaceutical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the potential of fluorine being released in a fluoride [[leaving group]] depends on its position in the molecule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pet chemistry: The driving force in molecular imaging |page=144 |publisher=Springer |last=Schubiger |first=P. A. |isbn=9783540326236 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; organofluorides are generally very stable, since the carbon–fluorine bond is strong.

Fluorines also find their uses in common [[mineralocorticoid]]s, a class of drugs that increase the [[blood pressure]]. Adding a fluorine increases both its medical power and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glucocorticoids|author1=Goulding, Nicolas J. |author2=Flower, Rod J. |page=40|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9783764360597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine-containing [[fludrocortisone]] is one of the most common of these drugs.&lt;ref name="dontburn"/&gt; [[Dexamethasone]] and [[triamcinolone]], which are among the most potent of the related synthetic [[corticosteroid]]s class of drugs, contain fluorine as well.&lt;ref name="dontburn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pain-relieving procedures: The illustrated guide |page=58 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |last1=Raj |first1=P.

Several inhaled general [[anesthetic]] agents, including the most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, [[halothane]], proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used.

Prior to the 1980s, antidepressants altered not only [[serotonin]] uptake (lack of serotonin is a reason for a depression), but also the uptake of altered [[norepinephrine]]; the latter caused most of the side effects of antidepressants. The first drug to alter only the serotonin uptake was [[Prozac]]; it gave birth to the extensive [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) antidepressant class and is the best-selling antidepressant. Many other SSRI antidepressants are fluorinated organics, including [[citalopram|Celexa]], [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]], and [[escitalopram|Lexapro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Antidepressants|year = 2004|pages=37–39|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = E.

[[File:PET scan-normal brain-alzheimers disease brain.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.5|PET scan for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease]]

Compounds containing fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that emits [[positron]]s, are often used in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, because the isotope's half-life of about 110 minutes is usefully long by positron-emitter standards. One such [[radiopharmaceutical]] is [[fluorodeoxyglucose|2-deoxy-2-(&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F)fluoro-D-glucose]] (generically referred to as fludeoxyglucose), commonly abbreviated as &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG, or simply FDG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1097/00002517-200012000-00016 |last1 = Schmitz |pmid = 11132989 |first1 = A. |year = 2000 |pages = 541–544 |issue = 6 |last2 = Kälicke |volume = 13 |journal= Journal of spinal disorders |first2 = T. |last3 = Willkomm |first3 = P. |last4 = Grünwald |first4 = F. |last5 = Kandyba |first5 = J. |last6 = Schmitt |first6 = O.|title=Use of fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in assessing the process of tuberculous spondylitis|url=http://www.ecios.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0157CIOS/cios-2-167.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PET imaging, FDG can be used for assessing glucose metabolism in the brain and for imaging cancer tumors.

Natural fluorine is monoisotopic, consisting solely of [[fluorine-19]]. Fluorine compounds are highly amenable to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), because fluorine-19 has a [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|1|2}}, a high [[nuclear magnetic moment]], and a high [[magnetogyric ratio]]. Fluorine compounds typically have a fast NMR [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]], which enables the use of fast averaging to obtain a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] similar to [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]] NMR spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|first = J.

===Oxygen transport research===
{{see also|Blood substitute|Liquid breathing}}

Liquid fluorocarbons have a very high capacity for holding gas in solution. They can hold more oxygen or carbon dioxide than blood does. For that reason, they have attracted ongoing interest related to the possibility of artificial blood or of liquid breathing.&lt;ref name="Gabrielet"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gabriel, J.

Blood substitutes are the subject of research because the demand for blood transfusions grows faster than donations. In some scenarios, artificial blood may be more convenient or safe.

Possible medical uses of liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) involve assistance for premature babies or for burn victims (if normal lung function is compromised).

===Fluorine gas===
Elemental fluorine is highly toxic. Above a concentration of 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, it causes significant irritation while attacking the eyes, airways and lungs and affecting the liver and kidneys. At a concentration of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm, human eyes and noses are seriously damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keplinger|Suissa|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People can be exposed to fluorine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for fluorine exposure in the workplace as 0.1 ppm (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1 ppm (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 25 ppm, fluorine is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Fluorine|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0289.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrofluoric acid===
{{See also|Chemical burn}}

[[File:HF burned hands.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=left and right hands, two views, burned index fingers|Typical HF burns: the outward signs may not be evident for 24 hours, after which calcium treatments are less effective.&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Charles|title=Figure hfl|url=http://www.eatonhand.com/complic/figures/hfl.htm|work=E-Hand.com: the electronic textbook of hand surgery|publisher=The Hand Center (former practice of Dr. Eaton)|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hydrofluoric acid, the water solution of hydrogen fluoride, is a contact poison.  Even though it is chemically only a weak acid, it is far more dangerous than conventional strong [[mineral acids]], such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid. Owing to its lesser chemical dissociation in water (remaining a neutral molecule), hydrogen fluoride penetrates tissue more quickly than typical acids. Poisoning can occur readily through the skin or eyes or when inhaled or swallowed.  From 1984 to 1994, at least nine U.S. workers died from accidents with HF.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

Once in the blood, hydrogen fluoride reacts with calcium and magnesium, resulting in electrolyte imbalance (potentially [[hypocalcemia]]). The consequent effect on the heart ([[cardiac arrhythmia]]) may be fatal.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{harvnb|Blodgett|Suruda|Crouch|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Formation of insoluble [[calcium fluoride]] also causes strong pain.&lt;ref name=Goldfrank&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffman et al.|2007|p=1333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Burns with areas larger than 160&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, about the size of a man's hand, can cause serious systemic toxicity.&lt;ref name='RMTHFE'&gt;{{Harvnb|HSM|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, with an 8-hour delay for 50% HF and up to 24 hours for lower concentrations. Hydrogen fluoride interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful.

If the burn has been initially noticed, then HF should be washed off with a forceful stream of water for ten to fifteen minutes to prevent its further penetration into the body. Clothing used by the person burned may also present a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischman|2001|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C&amp;pg=PA458 458–459]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with [[calcium gluconate]], a source of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that binds with the fluoride ions. Skin burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5 percent calcium gluconate gel&lt;ref name="pmid2741315"&gt;{{harvnb|El Saadi et al.|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17091088"&gt;{{harvnb|Roblin et al.|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or special rinsing solutions.&lt;ref name="pmid15461243"&gt;{{harvnb|Hultén et al.|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because HF is absorbed, further medical treatment is necessary. Calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Use of calcium chloride is contraindicated and may lead to severe complications. Sometimes surgical excision of tissue or amputation is required.&lt;ref name="RMTHFE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zorich|1991|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdB3KjhWzFQC&amp;pg=PA183 182–3]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluoride ion===
[[File:Fluworôze egzostozes1-800h.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=knobby hoofed leg|Moroccan cow with fluorosis, from industrial contamination]]

{{See also|Fluoride toxicity}}

Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic. For sodium fluoride, the lethal dose for adults is 5–10&amp;nbsp;g, which is equivalent to 32–64&amp;nbsp;mg of elemental fluoride per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="zzzzzzz23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Liteplo et al.|2002|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dose that may lead to adverse health effects is about one fifth of the lethal dose.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; Chronic excess fluoride consumption can lead to [[skeletal fluorosis]], a disease of the bones that affects millions in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19305069"&gt;{{harvnb|Reddy|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluoride ion is readily absorbed by the stomach and intestines. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach. In this form, fluoride crosses cell membranes and then binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes. Fluoride is [[excretion|excreted]] through urine. Fluoride exposure limits are based on urine testing, which is used to determine the human body's capacity for ridding itself of fluoride.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shin|Silverberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baez|Baez|Marthaler|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluoride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Augenstein et al.|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste.&lt;ref name="Nochimson"/&gt; Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has occurred several times, including an Alaskan incident that sickened nearly 300 people and killed one.&lt;ref name=Gessner94&gt;{{harvnb|Gessner et al.|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopersistence===
{{main|Perfluorinated compound}}
Because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, organofluorines endure in the environment. [[Perfluorinated compound]]s (PFCs) have attracted particular attention as [[persistent organic pollutant|persistent global contaminants]].  These compounds can enter the environment from their direct uses in waterproofing treatments and firefighting foams or indirectly from leaks from fluoropolymer production plants (where they are intermediates). Because of the acid group, PFCs are water-soluble in low concentrations.&lt;ref name=Giesy&gt;John P. Giesy and Kurunthachalam Kannan [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es022253t Perfluorochemical Surfactants in the Environment], 1 April 2002, Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 147-152.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are other PFAAs, the lion's share of environmental research has been done on the two most well-known: [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies these materials as "emerging contaminants" based on the growing but still incomplete understanding of their environmental impact.&lt;ref name="PFOA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steenland K, Fletcher T, Savitz DA |title=Epidemiologic evidence on the health effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=118 |issue=8 |pages=1100–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20423814 |pmc=2920088 |doi=10.1289/ehp.0901827 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/emerging_contaminants_pfos_pfoa.pdf|title=Emerging Contaminants Fact Sheet- PFOS and PFOA|accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202537/http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/emerging_contaminants_pfos_pfoa.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trace quantities of PFCs have been detected worldwide, in organisms from polar bears in the Arctic to the global human population.  Both PFOS and PFOA have been detected in breast milk and the blood of newborns.  A 2013 review showed widely varying amounts of PFOS and PFOA in different soils and groundwater, with no clear pattern of one chemical dominating. PFC concentrations were generally higher in areas with more human population or industrial activity, and areas with more PFOS generally also had more PFOA.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zareitalabad, J. Siemens, M. Hamer, W. Amelung [http://safeguard.giqs.org/fileadmin/web_safeguard/content/Berichte_Protokolle2009/Schlussdokumente/CHEM13643.pdf Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in surface waters, sediments, soils and wastewater – A review on concentrations and distribution coefficients] Chemosphere 91 (2013) 725–732. Review&lt;/ref&gt;  the two chemicals have been found at different concentrations in different populations; for example, one study showed more PFOS than PFOA in Germans, while another study showed the reverse for Americans. PFCs may be starting to decrease in the biosphere: one study indicated that PFOS levels in wildlife in Minnesota were decreasing, presumably because [[3M]] discontinued its production.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;

[[File:PFOS-3D-vdW.png|The PFOS molecule|thumb]]

In the body, PFCs bind to proteins such as [[serum albumin]]. Their tissue distribution in humans is unknown, but studies in rats suggest it is present mostly in the liver, kidney, and blood. They are not metabolized by the body but are excreted by the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species.  Rodents have half-lives of days, while in humans they remain for years. Many animals show sex differences in the ability to rid the body of PFAAs, but without a clear pattern. Gender differences of half lives vary by animal species.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"&gt;Lau C, Anitole K, Hodes C, Lai D, Pfahles-Hutchens A, Seed J. [http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/2/366.full.pdf Perfluoroalkyl Acids: A Review of Monitoring and Toxicological Findings] Toxicol Sci. 99(2), 366–394 (2007) {{DOI|10.1093/toxsci/kfm128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential health impact of PFCs is unclear. Unlike chlorinated hydrocarbons, PFCs are not [[lipophilic]] (stored in fat), nor [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] (damaging genes). Both PFOA and PFOS in high doses cause cancer and the death of newborns in rodents. Studies on humans have not been able to prove an impact at current exposures. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have some of the highest PFOS concentrations of any wildlife studied; one study suggests an impact on their immune systems.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"&gt;Kellyn Betts [http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072861/ PFOS and PFOA in Humans: New Study Links Prenatal Exposure to Lower Birth Weight]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Nov; 115(11): A550. {{PMC|2072861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"/&gt;

The biochemical causes of toxicity are also unclear and may differ by molecule, health effect, and even animal. [[PPAR-alpha]] is a protein that interacts with PFAAs and is commonly implicated in contaminant-caused rodent cancers.&lt;ref name="PFOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFOA evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tox"/&gt;

Less fluorinated chemicals (i.e. not perfluorinated compounds) can also be detected in the environment. Because biological systems do not metabolize fluorinated molecules easily, fluorinated pharmaceuticals like antibiotics and antidepressants can be found in treated city sewage and wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lietz|Meyer|2006|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine-containing agrichemicals are measurable in farmland [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and nearby rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrens|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Biomass partitioning''' is the process by which [[plant]]s divide their energy amongst their [[Plant anatomy|parts]]. For example, there may be a tradeoff in proteins and carbohydrates allocated towards leaves for [[photosynthesis]] or to roots for the process of nutrient uptake.The study of [[biomass]] partitioning is important to [[crop]] [[plant growth|growth]]. The percentages of partitioning can be determined with the equation &lt;math&gt; (dW/dt)_i = P_{ci} * dW/dt &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605095033/http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 5, 2016 | title=Biomass partitioning | publisher=Ape Simulator | accessdate=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
with ''dW/dt'' is the [[exponential growth|growth rate]] ''(dW/dt)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;ci&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the rates of biomass partitioned and the respective partitioning factor for each [[plant organ]] ''i''.

Overall, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen availability]] has a strong effect on partitioning, with plants growing in low-nitrogen areas partitioning most of their biomass to underground structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cambui CA |author2=Svennerstam H |author3=Gruffman L |author4=Nordin A |author5=Ganeteg U |year=2011|title=Patterns of Plant Biomass Partitioning Depend on Nitrogen Source|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6|issue=4|pages=e19211|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019211|display-authors=etal |pmid=21544211 |pmc=3081341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil nitrogen availability is a strong determinant of biomass allocation. For example, in low productivity systems such as [[Taiga|boreal forests]], trees devote a large portion of their biomass to roots. But as the soil productivity begins to increase, biomass is primarily allocated to aboveground structures such as leaves and stems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an overall pattern, the overall lengths of roots begin to decrease as nitrogen concentrations increase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fuzhong|last2=Bao|first2=Weikai|last3=Li|first3=Fanglan|last4=Wu|first4=Ning|date=2008-05-01|title=Effects of drought stress and N supply on the growth, biomass partitioning and water-use efficiency of Sophora davidii seedlings|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847207002237|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=63|issue=1–3|pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to nitrogen as a factor of plant biomass partitioning, other environmental stressors such as water availability play a role. For example, plants that are growing in dry conditions often have a decreased total biomass production but they also contribute more of their biomass to the roots and develop a higher root:shoot.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When plants allocate more of their biomass to their roots, they are able to enhance water absorption by tapping further down into the [[water table]] as well as extending further laterally with the aid of increased [[Root hair|root hairs.]] But, when there is an extreme soil drought, there is not an increase in root:shoot biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Zhenzhu|last2=Zhou|first2=Guangsheng|last3=Shimizu|first3=Hideyuki|date=2010-06-01|title=Plant responses to drought and rewatering|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=5|issue=6|pages=649–654|doi=10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|issn=1559-2324|pmc=3001553|pmid=20404516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there is a limit to which plant biomass allocation responds to water stress and possibly other environmental factors as well.  It is important for plants to be able to balance their absorption and utilization processes with differing water and nitrogen availabilities because they adjust their growth in order to accommodate the abundances of growth-limiting resources, such as water and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bruno Julius Florian Taut''' (4 May 1880&amp;nbsp;– 24 December 1938) was a prolific German [[architect]], [[urban planner]] and author active during the [[Weimar culture|Weimar]] period. He is known for his theoretical works as well as his designs and buildings.

== Early life and career ==
Taut was born in [[Königsberg]] in 1880. After secondary school, he studied at the [[Baugewerkschule]]. In the following years, Taut worked in the offices of various architects in [[Hamburg]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. In 1903 he was employed by [[Bruno Möhring]] in [[Berlin]], where he acquainted himself with ''[[Jugendstil]]'' and new building methods combining [[steel]] with [[masonry]]. From 1904 to 1908, Taut worked in [[Stuttgart]] for [[Theodor Fischer]] and studied urban planning. He received his first commission through Fischer in 1906, which involved renovation of the village church in [[Unterriexingen]].

In 1908, he returned to Berlin to study art history and construction at the ''Royal Technical [[Higher education|Higher]] [[Technische Hochschule|School]] of [[Charlottenburg]]'' (''Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg''), now [[Technical University of Berlin]]. A year later, he established the architecture firm Taut &amp; Hoffmann with Franz Hoffmann.

Taut's first large projects came in 1913. He became a committed follower of the [[Garden City movement]], evidenced by his design for the Falkenberg Estate.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Architectural Theory / Edited by Harry Francis Mallgrave and Christina Contandriopoulos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Architectural Theory From The Renaıssance to The Present / Bernd Evers&lt;/ref&gt;

Taut adopted the futuristic ideals and techniques of the avante-garde as seen in the prismatic dome of the [[Glass Pavilion]], which he built for the association of the German glass industry for the 1914 [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition]] in [[Cologne]]. His aim was to make a whole building out of glass instead of merely using glass as a surface or decorative material.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He created glass-treaded metal staircases, a waterfall with underlighting, and colored walls of mosaic glass. His sketches for the publication "Alpine Architecture" (1917) are the work of an unabashed [[utopia]]n visionary, and he is classified as a [[Modernism|Modernist]] and, in particular, as an [[Expressionism|Expressionist]]. Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Germany ==
In 1910 after training in Berlin, working for [[Theodor Fischer]]'s firm in [[Stuttgart]], and establishing his own firm in Berlin, the experienced architect [[Hermann Muthesius]] suggested that Taut visit [[England]] to learn the garden city philosophy. Muthesius also introduced him to some of the ''[[Deutscher Werkbund]]'' group of architects, including [[Walter Gropius]]. Taut had [[socialist]] sympathies, and before [[World War I]] this hindered his advancement.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Taut's practical activity changed with World War I. He became a [[pacifist]] and so avoided military service. He began to write and sketch, less to escape from the brutalities of war than to present a positive utopia in opposition to this reality. Taut designed an immense circular garden city with a radius of about 7&amp;nbsp;km (4.3&amp;nbsp;mi) for three million inhabitants. The "City Crown" was to be in the very center. "Mighty and inaccessible", it would have been the culmination of a community and cultural center, a skyscraper-like, purpose-free "crystal building". "The building contains nothing but one beautiful room which can be reached by either of two staircases to the right and to the left of the theatre and the little community center. How can I even begin to describe what it is only possible to construct!", said Taut of the City Crown.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Taut completed two housing projects in [[Magdeburg]] from 1912 through 1915, which were influenced directly by the humane functionalism and urban design solutions of the garden city philosophy. The reform estate, created for a housing trust, was built in 1912–15 in the southwest of Magdeburg. The estate consists of one-storey terrace houses and was the first project in which Taut used colour as a design principle. The construction of the estate was continued by [[Carl Krayl]]. Taut served as city architect in Magdeburg from 1921 to 1923. During his time a few residential developments were built, one of which was the [[Hermann Beims estate]] (1925–28) with 2,100 apartments. Taut designed the exhibition hall ''City and Countryside'' in 1921 with concrete [[trusses]] and a central skylight.

[[File:Taut Wilskistrasse Berlin.jpeg|thumb|Onkel-Toms-Hütte, Wilskistrasse, Berlin]]
A lifelong painter, Taut was distinguished from his European modernist contemporaries by his devotion to [[color]]. As in Magdeburg, he applied lively, clashing colors to his first major commission, the 1912 ''[[Gartenstadt Falkenberg]]'' housing estate in Berlin, which became known as the "Paint Box Estates". The 1914 Glass Pavilion, an illustration of the new possibilities of glass, was also brightly colored. The difference between Taut and his Modernist contemporaries was never more obvious than at the 1927 [[Weissenhof Estate|''Weissenhofsiedlung'' housing exhibition]] in [[Stuttgart]]. In contrast to the pure-white entries from [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]], Taut's house (Number 19) was painted in primary colors. [[Le Corbusier]] is reported to have exclaimed, "My God, Taut is colour-blind!"&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, K., ''The Weissenhofsiedlung'' Rizzoli International Publications, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Taut was made chief architect of GEHAG, a Berlin public [[housing cooperative]], and was the main designer of several successful large residential developments ("Gross-Siedlungen") in Berlin, notably the 1925 [[Hufeisensiedlung ("Horseshoe Estate")|''Hufeisensiedlung'' ("Horseshoe Estate")]], named for its configuration around a pond, and the 1926 [[Onkel Toms Hütte]] Development ("[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]") in [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]], named for a local restaurant and set in a thick grove of trees. Both of these constructions became prominent examples of the use of colorful details in architecture.

Taut worked for the city architect of Berlin, [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], on some of Berlin's [[Modernist Housing Estates]], now recognized as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. The designs featured controversial modern flat roofs; access to sunlight, air and gardens; and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Political conservatives complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor, Gustav Böss, defended them: "We want to bring the lower levels of society higher."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Between 1924 and 1931, Taut's team completed more than 12,000 dwellings. In tribute to Taut, GEHAG incorporated an abstracted graphic of the Horseshoe Estate in its logo. This state housing association was sold by the [[Senate of Berlin]] in 1998; its legal successor is [[Deutsche Wohnen]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Japan ==
Being [[Jewish]] and a noted advocate of socialist political policies, Taut was compelled to look for opportunities to emigrate from Germany when the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] gained power. He was promised work in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1932 and 1933, but was obliged to return to Germany in February 1933 to a hostile political environment.

Later in the same year, Taut fled to Switzerland. Then with an invitation from Japanese architect Isaburo Ueno, he traveled to Japan via France, Greece, Turkey and Vladivostok, arriving in [[Tsuruga, Fukui|Tsuruga]], Japan on May 3, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denoon|first1=Donald|title=Multicultural Japan: Paleolithic to Postmodern|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0 521 00362 8|page=250|edition=Paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Taut made his home in [[Takasaki]], [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], where he produced three influential book-length appreciations of Japanese culture and architecture, comparing the historical simplicity of Japanese architecture with modernist discipline. For a period Taut worked as an industrial design teacher and his models of lamps and furniture sold at the Miratiss shop in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cabeza-Latinez|first1=Jose Maria|editor1-last=Weber|editor1-first=Willi|title=Lessons from Vernacular Architecture|date=2014|publisher=earthscan, Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire|isbn=978-1-84407-600-0|page=149}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Taut was noted for his appreciation of the stark, minimalist vein of Japanese architecture found at the [[Ise Shrine]] and at the [[Katsura Imperial Villa]] in Kyoto. He was the first to write extensively about the architectural features of Katsura Imperial Villa from a modernist perspective. Contrasting it with the elaborately decorated shrines of shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at [[Nikkō, Tochigi]], he famously said that "Japan's architectural arts could not rise higher than Katsura, nor sink lower than Nikko".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Varley|first1=H.

The only still extant Taut-designed architectural work in Japan is the extension to the Hyuga Villa at [[Atami, Shizuoka|Atami]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]]. Built in 1936 on a site below the original villa owned by businessman Rihei Hyuga, and part modern and part traditional Japanese in style, the three rooms provided additional space for social events and views over nearby [[Sagami Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyuga Villa Visitor Information|url=http://www.city.atami.shizuoka.jp/page.php?p_id=641|website=Atami City Official Website|publisher=Atami City, Shizuoka|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkey ==
Offered a position as Professor of Architecture at the "State Academy of Fine Arts" in [[Istanbul]] (currently, [[Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts]]), Taut relocated to [[Turkey]] in 1936. In Ankara he joined other German wartime exiles, including [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]] and Taut's associate [[Franz Hillinger]], who arrived in 1938.  Some of Taut's work was received unfavorably, however, and labelled as "cubic". In a letter to a Japanese friend he wrote, "They gave me a great opportunity in that they gave me freedom for my craft. I will make a building which is not 'cubic'; they are calling all [[modernism]] cubic. For this building, I am thinking of using some Turkish motifs."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He proceeded to design his own house in İstanbul's [[Ortaköy]] neighborhood, bridging the architectural traditions of his exile existence. His studio resembled that of the [[Einstein Tower]] in Potsdam, while the front view recalled a Japanese pagoda.

After leaving Germany, Taut gradually moved away from modernism. A colleague{{who|date=July 2014}} remarked that, "Like everyone who gets old, Taut is stuck with Renaissance principles and cannot find a way towards the new! I am very disappointed... It is a shame for such an avant-gardist."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Modern ve Sürgün&amp;nbsp;– Almanca Konuşan Ülkelerin Mimarları Türkiye’de / Yüksel Zandel Pöğün&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death in 1938, Taut wrote at least one more book and designed a number of educational buildings in [[Ankara]] and [[Trabzon]] under commissions from the Turkish Ministry of Education. The most significant of these buildings were the "[[School of Language and History - Geography|Faculty of Languages, History and Geography]]" at [[Ankara University]], "[[Ankara Atatürk Lisesi|Ankara Atatürk High School]]" and "Trabzon High School". His last building project, the "Cebeci School", was left unfinished. Taut's final work, one month before his death, was the [[catafalque]] which was used for the official state funeral of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] on 21 November 1938 in Ankara. It was a simple design, consisting of large wooden columns and a flag that covered the coffin.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;A Comparative Study On The Works of German Expatriate Architects In Their Home-Land And In Turkey During The Period of 1927-1950 / Yüksel Zandel Pöğün / IYTE&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}
'''Celestial mechanics''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the [[motion (physics)|motion]]s of [[celestial object|objects in outer space]]. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of [[physics]] ([[classical mechanics]]) to astronomical objects, such as [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, to produce [[ephemeris]] data.

As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of [[orbital mechanics]], which deals with the launching and [[orbit]]s [[artificial satellite]]s, and [[lunar theory]], a specialty which deals with the complications of the [[orbit of the Moon]]. Modern celestial mechanics tends to divide between five broad fields of study:
* trajectories of artificial satellites ([[orbital mechanics|astrodynamics]])
* motions of major planets, minor planets, and natural satellites in the Solar system and other stellar systems and widely spaced multiple-star systems (planetary dynamics)
* the motion of component stars and their planetary systems in closely spaced multiple-star systems and globular clusters (astrodynamics and [[stellar dynamics]])
* flow of stars within and among the bodies of large galaxies, dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters ([[stellar dynamics]] and galactic dynamics)
* motions of galaxies and intergalactic dust and gas within galaxy clusters ([[computational astrophysics]])

All of the above fields overlap, but are sometimes treated as separate, especially the study of the motion of stars within [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[interacting galaxy|interactions between whole galaxies]], which both tend to rely heavily on [[fluid mechanics]] (whole stars being particles of the “fluid”).{{cn | date = August 2018}}

==History==
{{For|early theories of the causes of planetary motion|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

Modern analytic celestial mechanics started with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] of 1687. The name "celestial mechanics" is more recent than that.  Newton wrote that the field should be called "rational mechanics." The term "dynamics" came in a little later with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and over a century after Newton, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] introduced the term "celestial mechanics."  Prior to Kepler there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using [[Greek astronomy#Eudoxan astronomy|geometrical]] or [[Babylonian astronomy#Neo-Babylonian astronomy|arithmetical]] techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets' motion.

===Johannes Kepler===
{{For|detailed treatments of how his laws of planetary motion can be used|Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian problem}}

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571&amp;ndash;1630) was the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century  to [[Copernicus]], with physical concepts to produce a [[Astronomia nova|''New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics'']] in 1609.  His work led to the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|modern laws of planetary orbits]], which he developed using his physical principles and the [[planet]]ary observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]]. Kepler's model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before [[Isaac Newton]] developed his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] in 1686.

===Isaac Newton===
[[Isaac Newton]] (25&amp;nbsp;December 1642&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;March 1727) is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as [[planet]]s, the [[Sun]], and the [[Moon]], and the motion of objects on the ground, like [[cannon]] balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of [[physical law]]s.  In this sense he unified ''celestial'' and ''terrestrial'' dynamics.  Using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], proving Kepler's Laws for the case of a circular orbit is simple. Elliptical orbits involve more complex calculations, which Newton included in his [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]].

===Joseph-Louis Lagrange===
After Newton, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange#Astronomy|Lagrange]] (25&amp;nbsp;January 1736&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;April 1813) attempted to solve the [[three-body problem]], analyzed the stability of planetary orbits, and discovered the existence of the [[Lagrangian points]].  Lagrange also reformulated the principles of [[classical mechanics]], emphasizing energy more than force and developing a [[Lagrangian mechanics|method]] to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and [[comet]]s and such.  More recently, it has also become useful to calculate [[spacecraft]] [[trajectory|trajectories]].

===Simon Newcomb===
[[Simon Newcomb]] (12&amp;nbsp;March 1835&amp;ndash;11&amp;nbsp;July 1909) was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised [[Peter Andreas Hansen]]'s table of lunar positions.  In 1877, assisted by [[George William Hill]], he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884, he conceived with A. M. W. Downing a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in [[Paris]], France in May 1886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.

===Albert Einstein===
[[Albert Einstein]] (14&amp;nbsp;March 1879&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;April 1955) explained the anomalous [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of Mercury's perihelion]] in his 1916 paper ''The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity''.  This led astronomers to recognize that [[Newtonian mechanics]] did not provide the highest accuracy.  [[Binary pulsar]]s have been observed, the first in 1974, whose orbits not only require the use of [[General Relativity]] for their explanation, but whose evolution proves the existence of [[gravitational radiation]], a discovery that led to the 1993 Nobel Physics Prize.

==Examples of problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Celestial motion, without additional forces such as [[thrust]] of a [[rocket]], is governed by gravitational acceleration of masses due to other masses. A simplification is the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where the problem assumes some number ''n'' of spherically symmetric masses. In that case, the integration of the accelerations can be well approximated by relatively simple summations.

:Examples:
:*4-body problem: spaceflight to Mars (for parts of the flight the influence of one or two bodies is very small, so that there we have a 2- or 3-body problem; see also [[Patched conic approximation|the patched conic approximation]])
:*3-body problem:
:**[[Quasi-satellite]]
:**Spaceflight to, and stay at a [[Lagrangian point]]

In the case that ''n''=2 ([[two-body problem]]), the situation is much simpler than for larger ''n''. Various explicit formulas apply, where in the more general case typically only numerical solutions are possible. It is a useful simplification that is often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*A [[binary star]], e.g., [[Alpha Centauri]] (approx. the same mass)
:*A [[binary asteroid]], e.g., [[90 Antiope]] (approx. the same mass)

A further simplification is based on the "standard assumptions in astrodynamics", which include that one body, the [[orbiting body]], is much smaller than the other, the [[central body]]. This is also often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*[[Solar system]] orbiting the center of the [[Milky Way]]
:*A planet orbiting the Sun
:*A moon orbiting a planet
:*A spacecraft orbiting Earth, a moon, or a planet (in the latter cases the approximation only applies after arrival at that orbit)

==Perturbation theory==
{{main|Perturbation theory}}
[[Perturbation theory]] comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]], which [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|are ancient]].) The earliest use of modern [[perturbation theory]] was to deal with the otherwise unsolveable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s solution for the orbit of the [[Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].

[[Perturbation theory|Perturbation methods]] start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is carefully chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]], which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]]), or a circular orbit, which is only correct in special cases of two-body motion, but is often close enough for practical use.

The solved, but simplified problem is then ''"perturbed"'' to make its [[differential equation|time-rate-of-change equations for the object's position]] closer to the values from the real problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third, more distant body (the [[Sun]]). The slight changes that result from the terms in the equations – which themselves may have been simplified yet again – are used as corrections to the original solution. Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a remarkably better approximate solution to the real problem.

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, for most problems the recycling and refining of prior solutions to obtain a new generation of better solutions could continue indefinitely, to any desired finite degree of accuracy.

The common difficulty with the method is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit ''"It causeth my head to ache."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Cropper |first1=William H. |title=Great Physicists: The life and times of leading physicists from Galileo to Hawking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 |date=2004 |page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This general procedure – starting with a simplified problem and gradually adding corrections that make the starting point of the corrected problem closer to the real situation – is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering. It is the natural extension of the "guess, check, and fix" method [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|used anciently with numbers]].

==Principles==
This is done for two reasons:

===From a [[Light transport theory|physics of light transport]] point of view===
The energy reaching the pixel comes from the whole [[solid angle]] by which the eyes see the pixel in the scene, not from its central sample. This yields the key notion of '''pixel footprint''' on surfaces or in the [[texture space]], which is the back projection of the pixel on the scene.

The description above corresponds to the [[pinhole camera]] simplified optics classically used in [[computer graphics]]. Note that this approach can also represent a lens-based camera and thus [[depth of field]] effects, using a cone whose cross-section decreases from the lens size to zero at the [[focal plane]], and then increases.

Moreover, a real optical system does not focus on exact points because of [[Airy disc|diffraction]] and imperfections. This can be modeled as a [[point spread function]] (PSF) weighted within a solid angle larger than the pixel.

===From a signal processing point of view===
Ray-tracing images suffer strong [[aliasing]] because the "projected geometric signal" has very high frequencies exceeding the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist-Shannon maximal frequency]] that can be represented using the pixel sampling rate, so that the input signal has to be low-pass filtered - i.e., integrated over a solid angle around the pixel center.

Note that contrary to intuition, the filter should not be the pixel footprint since a [[Rectangular function|box filter]] has poor spectral properties. Conversely, the ideal [[sinc function]] is not practical, having infinite support and possibly negative values. A [[Gaussian filter|Gaussian]] or a [[Lanczos resampling|Lanczos]] filter are considered good compromises.

==Computer graphics models==
Cone and Beam early papers rely on different simplifications: the first considers a circular section and treats the intersection with various possible shapes. The second treats an accurate pyramidal beam through the pixel and along a complex path, but it only works for [[polyedrical]] shapes.

Cone tracing solves certain problems related to [[Sample (signal)|sampling]] and aliasing, which can plague conventional ray tracing. However, cone tracing creates a host of problems of its own. For example, just intersecting a cone with scene geometry leads to an enormous variety of possible results. For this reason, cone tracing has remained mostly unpopular. In recent years, increases in computer speed have made [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] algorithms like [[distributed ray tracing]] - i.e. stochastic explicit integration of the pixel - much more used than cone tracing because the results are exact provided enough samples are used. But the convergence is so slow that even in the context of off-line rendering a huge amount of time is required to avoid [[Image noise|noise]]. Recent works focus on removing this noise with machine learning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3072959.3073601 |title=Interactive reconstruction of Monte Carlo image sequences using a recurrent denoising autoencoder |journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2017 |last1=Chaitanya |first1=Chakravarty R.

Differential cone-tracing, considering a differential angular neighborhood around a ray, avoids the complexity of exact geometry intersection but requires a LOD representation of the geometry and appearance of the objects. [[Mipmap|MIPmapping]] is an approximation of it limited to the integration of the surface texture within a cone footprint. Differential ray-tracing &lt;ref&gt;Homan Igehy. "Tracing Ray Differentials". http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/papers/trd/&lt;/ref&gt; extends it to textured surfaces viewed through complex paths of cones reflected or refracted by curved surfaces.

'''Conversation analysis''' ('''CA''') is an approach to the study of [[social interaction]], embracing both verbal and non-verbal conduct, in situations of everyday life. CA began with a focus on casual [[conversation]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but its methods were subsequently adapted to embrace more task- and institution-centered interactions, such as those occurring in doctors' offices, courts, law enforcement, helplines, educational settings, and the mass media. As a consequence, the term 'conversation analysis' has become something of a misnomer, but it has continued as a term for a distinctive and successful approach to the analysis of sociolinguistic interactions.

== History ==
Inspired by [[Harold Garfinkel]]'s [[ethnomethodology]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Garfinkel, Harold (1967). Studies in Ethnomethodology. Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erving Goffman]]'s conception of the interaction order,&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving (1983). The Interaction Order. American Sociological Review 48:1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; CA was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist [[Harvey Sacks]] and his close associates [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Schegloff, Emanuel (1992) Introduction. In Harvey Sacks, Lectures on Conversation (Vol.1: Fall 1964 – Spring 1968). Oxford, Blackwell: ix–lxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Today CA is an established method used in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology. It is particularly influential in [[interactional sociolinguistics]], [[discourse analysis]] and [[discursive psychology]].

== Method ==
Conversational analysis begins by setting up a problem connected with a preliminary hypothesis. The data used in CA is in the form of video- or audio-recorded conversations, collected with or without researchers' involvement, typically from a video camera or other recording device in the room where the conversation takes place (e.g. medical doctors' consultations with patients). The researchers construct a detailed transcription from the recording, ideally with no details left out. After transcription, the researchers perform [[Statistical inference|inductive]] data-driven [[analysis]]  aiming to find recurring patterns of interaction. Based on the analysis, the researchers develop a rule or model to explain the occurrence of the patterns, enhancing, modifying or replacing the initial hypothesis.

== Basic structures ==

===Turn-taking organization===
{{Main|Turn-taking}}
{{technical|date=July 2013}}
The way that turns are made in conversation has been the subject of its own study. The [[Turn-taking|basic turn-taking]] model for conversation was identified from field recordings. The basic foundation for this idea is that the participants in a conversation are expected to express their utterances (phrases, sentences, or parts of either) during their turns. The most basic forms take place in two-person conversations where sentence completion or pause, for example, might be enough to justify the next turn to the co-other person. This has been discussed under the structure of 'adjacency pairs'.

In multi-party conversations the mechanisms were found to be more complicated where 'current speaker selects next' is a possibility, and how frequently individual utterances are tailored for the sequence of speakers within the conversation. The possibility of obtaining not only the next turn, but a series of turns (required for example in telling a joke or story) is documented in analyses of announcements and story prefaces. A certain balance in conversation could be located in the process whereby turns are allocated. That balance was directed at the 'turn commodity', but also in countless other instances, for example with person identifiers and locators where minimal forms are utilized to evenly distribute whom speaks during the conversation.

Other collections of turn allocation mechanisms include use of 'repeats', the [[elision]] of lexical forms (words), the use of temporal regulators in turns including chuckles, 'uhm', ‘yuh know’, and ‘right’, the use of speech particles like ‘uh’, and ‘oh’, and other specifically short-syllabic devices that are consonant-prefaced like ‘tih’.

According to CA, the turn-taking system consists of two distinct components: the allocation mechanism which is responsible for distributing a turn (in any case), and the lexical components that parties utilize in filling that turn while remaining sequentially implicit in order to deal with the contingency of conversations that forces turn taking to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, H., Schegloff, E. A., &amp; Jefferson, G. (1974). "[http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2376846/component/escidoc:2376845/Sacks_1974_simplest_systematics.pdf A simplest systematics for the organization of turn-taking for conversation]." ''Language, 50'', 696–735.&lt;/ref&gt;

The turn constructional component describes basic units out of which turns are fashioned. These basic''' units''' are known as ''[[turn constructional units|Turn construction unit]]'' or TCUs. Unit types include: lexical, clausal, phrasal, and sentential. 

The turn allocation component describes how participants organize their interaction by distributing turns to speakers which coincide with sequence organization which focuses on how actions are ordered in conversation.

At a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP)  which is a place in the conversation in where who is speaking shifts, a set of rules apply in quick succession so that turns are allocated instantly: &lt;br /&gt;
'''1. Current speaker selects next speaker''': this can be done by the use of addressing terms (e.g. names), initiating action with eye contact, initiating action that limits the potential eligible respondents and the availability of environmental cues (e.g. requesting the passing of salt in a situation where only a particular person is sitting close to the salt). &lt;br /&gt;
'''2. Next speaker self-selects''': when there is no apparent addressee and potential respondents, one might self-select to continue the conversation. This can be done by ''overlapping'', using ''turn-entry devices'' such as "well" or "you know"; and ''recycled turn beginning'', which is a practice that involves repeating the part of a turn beginning that gets absorbed in an overlap.&lt;br /&gt;
'''3. Current speaker continues''': If no one takes up the conversation, the original speaker may again speak to provide further information to aid the continuation of the conversation. This can be done by adding an increment, which is a grammatically fitted continuation of an already completed ''[[turn constructional units|turn construction unit]]'' (TCU). Alternatively, the speaker can choose to start a new TCU, usually to offer clarification or to start a new topic.

====Adjacency pairs====
Talk tends to occur in responsive pairs; however, the pairs may be split over a sequence of turns. Adjacency pairs divide utterance types into 'first pair parts' and 'second pair parts' to form a 'pair type'. 
There are lots of examples of adjacency pairs including Questions-Answers, Offer-Acceptance/Refusal and Compliment-Response. (Schegloff &amp; Sacks:1973) &lt;ref&gt;Schegloff, E &amp; Sacks, H. (1973) ''Opening Up Closings'' http://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/PDF/schegloffOpeningUpClosings.pdf  (p.74)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sequence expansion ====
Sequence expansion allows talk which is made up of more than a single adjacency pair to be constructed and understood as performing the same basic action and the various additional elements are as doing interactional work related to the basic action underway.&lt;br/&gt;Sequence expansion is constructed in relation to a base sequence of a ''first pair part'' (FPP) and a ''second pair part'' (SPP) in which the core action underway is achieved. It can occur prior to the base FPP, between the base FPP and SPP, and following the base SPP. &lt;br/&gt;1. '''Pre-expansion''': an adjacency pair that may be understood as preliminary to the main course of action. A generic pre-expansion is a summon-answer adjacency pair, as in "Mary?"/ "Yes?".It is generic in the sense that it does not contribute to any particular types of base adjacency pair, such as request or suggestion. There are other types of pre-sequence that work to prepare the interlocutors for the subsequent speech action. For example, "Guess what!"/"What?" as preliminary to an announcement of some sort, or "What are you doing?"/"Nothing" as preliminary to an invitation or a request. &lt;br/&gt;2. '''Insert expansion''': an adjacency pair that comes between the FPP and SPP of the base adjacency pair. Insert expansions interrupt the activity under way, but are still relevant to that action.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, G. (1972). Side sequences. Studies in social interaction, 294, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Insert expansion allows a possibility for a second speaker, the speaker who must produce the SPP, to do interactional work relevant to the projected SPP. An example of this would be a typical conversation between a customer and a shopkeeper: &lt;br/&gt;
:Customer: I would like a turkey sandwich, please. (FPP base)&lt;br/&gt;
:Server: White or wholegrain? (Insert FPP)&lt;br/&gt;
:Customer: Wholegrain. (Insert SPP)&lt;br/&gt;
:Server: Okay. (SPP base) &lt;br/&gt;
3. '''Post-expansion''': a turn or an adjacency pair that comes after, but is still tied to, the base adjacency pair. There are two types: minimal and non-minimal. Minimal expansion is also termed ''sequence closing thirds'', because it is a single turn after the base SPP (hence ''third'') that does not project any further talk beyond their turn (hence ''closing''). Examples of SCT include "oh", "I see", "okay", etc.

4. '''Silence:''' Silence can occur throughout the entire speech act but in what context it is happening depends what the silence means. Three different assets can be implied through silence:
* Gap: when the speaker stops talking without selecting the next speaker so there is a silence until a new participant self selects
* Lapse: when the current speaker stops talking, does not select a next speaker, and no one self selects causing the conversation to end even if for just a moment 
* Pause: the speaker selects the next person, but that person is silent creating a pause or silence that "belongs" to them

==== Preference organization ====
CA may reveal structural (i.e. practice-underwritten) preferences in conversation for some types of actions (within sequences of action) over others.  For example, responsive actions which agree with, or accept, positions taken by a first action tend to be performed more straightforwardly and faster than actions that disagree with, or decline, those positions (Pomerantz 1984; Davidson 1984). The former is termed an unmarked turn shape, meaning the turn is not preceded by silence nor is it produced with delays, mitigation and accounts. The latter is termed marked turn shape, which describes a turn with opposite characteristics. One consequence of this is that agreement and acceptance are promoted over their alternatives, and are more likely to be the outcome of the sequence. Pre-sequences are also a component of preference organization and contribute to this outcome (Schegloff 2007).

=== Repair ===
Repair organization describes how parties in conversation deal with problems in speaking, hearing, or understanding. Repair segments are classified by who initiates repair (self or other), by who resolves the problem (self or other), and by how it unfolds within a turn or a sequence of turns. The organization of repair is also a self-righting mechanism in social interaction (Schegloff, Jefferson, and Sacks 1977). Participants in conversation seek to correct the trouble source by initiating and preferring self repair, the speaker of the trouble source, over other repair (Schegloff, Jefferson, and Sacks 1977). Self repair initiations can be placed in three locations in relation to the trouble source, in a first turn, a transition space or in a third turn (Schegloff, Jefferson, and Sacks).

===Action formation===
This focuses on the description of the practices by which turns at talk are composed and positioned so as to realize one or another actions.

== Major dimensions ==
# '''Action:''' Organization of actions distinct from outside of a conversation. This could include openings and closings of conversations, assessments, storytelling, and complaints.
# '''Structure:''' All human social action is structured and has rules, conversation is no different. In order to participate in a conversation the participants must abide by these rules and structures to be an active participant 
# '''Intersubjectivity:''' Concerning the ways in which the participants’ intentions, knowledge, relations, and stances towards the talked-about objects is created, maintained, and negotiated

== Contrasts to other theories ==
In contrast to the research inspired by [[Noam Chomsky]], which is based on a distinction between competence and performance and dismisses the particulars of actual speech, Conversation Analysis studies naturally-occurring talk and shows that spoken interaction is systematically orderly in all its facets (cf. Sacks in Atkinson and Heritage 1984: 21–27).  In contrast to the theory developed by [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumperz]], CA maintains it is possible to analyze talk-in-interaction by examining its recordings alone (audio for telephone, video for copresent interaction). CA researchers do not believe that the researcher needs to consult with the talk participants or members of their [[speech community]].

It is distinct from [[discourse analysis]] in focus and method. (i) Its focus is on processes involved in social interaction and does not include written texts or larger sociocultural phenomena (for example, 'discourses' in the Foucauldian sense). (ii) Its method, following Garfinkel and Goffman's initiatives, is aimed at determining the methods and resources that the ''interacting participants'' use and rely on to produce interactional contributions and make sense of the contributions of others. Thus CA is neither designed for, nor aimed at, examining the production of interaction from a perspective that is external to the participants' own reasoning and understanding about their circumstances and communication. Rather the aim is to model the resources and methods by which those understandings are produced.

== Application in other fields ==
In recent years, CA has been employed by researchers in other fields, such as [[feminism]] and feminist linguistics, or used in complement with other theories, such as Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA). MCA was influenced by the work on Harvey Sacks and his work on Membership Categorization Device (MCD). Sacks argues that 'members’ categories comprise part of the central machinery of organization and developed the notion of MCD to explain how categories can be hearably linked together by native speakers of a culture. His example that is taken from a children's storybook (The baby cried. The mommy picked it up.) shows how "mommy" is interpreted as the mother of the baby by speakers of the same culture. In light of this, categories are inference rich&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Steve Kaplan|title=Conversation Analysis|url=http://stevekaplanentrepreneu.com/how-to-handle-3-types-of-conversation-hogs/|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a great deal of knowledge members of a society have about the society is stored in terms of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, H. (1992). "Lectures on Conversation, Volumes I and II" Edited by G. Jefferson with Introduction by E.A. Schegloff, Blackwell, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Stokoe|Stokoe]] further contends that members’ practical categorizations form part of ethnomethodology's description of the ongoing production and realization of ‘facts’ about social life and including members’ gendered reality analysis, thus making CA compatible with feminist studies.&lt;ref name="Stokoe2006"&gt;Stokoe, Elizabeth (2006). "On ethnomethodology, feminism, and the analysis of categorial reference to gender in talk-in-interaction", ''Sociological Review'' '''54''': 467–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency psychiatry''' is the clinical application of [[psychiatry]] in [[emergency medicine|emergency]] settings.&lt;ref name=Currier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Conditions requiring psychiatric interventions may include [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]], [[substance abuse]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[psychosis]], violence or other rapid [[behavior|changes in behavior]]. Psychiatric emergency services are rendered by professionals in the fields of [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]] and [[social work]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The demand for emergency psychiatric services has rapidly increased throughout the [[world]] since the 1960s, especially in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; Care for patients in situations involving emergency psychiatry is complex.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Individuals may arrive in psychiatric emergency service settings through their own voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through [[involuntary commitment]]. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic [[mental illness|mental disorders]] or symptoms similar to those conditions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

==Definition==
Symptoms and conditions behind psychiatric emergencies may include [[parasuicide|attempted]] [[suicide]], [[substance dependence]], [[alcohol intoxication]], acute [[clinical depression|depression]], presence of [[delusion]]s, violence, [[panic attack]]s, and significant, rapid changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen&gt;De Clercq, M.; Lamarre, S.; Vergouwen, H. (1998). ''Emergency Psychiatry and Mental Health Policty: An International Point of View''. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency psychiatry exists to identify and/or [[treatment of mental illness|treat]] these symptoms and psychiatric conditions. In addition, several rapidly lethal medical conditions present themselves with common psychiatric symptoms. A [[physician]]'s or a [[nurse]]'s ability to identify and intervene with these and other medical conditions is critical.&lt;ref name=Currier&gt;Currier, G.W. ''New Developments in Emergency Psychiatry: Medical, Legal, and Economic''. (1999). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of services==
The place where emergency psychiatric services are delivered are most commonly referred to as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. [[Mental health professional]]s from a wide area of disciplines, including [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] in these settings alongside [[psychiatrist]]s and emergency [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=Hillard&gt;Hillard, R. &amp; Zitek, B. (2004). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities, sometimes housed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], psychiatric ward, or [[emergency department]], provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients [[24 hours a day, 7 days a week]].&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Glossary |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/hospitals/articles/glossary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFNAMI&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=NAMI-San Francisco |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Crisis Service |url=http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710103126/http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time.&lt;ref name=AllenM&gt;Allen, M.H. (1995). ''The Growth and Specialization of Emergency Psychiatry''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 [[telephone counseling]].&lt;ref name=Hillard2&gt;Hillard, J.R. (1990). ''Manual of Clinical Emergency Psychiatry''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Since the 1960s the demand for emergency psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to [[deinstitutionalization]] both in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, has resulted in a larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community.  There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk&gt;Bassuk, E.L. &amp; Birk, A.W. (1984). ''Emergency Psychiatry: Concepts, Methods, and Practices''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;Lipton, F.R. &amp; Goldfinger, S.M. (1985). ''Emergency Psychiatry at the Crossroads''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;Hedges, D. &amp; Burchfield, C. (2006). ''Mind, Brain, and Drug: An Introduction to Psychopharmacology''. Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in psychiatric emergency service settings located in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen/&gt;

Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services have sometimes been able to offer accessibility, convenience, and anonymity.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; While many of the patients who have used psychiatric emergency services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed have not conformed to any single psychiatric profile.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerson S, Bassuk E |title=Psychiatric emergencies: an overview |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1980 |pmid=6986089|doi=10.1176/ajp.137.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individualized care needed for patients utilizing psychiatric emergency services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Scope==

===Suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts===
As of 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated one million suicides in the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE) |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are countless more suicide attempts. Psychiatric emergency service settings exist to treat the mental disorders associated with an increased risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide can stem from  many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological, and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Violent behavior===
Aggression can be the result of both internal and external factors that create a measurable activation in the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are [[homicide|homicidal]] in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DH |title=Suicide and violence assessment in psychiatry |journal=General hospital psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=416–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8937907 |doi= 10.1016/S0163-8343(96)00037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Psychosis===
Patients with [[psychotic]] symptoms are common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination of the source of the psychosis can be difficult.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting will not be able to provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

An individual could also be suffering from an acute onset of psychosis. Such conditions can be prepared for diagnosis by obtaining a medical or psychopathological history of a patient, performing a [[mental status examination]], conducting [[psychological testing]], obtaining [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]], and obtaining other neurophysiologic measurements. Following this, the mental health professional can perform a [[differential diagnosis]] and prepare the patient for treatment. As with other patient care considerations, the origins of acute psychosis can be difficult to determine because of the mental state of the patient. However, acute psychosis is classified as a medical emergency requiring immediate and complete attention. The lack of identification and treatment can result in suicide, homicide, or other violence.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Substance dependence, abuse and intoxication===
[[Image:Psychoactive Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|Illicit [[psychoactive drugs]], a cause of psychotic symptoms.]]
Another common cause of psychotic symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve after a period of observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency department, as it is a long term condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Both acute [[alcohol intoxication]] as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Acting as a [[depressant]] of the [[central nervous system]], the early effects of [[ethanol|alcohol]] are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete [[anesthesia]] of the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual [[hallucination]]s, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic [[alcoholic]]s may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. [[Antipsychotic]]s are often used to treat these symptoms.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Patients may also be treated for substance abuse following the [[route of administration|administration]] of psychoactive substances containing [[amphetamine]], [[caffeine]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[cocaine]], [[phencyclidine]]s, or other [[inhalant]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants]]. Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter [[denial]] and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary short and long term treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.&lt;ref name= Hillard/&gt;

===Hazardous drug reactions and interactions===
[[Drug overdose|Overdoses]], [[drug interaction]]s, and dangerous reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a potentially lethal complication of first or second generation antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If untreated, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; [[Serotonin syndrome]] can result when [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s mix with [[buspirone]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include [[hyperthermia]], delirium, and [[tachycardia]] that may lead to shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency department or medicine service for increased monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Personality disorders===
Disorders manifesting dysfunction in areas related to [[cognition]], [[affect (psychology)|affectivity]], interpersonal functioning and impulse control can be considered [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from a personality disorder will usually not complain about symptoms resulting from their disorder. Patients suffering an emergency phase of a personality disorder may showcase combative or suspicious behavior, suffer from brief psychotic episodes, or be delusional. Compared with outpatient settings and the general population, the prevalence of individuals suffering from personality disorders in inpatient psychiatric settings is usually 7–25% higher. Clinicians working with such patients attempt to stabilize the individual to their baseline level of function.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Anxiety===
Patients suffering from an extreme case of [[anxiety]] may seek treatment when all support systems have been exhausted and they are unable to bear the anxiety. Feelings of anxiety may present in different ways from an underlying medical illness or psychiatric disorder, a secondary functional disturbance from another psychiatric disorder, from a primary psychiatric disorder such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or as a result of stress from such conditions as [[adjustment disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Clinicians usually attempt to first provide a "safe harbor" for the patient so that assessment processes and treatments can be adequately facilitated.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; The initiation of treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are important as patients suffering from anxiety disorders have a higher risk of premature death.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Disasters===
[[Natural disaster]]s and [[man-made hazards]] can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. [[Emergency management]] often includes psychiatric emergency services designed to help victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon the scale of the disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Abuse===
Incidents of [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]] or [[rape]] can result in dangerous outcomes to the victim of the criminal act. Victims may suffer from extreme anxiety, fear, helplessness, confusion, eating or sleeping disorders, hostility, guilt and shame. Managing the response usually encompasses coordinating psychological, medical and legal considerations. Dependent upon legal requirements in the region, mental health professionals may be required to report criminal activity to a police force. Mental health professionals will usually gather identifying data during the initial assessment and refer the patient, if necessary, to receive medical treatment. Medical treatment may include a [[physical examination]], collection of medicolegal evidence, and determination of the risk of [[pregnancy]], if applicable.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatments in psychiatric emergency service settings are typically transitory in nature and only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term [[psychiatric rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Walker, J.I. (1983) ''Psychiatric Emergencies''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of psychiatric medication, [[psychotherapy]], or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] may be used in the emergency setting.&lt;ref name= Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=RundHutzler&gt;Rund, D.A, &amp; Hutzler, J.C. (1983). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. St. Louis: The C.V. Mosby Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, M. (2007, May 31). ''[http://www.nihrc.org/dms/data/NIHRC/attachments/dd/files/91/Mental_health_issues_(Michael_Potter).pdf Setting the Standards: Human Rights and Health – Mental Health]''. Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===Medications===
With time as a critical aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Pharmacokinetics]] is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the [[route of administration]], [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] and [[metabolism]] of the medication.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name=HolfordSheiner&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holford N.H.G |author2=Sheiner L.B. | year = 1981 | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in vivo | url = | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Bioengineering | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug must be able to get to the stomach and stay there.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; In cases of [[vomiting]] and nausea this method of administration is not an option. [[Suppositories]] can, in some situations, be administered instead.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Medication can also be administered through [[intramuscular injection]], or through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous injection]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug [[solubility]], gastrointestinal [[motility]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If a medication is administered orally the amount of [[food]] in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the [[blood–brain barrier]] to the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after [[haloperidol]], an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Antipsychotics]], especially [[Haloperidol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3298219|year=2012|author1=Wilson|first1=M.

W.|last4=Holloman Jr|first4=G. H.|last5=Feifel|first5=D|doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866|pmid=22461918}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as assorted [[benzodiazepines]] are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2507712|year=2008|author1=Wilhelm|first1=S|title=Use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in patients with psychiatric emergencies: Results of an observational trial|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=61|last2=Schacht|first2=A|last3=Wagner|first3=T|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-61|pmid=18647402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Other treatment methods may be used in psychiatric emergency service settings. [[Brief therapy|Brief psychotherapy]] can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===ECT===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is a controversial form of treatment which [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#Additional rights|cannot be involuntarily applied]] in psychiatric emergency service settings.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter/&gt; Instances wherein a patient is depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

==Observation and collateral information==
There are other essential aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The observation of the patient's behavior is an important aspect of emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation for a period of time may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.

Collateral information or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient. Some jurisdictions require consent from the patient to obtain this information while others do not. For example, with a patient who is thought to be paranoid about people following him or spying on him, this information can be helpful discern if these thoughts are more or less likely to be based in reality. Past episodes of suicide attempts or violent behavior can be confirmed or disproven.

==Disposition==
Patient receive emergency services often on a time limited basis such as 24 or 72 hours. After this time, and sometimes earlier, the staff must decide the next place for the patient to receive services. This is referred to as disposition. This is one of the essential features of emergency psychiatry.

===Hospital admission===
[[Image:EmergencyPsychiatryProcess.PNG|thumb|right|The emergency care process.]]
The staff will need to determine if the patient needs to be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient facility or if they can be safely discharged to the community after a period of observation and/or brief treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Initial emergency psychiatric evaluations usually involve patients who are acutely agitated, [[paranoid]], or who are suicidal. Initial evaluations to determine admission and interventions are designed to be as therapeutic as possible.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

====Involuntary commitment====
[[Involuntary commitment]], or sectioning, refers to situations where [[police officer]]s, health officers, or [[Health care provider|health professionals]] classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#5150 criteria|gravely disabled]], or mentally ill according to the applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed which may or may not result in [[involuntary treatment]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

====Referrals and voluntary hospitalization====
In some locations, such as the United States, voluntary hospitalizations are outnumbered by involuntary commitments partly due to the fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from [[assertive community treatment]] centers.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.

{{more footnotes|date=April 2011}}
An '''energy budget''' is a balance sheet of [[energy]] [[income]] against [[expenditure]]. It is studied in the field of [[Energetics]] which deals with the study of energy transfer and transformation from one form to another.  [[Calorie]] is the basic unit of measurement. An [[organism]] in a laboratory experiment is an open [[thermodynamic]] system, exchanging energy with its surroundings in three ways - heat, work and the potential energy of [[biochemical compounds]].

Organisms use ingested food resources (C=consumption) as building blocks in the synthesis of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] (P=production) and as fuel in the metabolic process that power this synthesis and other physiological processes (R=respiratory loss). Some of the resources are lost as waste products (F=faecal loss, U=urinary loss). All these aspects of metabolism can be represented in energy units.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The basic model of energy budget may be shown as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P = C - R - U - F or 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P = C - (R + U + F) or 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
C = P + R + U + F 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the aspects of metabolism can be represented in energy units (e.g. [[joules]] (J);1 [[calorie]] = 4.2 kJ).
Energy used for [[metabolism]] will be

&lt;blockquote&gt;
R = C - (F + U + P) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Energy used in the maintenance will be

&lt;blockquote&gt;
R + F + U = C - P
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


== Endothermy and ectothermy ==
Energy budget allocation varies for endotherms and ectotherms. [[Ectotherm]]s rely on the environment as a heat source while [[endotherm]]s maintain their body temperature through the regulation of metabolic processes. The heat produced in association with metabolic processes facilitates the active lifestyles of endotherms and their ability to travel far distances over a range of temperatures in the search for food.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Kimberly P.|last2=McDougall|first2=Freya O.|last3=Seymour|first3=Roger S.|date=2013-05-08|title=A review of the energetics of pollination biology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-013-0760-5|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|language=en|volume=183|issue=7|pages=867–876|doi=10.1007/s00360-013-0760-5|issn=0174-1578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ectotherms are limited by the ambient temperature of the environment around them but the lack of substantial metabolic heat production accounts for an energetically inexpensive metabolic rate. The energy demands for ectotherms are generally one tenth of that required for endotherms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Platonism}}

The '''Euthyphro dilemma''' is found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Euthyphro]]'', in which [[Socrates]] asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]], "Is the [[piety|pious]] ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) loved by the [[deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" ([[Stephanus pagination|10a]]) It implies that if moral authority must come from the gods it does not have to be good, and if moral authority must be good it does not have to come from the gods – a highly controversial idea at the time Socrates first presented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Was the Charge Against Socrates? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-the-charge-against-socrates-121060 |website=Thoughtco |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the argument applied to the many capricious gods of [[ancient Greece]], it has implications for the [[monotheism|monotheistic religions]] of today. "Is what is [[good and evil|morally good]] commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?"&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Leibniz stated, in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-010-1426-7_60#page-1 ''Reflections on the Common Concept of Justice''] (circa 1702):  "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a [[false dilemma]], and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.

==The dilemma==
Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's ''[[Euthyphro]]''. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods ([[:wikt:θεοφιλής|τὸ θεοφιλές]]), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).

At this point the [[dilemma]] surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very ''nature'' of the pious, but at most a ''quality'' of the pious (11ab).

==In philosophical theism==
The dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Leibniz]] presented this version of the dilemma: "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=516}}

Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar [[Terence Irwin]], the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2006}} More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in [[metaethics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.

=== God commands it because it is right ===

====Supporters====
The first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God ''because it is right'') goes by a variety of names, including [[intellectualism]], [[rationalism]], [[Moral realism|realism]], [[Natural law|naturalism]], and [[Moral universalism|objectivism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The [[Mu'tazilah]] school of [[Islamic theology]] also defended the view (with, for example, [[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Nazzam]] maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying),{{sfn|Wolfson|1976|p=579}} as did the [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Averroes]].{{sfn|Hourani|1962|pp=13–40}} [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue.{{sfn|Haldane|1989|p=40}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=I, pp. 553–556}} Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]] (adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal).{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}} Among later [[Scholastics]], [[Gabriel Vásquez]] is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's.{{sfn|Pink|2005}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=II, pp. 6–10}} [[Early modern period|Modern]] natural law theory saw [[Grotius]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] also putting morality prior to [[Will of God|God's will]], comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarists]] like [[Pufendorf]] in philosophical controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See esp. {{harvnb|Grotius|1625|loc=1.1.10}} and {{harvnb|Leibniz 1702(?)}}; see also {{harvnb|Leibniz|1706|pp=64–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Platonists]] like [[Benjamin Whichcote]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist [[metaethics]] of [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[Richard Price]];{{sfn|Gill|1999|loc=esp. pp. 272–74}}{{sfn|Mackie|1980|loc=Chapters 2, 8}}{{sfn|Gill|2011}} what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary [[Philosophy of religion|philosophers of religion]] who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include [[Richard Swinburne]]{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|pp=209–216}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}} and [[T. J. Mawson]]{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} (though see below for complications).

====Criticisms====

* [[Sovereignty]]: If there are moral standards independent of God's will, then "[t]here is something over which God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher. Moreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral standard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=247}} 18th-century philosopher [[Richard Price]], who takes the first horn and thus sees morality as "necessary and immutable", sets out the objection as follows: "It may seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally eternal and necessary."{{sfn|Price|1769|loc=Chapter 5}}
* [[Omnipotence]]: These moral standards would limit God's power: not even God could oppose them by commanding what is evil and thereby making it good.  This point was influential in Islamic theology: "In relation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Ash'ari]] got rid of the whole embarrassing problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act as a standard for God's action."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=276}} Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfn|Haldane|1989|pp=42–43}} As contemporary philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] puts the point, this horn "seems to place a restriction on God's power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and also] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to do what, independently of his will, is wrong."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}}
* [[Free will|Freedom of the will]]: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God's freedom of will: God could not command anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance with them.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} for a detailed discussion of this problem; also see {{harvnb|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6.22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Mark Murphy (philosopher)|Mark Murphy]] puts the point, "if moral requirements existed prior to God's willing them, requirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God's liberty would be compromised."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#2.1 Metaethical theological voluntarism: Considerations in Favor]}}
* [[Secular morality|Morality without God]]: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its authority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early modern political theorist [[Hugo Grotius]]: "What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him"{{sfn|Grotius|1625|loc=Prolegomenon, 11}} On such a view, God is no longer a "law-giver" but at most a "law-transmitter" who plays no vital role in the foundations of morality.{{sfn|Kretzmann|1999|p=423}} [[Nontheism|Nontheists]] have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming [[Argument from morality|moral arguments for God's existence]]: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the starting gate.{{sfn|Oppy|2009|pp=352–356}}

====Responses to criticisms====
Contemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a "subjective theory of value" that makes morality arbitrary.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=143–145}} They accept a theory of morality on which, "right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what ''anyone'' believes, wants, or prefers."{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=145–147}} They do not address the aforementioned problems with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of "maximal power", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not [[omnibenevolent]]). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=166, 173–176}}

[[Richard Swinburne]] and [[T. J. Mawson]] have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to ''necessary'' moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still affect ''contingent'' moral truths.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 11}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: "Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}} This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]]: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=192ff}} This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 9}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=217–222}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=26–29}} On the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|p=211}} Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=211–215}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|pp=10–12}} Second, God can make an ''indirect'' moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=29–32}}

===It is right because God commands it===

====Supporters====

The second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right ''because it is commanded by God'') is sometimes known as [[divine command theory]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by [[Duns Scotus]], who argued that not all [[Ten Commandments]] belong to the [[Natural Law]] in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.

[[William of Ockham]] went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Quodlibeta'' 3.13&lt;/ref&gt; and even to ''hate'' God.&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Reportata'' 4.16; see also {{harvnb|Osborne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Scholastics]] like [[Pierre D'Ailly]] and his student [[Jean Gerson|Jean de Gerson]] explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not "command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ailly, Pierre. ''Questions on the Books of the Sentences'' 1.14; quoted in {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}}, quoting Idziak 63–4; see {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}} for similar quotes from Gerson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant]] reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that "for [God's] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it",{{sfn|Luther|1525|loc=§88}} and Calvin writing that "everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it."{{sfn|Calvin|1536|loc= 3.23.2}} The voluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by [[Descartes]], who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and that God was therefore capable of giving [[circles]] unequal [[radii]],{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 25}} giving [[triangles]] other than 180 internal degrees, and even making [[contradictions]] true.{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 235}} Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: "why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?"{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 343}} [[Thomas Hobbes]] notoriously reduced the justice of God to "irresistible power"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "Of Liberty and Necessity" 12&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing the complaint of [[John Bramhall|Bishop Bramhall]] that this "overturns... all law").&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "A Defense of True Liberty", 12f&lt;/ref&gt; And [[William Paley]] held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested "urge" to avoid [[Hell]] and enter [[Heaven]] by acting in accord with God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, William. "Principles" 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's [[Ash'ari|Ash'arite theologians]], [[al-Ghazali]] foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view "was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=270}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Frank|1994|pp=32–36}} for the view that al-Ghazali incorporated rationalist elements that moved him away from traditional Ash'arite voluntarism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wittgenstein]] said that of "the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good", that which holds that "the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it" is "the deeper", while that which holds that "God wills the good, because it is good" is "the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as though' that which is good could be given some further foundation".&lt;ref name=Janik&gt;{{harvnb|Janik|Toulmin|1973|p=194}}. The passage is also quoted in {{harvnb|Baggett|2002|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).

====Criticisms====

This horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:

* No reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based on reasons: "if theological voluntarism is true, then God's commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but] it cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some moral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining rather than another."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#3.2 Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism: Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness]}} And as [[Michael J. Murray]] and [[Michael Rea]] put it, this would also "cas[t] doubt on the notion that morality is genuinely objective."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|pp=246–247}} An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain how true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by him.{{sfn|Doomen|2011}}
* No reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God's status as a [[Wisdom|wise]] and [[Rationality|rational]] being, one who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: "Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act."{{sfn|Leibniz|1686|loc=II}}
* Anything goes:{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} This arbitrariness would also mean that ''anything'' could become good, and ''anything'' could become bad, merely upon God's command. Thus if God commanded us "to gratuitously inflict pain on each other"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} or to engage in "cruelty for its own sake"{{sfn|Adams|1973}} or to hold an "annual sacrifice of randomly selected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged suffering for its victims",{{sfn|Morriston|2009|p=249}} then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] put it: "nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.1.5}}
* Moral [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]: If morality depends on the [[Free will|perfectly free will]] of God, morality would lose its necessity: "If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves, then goodness can change [[Possible world|from world to world]] or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those who believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} In other words, no action is necessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action which is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued that divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral [[supervenience]].{{sfn|Klagge|1984|pp=374–375}}
* Why do God's commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander has some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very commands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for God's commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his own will. As Cudworth put it: "For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of commanding others, and others {{sic}} obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own making, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in all laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer {{sic}} will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of the commander."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.2.4}} To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for creating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to our benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] writes: "Is the Reason exciting to concur with the Deity this, 'The Deity is our Benefactor?' Then what Reason excites to concur with Benefactors?"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1742|loc=I}} Or finally, one might resort to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s view: "The right of nature whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he required obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his ''irresistible power''."{{sfn|Hobbes|loc=31.5}} In other words, [[might makes right]].
* God's goodness: If ''all'' goodness is a matter of God's will, then what shall become of ''God's'' goodness? Thus [[William P. Alston]] writes, "since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to say that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he preaches, whatever that might be;"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} Hutcheson deems such a view "an insignificant [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], amounting to no more than this, 'That God wills what he wills.'"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1738|loc=2.7.5}} Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command theorists "deprive God of the designation ''good'': for what cause could one have to praise him for what he does, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?"{{sfn|Leibniz|1710|p=176}} A related point is raised by [[C. S. Lewis]]: "if good is to be ''defined'' as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is emptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as those of the 'righteous Lord.'"{{sfn|Lewis|1943|p=79}} Or again Leibniz: "this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the devil."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=561}} That is, since divine command theory trivializes God's goodness, it is incapable of explaining the difference between God and an all-powerful demon.
* The [[is-ought problem]] and the [[naturalistic fallacy]]: According to [[David Hume]], it is hard to see how moral propositions featuring the relation ''ought'' could ever be deduced from ordinary ''is'' propositions, such as "the being of a God."{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=3.1.1.27}} Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral ''oughts'' from ordinary ''ises'' about God's commands.{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}} In a similar vein, [[G. E. Moore]] argued (with his [[open question argument]]) that the notion ''good'' is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms are guilty of the so-called "naturalistic fallacy."{{sfn|Moore|1903|loc=Chapters 1, 2, 4}} This would block any theory which analyzes morality in terms of God's will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that "when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the attitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever."{{sfn|Moore|1912|p=79}}
* No morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God's will, then if God does not exist, there is no morality. This is the thought captured in the slogan ([[q:Fyodor Dostoyevsky#The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880)|often attributed to Dostoevsky]]) "[[The Brothers Karamazov|If God does not exist, everything is permitted.]]" Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for their view or a virtue of their view. [[Argument from morality|Many argue]] that morality does indeed require God's existence, and that this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] contends that this idea ("that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God") is one that "will seem (at least initially) implausible to many", and that his theory must "dispel [an] air of paradox."{{sfn|Adams|1979|p=77}}

====Restricted divine command theory====

One common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between ''value'' and ''obligation''. Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a ''restricted'' divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the [[deontic]] region of obligation. This response is found in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s discussion of natural law and voluntarism in ''De legibus''{{sfn|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6 "Is the natural law truly a preceptive divine law?"}} and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1973}}, esp. p. 109 and {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=esp. p. 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip L. Quinn]],{{sfn|Quinn|2007|loc=esp. p. 71}} and William P. Alston.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=306–307}}

A significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=317–318}} God could not issue horrible commands: God's own essential goodness{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}}{{sfn|Quinn|2007|pp=81–85}}{{sfn|Alston|1990|p=317}} or loving character&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1979}}. In this early work, Adams's view is that it is logically possible but "unthinkable" that God would issue horrible commands: "the believer's concepts of ethical rightness and wrongness would break down in the situation in which he believed that God commanded cruelty for its own sake" (p. 324). In later work, Adams contends that "God ''cannot'' be sadistic" ({{harvnb|Adams|1999|p=47}}).&lt;/ref&gt; would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=252–253}} These proposed solutions are controversial,&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms, see {{harvnb|Chandler|1985}}; {{harvnb|Morriston|2001}}; {{harvnb|Shaw|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Zagzebski|2004|pp=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} on the problems of divine omnipotence and freedom of the will&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then on what ''does'' it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=Chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Quinn|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alston|1990}} distances himself from Platonism; see also {{harvnb|Kretzmann|1999|pp=375–376}} for a similar solution, put in terms of divine simplicity.&lt;/ref&gt; Alston offers the analogy of [[Metre#Prototype metre bar|the standard meter bar in France]]. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why ''God'' is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is "the end of the line," with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=318–322}} On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's ''will'', it still depends on ''God'', and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.

This solution has been criticized by [[Wes Morriston]]. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those properties good because God has them?{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=253}} Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's essential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=266}}

Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], disputing the perspective that "God is good" and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are "caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Practical Ethics|edition= 3d|last= Singer|first= Peter|year= 1993|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8|pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False dilemma===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like [[William James]]{{sfn|James|1891}} and Wittgenstein&lt;ref name=Janik/&gt; later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic [[abstract object|abstracta]] independently of God.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=186}} Classical [[Judaeo-Christian]] theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} "The classical tradition," Rogers notes, "also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|2008|p=186}}; see also {{harvnb|Rogers|2000|pp=127–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, "Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value."{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}}

====Jewish thought====
The basis of the false dilemma response—God's nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[prophet]]s, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], [[Hosea]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] and [[Isaiah]]. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before [[Thales]], traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) "Their message," writes British scholar [[Norman H. Snaith]], "is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=59}}. Written over many centuries by many authors, the Old Testament displays a marked ethical evolution in its portrayal&amp;nbsp;– and therefore understanding&amp;nbsp;– of God. In its earliest-written books, God appears at times as no more than a nationalistic tribal deity who orders the extermination of entire peoples hostile to Israel, such as the [[Midianites]] (Numbers 31: 1–54) and [[Amalekites]] (1 Samuel 15: 1–25). By the time of Amos, however, such "primitive and immature notions" are a thing of the past ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|loc=p. 52; see also pp. 61–62, 66–67}}). For a recent overview, see {{harvnb|Head|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not least in its "special consideration for the poor and down-trodden."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|pp=68–69}}. It was this "bias towards the poor and needy" ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=70}}) in the message of the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ that inspired the "[[preferential option for the poor]]" of late-twentieth-century Latin American [[liberation theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Snaith observes, ''tsedeq'', the Hebrew word for [[righteousness]], "actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land." This includes justice, but goes beyond it, "because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=70}} ''Tsedeq'' "is the norm by which all must be judged" and it "depends entirely upon the Nature of God."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}

Hebrew has few [[abstract noun]]s. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=174}} In contrast to the Greek ''[[dikaiosyne|dikaiosune]]'' (justice) of the philosophers, ''tsedeq'' is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:
{{quote|''Tsedeq'' is something that happens here, and can be seen, and recognized, and known. It follows, therefore, that when the Hebrew thought of ''tsedeq'' (righteousness), he did not think of Righteousness in general, or of Righteousness as an Idea. On the contrary, he thought of a particular righteous act, an action, concrete, capable of exact description, fixed in time and space.... If the word had anything like a general meaning for him, then it was as it was represented by a whole series of events, the sum-total of a number of particular happenings.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}}}
The Hebrew stance on what came to be called the [[problem of universals]], as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|pp=9, 187–188}} This has not changed. In 2005, [[Jonathan Sacks]] wrote, "In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist."{{sfn|Sacks|2005|p=164}} Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as "misleading" because "it is not exhaustive": it leaves out a third option, namely that God "acts only out of His nature."{{sfn|Sagi|Statman|1995|pp=62–63}}

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Like [[Aristotle]], Aquinas rejected Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics]'', Bk. 1, lectio 10, n. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness.{{sfn|McInerny|1982|pp=122–123}} On this analysis, the abstract "good" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, "Good is what all desire."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' 1.1; Aquinas, ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics]'' 1, 9 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 5,1}} As he clarified, "When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 6,2 ad 2}} In other words, even those who desire evil desire it "only under the aspect of good," i.e., of what is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics'' 1,10.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II q24, a2}}

Aquinas's discussion of [[sin]] provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. "Every sin," he writes, "consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I/II 72,2}} Thus, "in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II 58,2 and I/II 77,2}} "No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' 4,92.&lt;/ref&gt; God, however, has full knowledge ([[omniscience]]) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed&amp;nbsp;– for instance, by [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who wrote: "There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil"&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Nicolai. ''Ethik'' (3rd edition). Berlin, 1949, p. 378. Cited in {{harvnb|Pieper|2001|pp=78–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. [[Josef Pieper]], however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly [[anthropomorphic]] conception of God.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer.htm De Veritate]'' 24,3 ad 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a sign, of freedom (''quodam libertatis signum'').&lt;ref name=Ver22&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 22,6.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, "it does not belong to the [[essence]] of the free will to be able to decide for evil."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 24,3 ad 2; ''Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard'' 2d,44,1,1 ad 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom."&lt;ref name=Ver22/&gt; It is precisely humans' creatureliness&amp;nbsp;– that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient&amp;nbsp;– that makes them capable of sinning.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=80}} Consequently, writes Pieper, "the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom&amp;nbsp;– contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue."{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} Pieper concludes: "Only ''the'' will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act"{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 63,1 }}{{sfn|Pieper|2001|pp=80–81}}&amp;nbsp;– and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.

====William James====
William James, in his essay "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: "Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}} Moral obligations are created by "personal demands," whether these demands&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gale|1999|p=44}}: In his essay, "James used 'desire', 'demand' and 'claim' interchangeably, using 'desire' and 'demand' each eleven times and 'claim' five."&lt;/ref&gt; come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that "ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well." However, whether "the purely human system" works "as well as the other is a different question."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}}

For James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls "the easy-going and the strenuous mood."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker's "various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value;&lt;ref&gt;James is acutely aware of how hard it is to "avoid complete moral skepticism on the one hand, and on the other escape bringing a wayward personal standard of our own along with us, on which we simply pin our faith." He briefly discusses several notions "proposed as bases of the ethical system", but finds little to help choose among them. ({{harvnb|James|1891|loc=Section III}})&lt;/ref&gt; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power." Our attitude is "entirely different" in a world where there are none but "finite demanders" from that in a world where there is also "an infinite demander." This is because "the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands", for in that case, "actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach." Even though "exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us", our postulation of him serves "to let loose in us the strenuous mood"{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} and confront us with an [[existential]]{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=40}} "challenge" in which "our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In the words of Richard M. Gale, "God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably ''good''. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the ''Euthyphro''."{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=44}}

==In philosophical atheism==
===Atheistic resolutions===
[[Atheism]] challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed).  This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.

[[Secular humanism]] takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy.  Some secular humanists believe in [[ethical naturalism]], that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge.  Others have adopted [[moral relativism]] in the sense of [[meta-ethics]] – the idea that ethics are a [[social construct]] – but nonetheless by way of [[utilitarianism]] advocate imposing a set of [[moral universalism|universal ethics]] and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy.  These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: "Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?"

===Rejection of universal morality===
The other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by.  [[Moral nihilism]] challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely.  This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.

[[Moral relativism]] accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth.  This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws).  "Normative moral relativism" asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of [[religious pluralism]], strong [[relativism]] it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.

==In popular culture==
In the song "[[No Church in the Wild]]" from the album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', rapper [[Jay Z]] references the dilemma with the line, "Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? [[Socrates]] asked whose bias do y'all seek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-no-church-in-the-wild-lyrics#note-314340|title=Kanye West – No Church in the Wild Lyrics|accessdate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In American legal thinking==

[[Yale Law School]] Professor [[Myres S. McDougal]], formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, "Do we protect it because it's a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ScopeProtnProb.pdf  ''Scope-of-Protection Problems With Patents and Copyrights on Methods of Doing Business''], 10 {{smcaps|Fordham Intell. Prop., Media &amp; Ent.}} L.J. 105, 128 n.100 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'', 324 U.S. 499 (1945), Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] addressed whether there was a protectable property interest in a head of water lessened by federal action. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]ot all economic interests are "property rights;" only those economic advantages are "rights" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. ... We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a "property right;" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests.&lt;ref&gt;324 U.S. at 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's majority (per Justice Jackson) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. A dissenting opinion, however, considered that property rights existed ''a priori'' and that they dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48529">[[Promiscuity]] tends to be frowned upon by many societies, expecting most members to have [[Committed relationship|committed, long-term relationships]] with single partners.

Most societies have historically been more critical of women's promiscuity than of [[heterosexual]] men's. Among women, as well as men, inclination for sex outside committed relationships is correlated with a high [[libido]],&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; but social and cultural factors have also been observed to influence sexual behavior and opinion.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Regan&amp;Atkins2006" /&gt;

{{See also|Hormones and sexual motivation|Sexual desire#Sex differences in sexual desire|Libido#Factors}}

Studies have related [[sociosexual orientation]] to [[sex drive]], especially in women, where the higher the sex drive the less restricted the sociosexual orientation, or interest in sex outside [[committed relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=RF |title=Gender and erotic plasticity: Sociocultural influences on the sex drive |doi=10.1080/14681990410001691343 |journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=133–139 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, pertaining to the [[nature and nurture]] debate, there is some data emphasizing cultural factors, more so for women than for men.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R.

Men tend to have higher sociosexuality scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmitt |first1=DP |year=2005 |title=Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=247–311 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000051 |pmid=16201459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmitt |first1=DP |year=2007 |title=Sexual strategies across sexual orientations: How personality traits and culture relate to sociosexuality among gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and heterosexuals |journal=Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–214 |doi=10.1300/J056v18n02_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is more variability in scores within each gender than between men and women, indicating that although the average man is less restricted than the average woman, individuals may vary in sociosexual orientation regardless of gender.&lt;ref name="Gangestad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad |first1=SW |last2=Simpson |first2=JA |year=2000 |title=The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=573–587 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0000337X |pmid=11301543|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/GangestadSimpson2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Contrary to popular belief, [[Body image|body esteem]] in women showed a significant positive correlation with sociosexual unrestrictedness.&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; So did [[Waist–hip ratio|hip-to-waist ratio]] and two measures of [[virilization]].&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; Finally, still in the same study, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption correlated, too, but it is unclear whether the latter promoted the former or vice versa, or if a third variable was at play.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clard |first=AP |url=http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~psapc/pdfs/Clark%282004%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=Self-perceived attractiveness and masculinization predict women's sociosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=25 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(03)00085-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130054024/http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~psapc/pdfs/Clark%282004%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] women tend to be less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both homo- and heterosexual women. In sociosexual behavior also, bisexual women reported being more unrestricted, followed by homo- and then heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="Schmitt" /&gt;

[[Power (social and political)|Social power]] has been popularly associated with sexual [[wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] among men; experimental psychologists have linked power with sexual infidelity among women also. A Dutch study involving a large survey of 1,561 professionals, concluded that "The relationship between power and infidelity was the same for women as for men, and for the same reason. These findings suggest that the common assumption (and often-found effect) that women are less likely than men to engage in infidelity is, at least partially, a reflection of traditional gender-based differences in power that exist in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lammers |first1=J |last2=Stoker |first2=JI |last3=Jordan |first3=J |last4=Pollmann |first4=MMH |last5=Stapel |first5=DA |year=2011 |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/9/1191.short |title=Power increases infidelity among men and women |journal=Psychological Science |doi=10.1177/0956797611416252 |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1191–7 |pmid=21771963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church (building)|Church]]-attending women score lower on promiscuity than other women, while men appear to lack this correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fagan |first1=PF |last2=Nicholas |first2=Z |url=https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF11L30.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Benefits of Religious Attendance |journal=Marri Research |date=December 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study published in ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' found that there was a correlation between female pre-marital promiscuity and higher rates of divorce.  The research, conducted by Jay Teachman, found that women with 16 or more sexual partners prior to marriage had an 80% rate of subsequent divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Teachman, Jay, "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00444.x/abstract Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation, and the Risk of Subsequent. Marital Dissolution Among Women]", ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'', September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology ===

Men and women leading [[polyandrous]] lifestyles have higher levels of [[testosterone]]. However, it is unclear whether higher levels of testosterone cause increased sex drive and in turn multiple partners or whether sexual activity with multiple partners causes the increase in testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Anders |first1=SM |last2=Hamilton |first2=LD |last3=Watson |first3=NV |title=Multiple partners are associated with higher testosterone in North American men and women |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=454–459 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.01.002 |pmid=17316638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociosexuality in women is positively correlated with two measures of [[prenatal]] exposure to [[androgens]]—right [[digit ratio]], and scores on the [[Mental rotation#Vandenburg and Kuse|Vandenberg Mental Rotation test]]—providing some limited support to the [[virilization]] hypothesis of female promiscuity&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; (see also [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation]]). The aforementioned hypothesis is not at all mutually exclusive with other hypotheses.

Libido is correlated with the [[menstrual cycle]] so that many women experience an increase in sexual desire several days immediately before [[ovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullivant |first1=SB |last2=Sellergren |first2=SA |last3=Stern |first3=Kathleen |title=Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=February 2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=82–93 (in online article, see pp.14–15, 18–22) |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |pmid=15216427 |doi=10.1080/00224490409552216 |last4=Spencer |first4=Natasha A. |last5=Jacob |first5=Suma |last6=Mennella |first6=Julie A. |last7=McClintock |first7=Martha K. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923001735/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |archivedate=2007-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone levels rise gradually from about the 24th day of a woman's menstrual cycle until ovulation on about the 14th day of the next cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods, and Potential |last=Lichterman |first=Gabrielle |isbn=978-1-59337-345-0}}{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the high-testosterone period before ovulation, a woman typically feels more attracted to masculine facial features and is more likely to pursue short-term mating.

It is common for sex drive to diminish dramatically after [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrel |first=PM |title=Psychosexual effects of menopause: role of androgens |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=180 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=S319–24 |year=1999 |pmid=10076172 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies, including [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s, have concluded that the average age group in which women are the most active sexually is their mid-thirties, one study liberally estimating 27-45 as the limits of the age group (the average man peaks earlier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton |first1=JA |last2=Confer |first2=JC |last3=Goetz |first3=CD |last4=Buss |first4=DM |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/students/easton/PAID_RE_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reproduction expediting: Sexual motivations, fantasies, and the ticking biological clock |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=516–520 |place=The University of Texas at Austin |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616102925/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/students/easton/PAID_RE_final.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in this age group typically report having sexual fantasies greater in number and intensity, engaging in sexual activity more frequently, and being more interested in casual sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloud |first=John |title=The Science of Cougar Sex: Why Older Women Lust |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2007422,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study in [[sexual antagonism]] suggested a possible genetic link between female [[Androphilia|androphilic]] promiscuity and [[Homosexuality|male androphilia]]: [[Samoa]]n tribal women exhibited a correlation between reproductive output and the likeliness of having androphilic grandsons, though not nephews (see also [[Fa'afafine]]).&lt;ref name="fa'afafine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VanderLaan |first1=DP |last2=Forrester |first2=DL |last3=Petterson |first3=LJ |last4=Vasey |first4=PL |year=2012 |title=''Offspring Production among the Extended Relatives of Samoan Men and ''Fa'afafine |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036088 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=e36088 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036088 |editor1-last=Vitzthum |editor1-first=Virginia J|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...736088V |pmid=22558342 |pmc=3338633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rate of molecular evolution of the seminal protein gene [[SEMG2]] correlates with levels of female promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorus |first1=S |last2=Evans |first2=PD |last3=Wyckoff |first3=GJ |last4=Choi |first4=SS |last5=Lahn |first5=BT |title=Rate of molecular evolution of the seminal protein gene SEMG2 correlates with levels of female promiscuity |journal=Nat.

[[Bateman's principle]] implies that females are choosy because there is little evolutionary advantage for them to mate with multiple males. However, observation of many species, from [[rabbit]]s to [[tephritidae|fruit flies]], has shown that females have more offspring if they mate with a larger number of males. This seemingly contradicts Bateman's theory, specifically his conclusion that "while males had more children the more partners they mated with, females did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judson |first=Olivia |author-link=Olivia Judson |title=Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice To All Creation |place=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2002 |isbn=0-8050-6331-5 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to Bateman's principle abound, as do hypotheses explaining the evolution of female promiscuity. Females in fact have a lot to gain, depending on the species (see [[Bateman's principle#Females can be promiscuous|here]]).

Many species once thought monogamous, including such birds as [[swan]]s, are now known to engage in [[Promiscuity#Extra-pair copulation in non-humans|extra-pair copulations]].

== Society and culture ==

[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s have theorized that taboos against female promiscuity evolved on the basis of [[Non-paternity event|paternity anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson |first1=Margo |last2=Daly |first2=Martin |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/themanwho.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel |year=1992 |place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA test]]s being yet to be invented, it was impossible to accurately determine paternity, unlike maternity. A male risked spending [[paternal investment]] on offspring who carried genetic material of another male rather than of his own. Evolutionarily, this translated into [[sexual jealousy]] and complex preventive customs (e.g., [[female genital mutilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html |title=Female genital mutilation |publisher=World Health Organization |date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[menstrual taboos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassman |first=BI |year=1992 |title=The function of menstrual taboos among the Dogon: defense against cuckoldry? |journal=Human Nature |volume=3 |pages=89–131 |doi=10.1007/BF02692249 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Pre-Modern ===

Female promiscuity is a recurring theme in mythologies and religions. In the Middle East, [[sacred prostitution]], usually in honor of Goddess [[Astarte]], had been prevalent before the 4th century when Emperor [[Constantine I]] attempted to replace pagan traditions with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html |title=3.55}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html |title=3.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[nymph]]s are portrayed as dangerous nature spirits sexually uninhibited with humans; hence, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] medical term ''[[Wiktionary:nymphomania|nymphomania]]''. [[Imperial Rome]] is popularly seen as being sexually profligate,&lt;ref&gt;Beert C. Verstraete and Vernon Provencal, introduction to ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 5. For an extended discussion of how the modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early [[Christian polemic]], see Alastair J.L. Blanshard, "Roman Vice," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 1–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and certain Roman empresses—such as [[Theodora I]], [[Messalina]] and [[Julia the Elder]]—gained in their lifetime a reputation of extreme promiscuity.
{{Quote|text=
On the field of pleasure she [Empress Theodora] was never defeated. Often she would go picnicking with ten young men or more, in the flower of their strength and virility, and dallied with them all, the whole night through. … and even thus found no allayment of her craving … And though she flung wide three gates to the ambassadors of [[Cupid]], she lamented that nature had not similarly unlocked the straits of her bosom, that she might there have contrived a further welcome to his emissaries.|

The [[Bible]] features many female personages identified as being promiscuous, among them the [[Whore of Babylon]], [[Jezebel|Princess Jezebel]], [[Thyatira|Prophetess Jezebel]], [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], [[Rahab]], [[Salome]], and [[Zuleika (legendary)|Potiphar's unnamed wife]].

Female genital mutilation is found in many African and a few Asian societies.

The development of [[chastity belts]], apparently in the 14th century, proved handy to men worried about the prospect of their wives committing [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill, Reay. ''Sex in history'' (1980). New York: Stein and Day. p.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
[[File:Catherine II (Rotari type, GIM) by shakko.jpg|thumb|150px|Empress [[Catherine the Great]], a crucial figure at the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], is popularly remembered for [[Legends of Catherine the Great|her sexual promiscuity]].]]

Many cultures have historically laid much restriction on sexuality, most emphatically against immoderate expression of sexuality by women. In contrast, some recent ethical philosophies—both secular (coming from [[individualism]] and [[sex-positive feminism]]) and religious (e.g., [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[LaVeyan Satanism]])—either tolerate it or outright celebrate it.
{{Quote|text=
We believe that it is fundamentally a radical political act to deprivatize sex. So much oppression in our culture is based on shame about sex: the oppression of women, of cultural minorities, oppression in the name of the (presumably asexual) family, oppression of sexual minorities. We are all oppressed. We have all been taught, one way or another, that our desires, our bodies, our sexualities, are shameful. What better way to defeat oppression than to get together in communities and celebrate the wonders of sex?|

Public opinion has fluctuated over the centuries, with such downturns as [[Puritan#Family life|New England Puritanism]] (1630—1660) and the [[Victorian era]] (1837—1901), when [[hypersexuality]] was often treated as an exclusively female disorder, diagnosed on the grounds of as little as masturbation alone (see [[Hypersexuality#Nymphomania in the Victorian age|here]]).&lt;ref name=Frick&gt;{{cite web|last=Frick |first=Katie L. |title=Women's Mental Illness: A Response to Oppression |url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml#spinsters |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=26 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061024/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml |archivedate=30 March 2010 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the late 20th century, women could be incarcerated for promiscuous behavior in so-called [[Magdalene asylum]]s, the last of which was closed in Ireland in 1996.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/world/europe/25iht-abuse25.html?_r=3 |title=Irish Church's Forgotten Victims Take Case to U.N. |last=Ryan |first=Carol |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-archer.co.uk/history/magdalene1.htm |title=The Magdalene Laundry |author=Alison Roberts |year=2003 |publisher=The-archer.co.uk |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutionalised |author=Garth Toyntanen |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558501-0-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1958, [[Ontario]] used the [[Velma Demerson|Female Refuges Act]] to incarcerate women felt to be "incorrigible".

Following the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1760~1840), as Western countries underwent [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], education and employment opportunities were increasing for women. This environment gave rise in the late 19th century to the feminist ideal called "the [[New Woman]]"—a personification of female economic, sexual and other autonomy—which had a profound influence on feminism well into the 20th century. It wasn't until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] that female British citizens were no longer legally compelled, upon marriage, to transfer all their property to their husbands. The [[Women's Movement]] was closely [[Free love#Free love and the women's movement|allied]] with the [[free love]] movement, whose advocates had a strong belief that a woman ought to be herself [[Self-ownership|sovereign over her body]].

{{Quote|text=Laws against adultery [were] [[Adultery#Historical context|based]] upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman … has …  an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal [[Wiktionary:hausfrau|hausfrau]], if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her!|

The 1950s in America is stereotyped to have been sexually repressed, though not as severely as the Victorian era. Female promiscuity in particular became substantially more accepted in [[Western world|Western]] culture after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, which resonated with the [[hippie movement]]. It also became more prevalent a theme in [[mass media]], including cinema (e.g., ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'') and music (e.g., ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has been at the forefront of the [[gender neutrality|gender neutrality]] movement in terms of promiscuity since becoming a globally recognized entertainer in the 1980’s. In addition to her sexually explicit song lyrics and occasional nude self exposures during live performances and almost being arrested in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, on May 29, 1990 for simulating masturbation in public &lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6582939/madonna-masturbation-like-a-virgin-controversy-toronto-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;, her book [[Sex (book)|Sex]] released on Oct 21, 1992 was a commercially successful nude pictorial of her and various famous celebrities engaging in scenes of purported promiscuity, further enhancing her vision of gender equality in this regard.

Although [[polygyny]] is more common, some tribal societies are traditionally [[polyandrous]].

== Statistics ==

The use of [[demographical]] methods in [[sexological]] research was pioneered by the American zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]], who published two books—''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953)—collectively known as the [[Kinsey Reports]]. The reports defied the expectations of the public and paved the way for the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s.

Accurately assessing people's sexual behavior is difficult, since there are strong social and personal motivations, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity. Women tend to undervalue the number of their sex partners whereas men tend to overestimate the number of theirs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In a 1994 study in the United States, almost all married heterosexual women reported having sexual contact only with their husbands, and unmarried women almost always reported having no more than one sexual partner in the past three months. [[Lesbian]]s who had a long-term partner reported having fewer outside partners than heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199410063311407 |last1=Friedman |first1=RC |last2=Downey |first2=JI |year=1994 |title=Homosexuality |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=331 |issue=October 6, 1994, Number 14 |pages=923–930 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/14/923#R10 |pmid=8078554}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research, however, contradicts the assertion that heterosexual women are largely [[monogamous]]. A 2002 study estimated that 45% to 55% of married heterosexual women engage in sexual relationships outside their marriage.&lt;ref name="Atwood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atwood |first=JD |last2=Schwartz |first2=L |title=Cyber-Sex  The New Affair Treatment Considerations |journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy: Innovations in Clinical and Educational Interventions |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=37–56 |doi=10.1300/J398v01n03_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the estimates for heterosexual males in the same study were greater (50%–60%), the data indicates that a significant portion of married heterosexual women have or have had sexual partners other than their spouse as well.&lt;ref name="Atwood" /&gt;

One international study found women to be more variable than men in their sex drive.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt; International measurements of promiscuity are inconsistent from study to study, varying by the methodology used. Due to practical reason—the inability to survey a country's entire population—all studies of this class are [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], generalizing about the general population based on assessments of sample groups supposed to be representative of the larger population being studied.

For example, in a non-scientific study conducted by the condom-making company [[Durex]], British women reported fewer partners than British men, while the only country where women reported more sex partners than men did was [[New Zealand]] (20.4 versus 16.8), which was also the country where women reported more sex partners than did women from all other countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/13/1191696214489.html |title=New Zealand women most promiscuous |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further complicate matters, a well-known study in general sociosexuality that surveyed 14,059 people across 48 countries, placed New Zealand, which came right before [[Slovenia]], second to [[Finland]]; the [[United States]], in the unisex scores of the same study, came in 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitt |first=David |title=Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: a 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating |journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |pages=247–75; discussion 275–311 |year=2005 |pmid=16201459 |issue=2 |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000051 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226234624/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
[[File:Order-cuckoldry-ca1815-French-satire.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ca. 1815 French satire on [[cuckoldry]], which shows both men and women wearing horns.]]
Sexual relations with multiple males are termed ''[[polyandry]]''. It has a more specific meaning in zoology, where it refers to a type of [[mating system]], and in anthropology, where it refers to a type of [[marriage]]. Sexual relations with multiple females are termed ''[[polygyny]]'', but in zoology it can only be applied to heterosexual relations. [[Polyamory]] is sometimes defined as [[non-monogamy]] with consent of all parties involved, if within or without [[committed relationship]]s. Attitudinal differences concerning sex outside committed relationships are referred to under the term ''[[sociosexual orientation]]'' or simply ''sociosexuality''.

Since at least 1450, the word ''[[slut]]'' has been used, often pejoratively, to describe a sexually promiscuous woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|slut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In and before the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era]]s, terms like "strumpet" and "whore" were used to describe women deemed promiscuous, as seen for example in [[John Webster]]'s 1612 play ''[[The White Devil]]''.

Discrimination targeting individuals, specifically women, for sexual behavior deemed excessive, has been referred to, since at least spring of 2010, with the [[neologism]] ''[[slut shaming]]'' (also hyphenated, as ''slut-shaming'').&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

''[[Cuckold]] fetish'' is colloquial for a [[paraphilia]] in which sexual gratification is gained from maintenance or observation of sexual relations by a woman with a man or a number of men besides her husband, boyfriend or long-term male sex partner.

The popular slang ''[[Cougar (slang)|cougar]]'' refers to a woman who seeks sexual relations with considerably younger men.

The term ''[[fallen woman]]'' was used to describe a woman who has "lost her innocence", and fallen from the grace of God. In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the "loss or surrender of a woman's chastity". Its use was an expression of the belief that to be socially and morally acceptable a women's sexuality and experience should be entirely restricted to marriage, and that she should also be under the supervision and care of an authoritative man.

In [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]], '''foreplay''' is a set of [[emotionally intimate|emotionally]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate]] acts between two or more people meant to create [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual desire|desire]] for [[sexual activity]]. Foreplay results in physiological and mental responses in both parties in anticipation of the expected sexual activity. Either or any of the [[sexual partner]]s may indicate sexual interest and initiate foreplay, and the initiator may not be the active partner during the sexual activity. Foreplay stimulates both partners' sexuality, lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]]s and increases emotional intimacy between partners, and implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners. In [[animal sexual behavior]], the loose equivalent is sometimes termed 'precoital activity'.

Sexual desire is an aspect of a [[Human sexuality|person's sexuality]], which varies from one person to another. A person who desires sexual activity with another person can attempt to provoke sexual arousal in the person. Depending on the type and intensity of the relationship between the two people, the stimuli may involve indicating to the person in some subtle and romantic way that he or she has that desire or by provoking other [[erotic stimuli]]. There are many potential stimuli, both [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical]] and [[Stimulus (psychology)|mental]], which can cause a person to become sexually aroused, and which stimuli are invoked will depend on circumstances at a particular time.

On the other hand, there are other things which act as turn-offs, depending on the person's preferences. The response to an indication of sexual interest may be inhibited by issues of [[sexual morality]].

==Initiating==
[[File:Nipping the Nape.png|thumb|Foreplay by [[kissing]] on female's back]]

Foreplay can begin with one person indicating in some manner to another person a desire to engage in sexual activity with that other person. Any act that creates and enhances [[sexual desire]], interest, [[sexual stimulation|stimulation]] or arousal in a sexual partner may constitute foreplay. An indication of sexual desire can be through physical intimacy, such as [[kissing]], [[Physical intimacy|touching]], [[Hug|embracing]] or nibbling the partner. Mental engagement can also create sexual interest, such as [[flirting]], talking, whispering or [[teasing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/foreplay foreplay] cambridge.org&lt;/ref&gt; It may, for example, be a non-physical gesture that indicates sexual availability. Sexual interest can be indicated and created by [[nudity]], such as by one partner [[striptease|stripping]], or by wearing sexually suggestive clothing, or by creating a romantic, intimate, or overtly sexual atmosphere. The manual or oral touching of an [[erogenous zone]] may indicate sexual interest, as does an intimate kiss on the [[mouth]], [[breast]]s, [[stomach]], [[buttocks]], back and inner [[thigh]]s or other areas of the body. A passionate or [[French kiss]] commonly indicates sexual interest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php Foreplay Tricks To Improve Your Sexual Relations: Deep kissing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220060836/http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php |date=2010-02-20 }} Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt; as does any removal of a partner's clothing.

Verbally, foreplay may include compliments, subtle comments with [[double entendre]], and intimate conversations. Non-verbally, foreplay can include provocative clothing, suggestive postures and motions, [[personal grooming|preening]] gestures, winking, licking or biting one's lips, standing inside a partner's [[personal space]], and holding a gaze longer than would be expected from only a casual interest.

Foreplay commences when the other partner indicates reciprocal sexual interest. Depending on the context, the non-objection to a partner's advances may indicate that the sexual interest is reciprocated, as may a response to a kiss or hug. The non-objection to the touching of an erogenous zone, or the taking off of an item of clothing may indicate reciprocated sexual interest. Also, the other partner may indicate reciprocal interest by engaging in intimate behaviour of their own.

There are situations which act as turn-offs or which can affect the romantic or erotic moment that may have been created. Turn-offs can range from things like bad breath, body odor, excessive noise or a reference to an ex-partner. A person's [[sexual inhibition]] can also impact on creation or maintenance of sexual interest. Some people feel uncomfortable with acts such as [[French kiss]]ing, or the possibility of someone (e.g. children) intruding, or nudity, besides other situations.

==Games==
[[Sexual role-playing]] or sex games can create sexual interest.&lt;ref name="FGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreplaygames.net |title=Fore Play Games |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can be played in a variety of situations, and have been enhanced by technology. This type of extended foreplay can involve SMS messaging, phone calls, [[online chat]], or other forms of distance communication, which are intended to stimulate fantasizing about the forthcoming encounter. This tantalization builds up sexual tension.

A card or board game can be played for foreplay. The objective of the game is for the partners to indulge their fantasies. The loser can, for example, be required to [[strip games|remove clothing]] or give the winner a sensual [[foot massage]] or any other thing that the winner wants to try. A sensuous atmosphere can also be enhanced by candles, drinks, sensual food or suggestive clothing. Even a suggestion of the use of [[sex toys]] or the playing of games involving [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], [[sexual bondage]], [[blindfolding]] or [[sploshing]] is an indication of sexual interest.

Some couples create sexual interest by watching [[erotic]] and [[pornography|pornographic]] videos. [[Role play]]ing may involve the partners wearing [[costumes]], to create and maintain a [[sexual fantasy]]. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence and then the other continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. 'Strangers for a day' is a role playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to [[flirt]] and [[seduce]] the other, without doing or saying anything that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.

==Tantric==
Tantric foreplay is the first step in the lovemaking session, according to the [[tantra]] principles. [[Tantric sex]] is against rushing things for the purpose of reaching an [[orgasm]], so tantric foreplay is a way to prepare the body and the mind for the union between the two bodies. The tantric rules say that foreplay must be focused on the preparation before sexual intercourse. Tantric foreplay may include sensual baths between the two partners in a relaxing atmosphere. [[Fragrance oil]] and candles may also be used to set up the mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Van Lysebeth |first = Andre |title = Tantra: the cult of the feminine |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-81-208-1759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric foreplay is only about giving each other time to connect [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and bind. Staring at each other while in a cross-legged position and touching the other's hand palms is a usual foreplay tactic used by tantra practitioners.
Tantric foreplay may also include [[Tantra massage]]s. The massage that is applied, according to the tantric philosophy, is not for reaching orgasms but for giving each other pleasure and connecting at a spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123012018/http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archivedate=2011-11-23|title=Tantra foreplay techniques|author=Mental Foreplay online portal|date=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which is purely physiological.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femaleforeplay.com |title=Female Foreplay Before Intercourse |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, foreplay implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners and creates intimacy.

Psychologically, foreplay lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] and increases [[emotional intimacy]] between partners. Physically, it stimulates the process that produces [[sexual arousal]].

Foreplay has important physical and psychological effects on women. The biggest issue related to the ability of achieving orgasms is thought to be solved with the right foreplay techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplayforwomen.net/mental.html Mental foreplay for women] Retrieved on 2010-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the subject of the effectiveness of foreplay continues to be a point of discussion. An example of this is a European survey of 2,300 women in Prague which showed that foreplay is not the key in a satisfactory sexual act. Instead "the duration of intercourse – 16.2 minutes on average – is the clincher".&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3405928/Foreplay-is-overrated-researchers-claim.html "Foreplay is overrated, researchers claim"] 2010-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Foreplay can vary dramatically based on age, religion, and cultural norms. In spite of the clichéd modern folklore that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become physically aroused, recent scientific research refutes that myth. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada used the method of [[thermography|thermal imaging]] to record baseline [[temperature]] change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060930094145.htm Thermal Imaging Shatters Arousal Gender Gap Myth; Study Shows Women Become Aroused As Quickly As Men]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not take into account the amount of time necessary to become mentally aroused. There are hypotheses that relates foreplay as a factor which would increase fertility rates although more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Segura-Sampedro JJ. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987716300226 Foreplay, a selected strategy that might be able to increase fertility rates.] Medical Hypotheses (2016). {{doi|10.1016/j.mehy.2016.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are many historical references to foreplay, with many artistic depictions. The [[History of India|Ancient Indian]] work ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessbuildersbanquet.com/software/kamasutra.pdf translation], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama205.htm biting types], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama204.htm using nails]&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions [[BDSM]] activities such as slapping and moaning as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm slapping] Kama Sutra&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1109">In [[computability theory]], a '''Friedberg numbering''' is a [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] (enumeration) of the set of all [[recursively enumerable set|uniformly recursively enumerable sets]] that has no repetitions: each recursively enumerable set appears exactly once in the enumeration (Vereščagin and Shen 2003:30).

The existence of such numberings was established by [[Richard M. Friedberg]] in 1958 (Cutland 1980:78).

&lt;/score&gt;|width=110|caption=[[Acciaccatura]] notation}}A '''grace note''' is a kind of [[music notation]] denoting several kinds of musical [[ornament (music)|ornaments]]. It is usually printed smaller to indicate that it is melodically and harmonically nonessential. When occurring by itself, a single grace note normally indicates the intention of an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]. When they occur in groups, grace notes can be interpreted to indicate any of several different classes of ornamentation, depending on interpretation.

==Notation==
In notation, a grace [[Musical note|note]] is distinguished from a regular note by print size.  A grace note is indicated by printing a note much smaller than a regular note, sometimes with a slash through the note stem (if two or more grace notes, there might be a slash through the note stem of the first note but not the subsequent grace note). The presence or absence of a slash through a note stem is often interpreted to indicate the intention of an acciaccatura or an appoggiatura, respectively.

The works of some composers, especially [[Frédéric Chopin]], may contain long series of notes printed in the small type reserved for grace notes simply to show that the amount of time to be taken up by those notes as a whole unit is a subjective matter to be decided by the performer. Such a group of small printed notes may or may not have an accompanying principal note, and so may or may not be considered as grace notes in analysis.

==Function==
A grace note represents an [[ornament (music)|ornament]], and distinguishing whether a given singular grace note is to be played as an appoggiatura or acciaccatura in the [[performance practice]] of a given historical period (or in the practice of a given [[composer]]) is usually the subject of lively debate. This is because we must rely on literary, interpretative accounts of performance practice in those days before such time as [[audio recording]] was implemented, and even then, only a composer's personal or sanctioned recording could directly document usage.

As either an [[ornament (music)#Appoggiatura|appoggiatura]] or an [[ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]], grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them. This longer note, to which any grace notes can be considered harmonically and melodically subservient (except in the cases of certain appoggiaturas, in which the ornament may be held for a longer duration than the note it ornaments), is called the ''principal'' in relation to the grace notes.

A Grace note or notes is always noted in terms of exactly half of its principal note, but may be double or more. Where they are multiple, their proper notation must always equal exactly half of the principal note. (i.e. If the principal note is a quarter-note the grace note must be notated as an eighth- note, two sixteenth notes, four thirty-second notes, or eight sixty-fourth notes, if we are to set aside the concept of unnatural subdivisions of the beat such as the triplet, etc.) Grace notes, unlike what are referred to as [[cue-note]]s, never affect the rhythmic subdivision, or musical "count" of the bar in which they are contained - and therefore, do not require other notes to be dropped from the bar to keep the time signature intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/piano/playing-grace-notes-trills-and-glissandos-on-the-piano/ , et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in music==
In [[bagpipe]] music there is extensive use of grace notes. Indeed, because the [[chanter]] is not tongued but supplied by a continuous air source from the bag, grace notes are sometimes the only way to differentiate between notes. For example, inserting a grace note between two [[Quarter note|crotchet]]s (quarter notes) played at the same pitch is the only way to indicate them as opposed to them sounding like a single [[Half note|minim]] (half note). Various multiple grace note ornaments are formalised into distinct types, such as ''doublings'', ''throws'', and ''birls''. A single grace note is played on the beat as is the first grace note of a complex ornament such as a doubling. Some complex ornaments, such as ''taorluath'' can be played starting or ending on the beat. Grace notes are typically played as short as possible by lifting the fingers quickly and a short distance off the [[chanter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aVehSJE4P4 BagpipeLessons.com Secrets of Top Pipers: Gracenotes by Jori Chisholm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern editions of [[European classical music|Western classical]] works, editors often seek to eliminate the potential for different interpretations of ornamental symbology, of which grace notes are a prime example, by converting a composer's original ornamental notation into literal notation, the interpretation of which is far less subject to variation. Most modern composers, although by no means all of them, have followed this trend in the ''prima facie'' notation of their works.

In the context of [[Indian classical music]] ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] (North Indian), [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] (South Indian)) some specific forms of notes ([[Swara|swara-s]]) fulfill the technique of playing a note ([[swara]]). Such [[Ornament (music)|ornamentic]]  in Indian Classical Music is important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a [[raga]]. Some notes are linked with its preceding and succeeding note; these linked notes are called '''Kan-swars''' (= ''grace notes'').{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Kan-swars deal with so called ''touch notes''. ''sparsh'' means "touch" in [[Hindi]] ([[Devanagari]]). These ''grace notes'' ([[Ornament (music)#Acciaccatura|acciaccatura]]) are often referred to as '''sparsh-swars'''. ''Kan-swars'' or ''sparsh-swars'' can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways: 
# using a swift short ''glide'' ([[meend]] or [[ghaseet]]),
# as a ''Sparsh'' (technique of playing a note on a plucked stringed instrument, the movement of notes is ascending) and
# as a ''Krintan'' (the opposite of a Sparsh, movement of notes is descending).
In a book on Sitar compositions, Kan has been defined as 'fast deflection which can be approached while descending or ascending'. The act of Kaṇ being repeated twice, thrice or four times in a single stroke of mizrāb is called Krintan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omenad.net/articles/omeswarlipi.htm Sitar Compositions in Ome Swarlipi.

'''Honglujing Stele''' ({{zh|t=鴻臚井|s= 鸿胪井|p=Hónglújǐng}}) is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, &amp; 2 meters thick. It has 29 [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters written on it.

It is the only [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) stele from [[Manchuria]]. It mentions the 1st king of the [[Balhae]] around 698 - 926 CE. The king listed on the tablet is [[Go of Balhae]].

This kingdom is considered [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, or independent, depending on the nationality of the researcher. Russian and Japanese scholars classify it as an independent [[Mohe people|Mohe]] state.

It is currently located in the [[Japanese Imperial Palace]]. It was taken from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Lüshun]] city in about 1907 after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.

[[Artificial intelligence]] researchers have developed several specialized '''programming languages for artificial intelligence''':

== Languages ==
* [[AIML]] (meaning "Artificial Intelligence Markup Language")&lt;ref name="AIML_Repository"&gt;according to (the intro page to) the [http://nlp-addiction.com/chatbot/aiml/ AIML Repository] at nlp-addiction.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[XML]] dialect&lt;ref name="alicebot.org_aiml"&gt;See the [http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html AIML "Intro" (web) page] at www.alicebot.org&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]]-type [[chatterbot]]s. 
* [[Information Processing Language|IPL]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=46–48}}
&lt;/ref&gt; was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, such as lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=723–821}}
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=59–62}},
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on [[lambda calculus]]. [[Linked list]]s are one of the Lisp language's major [[data structure]]s, and Lisp [[source code]] is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new [[domain-specific language|domain-specific programming language]]s embedded in Lisp. There are many dialects of Lisp in use today, among which are [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[Clojure]].
* [[Smalltalk]] has been used extensively for simulations, neural networks, machine learning and genetic algorithms. It implements the purest and most elegant form of object-oriented programming using message passing.
* [[Prolog]]&lt;ref&gt;
History of logic programming:
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=190–196}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Prolog]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=477–491}},
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=641–676, 575–581}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running ''queries'' over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.
* [[STRIPS]] is a language for expressing [[automated planning and scheduling|automated planning problem instance]]s. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.
* [[Planner (programming language)|Planner]] is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.
* [[POP-11]] is a [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]] [[programming language]] with many of the features of an [[interpreted language]]. It is the core language of the [[Poplog]] [[Computer programming|programming]] [[system platform|environment]] developed originally by the [[University of Sussex]], and recently in the [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/ School of Computer Science] at the [[University of Birmingham]] which hosts [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html the Poplog website], It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], who find POP syntax more familiar than that of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]. One of POP-11's features is that it supports [[first-class function]]s.
*[[R (programming language)|R]] is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis, the use of Bayesian inference, neural networks and in general [[Machine Learning]]. In domains like finance, biology, sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard languages. It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation, functional programming and object-oriented programming. It supports deep learning libraries like [[MXNet]], [[Keras]] or [[TensorFlow]]. 
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is widely used for artificial intelligence, with packages for a number of applications including General AI, [[Machine Learning]], [[Natural Language Processing]] and [[Neural Network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence Python For Artificial Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101045354/http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence |date=2012-11-01 }} Python Wiki 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also a very good programming language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for search trees. The language's features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of purity.
* [[Wolfram Language]] includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, and image.&lt;ref name="Wolfram Language"&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html Wolfram Language]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C++]] (2011 onwards)
* [[MATLAB]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Julia (programming language)]], e.g. for machine learning, using native or non-native libraries.

'''Lotka's law''',&lt;ref name=seminalarticle&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lotka, Alfred J.|year=1926|title=The frequency distribution of scientific productivity|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|volume=16|issue=12|pages=317&amp;ndash;324}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Alfred J. Lotka]], is one of a variety of special applications of [[Zipf's law]].  It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  contributions in a given period is a fraction of the number making a single contribution, following the formula  &lt;math&gt;1/x^{a}&lt;/math&gt;  where ''a'' nearly always equals two, i.e., an approximate [[inverse-square law]], where the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article.  As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent.  There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc.  Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are discipline-specific.

[[File:Lotka plot.png|thumb|Graphical plot of the Lotka function described in the text, with C=1, n=2]]
The general formula says:
:&lt;math&gt;
X^n Y = C
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = C / X^n, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' is the number of publications, ''Y'' the relative frequency of authors with ''X'' publications, and ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are constants depending on the specific field (&lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt;).

== Example ==
Say 100 authors write at least one article each over a specific period, we assume for this table that C=100 and n=2. Then the number of authors writing portions of any particular articles in that time period is describe as in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Portion of articles written
! Number of authors writing that number of articles
|-----
| 10 || 100/10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
|-----
| 9 || 100/9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1 (1.23)
|-----
| 8 || 100/8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (1.56)
|-----
| 7 || 100/7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (2.04)
|-----
| 6 || 100/6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3 (2.77)
|-----
| 5 || 100/5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4
|-----
| 4 || 100/4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 6 (6.25)
|-----
| 3 || 100/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 11 (11.111...)
|-----
| 2 || 100/2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25
|-----
| 1 || 100
|}

That would be a total of 294 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.

This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result.  This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".&lt;ref name=discreteLotka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egghe |first=Leo |year=2005

In [[engineering]], a '''mechanical singularity''' is a position or configuration of a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] or a [[machine]] where the subsequent behaviour cannot be predicted, or the forces or other physical quantities involved become infinite or [[Determinism|nondeterministic]].

When the underlying engineering equations of a mechanism or machine are evaluated at the singular configuration (if any exists), then those equations exhibit [[mathematical singularity]].

Examples of mechanical singularities are [[gimbal lock]] and in static mechanical analysis, an under-constrained system.

[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]

== Types of singularities ==
There are three types of singularities that can be found in mechanisms: direct-kinematics singularities, inverse-kinematics singularities, and combined singularities. These singularities occur when one or both Jacobian matrices of the mechanisms becomes singular of rank-deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/56660|title=Singularity analysis of closed-loop kinematic chains - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the input and output velocities of the mechanism are defined by the following general equation:

&lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}\dot{\textbf{x}}+\textbf{B}\dot{\textbf{q}}=\textbf{0}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}
&lt;/math&gt;is the output velocities, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{q}}
&lt;/math&gt;is the input velocities, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}
&lt;/math&gt;is the direct-kinematics Jacobians, and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{B}
&lt;/math&gt;is the inverse-kinematics Jacobian.

=== Type-I: Inverse-kinematics singularities ===
This first kind of singularities occurs when:

&lt;math&gt;\det(\textbf{B})=0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Type-II: Direct-kinematics singularities ===
This second kind of singularities occurs when:

&lt;math&gt;\det(\textbf{A})=0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Type-III: Combined singularities ===
This kind of singularities occurs when for a particular configuration, both &lt;math&gt;\textbf {A}
&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\textbf {B} 
&lt;/math&gt;become singular simultaneously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14536">'''Metaphysical terms in René Guénon's works''' contains the definition of some [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms used in [[René Guénon]]'s writings.

In his metaphysical writings, René Guénon has stated precise definitions concerning key terms in [[metaphysics]]. This article summarizes some of them. Guénon's writings make use of words and terms, of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, lost substantially their original signification (e.g. words such as "metaphysics", "initiation", "mysticism", "personality", "form", "matter").&lt;ref&gt;c.f. for instance ''The Eastern Metaphysics'' and ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' w.r.t. the meaning of the word "metaphysics", the first chapter of ''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times'' on the meanings of the words "form" and "matter", the chapter "Kundalini-Yoga" in his ''Studies on Hinduism'' about the translation of Sanskrit word  ''samâdhi'' as "ecstasy", ''Man and his Becoming according to Vedânta" on the word "personality", ''Theosophism: History of a Pseudo-Religion" on the word "theosophy" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides the definition given by René Guénon to some of the words used extensively in his works.

In reality, only something that is limited is capable of definition, whereas by definition metaphysics is on the contrary by its very nature absolutely unlimited, and this plainly does not allow our enclosing it in a more or less narrow formula [...]."|source=''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'', part II, « The general characteristics of eastern thought », chapter V: « Essential characters of metaphysics », p. 70.

[...] in everything pertaining to initiation there is really nothing vague or nebulous, for on the contrary it is as precise and 'positive' as can be, so that initiation by its very nature is in fact incompatible with mysticism."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 1: « The initiatic and mystical paths », p. 8.

{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] initiation is essentially the transmission of a spiritual influence, a transmission that can only take place through a regular, traditional organization, so that one cannot speak of initiation outside of an affiliation with an organization of this kind.

|The '''Self'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self' is the transcendent and permanent principle of which the manifested being, the human being, for example, is only a transient and contingent modification, a modification which, moreover, can in no way affect the principle [...] The 'Self', as such, is never individualized and cannot become so, for since it must always be considered under the aspect of the eternity and immutability which are the necessary attributes of pure Being, it is obviously not susceptible of any particularization, which would cause it to be 'other that itself'. Immutable in its own nature, it develops the indefinite possibilities which it contains within itself, by a relative passing from potency to act through an indefinite series of degrees. Its essential permanence is not thereby affected, precisely because this process is only relative, and because this development is, strictly speaking, not a development at all, except from the point of view of manifestation, outside of which there is no question of succession, but only of perfect simultaneity, so that even what is virtual under one aspect, is found nevertheless to be realized in the 'eternal present'."|source=''[[Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta]]'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 23.

|'''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]], individuality, personality'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] Previously, on the contrary [i.e. prior to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosphists]]], even in the West, whenever any distinction has been made between these two terms ['individuality' or 'ego' and 'personality'] the personality has always been regarded as superior to individuality [...] The 'Self' [...] considered in relation to a being, is properly speaking the personality; it is true that one might restrict the use of this latter word to the 'Self' as principle of the manifested states, just as the 'Divine Personality', '''[[Ishvara|Ishwara]]''', is the Principle of universal Manifestation; but one can also extend it analogically to the 'Self' as principle of all states of the being, both manifested and unmanifested. The personality is an immediate determination, primordial and non-particularized, of the principle which in Sanskrit is called '''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atmâ]]''' or '''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]]''', and which, in default of a better term, we may call the 'Universal Spirit', on the clear understanding, however, that in this use of the word 'spirit', nothing is implied that might recall Western philosophical conceptions, and, in particular, that is not turned into a correlative of 'matter', as the modern mind is inclined to do, being subject in this respect, even though unconsciously, to the influence of Cartesian dualism."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 24.

|'''Universal and individual'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self', in relation to any being whatsoever, is in reality identical with Atmâ, since it is essentially beyond all distinction and all particularization; and that is why, in Sanskrit, the same word âtman, in cases other than the nominative, replaces the reflexive pronoun 'itself'. The 'Self is not therefore really distinct from Atmâ, except when one considers it [...] in relation to a certain definite state of being, such as the human state [...]. In this case, moreover, the 'Self' does not really become distinct from Atmâ in any way, since [...] it [...] cannot be affected by the point of view from which we regard it [...]. What should be noted is that to the extent that we make this distinction, we are departing from the direct consideration of the 'Self' in order to consider its reflection in human individuality [...]. The reflection in question determines what may be called the center of this individuality; but if isolated from its principle, that is, from the 'Self', it can only enjoy a purely illusory existence, for it is from that principle that it derives all its reality, and it effectually possesses this reality only through participation in the nature of the 'Self', that is, insofar as it is identified therewith by universalization. &lt;br /&gt;
The personality [...] belongs essentially to the order of principles in the strictest sense of the word, that is, to the universal order [...]. [The] following table [...] sets forth the essential distinctions in this connection [...]:"&lt;br /&gt;

As for the individual, it includes all degrees of formal manifestation, that is, all states in which beings are invested with forms, for what properly characterizes individuality and essentially constitutes it as such is precisely the presence of form among the limitative conditions which define and determine a given state of existence.

|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The "gross state" in fact is nothing else than the corporeal existence itself, to which [...] human individuality belongs by one of its modalities only, and not in its integral development. As to the "subtle state", it includes, in the first place, the extra-corporeal modalities of the human being, or of every other being situated in the same state of existence, and also, in the second place, all other individual states [...] It may be said, therefore, that the human being, considered in its integrality, comprises a certain sum of possibilities which constitute its corporeal or gross modality, and in addition, a multitude of other possibilities, which, extending in different directions beyond the corporeal modality, constitute its subtle modalities; but all these possibilities together represent, nonetheless, one and the same degree of universal Existence. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that human individuality is at once much more and much less than Westerners generally suppose it to be: much more, because they recognize in it scarcely anything except the corporeal modality, which includes but the smallest fraction of its possibilities; much less, however, because this individuality, far from really constituting the whole being, is but one state of that being among an indefinite multitude of other states. Moreover the sum of all these states is still nothing at all in relation to the personality, which alone is the true being, because it alone represents its permanent and unconditioned state, and because there is nothing else which can be considered as absolutely real."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 28.

[[File:Metapopulation (1).svg|thumb|Metapopulations are important in fisheries. The local population (1.) serves as a source for interbreeding with surrounding subspecies populations (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c).The populations are normally spatially separated and independent but spatial overlap during breeding times allows for [[gene flow]] between the populations.]]
A '''metapopulation''' consists of a group of spatially separated populations of the same [[species]] which interact at some level. The term metapopulation was coined by [[Richard Levins]] in 1969 to describe a model of [[population dynamics]] of insect pests in agricultural fields, but the idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially [[habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]]. In Levins' own words, it consists of "a population of populations".&lt;ref name=Levins1969&gt;{{citation  | last = Levins | first =  R.  | year = 1969  | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control  | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America  | volume = 15  | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metapopulation is generally considered to consist of several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied. In classical metapopulation theory, each population cycles in relative independence of the other populations and eventually goes extinct as a consequence of demographic [[stochastic]]ity (fluctuations in population size due to random [[demographic]] events); the smaller the population, the more chances of inbreeding depression and prone to extinction.

Although individual populations have finite life-spans, the metapopulation as a whole is often stable because immigrants from one population (which may, for example, be experiencing a population boom) are likely to re-colonize habitat which has been left open by the extinction of another population. They may also emigrate to a small population and rescue that population from extinction (called the ''rescue effect''). Such a rescue effect may occur because declining populations leave niche opportunities open to the "rescuers".

The development of metapopulation theory, in conjunction with the development of [[source-sink dynamics]], emphasised the importance of connectivity between seemingly isolated populations. Although no single population may be able to guarantee the long-term survival of a given species, the combined effect of many populations may be able to do this.

Metapopulation theory was first developed for terrestrial ecosystems, and subsequently applied to the marine realm.&lt;ref name="Kritzer06"&gt;Kritzer, JP &amp; Sale, PF (eds) (2006) Marine metapopulations, Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries science, the term "sub-population" is equivalent to the metapopulation science term "local population". Most marine examples are provided by relatively sedentary species occupying discrete [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches of habitat]], with both local recruitment and recruitment from other local populations in the larger metapopulation. Kritzer &amp; Sale have argued against strict application of the metapopulation definitional criteria that extinction risks to local populations must be non-negligible.&lt;ref name="Kritzer06"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

Finnish biologist [[Ilkka Hanski]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] was an important contributor to metapopulation theory.

The first experiments with [[predation]] and [[spatial heterogeneity]] were conducted by [[Georgii Gause|G.F. Gause]] in the 1930s, based on the [[Lotka-Volterra equation]], which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted.&lt;ref name="Real91"&gt;Real, Leslie A. and Brown, James H. 1991. Foundations of Ecology: Classic papers with commentaries. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population [[oscillations]] over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the [[population cycle]]s accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.

== Huffaker's experiments on predator–prey interactions (1958) ==

In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey.&lt;ref name=Huffaker1958&gt;{{citation  | last = Huffaker | first =  C.B.  | year = 1958  | title = Experimental Studies on Predation: Dispersion factors and predator–prey oscillations  | journal = Hilgardia  | volume = 27  | issue = 343  | pages = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact.&lt;ref name=Legendre1989&gt;{{citation  | last1 = Legendre | first1 = P.  | last2 = Fortin | first2 = M.J.  | year = 1989  | title = Spatial pattern and ecological analysis  | journal = Plant Ecology  | volume = 80  | issue = 2  | pages = 107  | doi = 10.1007/BF00048036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse.&lt;ref name="Real91"/&gt; These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model.&lt;ref name=Kareiva1987&gt;{{citation  | last = Kareiva | first =  P.  | year = 1987  | title = Habitat Fragmentation and the Stability of Predator–Prey Interactions  | journal = Nature  | volume = 326  | issue = 6111  | pages = 388  | doi = 10.1038/326388a0 |bibcode = 1987Natur.326..388K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of [[spatial heterogeneity]] and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, A. et al. 1997. Metapopulation Dynamics of a Persisting Predator–Prey system.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Levins model ==

Levins' original model applied to a metapopulation distributed over many patches of suitable habitat with significantly less interaction between patches than within a patch. Population dynamics within a patch were simplified to the point where only presence and absence were considered. Each patch in his model is either populated or not.

Let ''N'' be the fraction of patches occupied at a given time. During a time ''dt'', each occupied patch can become unoccupied with an extinction probability ''edt''. Additionally, 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''N'' of the patches are unoccupied. Assuming a constant rate ''c'' of [[propagule]] generation from each of the ''N'' occupied patches, during a time ''dt'', each unoccupied patch can become occupied with a colonization probability ''cNdt'' . Accordingly, the time rate of change of occupied patches, ''dN/dt'', is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = cN(1-N) - eN.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is mathematically equivalent to the [[logistic function|logistic model]], with a carrying capacity ''K'' given by

: &lt;math&gt; K = 1 - \frac{e}{c}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and growth rate ''r''

: &lt;math&gt; r = c - e.\,&lt;/math&gt;

At equilibrium, therefore, some fraction of the species's habitat will always be unoccupied.

== Stochasticity and metapopulations ==

Huffaker's&lt;ref name="Huffaker1958" /&gt; studies of spatial structure and species interactions are an example of early experimentation in metapopulation dynamics. Since the experiments of Huffaker&lt;ref name="Huffaker1958"/&gt; and Levins,&lt;ref name="Levins1969" /&gt; models have been created which integrate stochastic factors. These models have shown that the combination of environmental variability (stochasticity) and relatively small migration rates cause indefinite or unpredictable persistence. However, Huffaker's experiment almost guaranteed infinite persistence because of the controlled immigration variable.

== Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) ==

One major drawback of the Levins model is that it is [[deterministic]], whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are [[stochastic]]. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed [[habitats]], and the [[minimum viable population|viability of their populations]], i.e., how likely they are to become [[extinct]] in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the [[contact process (mathematics)|contact process]]. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for [[patch dynamics]]. At a given [[percolation threshold]], [[habitat fragmentation]] effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keymer J.E |author2=P.A. Marquet |author3=J.X. Velasco‐Hernández |author4=S.A. Levin | date=November 2000 |title=Extinction Thresholds and Metapopulation Persistence in Dynamic Landscapes|journal=The American Naturalist |volume=156 |pages= 478–4945 | doi=10.1086/303407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[conservation biology]] purposes, metapopulation models must include (a) the finite nature of metapopulations (how many patches are suitable for habitat), and (b) the [[probability theory|probabilistic]] nature of extinction and colonisation. Also, note that in order to apply these models, the extinctions and colonisations of the patches must be asynchronous.

== Microhabitat patches (MHPs) and bacterial metapopulations ==

[[Image:ecoli metapopulation.jpg|thumb|E. coli metapopulation on-chip.]]

By combining [[nanotechnology]] with [[landscape ecology]], a habitat landscape can be nanofabricated on-chip by building a collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local [[ecosystem service]] of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs can be used as physical implementations of an [[adaptive landscape]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keymer J.E. |author2=P. Galajda |author3=C. Muldoon R. |author4=R. Austin  |last-author-amp=yes | date=November 2006 |title=Bacterial metapopulations in nanofabricated landscapes|journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=46 |pages= 17290–295 |pmc= 1635019|doi=10.1073/pnas.0607971103 |bibcode=2006PNAS..10317290K |pmid=17090676}}&lt;/ref&gt; by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating on-chip within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and [[evolutionary ecology]] of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental [[biophysics]].

== Life history evolution ==
Metapopulation models have been used to explain life-history evolution, such as the [[ecological stability]] of [[Metamorphosis#Amphibian metamorphosis|amphibian metamorphosis]] in small [[vernal pools|vernal ponds]]. Alternative ecological strategies have evolved. For example, some salamanders forgo metamorphosis and sexually mature as aquatic [[Neoteny|neotenes]]. The seasonal duration of wetlands and the migratory range of the species determines which ponds are connected and if they form a metapopulation. The duration of the life history stages of amphibians relative to the duration of the vernal pool before it dries up regulates the ecological development of metapopulations connecting aquatic patches to terrestrial patches.&lt;ref name="Petranka07"&gt;{{Citation |last = Petranka |first = J.

[[File:A Mind Map on ICT and Pedagogy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A mind map about educational technology]]
{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2030">In [[open pit mining]] operations, people and equipment are constantly at the base of a steep, man-made slope (the highwall or pit-wall). Instances where this slope fails resulting in a rock or earthfall can result in loss of life, injuries and damage or destruction of equipment (see [[mining]]). It has been found that, over the last few hours preceding a slope failure, there is nearly always a small movement, or alteration in the movement pattern in the rock face of that section.

The system is intended to monitor mine slopes to detect this movement and generate a warning of impending failure ([[slope stability]]), so that personnel and equipment may be removed prior to the failure. The radar element provides very accurate, real-time, all weather slope movement measurements with sub millimetre detection ability, and is able to provide an alarm if the detected movement reaches a predetermined level, thereby permitting evacuation of the unstable area, and enhancing safety.

All radar measurements are fully geo-referenced to an accuracy that allows easy integration with standard digital terrain mapping (DTM) tools.

A second function of the Movement and Surveying Radar is to determine the absolute range to the electromagnetic reflective centroid of an area on a body of material or geographical feature. This functionality, combined with the accurately surveyed position of the measurement origin of the Movement and Surveying Radar and the positioning system’s angular measurement information, may be used to generate survey data of geographical features such as mine walls and rubble dumps. The survey data collected may be used for applications such as the calculation of material removal volumes.

A Movement and Surveying Radar combines simultaneously the execution of slope stability and surveying measurements, which together with high-speed external data links makes it a near real-time tool for mining safety, planning and productivity improvement.

The '''NIXT''', or '''Normal Incidence X-ray Telescope''', was a [[sounding rocket]] payload flown in the 1990s by Professor [[Leon Golub (astrophysicist)|Leon Golub]] of the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], to prototype normal-incidence (conventional) optical designs in [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) solar imaging. In the EUV, the surface of the [[Sun]] appears dark, and hot structures in the solar [[corona]] appear bright; this allows study of the structure and dynamics of the solar corona near the surface of the Sun, which is not possible using [[visible light]].

NIXT and its sister rocket, the [[MSSTA]], were the prototypes for all normal-incidence EUV imaging instruments in use today, including [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope|SOHO/EIT]], [[TRACE]], and [[STEREO|STEREO/SECCHI]].

In 1989, a NIXT sounding rocket launch detected soft X-Rays coming from a [[Solar flare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991ApJ...376..797H|title=1991ApJ...376..797H Page 797|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched when the solar event was detected to allow high resolution imaging of the Sun's [[corona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991ApJ...376..797H|title=1991ApJ...376..797H Page 797|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the observations were presented in 1990 in different papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991ApJ...376..797H|title=1991ApJ...376..797H Page 797|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIXT was launched throughout the early 1990s and a paper summarizing the results from these mission was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970008135.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National Oceanography Centre Southampton UK seen from waterfront.jpg|thumb|National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK]]
The '''National Oceanography Centre Southampton''' (NOCS) is a centre for research, teaching, and technology development in Ocean and Earth science. NOCS was created in 1995 jointly between the [[University of Southampton]] and the UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and is located within the port of [[Southampton]] at a purpose-built dockside campus with modern facilities. In 2010 the University and NERC components demerged, and the NERC-managed component became the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC – with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool). The two components of NOCS continue close collaboration through the jointly run Graduate School, shared research facilities and laboratories, complementary research groups, and many joint research grants and publications. The University component “Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton” (OES) is part of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, (FNES). It was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the [[QS World University Rankings]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="University of Southampton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/news/2014/2/southampton_positioned_30_in_the_world_rankings_for_ocean_and_earth_science.page|title=Southampton positioned 30 in the world rankings for Earth and Marine Sciences|author=University of Southampton|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:AYool NOCS 2004-05-01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|National Oceanography Centre, Southampton at sunset]]

The centre can trace its origins back to the years immediately after [[Second World War]], when the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) was founded.&lt;ref name=NIO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|title=History of the National Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=1 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061745/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan to create National Oceanography Centre Southampton as a centre of excellence in marine and earth science was formulated in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the Natural Environment Research Council in coordination with the University of Southampton. According to that plan a research and teaching complex was erected on the new Waterfront Campus dock-side location within the [[Port of Southampton]] to become the new home for the former National Institute of Oceanographic Science (from Wormley, Surrey), the Research Vessel Service (from Barry, Wales) and the former University of Southampton departments of Geology and Oceanography. NOCS was officially opened in 1996 as the Southampton Oceanography Centre by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] (he also renamed it the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in 2005).

The Centre's inaugural director from 1994-99 was [[John Shepherd (scientist)|John Shepherd]], a former Deputy Director of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] and an [[Earth system science|Earth system scientist]].&lt;ref name="director"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | title=Professor John Shepherd FRS | publisher=NOCS | accessdate=5 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208084855/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | archivedate=8 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New England Complex Systems Institute''' (NECSI) is a small [[United States|American]] research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[complex systems]]. NECSI offers educational programs, conducts research, and hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems. It was founded in 1996 and is located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = "NECSI"/&gt;

== Mission ==
NECSI was established in 1996 by faculty of various New England academic institutions, including [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], and others, to encourage communication and collaboration among researchers studying complex systems.&lt;ref name="iccs2"/&gt;

The NECSI web site describes "[[complex systems]]" as follows:&lt;ref name="NECSI"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complex systems have multiple interacting components whose [[collective behavior]] cannot be simply inferred from the behavior of components. The recognition that understanding the parts cannot explain collective behavior has led to various new concepts and methodologies that are affecting all fields of science and engineering, and are being applied to technology, business and even [[social policy]]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Collaboration and Communication==

NECSI promotes collaboration and dissemination of new research among complex systems researchers in wide-ranging disciplines and numerous institutions. NECSI's activities for this purpose include hosting an international research conference and maintaining a roster of affiliated scholars and co-faculty.

=== International Conference on Complex Systems ===
NECSI hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS), whose aims are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
first, to investigate those properties or characteristics that appear to be common to the very different complex systems now under study; and second, to encourage cross fertilization among the many disciplines involved.&lt;ref name = iccs8/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ICCS takes place on an occasional basis, with the most recent (eighth conference) in 2011. ICCS conferences have featured notable computer scientists (e.g., Gerald Sussman), mathematicians (e.g., Stephen Wolfram), systems theorists (e.g., [[John Sterman]]), physicists (e.g. Sandy Pentland), economists (e.g., James Stock), and others. 
Events at ICCS include research presentations and workshops, as well as pedagogical sessions aimed at a wider community.

=== Affiliates and Co-faculty ===
NECSI provides a public platform for affiliates and co-faculty at numerous academic institutions, primarily in the New England region. These researchers also contribute to NECSI educational programs.&lt;ref name = short_course /&gt;

== Research areas ==

=== Evolution and Ecology ===
NECSI researchers have contributed to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics, the evolution of [[altruism in animals|altruism]], the origin and characterization of [[biodiversity]], and the interplay between evolution and ecology.

Much of the work done at NECSI has focused on the role of the spatial distribution of species, an often overlooked factor of evolutionary dynamics. In the case where portions of a population are geographically isolated from each other, for example, [[Yaneer Bar-Yam]] was able to demonstrate shortcomings in the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], an approximation that is valid only if there is complete mixing of alleles in the gene pool.&lt;ref name="gene-centered" /&gt;

=== Networks ===
Studies of [[network topology|network topologies]] have found surprising similarities between a variety of complex social, technological and biological networks.  NECSI research in networks focuses on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function.

=== Social Systems ===
NECSI research in social systems focuses on the collective actions that create revolutions, ethnic violence, urban health, fads and panics, global food and so on. The role of individuals and organization can be analyzed by techniques and tools of [[complex systems]].

=== Representation ===
Complex systems exhibit behaviors at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Researchers working at NECSI have developed a mathematical formalism for simultaneously describing systems on multiple scales. This formalism had been applied to physical systems, information systems, organizational behavior, engineering projects and military conflict.

An essential tool for multiscale analysis, the complexity profile, the relationship between the observed complexity of a system and the scale of observation.

=== Post-crisis focus on social and economic systems ===
Since 2009, the Institute's research focus has shifted to socio-economic systems, with particular attention to the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and dynamics of Twitter networks and social sentiment. Policy relevant articles on stock market regulation and market crashes,&lt;ref name=market-interdependence /&gt;&lt;ref name = uptick/&gt;&lt;ref name=panic/&gt;&lt;ref name=bear-raid /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon D, Lagi M, de Aguiar MAM, Chinellato DD, Braha D, Epstein IR, et al. (2015). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131871 "Anticipating Economic Market Crises Using Measures of Collective Panic."] PLoS ONE 10(7): e0131871.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131871.&lt;/ref&gt; food riots and the causes of high food prices,&lt;ref name = foodprices/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-crises/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-update/&gt; and the European bond crisis&lt;ref name=europe-debt /&gt; have been released straight to the press. Peer reviewed articles continue to appear on other subjects.&lt;ref name=nyt-twitter /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-twitter/&gt;&lt;ref name=ring-species /&gt;

=== Further fields of research ===
* [[Systems Biology]]
* [[Systems Engineering]]
* [[Management|Organizational management]]
* [[Negotiation]]

== Public attention ==
NECSI's work on the global food crisis has been widely cited by the press,&lt;ref name=time-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref  name=motherboard-coverage /&gt; by movements to curb financial speculation,&lt;ref name=foodwatch /&gt;&lt;ref name=wdm /&gt; and included among the top 10 discoveries in science in 2011 by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].&lt;ref name=wired-top-discoveries /&gt; NECSI's scientific visualizations have received multiple citations on top 10 lists.&lt;ref name=wired-best-figures /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-graphics /&gt;&lt;ref name=map-porn /&gt;

NECSI has been called "a pioneer in using mathematics, computation and other quantitative methods to analyse topics like ethnic violence, economic crises and healthcare systems" by the press.&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt;

{{Music Education|major}}

The '''Orff Schulwerk''', or simply the '''Orff Approach''', is a developmental approach used in [[music education]]. It combines [[music]], movement, [[drama]], and [[speech]] into lessons that are similar to [[child]]'s world of play. It was developed by the [[Germany|German]] composer [[Carl Orff]] (1895–1982) and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] during the 1920s. Carl Orff worked until the end of his life to continue the development and spread of his teaching method. 

The Orff Approach is now used throughout the world to teach students in a natural and comfortable environment. The term "schulwerk" is [[German language|German]] for (literally) "school work" or "schooling", in this regard in the area of [[music]].

==Foundations==
The Orff Approach of [[music education]] uses very rudimentary forms of everyday activity for the purpose of music creation by music students. The Orff Approach is a "child-centered way of learning" music education that treats music as a basic system like [[language]] and believes that just as every child can learn language without formal instruction so can every child learn music by a gentle and friendly approach.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Patricia Sherman. Musician and Teacher. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often called "Elemental Music making" because the materials needed to teach students are "basic, natural, and close to a child’s world of thought and fantasy".&lt;ref name="Shamrock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shamrock|first=Mary|title=Orff- Schulwerk: An Integrated Method|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=83|issue=6|date=May 1997|pages=41–44|jstor=3399024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the Orff Approach to effectively work teachers must create an atmosphere that is similar to a child’s world of play. This allows participating children to feel comfortable learning a new and often abstract musical skill, greater exploration of a [[musical instrument]] or musical skill, and keeps a student from feeling [[evaluate]]d or judged by his or her peers and teachers. A child participating in an Orff classroom does not feel the pressure of [[performing]] that is often in tandem with music because every student in an Orff classroom is treated as an equal, even when performing a solo. 

The Orff Approach is used by teachers to encourage their students to enjoy making music as individuals as well as in groups. Children realize the joys of [[Group (sociology)|group]] co-ordination and cohesion. It also involves the participation of other adults and parents in music making. Thus it brings the role of [[parent]] in child education in a central position. From a teacher’s aspect Orff-Schulwerk is also a process of breaking down each activity into its simplest form and then presenting those steps one at a time to eventually become a completed performance.

In the Orff Approach "all concepts are learned by ‘doing'".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;"The Orff Approach to Music Education" By Gloria Day&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn music by experiencing and participating in the different musical lessons and activities. These lessons stimulate not only the paraxial concepts of music like rhythm and tempo, but also the aesthetic qualities of music. “Orff activities awaken the child’s total awareness” and “sensitize the child’s awareness of space, time, form, line, color, design, and mood- aesthetic data that musicians are acutely aware of, yet find hard to explain to musical novices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=Susan|title=Orff- Schulwerk Teaches Musical Responsiveness|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=68|issue=7|date=March 1982|pages=42–43|jstor=3395939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Simply Music]] or the [[Suzuki Method]], the Orff Schulwerk approach is not a method. There is no systematic stepwise procedure to be followed.  There are fundamental principles, clear models and basic processes that all intuitive and creative teachers use to guide their organization of musical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Orff." Miranda, Martina MENC Meeting, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

The music generated in the Orff Approach is largely improvisational and uses original tonal constructions that build a sense of confidence and interest in the process of creative thinking. Students of the Orff Approach sing, play instruments, and dance alone as well as in groups. Songs are usually short, contain [[ostinato]]s, are within singing range, can be manipulated to be played in a round or ABA form. "Music is chosen with strong nationalistic flavor, being related to folk songs and music of the child’s own heritage".&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; Music can also be anything from nursery rhymes to songs that are invented by the children themselves. Orff-Schulwerk music is largely based on simple but forceful variations on rhythmic patterns. This makes for very simple and beautiful musical forms, which are easily learned by young children, and is also useful for adults and thus it has a universal appeal.  Composer [[David Hewson (composer)|David Hewson]] was exposed to Orff Schulwerk and this influence helped to shape a lot of his later music.

The music is largely modal, beginning with pentatonic (both major and minor) scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orff - Keetman|title=Music for Children Vol I|year=1958|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt; (English version adapted by Margaret Murray) The drone or bordun, is quickly established as the ground bass that supports most melodies and melodic ostinati add energy and colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodkin|first=Doug|title=Play, Sing and Dance|year=2004|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II in Part One, covers hexachordal (added fa)melodies over Major Drone Bass Triads, and then seven notes: Ionian mode. Note, this is not major scale, as the drone bass enforces a non-functional harmony. Parallel thirds and sixths (paraphony) are used liberally here. Part Two introduces the use of triads as following: I - ii, and some I - vi.

Goodkin (p172) discusses the progression of the volumes:  I-II-III-IV-V as opposed to I-II-IV-III-V. Volume III introduces Major Dominant and Subdominant triads (That is to say: functional harmony). However Volume IV can be viewed as more logically the next step as it introduces Dorian, Aeolian and Phrygian modes with similar shifting drones and triads to those found previously in Vol II.

Vol IV, Part One: Minor-Drone Bass Triads. Aeolian, Dorian and Phrygian mode, i-ii shifting drones and triads. Part Two: Tonic and Leading Note triads, i-IV and decoration of the third.

Vol III Major Dominant and Subdominant Triads. This harmonic world is more challenging for children and improvising than the modes, hence the importance of leaving until skills have developed appropriately.

Volume V follows III, but explores Minor Dominant and Subdominant Chords.

And finally, almost as an afterthought, Paralipomena which explores the worlds of Lydian I-II, and Mixolydian I-VII.

When interesting original music has been generated by the groups or individual child a desire to record it may arise. Thus, the desire to develop musical skills emerges by itself and the child may be intrinsically propelled to learn formal music.

==Instruments and tools==
[[File:Intrumentarium Orff-Schulwerkde la société Studio 49.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Some typical teaching instruments ''Orff-Schulwerk'']]
Orff considered the percussive [[rhythm]] as a natural basic form of [[human]] expression. Carl Orff and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] co-composed much of the music for the five volume series, ''Music for Children.''  These volumes, first published in 1950, are still available and used today. Music played on Orff instruments is often very simple and easy to play even for first time musicians.

Some of the instruments within the approach include miniature [[xylophones]], [[marimbas]], [[glockenspiels]], and [[metallophones]]; all of which have removable bars, resonating columns to project the sound, and are easily transported and stored. Orff teachers also use different sized [[drums]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], and non- pitched percussion instruments "to round out the songs that are sung and played".&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; The Orff approach also requires that children sing, chant, clap, dance, pat, and snap fingers along to melodies and rhythms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;

==Spread==

In 1923 Carl Orff met [http://www.orff.de/en/life/educational-works/guenther-school.html Dorothee Günther] while working at a theater in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. Günther "believed that most students did not get enough chances to do art and music and movement activities".&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, Esther. "Orff- Schulwerk: Where Did it Come From?" The Orff Beat-Centenary Issue XXIV (June 1995). Victorian Orff Schulwerk Association. 3 May 2009 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915154530/http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |archivedate=15 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her extensive background in gymnastics and the arts Gunter was able to open the Gunter-Schule in 1924. Even though [[Carl Orff]] never worked with the students of the Gunter-Schule directly, this was the first institution to teach what would later be known as the Orff Approach.

Students of the Günther-Schule later went on to be dancers and teachers of note. One of these students, Gunild Keetman, began as a student and became a teacher at the school. The Gunter-Schule originally only taught older students; however, Keetman later worked on developing the ideas of the school to teach younger children as well. Together she and [[Carl Orff]] created the five volume series "Music for Children" which is still used by teachers today. The Gunter-Schule ran until 1944 when [[Nazis]] confiscated it. In 1945 the building was destroyed in an Allied bomb attack and all materials (instruments, costumes, photographs, and its library and archives) were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

After the war, two serendipitous events brought Orff's approach back into the educational field.  A series of [[radio]] programs aimed at children was broadcast in [[Bavaria]]. Orff wrote the music and re-united with Keetman to work on these broadcasts. The second event was the Mozartariums' request to have Keetman teach classes to children between 8 and 10 years old. Traude Schrattenecker who was also a graduate of the Gunter-Schule, joined Keetman in running this school.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

There are Orff Schulwerk associations in different countries across the [[world]] including [[Germany]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Korea]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]], [[France]], [[Finland]] and [[New Zealand]]. All of these organisations promote the teachings of [[Carl Orff]] and [[Gunild Keetman]] and the spread of the Approach. Through all of these organizations teachers interested in teaching the Orff Approach can become certified in the Approach.

==The American model ==

The American Orff-Schulwerk Association offers three different levels of training, each of which takes 60 hours to complete. Level one focuses on the "necessary skills to plan and implement a variety of Orff Schulwerk [[music]] and movement activities in the classroom." "Levels two and three are concerned with development of conceptual understanding of music and movement elements as they are presented in the Schulwerk elemental music context, as well as the skill needed to implement them".&lt;ref&gt;American Orff-Schulwerk. Association&lt;/ref&gt;

In America there are four stages in the Orff Approach:  [[imitation]], exploration, [[improvisation]], and composition.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Through imitation, the teacher, group leader, or even the students perform for the class and the class in turn repeats what was played for them. Exploration allows students to seek out the musical aspects that the Orff instruments offer and explore [[aural]]/[[Mouth|oral]] skills and the motions and expressions that the body is capable of. Literacy is taught by learning musical notation and becoming familiar with forms of music like [[rondo]] and ABA. Improvisation is the act of creating something, especially music, without prior preparation.&lt;ref name="Shamrock"/&gt; To improvise, a student must have "a preliminary knowledge and comprehension of concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Judith|title=Orff-Based Improvisation|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=66|issue=5|date=January 1980|pages=58–61|jstor=3395777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn to create their own melodies in a comfortable environment that allows for mistakes and promotes creativity.

==Orff Schulwerk in Aotearoa/New Zealand==

[http://www.orffnz.org Orff New Zealand Aotearoa (ONZA)] is a professional society dedicated to the promotion of the Orff Schulwerk approach in New Zealand. The organisation is a member of the [http://www.orff-schulwerk-forum-salzburg.org Orff Schulwerk Forum Salzburg]. In association with the [https://education.waikato.ac.nz/about/departments/arts-and-language-department/orff-schulwerk/ University of Waikato], ONZA offers a four-tiered course of study in the Orff approach, which includes practical workshops and critical investigation.

==Other applications==

The Orff Approach was originally intended to teach music to children but because of the different benefits that it offers with [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[dexterity]], and [[concentration]] the technique is often used to teach individuals with [[special needs]]. The simplicity of the technique allows all ranges of [[handicapped]] students to participate in the learning process. [[Mentally handicapped]] students can easily perform the tasks without fear of being ridiculed or being left behind. The [[visually impaired]]/[[blindness|blind]] who tend to have "hesitant, jerky, and over controlled" movements because they "often breathe quite shallowly" can use the different breathing and movement exercises to relax their body and breathing.&lt;ref name="Bitcon"&gt;Bitcon, Carol Hampton. Alike and Different: The Clinical and Educational Use or Orff Schulwerk. Santa Ana, CA: Rosha Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Students with a [[hearing impairment]]  can use the Orff Approach by feeling the [[vibrations]] that are created by different [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Since music is mostly resilient, students who have had injuries that have mentally impaired them can use the Approach as a form of [[therapy]]. Even elderly individuals who often become weak with old age can use the Orff Approach to help with [[memory]], [[dexterity]], and [[agility]].&lt;ref name="Bitcon"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">Broadly defined, '''positive neuroscience''' is the study of what the [[Human brain|brain]] does well.  Instead of studying [[mental illness]], positive neuroscientists focus on valued cognitive qualities that serve to enrich personal life and/or society.  Topics in positive neuroscience overlap heavily with those of [[Positive Psychology]], but use [[neuroimaging]] techniques to extend beyond the behavioral level and explain the [[neurobiology]] which underpins "positive" cognitive phenomena such as [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[optimism]], and healthy [[aging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveneuroscience.com/ positiveneuroscience]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Though '''positive neuroscience''' is only beginning to be recognized as an emerging field, empirical research of optimal or exceptional brain functioning has been conducted at least as far back as the 1970s.  Early work was confined to the use of lesion studies, and thus was only very case-specific.  Human [[Electroencephalography]], first practiced in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Swartz, B.E | year = 1998 | last2 = Goldensohn | month =   | first2 = ES| title = '''Timeline of the history of EEG and associated fields''' | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 106 | issue =  2| pages = 173–6 | doi=10.1016/S0013-4694(97)00121-1 | pmid=9741779}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a methodology for the study of creativity in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martindale C, Armstrong J |title=The relationship of creativity to cortical activation and its operant control |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=124 |issue=2d Half |pages=311–20 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4842281 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1974.10532293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in vivo brain imaging has become more sophisticated, investigations of positive neuroscience phenomena have incorporated functional imaging ([[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[Positron Emission Tomography]]) and structural imaging ([[Diffusion MRI]], [[voxel-based morphometry]], [[in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]).  Examples of research centers currently active in the field of '''positive neuroscience''' include [[Martin Seligman|Martin Seligman's]] lab at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Rex Jung's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725181422/http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; lab at [[The Mind Research Network]].

==The Templeton Foundation==
In 2009, the John Templeton Foundation and a committee of advisors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] put out a call for grant proposals aimed at investigators "conducting research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the ways in which the brain enables flourishing."  Qualifying projects had to "apply tools of neuroscience to positive psychological concepts", and focus on one of the following areas:

* [[Virtue]], strength, and positive [[emotion]]: What are the neural bases of the cognitive and affective capacities that enable virtues such as [[discipline]], persistence, [[honesty]], [[compassion]], [[love]], [[curiosity]], social and practical [[intelligence]], [[courage]], [[creativity]], and [[optimism]]?
* Exceptional abilities: What is special about the [[Human brain|brains]] of exceptional individuals and what can we learn from them?

'''''Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate''''' is a 1985 US [[documentary film]] directed by [[Kirby Dick]] about the interaction between a [[sex surrogate]] and her clients - Dick's first documentary film.

==Synopsis==
''Private Practices'' focuses on [[sex surrogate]] Maureen Sullivan and two of her clients. Kipper, a 25-year-old college student, has had little sexual experience with women and seeks help overcoming his shyness. John, a 45-year-old divorcee, believes that his sexual inadequacies are preventing him from finding a new partner. Sullivan works with these men in an attempt to improve their body image, relationship skills, and sexual satisfaction.

The film also shows how these patients interact with their friends, family members, and therapists. Many scenes focus on Sullivan, who discusses her history as a surrogate and describes her own relationship difficulties. In one scene, she and her brother confront their father about his abusive behavior and unwillingness to accept Maureen's career choice.

The filmmakers paid for the patients' therapy in exchange for permission to record their sessions. In order to preserve the therapeutic atmosphere, Dick only allowed a single camera operator to be in the room during each session, and he and the rest of the crew monitored the filming from a remote station in a different room.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Practices'' DVD commentary track&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the film crew does not directly interact with the subjects during therapy, and the subjects rarely comment on the presence of the filmmakers.

A postscript to the film states that John and Kipper have gone on to form more successful relationships, while Sullivan has started dating and reduced her number of patients.

==Reception==
''Private Practices'' won favorable reviews from critics. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Edward Guthmann called it "an honest, courageous and sensitive study of human beings in their most vulnerable moments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Radon mitigation''' is any process used to reduce [[radon]] gas concentrations in the breathing zones of occupied buildings, or radon from water supplies. Radon is a [[radium and radon in the environment|significant contributor]] to [[environmental radioactivity]].

Mitigation of radon in the air is accomplished through ventilation, either collected below a concrete floor slab or a membrane on the ground, or by increasing the [[air changes per hour]] in the building. Treatment systems using aeration or activated charcoal are available to remove radon from domestic water supplies.

==Testing==
[[File:Radon test kit.jpg|thumb|A typical radon test kit]]
[[File:Radon-indoor-one-week.svg|thumb|Fluctuation of ambient air radon concentration over one week, measured in a laboratory]]
The first step in mitigation is testing to see if the indoor-air and/or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced. No level of radiation is considered completely safe but it cannot be totally eliminated so governments around the world have set various ''action levels'' to provide guidance on when radon concentrations should be reduced while recognizing that radon cannot be eliminated. The World Health Organization's [[International Radon Project]] has recommended an action level of 2.7 pCi/l for radon in the air. Radon in the air is considered to be a larger health threat than radon in domestic water so the US Environmental Protection Agency recommendation is to not test for radon in water unless a radon in air test is above the action level. However, some US states, such as Maine where radon levels are higher than the national average, recommend all well water should be tested for radon. The US government has not set an action level for radon in water.

Air-radon levels fluctuate naturally on a daily and seasonal basis. A short term test (90 days or less) might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level, but are recommended for initial testing to quickly determine unhealthy conditions. Transient weather such as wind and changes in barometric pressure can affect short-term concentrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |title=You've found radon in your home—what should you do? |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Air Chek, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224030656/http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ventilation such as open windows and the operation of exhaust fans.

Testing for radon in the air is accomplished using passive or active devices placed in the building. Some devices are promptly sent to a laboratory for analysis, others calculate the results on-site. Radon-in-water testing requires a water sample being sent to a laboratory.

Retesting is recommended in several situations such as to double check test results before spending money on the installation of a mitigation system. Test results which exceed accuracy tolerances also require re-testing. When a mitigation system installation is warranted, a retest after the system is functional is advised to be sure the system is effectively reducing the radon concentration below the action level, and after any mitigation system repairs such as replacing a fan unit. Retesting is also recommended every ten years.

===Testing in the United States===
[[File:USradonmapforhouses.jpg.png|thumb|Radon map of the United States]]
[[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-2121 is a US standard for reducing air-born radon in homes as far as practicable below the action level of 4 [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/L) (148 [[becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |title=Recommended Residential Radon Mitigation Standard of Practice |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2008-02-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116184748/http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |archivedate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/E2121.htm?L+mystore+xyan5063| title = ASTM E2121-03 Standard Practice for Installing Radon Mitigation Systems in Existing Low-Rise Residential Buildings |publisher = ASTM International |date = |accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states recommend achieving 2.0 pCi/L or less.

Radon test kits are commercially available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |title=Commercially Available Radon Kits |accessdate=2012-04-19 |publisher=Alpha Energy Labs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712143535/http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used by homeowners, tenants and in limited cases by landlords, except when a property is for sale.

Commercially available test kits includes a passive collector that the user places in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long-term kits, taking collections from 91 days to one year, are also available.  Open land test kits can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins, but are not recommended by the EPA because they do not accurately predict the final indoor radon level.  The EPA and the National Environmental Health Association have identified 15 types of radon test devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |title=Radon Measurement Method Definitions |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=The National Environmental Health Association—National Radon Proficiency Program |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165447/http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Lucas cell]] is one type of device.

Retesting is specifically recommended in several situations. Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi/L (148 and 370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant a follow-up short term or long-term radon test before mitigation. Measurements over 10 pCi/L (370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant only another short-term test (not a long term test) so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed.

Purchasers of real estate may delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to less than 4 pCi/L.

It should be noted that the accuracy of the residential radon test depends upon the lack of ventilation in the house when the sample is being obtained.  Thus the occupants will be instructed not to open windows, etc., for ventilation during the pendency of test, usually two days or more.  However, the occupants, if the present owners, will be motivated to pass the test and insure the sale, so they might be tempted to open a window to get a lower radon score.  Moreover, there may be children or immature teens or young adults in the house who will open a window for ventilation notwithstanding instructions not to do so, particularly in uncomfortably hot weather.  Accordingly, whether the potential purchaser should trust the result of such a test is problematic.

Management of radon service provider certification has evolved since being introduced by the EPA in 1986. In the 1990s this service was "privatized" and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) helped transition the voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) to be administered by private firms. {{As of|2012}}, the NRPP is administered by the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrpp.info/history.shtml |title=National Radon Proficiency Program - NEHA and NEHA-NRPP History |publisher=Nrpp.info |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states, such as Maine, require landlords to test their rental properties and turn the results in to the state. In limited cases the landlord or tenant(s) may do the testing themselves. The rules in each state vary. In many cases there are private contractors that will inspect hired by the city.

===Testing in Canada===
Canadian Government, in conjunction with the territories and provinces, developed the guideline&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radoncontrol.ca/radon-gas--vancouver%2c-bc%2c-canada.html |title=Radon Gas &amp;#124; Vancouver, BC, Canada |publisher=Radoncontrol.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate when remedial action should be taken was originally set at 800 Bq/m³ ([[becquerel]]s per cubic meter) and since reduced to 200 Bq/m³. This new guideline was approved by the Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/radiation/radon/faq_fq-eng.php#reaction |title=Radon Frequently Asked Questions - Health Canada |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon gas mitigation==
[[File:Connecticut Radon Mitigation.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of a radon mitigation system including the fan and vent pipe is visible near the gutter downspout.]]Because high levels of radon have been found in every state of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.radonrid.com/comp/myth-vs-fact| title = Radon: Myth vs Fact| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = Radon-Rid/EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; testing for radon and installing radon mitigation systems has become a specialized industry since the 1980s.  Many states have implemented programs that affect home buying and awareness in the real estate community, however radon testing and mitigation systems are not generally mandatory unless specified by the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/rrnc/code_listing.html| title = Listing of States and Jurisdictions with RRNC Codes| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's "A Citizen's Guide to Radon",&lt;ref name="A Citizen's Guide to Radon"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html#lower| title = A Citizen's Guide to Radon| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method to reduce radon "primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |title=Radon Mitigation Methods |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher=Radon Solution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215190050/http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |archivedate=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted" and "EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently" according to the EPA's "Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home".&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/consguid.html#reductiontech| title = Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventilation systems can utilize a heat exchanger or energy recovery ventilator to recover part of the energy otherwise lost in the process of exchanging air with the outside.  For crawlspaces, the EPA states,&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; "An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes."

The most common approaches are active soil depressurization (ASD) and [[ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]] (MV). Experience has shown that ASD is applicable to most buildings since radon usually enters from the soil and rock underneath and MV is used when the indoor radon is emitted from the building materials. A less common approach works efficiently by reducing air pressures within cavities of exterior and demising walls where radon emitting from building materials, most often concrete blocks, collects. 
*Above slab air pressure differential barrier technology (ASAPDB) requires that the interior pressure envelope, most often [[drywall]], as well as all ductwork for air conditioning systems, be made as airtight as possible. A small blower, often no more than 15 cubic feet per minute (0.7 l/s) may then extract the radon-laden air from these cavities and exhaust it to the out of doors. With well-sealed [[HVAC]] ducts, very small negative pressures, perhaps as little as 0.5 [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (0.00007 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]]), will prevent the entry of highly radon-laden wall cavity air from entering into the breathing zone. Such ASAPDB technology is often the best radon mitigation choice for high-rise condominiums as it does not increase indoor humidity loads in hot humid climates, and it can also work well to prevent mold growth in exterior walls in heating climates.
*In hot, humid climates, [[heat recovery ventilator]]s (HRV) as well as [[energy recovery ventilator]]s (ERV) have a record of increasing indoor relative humidity and dehumidification demands on air conditioning systems. Mold problems have originated in homes that have been radon mitigated with HRV and ERV installations in hot, humid climates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} HRVs and ERVs have an excellent record in heating climates.
*A recent technology is based on [[building science]]. It includes a variable rate mechanical ventilation system that prevents indoor relative humidity from rising above a preset level such as 50% which is currently suggested by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] and others as an upper limit for the prevention of mold. It has proven to be especially effective in hot, humid climates. It controls the air delivery rate so that the air conditioner is never overloaded with more moisture than it can effectively remove from the indoor air.
*It is generally assumed that air conditioner operation will remove excess moisture from the air in the breathing zone, but it is important to note that just because the air conditioner cools does not mean that it is also dehumdifying. If Δ''t'' is 14 degrees or less, it may not dehumidify at all even though it is cooling.
*Factors that are likely to aggravate indoor humidity problems from mechanical ventilation–based radon installations are as follows and an expert radon mitigator/building scientist will check for and correct any and all of the following when he or she performs radon mitigation procedures:
** Air conditioner duct leaks located outside the breathing zone, such as in the attic.
** Excessive exhaust fan operation
** Oversize or over-capacity air conditioners
** AC air handler fans that do not stop running when the air conditioner compressor stops running.
** Delta ''t'' (Δ''t''), which is the amount that the air is cooled as it is passed through the air conditioner's cooling coils. A good Δ''t'' performance figure for home air conditioners is about 20&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C). In comparison, automobile air conditioners deliver Δ''t'' performance of 32 to 38&amp;nbsp;°F (18 to 21&amp;nbsp;°C). A Δ''t'' of 14&amp;nbsp;°F (8&amp;nbsp;°C) will dehumidify poorly if at all.

In South Florida, most radon mitigation is performed by use of fixed rate mechanical ventilation. Radon mitigation training in Florida does not include problems associated with mechanical ventilation systems, such as high indoor humidity, mold, moldy odors, property damage or health consequences of human occupation in high humidity of moldy environments{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. As a result, most Florida radon mitigators are unaware of and do not incorporate existing building science moisture management technology into mechanical ventilation radon installations. Home inspectors may not necessarily be aware of the mold risks associated with radon mitigation by mechanical ventilation.

The average cost for an ASD radon mitigation system in Minnesota is $1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/radon/mitigationsystem.html |title=Radon Mitigation System - EH: Minnesota Department of Health |publisher=Health.state.mn.us |date=2014-12-10 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These costs are very dependent on the type of home and age of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radonreductioninc.com/tag/featured-radon-mitigation-system/ |title=Featured Radon Mitigation System Archives |publisher=Radonreductioninc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon-in-water mitigation==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Radon removal from water supplies may be at a treatment plant, point of entry, or point of use. Public water supplies in the United States were required to treat for radionuclides beginning in 2003 but private wells are not regulated by the federal government {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. The radon can be captured by granular activated charcoal (GAR) or released into the air through aeration of the water. Radon will naturally dissipate from water over a period of days, but the quantity of storage needed to treat the water in this manner makes home systems of this type impracticably large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/drinkingwater/dws/radon/upload/2001_01_09_radon_hrrcafr.pdf|format=PDF|title="Radon in Drinking Water Health Risk Reduction and Cost Analysis: Notice"|journal=''Federal Register''|volume= 64|date=February 26, 1999|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activated carbon systems capture radon from the water. The amount of radiation accumulates over time and the filter material may reach the level of requiring disposal as a [[radioactive waste]]. However, in the United States there are no regulations concerning radiation levels and disposal of radon treatment waste {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.

Aeration systems move the radon from the water to the air. Radon gas discharged into the air is the release of a pollutant, and may become regulated in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">'''Redux ''' is the generic name of a family of [[phenol]]&amp;ndash;[[formaldehyde]]/[[polyvinyl]]&amp;ndash;formal [[adhesives]] developed by [[Aero Research Limited]] (ARL) at [[Duxford]], UK, in the 1940s, subsequently produced by [[Ciba-Geigy|Ciba (ARL)]]. The brand name is now also used for a range of [[epoxy]] and bismaleimide adhesives manufactured by [[Hexcel]]. The name is a contraction of '''''RE'''search at '''DUX'''ford''.

==History==
Devised at ARL by Dr. [[Norman de Bruyne]] and George Newell in 1941 for use in the aircraft industry, the adhesive is used for the [[chemical bonding|bonding]] of metal-to-metal and metal-to-wood structures. The adhesive system comprises a liquid phenolic resin and a PVF (PolyVinylFormal) thermoplastic powder.

The first formulation available was '''Redux Liquid E/Formvar''', comprising a phenolic liquid ('''Redux Liquid E''') and a PVF powder ('''[[Formvar]]'''), and after its initial non-aviation related application of bonding [[clutch]] plates on [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] [[tanks]], it was used by [[de Havilland]] from [[1943 in aviation|1943]] to the early 1960s, on, among other aircraft, the [[de Havilland Hornet|Hornet]], the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]] and the derived [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]], and the [[de Havilland Dove|Dove]], [[de Havilland Heron|Heron]] and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident]]. It was also used by [[Vickers Armstrong|Vickers]] on the [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Viking]] and by [[Vought|Chance Vought]] on the [[F7U Cutlass]].

Typically, Redux would be used to affix stiffening [[Longeron|stringer]]s and doublers to [[wing]] and [[fuselage]] panels, the resulting panel being both stronger and lighter than a [[rivet]]ed structure. In the case of the Hornet it was used to join the [[aluminium]] lower-wing skin to the wooden upper wing structure, and in the fabrication of the aluminium/wood main wing [[Spar (aviation)|spar]], both forms of [[Composite material|composite]] construction made possible by the advent of Redux.

After initially supplying de Havilland only, ARL subsequently produced a refined form of ''Redux Liquid E/Formvar'' using a new liquid component known as '''Redux Liquid K6''', and a finer-grade (smaller [[Granular material|particle]]-size) PVF powder, and this was later made generally available to the wider aircraft industry as '''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775''', so-named because it was sold for aircraft use to specification DTD 775&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Available for general non-[[aerospace]] use it was called '''Redux Liquid K6/Powder C'''.

''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'' was joined in [[1954 in aviation|1954]] by the subsequent '''Redux Film 775''' system, used from [[1962 in aviation|1962]] by de Havilland (later [[Hawker Siddeley]] and subsequently [[British Aerospace]]) on the [[British Aerospace BAe 125|DH.125]] and [[BAe 146|DH.146]]. Other users included [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] (on the [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]]), [[Saab Group|SAAB]] (on the [[Saab Lansen|Lansen]] &amp; [[Saab Draken|Draken]]), [[Fokker]] (on the [[Fokker F27|F.27]]), [[Sud Aviation]] (on the [[Aérospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II/III]]), [[Société Anonyme des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Breguet|Breguet]] and [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild]], the film-form having the advantage of greater gap-filling ability with no loss of strength over ''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'', allowing for wider tolerances in component-fit, as well as easier handling and use and controlled ratios of the liquid/powder components.   
Other Redux adhesives available included "Redux 64", a solution of the phenolic liquid and PVF powder, used worldwide for bonding linings to brake shoes, pads and clutches.
The Redux range was subsequently expanded to include the current range of adhesives, both in single and two part paste systems and film forms, for both aerospace and industrial uses.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; DTD = ''Directorate of Technical Development''

==Usage==

To use Redux in its liquid/powder form, a thin film of the phenolic liquid is applied to both mating surfaces and then dusted with or dipped in the PVF powder to give an approximate ratio by weight of 1 part liquid to 2 parts powder. The coated joints are then allowed to stand for not less than 30 minutes and not more than 72 hours before the components are brought together under elevated pressure and temperature. The [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] process is by [[condensation]] and a typical figure for ''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'' is 30 minutes at 145&amp;nbsp;°C (293&amp;nbsp;°F) under a pressure of 100 [[Pound-force per square inch|lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (690 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). This is not critical and variations in curing-time and/or temperature may be used to increase [[Shear strength|shear]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] strength at temperatures above 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F). Extending the curing cycle gives benefits in [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength at some cost in the room-temperature peel strength, the practical limit for [[aluminium alloy]]s being approx 170&amp;nbsp;°C (338&amp;nbsp;°F) for one hour, due to the possibility of affecting the alloy's mechanical properties.

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

'''Sustainable design''' (also called environmentally sustainable design,  environmentally conscious design, etc.) is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of [[ecology|ecological]] [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"&gt;McLennan, J. F. (2004), The Philosophy of Sustainable Design&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit}}  Note: Social and economic factors are vitally important considerations, but are sub systems in the larger context of the Earth's eco-sphere. 

==Theory==
The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design".&lt;ref name="McLennan, J. F. 2004"/&gt; Manifestations of sustainable design require [[renewable resources]], impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment.

Great design is sustainable design: Rather than considering green building design as an externality, architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design. This includes better user experience and comfort, doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance, and maximizing the effectives of durable, quality materials. Rather than the well-known edict “form follows function,” it’s time to think “form follows environment.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.edgebuildings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/igen-2016-prashant-kapoor-red.pdf|title=  Architect and Interiors India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the "elimination of negative environmental impact", sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour. A dynamic balance between economy and society, intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://engagebydesign.org/values/|title=  Sustainable Design Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual problems===

====Diminishing returns====
The principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the [[technology life cycle]] and in the useful life of any system as discussed in [[industrial ecology]] and [[life cycle assessment]].  Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits.  Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity, the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} (see also: [[law of diminishing returns]], [[marginal utility]] and [[Jevons paradox]].)

====Unsustainable investment====
A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], but may lead to a collapse.  This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by [[Joseph Tainter]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;JA Tainter 1988 The Collapse of Complex Societies Cambridge Univ. Press {{ISBN|978-0521386739}}&lt;/ref&gt; This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mayan Empire|Mayan]], among others. Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forest.mtu.edu/info/ecologyseries/Hollings%201973%20resilience.pdf Buzz Holling 1973 Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste prevention====
[[File:Floriade2012Design-GreenestBuildingNL.pdf|thumb|Plans for Floriade 2012 in Venlo, the Netherlands: "The Greenest Building in the Netherlands - no external fuel, electricity, water or sewage."]]
'''Negative Effects of Waste'''

About 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U.K. alone, for example, each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/waste/ Waste and recycling], DEFRA&lt;/ref&gt; And with reference to only household waste, between 1991/92 and 2007/08, each person in England generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1769 Household waste], Office for National Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal. All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment, public health, and local economies. Landfills have contaminated drinking water. Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air, soil, and water. The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology. Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts.

The toxics components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem. In the U.S., about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials, such as [[heavy metals]] like [[nickel]], [[lead]], [[cadmium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from batteries, and [[organic compounds]] found in pesticides and consumer products, such as [[air freshener]] sprays, [[nail polish]], cleaners, and other products.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, "[http://www.epa.gov/ncct/expocast/ Expocast]"&lt;/ref&gt; When burned or buried, toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment.

The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation. Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem. It does not mean doing without, but doing differently. For example, preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages; it just means using refillable bottles.

'''Waste prevention strategies'''
In planning for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste. A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through [[biodegradation]]. This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment. 

Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste &amp;mdash; materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors. The following waste prevention strategies apply to both, although different approaches will be needed for implementation:&lt;ref name=guiding&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch9.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design." Chapter 9: Waste Prevention].&lt;/ref&gt;

* use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic
* compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes
* reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling
* consuming less resources means creating less waste, therefore it reduces the impact on the environment.

===Sustainable design principles===
[[File:CalifAcadamyOfSciAug28-2008img0640.JPG|thumb|290px|The [[California Academy of Sciences]], San Francisco, California, is a sustainable building designed by Renzo Piano. It opened on September 27, 2008]]
[[File:(1)Central building Broadway Sydney-1.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], [[Sydney]]]]

While the practical application varies among disciplines
, some common principles are as follows:
* Low-impact materials: choose non-toxic, sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process
* Energy efficiency: use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy
* [[Emotionally durable design]]: reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products, through design
* Design for reuse and [[recycling]]: "Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife'."&lt;ref&gt;Anastas, P. L. and Zimmerman, J. B. (2003). "[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es032373g Through the 12 principles of green engineering]". Environmental Science and Technology. March 1. 95-101A.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design impact measures]] for total [[carbon footprint]] and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available.^&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many are complex, but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts.  One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of {{convert|8,000|btu|abbr=on}} per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of 0.57&amp;nbsp;kg of CO2 per dollar (1995 dollars US) from DOE figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html US DOE 20 yr Global Product &amp; Energy Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100643/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/carbonemiss/chapter1.html |date=2007-06-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sustainable design standards]] and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals.  There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions.
* [[Biomimicry]]: "redesigning industrial systems on biological lines ... enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles..."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hawken, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins (1999). Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution. Little, Brown. {{ISBN|978-0-316-35316-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Service substitution]]: shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions, e.g., from a private automobile to a [[carsharing]] service. Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption (e.g., per trip driven).&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Chris (2006). "Dematerializing Consumption through Service Substitution is a Design Challenge". Journal of Industrial Ecology. 4(1). {{doi|10.1162/108819800569230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Renewable resource]]: materials should come from nearby (local or [[bioregion]]al), sustainably managed renewable sources that can be [[compost]]ed when their usefulness has been exhausted.
* [[Robust eco-design]]: robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I., Katz R. and Bukchin J., "[http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Eco_Design.pdf Robust Eco-Design: A New Application for Quality Engineering]", IIE Transactions, Vol. 40 (10), p. 907 - 918.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill of Rights for the Planet====
A model of the new design principles necessary for [[sustainability]] is exemplified by the "Bill of Rights for the Planet" or "Hannover Principles" -  developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO 2000 that was held in [[Hannover, Germany]].{{fact|date=September 2017}}
:''The Bill of Rights'':
# Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy, supportive, diverse, and sustainable conditions.
# Recognize Interdependence. The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world, with broad and diverse implications at every scale. Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects.
# Respect relationships between spirit and matter. Consider all aspects of human settlement including community, dwelling, industry, and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness.
# Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being, the viability of natural systems, and their right to co-exist.
# Create safe objects of long-term value. Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products, processes, or standards.
# Eliminate the concept of waste. Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes, to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste.
# Rely on natural energy flows. Human designs should, like the living world, derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income. Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use.
# Understand the limitations of design. No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems. Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature. Treat nature as a model and mentor, not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled.
# Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge. Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues, patrons, manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility, and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity.

These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA) in June 1993 at the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Expo 93 in [[Chicago]]. Further, the AIA and UIA signed a "Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future." In summary, the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA, UIA, and their members are committed to:

* Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities
* Developing and continually improving practices, procedures, products, services, and standards for sustainable design
* Educating the building industry, clients, and the general public about the importance of sustainable design
* Working to change policies, regulations, and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice
* Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards.

In addition, the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design (ICED), a coalition of architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering organizations, developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design. ICED states: The ethics, education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future. . . . To achieve this vision we will join . . . as a multidisciplinary partnership."

These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive. The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch1.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Applications of this philosophy range from the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] &amp;mdash; small objects for everyday use, through to the [[macrocosm]] &amp;mdash; buildings, cities, and the Earth's physical surface. It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[engineering]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[fashion design]] and [[human-computer interaction]].

Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global [[environmental crisis|environmental crises]], the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to [[ecosystem]]s, and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="shu-yang"&gt;Fan Shu-Yang, Bill Freedman, and Raymond Cote (2004). "[http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;journal=er&amp;volume=12&amp;calyLang=eng&amp;articleFile=a04-005.pdf Principles and practice of ecological design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160329/http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet |date=2004-08-14 }}". Environmental Reviews. 12: 97–112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, eco architecture writer [[Bridgette Meinhold]] surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book, “Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World.”&lt;ref name=wwnorton&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Bridgette|title=Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Urgent_Architecture.html?id=ib-nuAAACAAJ|publisher=W.

The limits of sustainable design are reducing. Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency. As a result, the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts.  The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services, does not solve this problem. The basic dilemmas include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements; the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones; that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized, but are distributed throughout the economies; and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing.

==Examples==

===Beauty and sustainable design===
Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics, some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration. [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winner [[Frank Gehry]] has called green building "bogus,"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Arndt, "[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2010/04/architect_gehry.html/ Architect Gehry on LEED Buildings: Humbug]", Bloomberg Businessweek, April 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Design Awards]] winner [[Peter Eisenman]] has dismissed it as "having nothing to do with architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curatorialproject.com/interviews/petereisenmanii.html/ Intercontinental Curatorial Project, Interview with Peter Eisenman, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The American Prospect]]'' asked whether "well-designed green architecture" is an "oxymoron."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-195324010/green-building-blues-is-well-designed-green-architecture/ Kriston Capps, "Green Building Blues," ''The American Prospect,'' February 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided. A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect [[Lance Hosey]], whose book ''[[The Shape of Green: Aesthetics, Ecology, and Design]]'' (2012) was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty. Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful, but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed, creating things of even greater beauty. Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in ''The Shape of Green'' could "revolutionize what it means to be sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderonline.com/design/not-pretty-then-its-not-green_o/|title=Not Pretty? Then It’s Not Green|author=Claire Easley|work=Builder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs. Examples include [[One Central Park]] and the [[Science Faculty building, UTS]].

===Emotionally durable design===

According to [[Jonathan Chapman (academic)|Jonathan Chapman]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], USA, emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of [[natural resources]] by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ‘Design for [Emotional] Durability’, ''Design Issues'', vol xxv, Issue 4, Autumn, pp29-35, 2009 {{doi|10.1162/desi.2009.25.4.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 9/1/15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences &amp; Empathy'', Chapman describes how "the process of consumption is, and has always been, motivated by complex emotional drivers, and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things; it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self, that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment, becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J., ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emotionally-Durable-Design-Objects-Experiences/dp/1844071812 Emotionally Durable Design: Objects, Experiences and Empathy]'', Earthscan, London, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a product requires an attribute, or number of attributes, which extend beyond utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KKEG15_Littsem3_product-attachment-and-replacement.pdf|title = Product attachment and replacement: implications for sustainable design|last = Page|first = Tom|date = 2014|journal = Int. J. Sustainable Design|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 09/01/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chapman, 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements:
* '''Narrative''': How users share a unique personal history with the product.
* '''Consciousness''': How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will.
* '''Attachment''': Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product?
* '''Fiction''': The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship.
* '''Surface''': How the product ages and develops character through time and use.

As a strategic approach, "emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible, well made, tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term."&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, E. (2009). [http://www.ijdesign.org/ojs/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/571/263 Contemporary ceramic design for meaningful interaction and emotional durability: A case study]. ''International Journal of Design'', 3(2), 87-92&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of [[Parsons The New School for Design]] in New York, “emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users, as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to, and in, design things.”&lt;ref&gt;Clark, H. &amp; Brody, D., Design Studies: A Reader, Berg, New York, US, 2009, p531 {{ISBN|9781847882363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable architecture===
{{Main|Sustainable architecture}}
[[File:Sustainable.jpg|thumb|Sustainable building design]]

Sustainable architecture is the design of [[sustainable building]]s. Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the [[life cycle assessment|lifecycle]] of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; [[alternative energy]] sources such as [[solar hot water]], appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power; [[rainwater harvesting]] for gardening, washing and [[aquifer]] recharge; and on-site [[waste management]] such as [[green roof]]s that filter and control stormwater runoff. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation.&lt;ref name="plainiotis"&gt;Ji Yan and Plainiotis Stellios (2006): Design for Sustainability. Beijing: China Architecture and Building Press. {{ISBN|7-112-08390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable architects design with [[sustainable living]] in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable vs [[green design]] is the challenge that designs not only reflect [[healthy building|healthy]] processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources. A test for sustainable design is &amp;mdash; can the design function for its intended use without [[fossil fuel]] &amp;mdash; unplugged. This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution.  As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested, architects will soon be able to create not only passive, null-emission buildings, but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design.  In 2004 the 59 home housing community, the [[Solar Settlement]], and a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} integrated retail, commercial and residential building, the [[Sonnenschiff|Sun Ship]], were completed by architect [[Rolf Disch]] in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The [[Solar Settlement]] is the first housing community worldwide in which every home, all 59, produce a positive energy balance.&lt;ref name="Rolf Disch Solararchitektur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosting.more-elements.com/MoccaMS/projects/plusenergie/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=266&amp;L=0&amp;host=2|title=Rolf Disch - SolarArchitektur|work=more-elements.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011: "[https://osr.ashrae.org/Public%20Review%20Draft%20Standards%20Lib/Gdl-10P-PPR2-Draft%20_chair-approved-rev_.pdf Interactions Affecting the Achievement of Acceptable Indoor Environments]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=Charter of the New Urbanism|work=cnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable landscape and garden design===
{{Main|Sustainable landscape architecture|Sustainable landscaping|Sustainable gardening}}
'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of sustainable design and [[energy-efficient landscaping]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space. Plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation.
Design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind, using local materials, and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce [[green waste]] hauling but to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[Soil carbon|carbon]] in the [[soil]].

Some designers and gardeners such as [[Beth Chatto]] also use [[drought]]-resistant plants in arid areas ([[xeriscaping]]) and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and [[habitat]]s for [[irrigation]]. Water from building roofs may be collected in [[rain garden]]s so that the [[groundwater]] is recharged, instead of rainfall becoming [[surface runoff]] and increasing the risk of [[flooding]].

Areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage [[bio-diversity]]. Native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways: by plants which provide food such as [[nectar]] and [[pollen]] for insects, or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees, or habitats such as [[pond]]s for [[amphibian]]s and aquatic insects. [[Pesticide]]s, especially [[Chemical pesticides|persistent pesticides]], must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife.

Soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to [[Groundcover|ground-cover plants]] and [[mulch]]es to increase [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] and therefore [[earthworms]] and [[mycorrhiza]]; [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]] instead of [[Nitrogen fertilizer#Inorganic fertilizers (mineral fertilizer)|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]]; and sustainably harvested [[Seaweed#Other uses|seaweed extract]] to replace [[Plant nutrition#Micro-nutrients|micronutrients]].

Sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental, growing food, firewood and craft materials from beautiful places.

Sustainable landscape approaches and labels include [[organic farming]] and [[Organic horticulture|growing]], [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[Forest gardening|forest gardens]], [[agroecology]], [[vegan organic gardening]], ecological gardening and [[climate-friendly gardening]].

===Sustainable agriculture===
:''Main: [[Sustainable agriculture|Organic farming]]
[[Sustainable agriculture]] adheres to three main goals:
*Environmental Health,
*Economic Profitability,
*Social and Economic Equity.
A variety of philosophies, policies and practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture.

There are strenuous discussions &amp;mdash; among others by the [[agricultural]] sector and authorities &amp;mdash; if existing pesticide protocols and methods of [[soil conservation]] adequately protect [[topsoil]] and [[wildlife]]. Doubt has risen if these are sustainable, and if [[organic gardening|agrarian reforms]] would permit an efficient [[agriculture]] with fewer [[pesticide]]s, therefore reducing the damage to the [[ecosystem]].

For more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070421034222/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm "UC Davis: Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program"].&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, G (December 1997).

===Domestic machinery and furniture===
{{Main|Home appliances}}
[[Automobile]]s, [[home appliance]]s and [[furniture]]s can be designed for repair and disassembly (for recycling), and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel, aluminum and glass, and renewable materials, such as [[Zelfo]], [[wood]] and plastics from natural feedstocks. Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-[[sustainable products]]. Even mild design efforts can greatly increase the sustainable content of manufactured items.

====Improvements to heating, cooling, ventilation and water heating====

* [[Annualized geothermal solar]]
* [[Earth cooling tubes]]
* [[Geothermal heat pump]]
* [[Heat recovery ventilation]]
* [[Hot water heat recycling]]
* [[Passive cooling]]
* [[Renewable heat]]
* [[Seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES)
* [[Solar air conditioning]]
* [[Solar hot water]]
{{div col end}}

===Energy sector===
{{Main|Solar energy|Alternative energy}}
{{See also|Solar thermal collector|Solar panel|Passive solar building design}}
Sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], [[hydro power|hydro]], [[bioenergy]], [[geothermal energy|geothermal]], and [[hydrogen]]. Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source; it has been in use for centuries in [[Europe]] and more recently in the [[United States]] and other nations. Wind energy is captured through the use of [[wind turbine]]s that generate and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages. Solar power can be harnessed through [[photovoltaics]], concentrating solar, or [[solar hot water]] and is also a rapidly growing energy source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repp.org/index.html "Renewable Energy Policy Project &amp; CREST Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology"]&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in the technology and modifications to photovoltaics cells provide a more in depth untouched method for creating and producing solar power. Researchers have found a potential way to use the photogalvanic effect to transform sunlight into electric energy. &lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.022 "Solar energy conversion and storage: Rhodamine B - Fructose photogalvanic cell"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability, potential, and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan. The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to [[sustainable development]] and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;Various. "[http://www.nps.gov/dsc/dsgncnstr/gpsd/ch7.html Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design". Chapter 7: Energy Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for sustainable manufacturing===
Sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability. The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]] in order to condition the related [[sustainability]] on [[product life cycle]] and Factory operations.
* Designing sustainable production systems imply, on the one hand, the analysis and optimization of intra-factory aspects that are related to [[manufacturing plants]]. Such aspects can regard the [[resource consumption]] restrain, the  process [[efficiency]], the [[ergonomics]] for the factory workers, the elimination of [[hazardous substances]], the minimization of factory emissions and waste as well as internal emissions, the integrated management of information in the production facilities, and the technological updating of machines and plants.
* Other inter-factories aspects concern the sustainable design of manufactured products, product chain [[Dematerialization (products)|dematerialisation]], management of the background and foreground [[supply chains]], support of [[circular economy]] paradigm, and the [[labelling]] for sustainability.

===Water sector===
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Rainwater harvesting|Stormwater harvesting}}
[[File:Rain Water storage.JPG|thumb|A 35,003 litre rainwater harvesting tank in [[Kerala]]]]

Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner.

Beyond the use of certain technologies, Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts. Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption, that is not necessarily for drinking purposes, is of potable water quality. This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called "fit-for-purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|title=Water recycling &amp; alternative water sources|work=health.vic.gov.au|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107231100/http://www.health.vic.gov.au/environment/water/recycle.htm|archivedate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This more rational use of water achieves several economies, that are not only related to water itself, but also the consumption of energy, as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons.

==Terminology==
In some countries the term ''sustainable design'' is known as [[ecodesign]], [[green design]] or [[environmental design]]. [[Victor Papanek]], embraced [[social design]] and social quality and ecological quality, but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term. ''Sustainable design'' and ''design for sustainability'' are more common terms, including the [[triple bottom line]] (people, planet and profit).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the EU, the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign. Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the [[circular economy]] package, that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of 2015. To this effect, an Ecothis.EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ecothis.eu campaign website|url=http://www.ecothis.eu|publisher=ecothis.eu|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable technologies==
Sustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/sustainability-theme1/sustainable-roadmap |title=Sustainable Roadmap - Open Innovation |first= |last= |work=connect.innovateuk.org |year=2012 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant overlap with [[appropriate technology]], which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. However, the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an "appropriate technology," as that term is commonly used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8222">'''The Kildonan School''' is a private coeducational boarding and day school in [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia, New York]] offering daily one-to-one [[Orton-Gillingham]]  language remediation and a college preparatory curriculum for students in grades 2-12 and PG (post-graduate). The Kildonan School is exclusively for students with [[dyslexia]] and [[language-based learning disability|language-based learning disabilities]].

== History ==

The Kildonan School was founded in 1969 by Diana Hanbury King and Kurt Goldman. The college preparatory program, currently with a 100% college acceptance rate,{{Cn|date=November 2014}} evolved from Dunnabeck, the one-to-one Orton-Gillingham based language remediation summer camp also founded by Diana King, which still takes place on the school’s campus every summer.

Ms. King taught for years at [[Sidwell Friends School]] in Washington, D.C. and at Camp Mansfield in Vermont, the latter of which was founded by Helene Durbrow,  who studied directly under [[Samuel Orton|Dr. Samuel Orton]].    Ms. King has written numerous books on the Orton-Gillingham approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Diana|title=English Isn't Crazy!: The Elements of Our Language and How to Teach Them|year=2000|publisher=York|location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Diana|title=Writing Skills|year=1985|publisher=Educators Publisher Service |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and she lectures across the country and trains teachers in Orton Gillingham methodology in the US, in Bermuda, and in Asia.

== The Orton-Gillingham approach ==

The Orton-Gillingham approach is a structured, flexible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Betty|title=The Structured Flexibility of Orton-Gillingham|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=1991|volume=41|issue=4|pages=41–54|doi=10.1007/bf02648077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  multisensory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oakland|first=T |author2=J.L.

== Accreditation ==

The Kildonan School was accredited in 2003 by the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators  and re-accredited by [[NYSAIS]] (the New York State Association of Independent Schools)  in 2013. The Kildonan School currently has two AOGPE Fellows on staff who mentor each tutor the school employs through 70 hours of pre-tutoring training and the AOGPE associate/certification process.

== Complementary programs ==

Dyslexic students learn language differently from other students – specifically, it has been posited that dyslexics compensate for lack of activity while reading in the angular gyrus (responsible for signifiers in language and residing in the back of the brain) with lots of activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (responsible for speech and residing in the front of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariniello|first=Leah|title=Dyslexia and Language Brain Areas|journal=Brain Briefings - Society for Neuroscience|year=1999|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/selflearn/Dyslexia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows, therefore, that dyslexic students tend to also have trouble with balance and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fawcett|first=Angela|title=Automatisation Deficits In Balance For Dyslexic Children|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1992|volume=75|issue=5|pages=507–529|doi=10.2466/pms.1992.75.2.507}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In keeping with brain research that shows that language remediation relies on stimulating connections between brain networks, and specifically between the two hemispheres of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tramontana|first=Michael|author2=Stephen R. Hooper |title=Hemispheric Stimulation Techniques in Children with Dyslexia|journal=Advances in Child Neuropsychology|year=1995|volume=3|series=Springer|pages=144–77|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4178-2_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dryer|first=R. |author2=I.L.

These two sports are balance sports, and so require students to make neural connections between both hemispheres of the brain.

== Mission and philosophy ==

Kildonan’s mission of empowering students with dyslexia is in keeping with research by Brock and Fernette Eide and Ben Foss, which shows that a way to open up future opportunities for dyslexics is to play on their strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venton|first=Danielle|title=Q&amp;A: The Unappreciated Benefits of Dyslexia|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/09/dyslexic-advantage/|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakker|first=Merel|title=Dyslexia: Our Children Deserve an Honest Chance!|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/merel-bakker/dyslexia-our-children-des_b_4106886.html?ir=Parents|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belzberg|first=Lisa|title=Can Dyslexics Succeed at School or Only in Life?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-belzberg/can-dyslexics-succeed-at-_b_2718579.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To this end, Kildonan encourages its staff to include ''The Dyslexic Advantage'' and ''The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan'' in their professional development plans.

'''''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''''' ({{lang-ar|الروض العاطر في نزهة الخاطر}} ''Al-rawḍ al-ʿāṭir fī nuzhaẗ al-ḫāṭir'') by [[Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi]] is a fifteenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[sex manual]] and work of [[erotic literature]].

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about [[sexual health]], and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the [[Human penis|penis]] and [[vagina]], has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

According to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote ''The Perfumed Garden'' sometime during the twelfth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi,&lt;ref&gt;أبو عبدالله محمد ابن عمر النفزاوي&lt;/ref&gt; was born among the [[Berbers|Berber]] Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day [[Tunisia]]. He compiled at the request of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] ruler of [[Tunis]], Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.

==Translations==

===1886: Burton English translation===
''The Perfumed Garden'' first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of [[Pietro Aretino|Aretin]] and [[Rabelais]], and the French book ''Conjugal Love'' by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes ''The Perfumed Garden'' unique in the genre is "the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented." Burton points out that not all of the ideas in ''The Perfumed Garden'' are original: "For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi]]; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book ''Birds and Flowers'' by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams."

The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled ''The Scented Garden'', was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.

=== 1976: Khawam French translation ===
A new French translation by [[René R. Khawam]] was published in 1976.

=== 1999: Colville English translation ===
In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English ''Perfumed Garden'' translated directly from the Arabic original.  Of the Burton translation, he says, "details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources.  The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation.  The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original".

Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled "Sexual Technique" in Colville's translation and "Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition" in Burton's.  Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these.  Colville's translation is 2½ pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.

==Inspiration for musical works==
In 1923 the English composer [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji]] wrote ''Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/04-sourc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAH Band]] released a single entitled “Perfumed Garden” in 1982.

Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish [[melodic death metal|melodic death metal band]], also wrote a song called "The Perfumed Garden", released on their "Spirits and August Light" album in 2003.

[[Ray Manzarek]], inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.

'''''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''''' is a 1995 book by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]], where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to [[Charles Percy Snow]]'s 1959 work ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', which described the conflict between the cultures of the [[humanities]] and [[science]].

== Contents ==
23 people were included in the 1995 book:
* physicist [[Paul Davies]]
* biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] 
* philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]
* paleontologist [[Niles Eldredge]]
* chaos theorist [[J. Doyne Farmer]]
* theoretical physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]]
* biologist [[Brian Goodwin]]
* geologist/biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]]
* physicist [[Alan Guth]]
* inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]]
* theoretical psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]]
* geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]]
* biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]]
* complex systems specialist [[Christopher Langton]]
* biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]
* mathematician and computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]]
* mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]
* cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]]
* theoretical astrophysicist [[Martin Rees]]
* cognitive scientist [[Roger Schank]]
* theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]]
* biologist [[Francisco Varela]]
* evolutionary biologist [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their "[[Feuilleton]]" or "culture" sections (such as the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that "third culture thinking" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the Anglo-Saxon cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]] and the psychologist [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for "third culture." The German author [[Gabor Paal]] suggested that the idea of the "third culture" is a rather modern version of what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] called [[Realphilosophie]] (''philosophy of the real'').

Also, already during the [[interwar period]], [[Otto Neurath]] and other members of the [[Vienna Circle]] strongly propagated the need for both the [[unity of science]] and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s-1940s.

'''Threats to sea turtles''' are numerous and have caused many [[sea turtle]] species to be endangered. Of the seven extant species of sea turtles, six in the family Cheloniidae and one in the family Dermochelyidae, all are listed on the [[IUCN Red List of Endangered Species]]. The list classifies six species of sea turtle as "threatened", two of them as "critically endangered", one as "endangered" and three as "vulnerable". The [[flatback sea turtle]] is classified as "data deficient" which means that there is insufficient information available for a proper assessment of conservation status.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2018. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 3.1. &lt;http://www.iucnredlist.org&gt;. 11 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Although sea turtles usually lay around one hundred eggs at a time, on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Sara. "Hilton Head Island sees record sea turtle nesting season." Bluffton Today (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.blufftontoday.com/news/2010-08-06/hilton-head-island-sees-record-sea-turtle-nesting-season&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the things that endanger these hatchlings are natural, such as predators including sharks, raccoons, foxes, and seagulls,&lt;ref&gt;"Natural ." Sea Turtle Foundation. Sea Turtle Foundation, 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.seaturtlefoundation.org/threats/natural/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; many new threats to the sea turtle species have recently arrived and increased with the ever-growing presence of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, Michael, Aaron Wirsing, Jordan Thomson, and Derek Burkholder. "A review of lethal and non-lethal effects of predators on adult marine turtles." ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'' 356.1-2 (2008): 43-51. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial lighting==

One of the greatest threats to the survival of hatchlings is [[lighting|artificial lighting]].  When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="Lohmann, Catherine 2006"&gt;Lohmann, Catherine, and Kenneth Lohmann. "Sea turtles ." ''Current Biology'' 16.18 (2006): R784-R786. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially.  With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle’s natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest  thing of light.  With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful treks to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Marc. "The Biogeography of Leatherback Turtles." San Francisco State University. San Francisco State University, Nov 2002. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/fall02%20projects/leatherback.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies support artificial light as the leading cause for hatchling disorientation, showing that in 1999, 51% of the nests studied showed signs of confusion with one-fourth of all the hatchlings headed in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Mark. "Light Pollution and Marine Turtle Hatchlings: The Straw that Breaks the Camel's Back?." ''The George Wright Forum''. The George Wright Society, 2001. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	As artificial lighting has been shown to be significantly harmful to the offspring of sea turtles, there have been several large-scale conservation efforts by Marine Life programs and conservation groups like  that continue to educate the public on turtle conservation.  Communities situated on or near a beach have been warned of the effects excessive lighting has on sea turtles and there has been substantial attempts to darken beaches and replace harmful artificial lighting with turtle-safe lights.  Some entire communities have adopted official sea turtle protection regulations, such as Florida’s “Lights-out” policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Fredrica. "Saving Sea Turtles with a Lights-Out Policy in Florida." ''National Geographic News''10 Mar. 2003: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0310_030310_turtlelight_2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic interference==

Ferrous metal wire mesh screens are commonly used to protect sea turtle nests from predators' excavating and devouring the eggs and hatchlings.  A new concern is that nestlings' delicate magnetic sense may not develop normally in the presence of the magnetic field interference from                                                    these steel mesh cages.  The effects of the use of steel mesh as a cage material may not be known for many years until assessments can be made of the success rate of the first adult populations that developed within such cages begin attempting landfall for nest-making.  Gravid turtles or their hatchlings may also be affected by the presence of magnetic fields arising from power cables, iron debris,  steel seawalls or other human activities that locally modify earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Lohmann, Catherine 2006"/&gt;

==Oil spills and marine pollution==
[[File:Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation.jpg|thumb|An oiled Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]
[[Marine pollution]] is both directly harmful to sea turtles as well as indirectly, through the deterioration of their natural habitats.  Some of the most dangerous ocean pollutants include [[toxic metal]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, untreated waste, [[chemical substance|chemicals]], and a variety of [[petroleum]] products. [[Oil spill]]s are particularly dangerous to sea turtles.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles"&gt;"Sea Turtle Threats: Oil Spills." ''Sea Turtle Conservancy'' (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=oilspills&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;   Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can get in their eyes, skin, and lungs which can lead to significant health problems.  Even if they are not directly in contact with marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat.  Oil is also a cause for the death of [[seagrass]], which is a large staple in the diet of the green turtle.  The diets of the [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[loggerhead sea turtle]], and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]] species have also been affected by the oil’s role in the reduction of certain [[sponges]] and [[invertebrates]].   Extended exposure has been found to deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other threats.&lt;ref name="Milton, Sarah 2010"&gt;Milton, Sarah, and Peter Lutz. United States. ''Oil and Sea Turtles Biology, Planning, and Response''.  2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, formerly known as the Caribbean Conservation Program, the [[animal migration|migration]] habits of sea turtles increase their exposure to marine pollution at each of the stages of their lives including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub adults, or nesting adults.   A 1994 study off of Florida’s Atlantic coast, 63% of hatchlings surveyed had been found to have ingested tar.  Loggerheads in particular have been shown to have the most problems with [[tarball (oil)|tarball]] ingestion, leading to [[esophagus|esophageal]] swelling that can dislocate the intestines and liver leading to serious [[buoyancy]] issues as well as excessive swelling.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles" /&gt; Many regions heavily associated with oil, either exploration, transportation, or processing, are also significant sea turtle environments, including the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]], and particularly the coasts of Texas and Florida.&lt;ref name="Milton, Sarah 2010"/&gt; Sea turtles existing in the exact areas where oil spills occur are not the only ones at risk due to the strong and far reaching ocean currents which can move pollution to great distances from its derivation.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, B.E. "Ecology of neonate loggerhead turtles inhabiting lines of downwelling near a Gulf Stream front." ''Sea Turtle Conservancy '' (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Breeding season is in particular a dangerous time for sea turtles due to the pollution of beach nesting sites.&lt;ref&gt;Antworth, Rebecca, David Pike, and John Stiner. "Nesting ecology, current status, and conservation of sea turtles on an uninhabited beach in Florida, USA." ''Biological Conservation'' 130.1 (2006): 10-15. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contamination of their diet can lead to disruption of digestion as well as physical injury of the sea turtles’ digestive tracts.  The nesting of female sea turtles is often deterred due to the potential of oily effluence.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles" /&gt;  If the female does lay eggs, the development of the eggs is still at risk due to either oil in the sand or contamination from the mother turtle that was oiled while nesting.  If the eggs in the nest have contact with oil while in the last half of their [[egg incubation|incubation phase]], the rate of hatchling survival sharply decreases and those that do survive have a greater chance of physical deformities.&lt;ref&gt;United States. ''Impacts of Oil on Marine Mammals and Sea Turtles'', 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean plastic==
Discarded plastic bags floating in the ocean resemble jellyfish, a common food of sea turtles. If a turtle eats a plastic foil, it tends to clog the turtle's digestive system and results in the animal dying. There have been many cases of dissection showing plastic foil and other debris inside turtles stomachs and intestines.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.seaturtle.org/imagelib/?cat=663&amp;thumb=1 Pictures of plastic items eaten by turtles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Owing to the popularity of numerous sea turtle species, people often travel to areas where the turtles nest or live to observe and photograph them. This has resulted in numerous deaths of the turtles through boat collisions, tourists attempting to catch or steal individuals, and other incidents. In [[Costa Rica]], tourists have recently been criticised for interfering with the nesting habits of the resident [[Olive ridley sea turtle]]s, disrupting and confusing the animals by attempting to take [[selfie]]s with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/selfie-taking-tourists-threaten-sea-turtle-population-in-costa-rica-1.3237329|title=Selfie-taking tourists threaten sea turtle population in Costa Rica  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boats ==
[[File:Manatee_bearing_scars_on_back_from_boat_propeller.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manatee_bearing_scars_on_back_from_boat_propeller.jpg|thumb|Image of a manatee with boat strike injuries. Similar injuries occur on turtle with parallel cuts (as shown in the image) or by blunt force trauma.]]
There are numerous threats to sea turtles associated with boats including: [[Oil spill|oil spills,]] [[habitat degradation]], and vessel collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology of Sea Turtles|last=Lutcavage|first=ME|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=388-404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boat strike injuries result in two types of injuries: blunt force trauma and propeller slices in the [[carapace]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=George|date=2012|title=Boat strikes: A threat to the Suwannee Cooter (Pseudemys concinna suwanniensis)|url=|journal=Herpetological Conservation and Biology|volume=7|pages=349-357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blunt force trauma is from the hull of the boat hitting the turtle. Blunt force trauma results in a cracking, less obvious, injury on the turtle's [[carapace]]. Propeller strikes form clear cut, parallel lines on the carapace of the turtle. The [[propeller]] wounds can cut into the spinal cord or lungs if deep enough, as these are located dorsally on the animal attached to the underside of the [[carapace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anatomy of Sea Turtle|last=Wyneken|first=J|publisher=U.S. Departments of Commerce NOAA Technnical Memorandum NMFS-SEFSC-470|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea turtle stranding data is the primary method of quantifying boat strike injuries, which has increased by 20% in [[Florida]] between 1985 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singel|first=K|date=2007|title=Navigating Florida’s waterways: boat related strandings of marine turtles in Florida|url=|journal=Proceeding of the 27th Annual Symposium on Sea Turtle Biology and Conservation.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, sea turtles are not able to avoid boat collisions when boats are travelling too quickly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazel|first=Julia|date=2007|title=Vessel speed increases collision risk for the green turtle Chelonia mydas|url=|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=3|pages=105-113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the faster a boat is travelling the more damage is done to the turtle, making incidents more lethal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Work|first=Paul A.|last2=Sapp|first2=Adam L.|last3=Scott|first3=David W.|last4=Dodd|first4=Mark G.|date=2010|title=Influence of small vessel operation and propulsion system on loggerhead sea turtle injuries|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2010.07.019|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=393|issue=1-2|pages=168–175|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2010.07.019|issn=0022-0981|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When sea turtles surface to breathe they continue swimming in the water column just below the surface, this allows them to get a few breathes in at a time, and then dive into deeper water to hunt or [[forage]]. This depth is the ideal depth for the propeller of the boat to hit the turtle, it also makes it even more difficult for boaters to try and avoid the turtle, since they can't be seen.

There are ways to mitigate the problem. Speed reduction zones have been beneficial for species such as the [[Florida Manatee|Florida manatee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laist|first=David W.|last2=Shaw|first2=Cameron|date=2006|title=PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT BOAT SPEED RESTRICTIONS REDUCE DEATHS OF FLORIDA MANATEES|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00027.x|journal=Marine Mammal Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=472–479|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00027.x|issn=0824-0469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones would be especially important implemented in shallow, [[Coast|coastal]] regions near popular nesting beaches during nesting season. Vessel modification are another way that boaters can reduce their influence on marine life. Jet board motors have an impeller that eliminates the threat of propeller damage to marine turtles. The motor rests only a few inches from the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of the boat, meaning it is less likely to hit turtles that are not surfacing to breathe. Propeller guards are slightly helpful at idle speeds, but once a boat begins to reach higher planing speeds they are ineffective in protecting the turtle from the propeller. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sea turtles that strand alive with boat injuries can be treated at rehabilitation facilities. Treatment is not always successful, but there are turtles that do survive boat strike injuries. 

==Fishing==
According to an article in AAAS &amp; Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died over the past twenty years due to injuries caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats.&lt;ref name="news.sciencemag.org"&gt;Stokstad, Erik. "Sea Turtles Suffer Collateral Damage From Fishing." ''Science AAAS'' 07 Apr 2010: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/sea-turtles-suffer-collateral-da.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310111027/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/sea-turtles-suffer-collateral-da.html |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fisheries]] often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark.  What is known as “[[bycatch]]” is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name="news.sciencemag.org"/&gt; [[longline fishing|Longline]], [[trawling|trawl]],&lt;ref&gt;Sasso, Christopher, and Sheryan Epperly. "Seasonal sea turtle mortality risk from forced submergence in bottom trawls." ''Fisheries Research'' 81.1 (2006): 86-88. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gillnet]] fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea turtle accidents.  Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come up for air.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Heather, Erin LaCasella, Robin LeRoux, Henry Miliken, and Brett Hayward. "Characteristics of sea turtles incidentally captured in the U.S. Atlantic sea scallop dredge fishery." ''Fisheries Research'' 93.3 (2008): 289-295. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital organs and intestines.&lt;ref&gt;Viegas, Jennifer. "Millions of Sea Turtles Captured, Killed by Fisheries." ''Discovery News'' (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://news.discovery.com/animals/turtles-bycatch-fishing.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poaching==

In many countries sea turtles are captured, killed, and traded for their meat, shells and for their leather flippers.   Eggs are also at risk of [[poaching]] and are commonly eaten by humans and are considered a delicacy in certain cultures.  Other cultures believe sea turtle eggs to be [[aphrodisiac]]s, while others claim that eating them yields longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Rhett. "Sex sells sea turtle conservation in Mexico." Environmental News August 19, 2005: n. pag. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://news.mongabay.com/2005/0819-turtles.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In some islands, parts of the sea turtle are used in ceremonies and are considered sacred.  Other times, the carcasses harvested are made into jewelry, instruments, souvenirs, sunglasses, or wall decorations, especially of the Hawksbill variety which are desired for the striking details of the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guern Lytle, Claire. "Sea Turtle Egg Poaching Legalized in Costa Rica: The Debate ." Coastal Care. N.p., n.d. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://coastalcare.org/2011/07/legalized-poaching-turtles-eggs-and-playa-ostional-costa-rica/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==
[[File:Climate March 0841 (34210334302).jpg|thumb|Placard "I speak for the sea turtles", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].]]

[[Global warming]] is estimated to have serious effects on wildlife over the next few decades. There is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. With the increase of temperature, [[polar ice cap|polar ice]] has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. Global warming has been associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that [[coastal erosion|erode beaches]] and flood nests.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Warming." SEE Turtles. N.p., 2007. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.seeturtles.org/1380/global-warming.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224021856/http://www.seeturtles.org/1380/global-warming.html# |date=2010-12-24 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. Water that is too warm can also cause [[coral bleaching]], which is detrimental to [[reefs]] that are essential to certain species, such as the Hawksbill sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, Sean. "Global Warming Has Devastating Effect on Coral Reefs, Study Shows." National Geographic News 28 Oct 2010: n. pag. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/warming-coral.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[File:Turtlewithfptumors0149026.jpg|thumb|right|A sea turtle with [[fibropapillomatosis]].]]
A disease known as [[fibropapillomatosis]] manifests itself in turtles through external [[tumor]]s.  These tumors often grow to be so large that they hinder a sea turtle’s ability to see, eat, and swim, therefore rendering the sea turtle unable to survive.  Inexplicably, the majority of the cases of fibropapillomatosis have been diagnosed in the [[green sea turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'') while none have been in the [[leatherback sea turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea'').  Cases of this disease have been found in all major oceans.  Although the causes of this disease are not clear, many believe the source to be [[virus|viral]].  These tumors are either smooth or contain pointed projections and they are red, pink, grey, black, or purple in color. These tumors are usually located anywhere on the soft skin tissue of the sea turtle, either the neck, eyes, or bottom of the flippers and range in size anywhere from a pea to a grapefruit.&lt;ref&gt;Florida. ''Fibropapillomatosis and its effect on green turtles'', 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts and rehabilitation centers==

A study by Discovery News targets the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the Eastern [[Pacific]], the Southwest [[Atlantic]], and the Northwest Atlantic as the regions in the direst need of preservation endeavors.  In 1963, the Marine Turtle Group was created by the chairman of the Survival Service Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources as the first international forum for sea turtle research and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Frederick. "Saving sea turtles: the evolution of the IUCN Marine Turtle Group." ''Endeavour'' 29.3 (2005): 114-118. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1973, the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] was passed, providing protection for all sea turtle species, and in 1977, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the [[NOAA|NOAA Fisheries]] and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to enforce the ESA with regards to sea turtles.  USFWS is responsible for all sea turtle conservation on nesting beaches and NOAA Fisheries are responsible for the marine conservation of sea turtles. The conservation of sea turtles on an international scale has been led by two major environmental agreements: the [[Indian Ocean]] – South-East Asian Marine Turtle Memorandum of Understanding and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles.&lt;ref name="nmfs.noaa"&gt;"Marine Turtles." Office of Protected Resources. NOAA Fisheries, 11 Nov 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/turtles/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an attempt to lessen the number of turtles killed by fishing incidents, several new types of turtle-safe fishing equipment have been introduced such as the [[circle hook]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Read, Andrew. "Do circle hooks reduce the mortality of sea turtles in pelagic longlines? A review of recent experiments." ''Biological Conservation'' 135.2 (2007): 155-169. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fish bait]], and [[turtle excluder device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Bycatch - So what's the answer?." WWF Global. N.p., 2009. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.smartgear.org/smartgear_bycatch/bycatch_{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Poaching]] has been outlawed in most countries and turtle conservation education has been growing in both in size and efficiency.

Rehabilitation centers have been established as well, such as the Marine Life Center in [[Juno Beach, Florida]] &lt;ref&gt;"Our Mission." ''Loggerhead Marinelife Center''. N.p., 2010. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.marinelife.org/mission&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center located on [[Topsail Island, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center Mission Statement." ''Topsail Turtle Project''. N.p., 2011. Web. 4 Oct 2011. &lt;http://seaturtlehospital.org/whoweare.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these centers is to help protect the local and [[endangered sea turtles|endangered sea turtle]] population by: a) rescuing sick or injured turtles and taking them to the treatment facility, b) rehabilitating these turtles through various types of treatment and/or surgery, and c) releasing turtles back into the ocean once they have been successfully nursed back to health. Although some sea turtles’ injuries are so severe that they can never become healed to the extent of being able to survive on their own outside of the facilities, hundreds of the patients from both the Gordon and Patricia Gray Veterinary Hospital in Juno Beach and the Sea Turtle Hospital in Topsail Island have been successfully rehabilitated and released in the last couple of decades.

Evaluating the progress of conservation programs is difficult, because many sea turtle populations have not been assessed adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bjorndal |first1= Karen |last2= Bowen |first2= Brian |year= 2011 |title= Better Science Needed for Restoration in the Gulf of Mexico |journal= Science |volume= 331 |pages= 537–538 |doi= 10.1126/science.1199935 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6017/537.full.pdf |accessdate= July 25, 2011 |issue=6017 |pmid=21292956 |last3= Chaloupka |first3= M. |last4= Crowder |first4= L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">In [[science]] and [[research]], an '''attribute''' is a characteristic of an object (person, thing, etc.).&lt;ref name=babbie&gt;[[Earl R. Babbie]], ''The Practice of Social Research", 12th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-495-59841-0}}, p. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes are closely related to variables. A '''variable''' is a [[logic]]al set of attributes.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; Variables can "vary" - for example, be high or low.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word "low" or "high").&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; ''(For example see: [[Binary option]])''

While an attribute is often intuitive, the '''variable''' is the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]]. In data processing [[data]] are often represented by a combination of ''items'' (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns).

Values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called ''binary'' (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have ''non-dichotomous'' variables and the ones with a higher [[level of measurement]]. (See also [[domain of discourse]].)

Semantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from '[[Phenotypic_trait|traits]]' (characteristics that are inherent to the object).

==Examples==
[[Ageing|Age]] is an attribute that can be operationalized in many ways. It can be dichotomized so that only two values - "old" and "young" - are allowed for further data processing. In this case the attribute "age" is operationalized as a binary variable. If more than two values are possible and they can be ordered, the attribute is represented by ordinal variable, such as "young", "middle age", and "old". Next it can be made of rational values, such as 1, 2, 3.... 99&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

The "social class" attribute can be operationalized in similar ways as age, including "lower", "middle" and "upper class" and each class could be differentiated between upper and lower, transforming thus changing the three attributes into six (see the [[Social_class#William_Lloyd_Warner|model proposed by William Lloyd Warner]]) or it could use different terminology (such as the [[working class]] as in the [[Social_class#Gilbert_.26_Kahl|model by Gilbert and Kahl]]).

The '''Voluntary Human Extinction Movement''' ('''VHEMT'''{{efn-ua|VHEMT is pronounced "vehement",&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|last=Pesca|first=Mike|title=All Choked Up|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5401422|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=May 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; because, according to Knight, that is what they are.&lt;ref name=te/&gt;}}) is an [[environmental movement]] that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary [[Human extinction|extinction of humankind]]. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent [[environmental degradation]]. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of [[resources]] required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by [[human overpopulation]].

VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]] in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's [[biosphere]] and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop [[Sustainable living|sustainable lifestyles]] or can [[Human population planning|reduce their population]] to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.

== History ==
The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight,&lt;ref name=te/&gt;&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;{{efn-ua|Knight denies that he is the founder, saying that "I’m not the founder of VHEMT, I just gave it a name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal information about Les U.

In 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter,&lt;ref name=te/&gt; known as ''These Exit Times''.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; In the newsletter, he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating.&lt;ref name=te/&gt; VHEMT has also published cartoons,&lt;ref name=ta&gt;{{cite news|title=Sites answer 300 million questions|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061022/NEWS/610220322/1016/FEATURES07|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Barre Montpelier Times Argus|date=October 22, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019235441/http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061022%2FNEWS%2F610220322%2F1016%2FFEATURES07|archivedate=October 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a comic strip titled ''Bonobo Baby'', featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a [[bonobo]].&lt;ref name=ti&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Stephen|title=Live long and die out: Stephen Jarvis encounters the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/live-long-and-die-out-stephen-jarvis-encounters-the-voluntary-human-extinction-movement-1372200.html|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 24, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT;{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} it was available in 11 languages by 2010.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} VHEMT's logo features the letter "V" (for voluntary) and a picture of the Earth with north at the bottom.&lt;ref name=vhemtlogo&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolism of the logo for the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|url=http://vhemt.org/logo.htm|publisher=Voluntary Human Extinction Movement|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|VHEMT states that the inverted Earth represents the radical shift in human direction the movement seeks, and notes that upside down emblems are often used as symbols of distress.&lt;ref name=vhemtlogo/&gt;}}

== Organization and promotion ==
VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization,{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|pp=142–3}} and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of [[Willamette University]] stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers.&lt;ref name=te/&gt; Six years later, [[Fox News]] said the list had only 230 subscribers.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement;&lt;ref name=te/&gt; and that this includes "millions of people".&lt;ref name=aboutvhemt&gt;

Knight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT.&lt;ref name=te/&gt; He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts,{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} as well as [[bumper sticker]]s that read "Thank you for not breeding".&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

Knight argues that the [[human population]] is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that the best thing for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing.&lt;ref name="CNN Technology"/&gt; He says that humans are "incompatible with the biosphere"&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms).&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived [[Sustainable living|sustainable lifestyles]],&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the [[Extinction#Modern extinctions|extinction of other species]]; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population.&lt;ref name=te/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/07/29/anti-people-group-pushes-for-man-extinction.html|title=Anti-People Group Pushes for Man's Extinction|last=Park|first=Michael Y.|date=July 29, 2001|work=Fox News|accessdate=February 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429112341/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C30834%2C00.html|archivedate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN Technology"/&gt;

James Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal ''Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society'', notes that the "most fundamental belief" of VHEMT is that "human beings should stop reproducing", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}} Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Residents of [[First World]] countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume the largest proportion of resources.&lt;ref name=og/&gt;

Knight believes that Earth's non-human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: "The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger".&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; He argues that species higher in the [[food chain]] are less important than lower species.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; His ideology is drawn in part from [[deep ecology]], and he sometimes refers to the Earth as [[Gaianism|Gaia]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals.&lt;ref name="CNN Technology"&gt;

Knight sees abstinence from reproduction as an [[Altruism|altruistic]] choice&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a way to prevent involuntary human suffering&lt;ref name=newsci&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221862.800-breeding-to-death.html|title=Breeding to Death|newspaper=New Scientist|date=May 15, 1999|page=19}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Knight claims that non-reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the [[Garden of Eden]],&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=312}} Other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion, war, and starvation.&lt;ref name="maclean"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/science/environment/article.jsp?content=20070806_108079_108079|title=Please refrain from procreating|last=Bethune|first=Brian|date=August 6, 2007|work=Maclean's|accessdate=January 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625170751/http://www.macleans.ca/science/environment/article.jsp?content=20070806_108079_108079|archivedate=June 25, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight argues that "procreation today is de facto child abuse".{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce, they would use their energy for other pursuits,&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt;

VHEMT rejects government-mandated [[human population control]] programs in favor of voluntary population reduction,&lt;ref name=te/&gt; supporting only the use of [[birth control]] and willpower to prevent pregnancies.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population, citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars, famines, and viruses.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=310}} Though their newsletter's name recalls the suicide manual ''[[Final Exit]]'',&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Savory|first=Eve|title=VHEMT: The case against humans|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2008/09/03/f-savory-vhemt.html|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of mass suicide is rejected,&lt;ref name=og&gt;{{cite news|last=Buarque|first=Daniel|title=Cada pessoa nova é um fardo para o planeta, diz movimento da extinção |trans-title=Every new person is a burden on the planet, says an extinction movement |url=http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2011/10/cada-pessoa-nova-e-um-fardo-para-o-planeta-diz-movimento-da-extincao.html|language=Portuguese|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=G1|date=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have adopted the slogan "May we live long and die out".&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect the Earth, distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment, and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause. VHEMT members who strongly believed that "Civilization [is] headed for collapse" were most likely to embrace these views.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|p=267}} However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=143}}

VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than [[Population Action International]], a group that argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the [[Church of Euthanasia]], which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of [[Earth First!]] or had donated to the group in the previous five years.{{sfn|Ellis|1998|p=382–3}}

== Reception ==
Knight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's [[natalism]]. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

Reception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Gregory Dicum states that there is an "undeniable logic" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in ''[[The Independent]]'', noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; At ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction.&lt;ref name="gd"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/28/children-parents|title=Am I fit to breed?|last=Dammann|first=Guy|date=December 28, 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain.&lt;ref name="tg02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/24/nomorebabiesplease|title=No more babies, please|last=O'Reilly|first=Abby|date=November 24, 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight contends in response to these arguments that though [[sexual desire]] is natural, human desire for children is a product of [[enculturation]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; Ormrod claims that Knight "arguably abandons [[deep ecology]] in favour of straightforward [[misanthropy]]". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on "benefits accruing to humans". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of "late-modern consumer societies". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology.{{sfn|Ormrod|2011|p=158}} ''[[The Economist]]'' characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as "Malthusian bosh". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction.&lt;ref name=te/&gt; Sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] also deems VHEMT to be a [[Malthusian]] group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that "[thinks] the worst about the human species".&lt;ref name=spike&gt;{{cite news|last=Furedi|first=Frank|title=Environmentalism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/3817|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than "anti-human".&lt;ref name=spiked1/&gt;

Brian Bethune writes in ''[[Maclean's]]'' that Knight's logic is "as absurd as it's unassailable". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a "collective loss of the will to live" would prevail.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; In response to Knight's platform, journalist [[Sheldon Richman]] argues that humans are "active agents" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth.&lt;ref name="CNN Technology"/&gt; [[Alan Weisman]], author of ''[[The World Without Us]]'', suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt;

[[Katharine Mieszkowski]] of [[Salon.com]] recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing "probing questions" about their childlessness.&lt;ref name="sdc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/11/16/human_extinction/|title=No need to breed?|last=Mieszkowski|first=Katharine|date=November 16, 2005|work=Salon|access-date=January 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924175257/http://www.salon.com/2005/11/16/human_extinction/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies'', Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of "queer oppositional politics" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of "civil order", as [[Lee Edelman]] suggested that [[queer theory]] should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the [[death drive]] rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past.&lt;ref name=da&gt;

Although Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled ''[[Donna Kossy#Kooks (1994)|Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief]]'',&lt;ref name=te/&gt; ''The Guardian'' journalist [[Oliver Burkeman]] notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems "rather sane and self-deprecating".&lt;ref name=tg&gt;{{cite news|last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|title=Climate change: calling planet birth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/climate-change-family-size-babies|accessdate=January 7, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as "thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious".&lt;ref name=spiked1&gt;{{cite news|last=Appleton|first=Josie|title=Unleashing nature’s terror|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_printable/3628/|accessdate=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Spiked|date=July 20, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521165551/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_printable/3628/|archivedate=May 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in "modern [[humanism]]".{{sfn|Best|Kellner|2001|p=268–9}}

'''Waste hierarchy''' is a tool used in the evaluation of processes that [[Environmental protection|protect the environment]] alongside [[resource consumption|resource]] and [[energy consumption]] to most favourable to least favourable actions.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite web|first1=Wenke |last1=Hansen |first2=Maria |last2=Christopher |first3=Maic |last3=Verbuecheln |date=December 2002| title=EU Waste Policies and Challenges for Local and Regional Authorities|url=http://ecologic.eu/sites/files/download/projekte/1900-1949/1921-1922/1921-1922_background_paper_waste_en.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy establishes preferred program priorities based on [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;  To be sustainable, waste management cannot be solved only with technical end-of-pipe solutions and an integrated approach is necessary.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental Protection Agency |date=2013|title=Non-Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy|url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waste management hierarchy''' indicates an order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste, and is usually presented diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Environmental Program |year=2013 |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities|isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy captures the progression of a material or product through successive stages of [[waste management]], and represents the latter part of the [[Product lifecycle|life-cycle for each product]].&lt;ref name=UNEP/&gt;

The aim of the '''waste hierarchy''' is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.  The proper application of the waste hierarchy can have several benefits. It can help prevent emissions of greenhouse gases, reduces pollutants, save energy, conserves resources, create jobs and stimulate the development of green technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waste-to-Energy Research and Technology Council |date=2009|title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.wtert.eu/default.asp?Menue=14&amp;ShowDok=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life-cycle thinking==

All products and services have [[environmental impact]]s, from the extraction of [[raw materials]] for production to manufacture, distribution, use and disposal.   Following the waste hierarchy will generally lead to the most [[resource-efficient]] and environmentally sound choice but in some cases refining decisions within the hierarchy or departing from it can lead to better environmental outcomes.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission|title=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment for Waste Management|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/publications/pdf/Making_Sust_Consumption.pdf |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Product lifecycle|Life cycle]] thinking and assessment can be used to support decision-making in the area of [[waste management]] and to identify the best environmental options. It can help policy makers understand the benefits and trade-offs they have to face when making decisions on waste management strategies. [[Life-cycle assessment]] provides an approach to ensure that the best outcome for the environment can be identified and put in place.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It involves looking at all stages of a product’s life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or [[reuse]] of resources.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.

For example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]. This is because a washing machine’s greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

The European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into [[waste policies]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other [[environmental initiative]]s.

== European Union waste framework directive ==

In 1975, The European Union’s [[Waste Framework Directive]] (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy.&lt;ref name=ECWaste&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=2014 |title=EU Waste Legislation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312223737/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the importance of [[waste minimization]], and the [[Environmental protection|protection of the environment]] and [[human health]], as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.

In 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web|author=Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs|title=Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the European Union parliament introduced a new ''five-step waste hierarchy'' to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt; Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt;  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including [[energy recovery]] and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=197|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges for local and regional authorities ==
The task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach.&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; 
* A coherent [[waste management]] strategy must be set up
* Separate [[garbage collection|collection]] and [[waste sorting|sorting]] systems for many different waste streams need to be established.
* Adequate [[waste treatment|treatment]] and disposal facilities must be established.
* An effective horizontal co-operation between local authorities and municipalities and a vertical co-operation between the different levels of government, local to regional and when beneficial, also at the national level need to established
* Finding financing for the establishing or upgrading of expensive sustainable waste management infrastructure to address the needs of managing waste
* A lack of data available on waste management strategies must be overcome and monitoring requirements must be met to implement the waste programs
* The enforcement and control of business plans and practices be established and applied to maximize benefits to the environment and human health
* A lack of administrative capacity at the regional and local level. The lack of finances, information, and technical expertise must be overcome for effective implementation and success of the waste management policies.

==Source reduction==
[[Source reduction]] involves efforts to reduce [[hazardous waste]] and other materials by modifying industrial production. Source reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology, [[raw material]] inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term "pollution prevention" may refer to source reduction.

Another method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling.  Many communities in the United States are implementing [[variable-rate pricing]] for waste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - [[PAYT]]) which has been effective in reducing the size of the [[municipal waste]] stream.&lt;ref name="ecocycle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocycle.org/zero/pay_throw.cfm|title=Pay-As-You-Throw - Let's Start|accessdate=2006-11-26|author=Mark Ruzzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste. [[Toxics use reduction]] is a more controversial approach to source reduction that targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have been set up by legislation in some states, e.g., [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Oregon]]. The 3 R's represent the 'Waste Hierarchy' which lists the best ways of managing waste from the most to the least desirable. Many of the things we currently throw away could be reused again with just a little thought and imagination.
