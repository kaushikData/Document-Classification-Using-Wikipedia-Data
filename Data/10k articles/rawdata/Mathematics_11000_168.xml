==Description==
[[File:Shannon communication system.svg|thumb|right|343px|Shannon's diagram of a general [[communications system]], which shows the process that produces a message.]]
The article was the founding work of the field of [[information theory]]. It was later published in 1949 as a book titled ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'' ({{ISBN|0-252-72546-8}}), which was published as a [[paperback]] in 1963 ({{ISBN|0-252-72548-4}}). The book contains an additional article by [[Warren Weaver]], providing an overview of the theory for a more general audience. Shannon's article laid out the basic elements of communication:

*An information source that produces a message
*A transmitter that operates on the message to create a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] which can be sent through a channel
*A channel, which is the medium over which the signal, carrying the information that composes the message, is sent
*A receiver, which transforms the signal back into the message intended for delivery
*A destination, which can be a person or a machine, for whom or which the message is intended

It also developed the concepts of [[information entropy]] and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]], and introduced the term [[bit]] (which Shannon credited to [[John Tukey]]) as a unit of information. It was also in this paper that the [[Shannon–Fano coding]] technique was proposed - a technique developed in conjunction with [[Robert Fano]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6972">In [[conformal geometry]], the '''ambient construction''' refers to a construction of [[Charles Fefferman]] and Robin Graham&lt;ref&gt;Fefferman, C. and Graham, R. "Conformal invariants", in ''Élie Cartan et les Mathématiques d'Aujourdui'', Asterisque (1985), 95-116.&lt;/ref&gt; for which a [[conformal manifold]] of dimension ''n'' is realized (''ambiently'') as the boundary of a certain [[hyperbolic manifold|Poincaré manifold]], or alternatively as the [[celestial sphere]] of a certain [[pseudo-Riemannian]] manifold.

The ambient construction is canonical in the sense that it is performed only using the [[conformal class]] of the metric: it is conformally invariant.  However, the construction only works [[asymptotic]]ally, up to a certain [[order of approximation]].  There is, in general, an [[Obstruction theory|obstruction]] to continuing this extension past the critical order.  The obstruction itself is of tensorial character, and is known as the (conformal) '''obstruction tensor'''.  It is, along with the [[Weyl tensor]], one of the two primitive invariants in conformal differential geometry.

Aside from the obstruction tensor, the ambient construction can be used to define a class of conformally invariant [[differential operator]]s known as the [[GJMS operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R., Jenne, R., Mason, L.J., and Sparling, G.A.J. "Conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian I: Existence", ''Jour. Lond. Math. Soc'', '''46''' (1992), 557-565.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related construction is the [[tractor bundle]].

==Overview==
The model flat geometry for the ambient construction is the future [[null cone]] in [[Minkowski space]], with the origin deleted.  The celestial sphere at infinity is the conformal manifold ''M'', and the null rays in the cone determine a [[line bundle]] over ''M''.  Moreover, the null cone carries a metric which degenerates in the direction of the generators of the cone.

The ambient construction in this flat model space then asks: if one is provided with such a line bundle, along with its degenerate metric, to what extent is it possible to ''extend'' the metric off the null cone in a canonical way, thus recovering the ambient Minkowski space?  In formal terms, the degenerate metric supplies a [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] for the extension problem and, as it happens, the natural condition is for the extended metric to be [[Ricci flat]] (because of the normalization of the [[normal conformal connection]].)

The ambient construction generalizes this to the case when ''M'' is conformally curved, first by constructing a natural null line bundle ''N'' with a degenerate metric, and then solving the associated Dirichlet problem on ''N'' &amp;times; (-1,1).

==Details==
This section provides an overview of the construction, first of the null line bundle, and then of its ambient extension.

===The null line bundle===
Suppose that ''M'' is a conformal manifold, and that [''g''] denotes the conformal metric defined on ''M''.  Let &amp;pi; : ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' denote the tautological subbundle of T&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' &amp;otimes; T&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' defined by all representatives of the conformal metric.  In terms of a fixed background metric ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N'' consists of all positive multiples &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the metric.  There is a natural action of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on ''N'', given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_\omega g = \omega^2 g&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[total space]] of ''N'' carries a tautological degenerate metric, for if ''p'' is a point of the fibre of &amp;pi; : ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' corresponding to the conformal representative ''g''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, then let
:&lt;math&gt;h_p(X_p,Y_p) = g_p(\pi_*X,\pi_*Y).&lt;/math&gt;
This metric degenerates along the vertical directions.  Furthermore, it is homogeneous of degree 2 under the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; action on ''N'':
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^*_\omega h = \omega^2 h&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''X'' be the vertical vector field generating the scaling action.  Then the following properties are immediate:
:''h''(''X'',-) = 0
:'''L'''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;h = 2''h'', where '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] along the vector field ''X''.

===The ambient space===
Let ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; = ''N'' &amp;times; (-1,1), with the natural inclusion ''i'' : ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dilations &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; extend naturally to ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;, and hence so does the generator ''X'' of dilation.

An '''ambient metric''' on ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; is a Lorentzian metric ''h''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; such that
* The metric is ''homogeneous'': &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;
* The metric is an ''ambient extension'':  ''i''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h'', where ''i''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along the natural inclusion.
* The metric is ''[[Ricci flat]]'': Ric(''h''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;) = 0.

Suppose that a fixed representative of the conformal metric ''g'' and a local coordinate system ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;) are chosen on ''M''.  These induce coordinates on ''N'' by identifying a point in the fibre of ''N'' with (''x'',''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''g''(''x'')) where ''t'' &gt; 0 is the fibre coordinate.  (In these coordinates, ''X'' = ''t'' ∂&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;.)  Finally, if &amp;rho; is a defining function of ''N'' in ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; which is homogeneous of degree 0 under dilations, then (''x'',''t'',&amp;rho;) are coordinates of ''N''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;.  Furthermore, any extension metric which is homogeneous of degree 2 can be written in these coordinates in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;h^\sim = t^2 g_{ij}(x,\rho)dx^idx^j+2\rho dt^2+2tdtd\rho,\, &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; are ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions with ''g''(''x'',0) = ''g''(''x''), the given conformal representative.

After some calculation&lt;!--C.F. tells me this was published recently by Graham and Hirachi.  Find the citation!--&gt; one shows that the Ricci flatness is equivalent to the following differential equation, where the prime is differentiation with respect to &amp;rho;:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho g_{ij}''-\rho g^{kl}g_{ik}'g_{jl}+\tfrac12\rho g^{kl}g_{kl}'g_{ij}'+\frac{2-n}{2}g_{ij}'-\tfrac12 g^{kl}g_{kl}'g_{ij}+\mathrm{Ric}(g)_{ij}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
One may then formally solve this equation as a power series in &amp;rho; to obtain the asymptotic development of the ambient metric off the null cone.  For example, substituting &amp;rho; = 0 and solving gives
:''g''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'',0) = 2''P''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;
where ''P'' is the [[Schouten tensor]].  Next, differentiating again and substituting the known value of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'',0) into the equation, the second derivative can be found to be a multiple of the [[Bach tensor]].  And so forth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21197">The '''Arzelà–Ascoli theorem''' is a fundamental result of [[mathematical analysis]] giving [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] to decide whether every sequence of a given family of [[real number|real]]-valued [[continuous function]]s defined on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] has a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] [[subsequence]].  The main condition is the [[equicontinuity]] of the family of functions. The theorem is the basis of many proofs in mathematics, including that of the [[Peano existence theorem]] in the theory of [[ordinary differential equations]], [[Montel's theorem]] in [[complex analysis]], and the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]] in [[harmonic analysis]].

The notion of equicontinuity was introduced in the late 19th century by the Italian mathematicians [[Cesare Arzelà]] and [[Giulio Ascoli]]. A weak form of the theorem was proven by {{harvtxt|Ascoli|1883–1884}}, who established the sufficient condition for compactness, and by {{harvtxt|Arzelà|1895}}, who established the necessary condition and gave the first clear presentation of the result.  A further generalization of the theorem was proven by {{harvtxt|Fréchet|1906}}, to sets of real-valued continuous functions with domain a [[compact set|compact]] [[metric space]] {{harv|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|p=382}}.  Modern formulations of the theorem allow for the domain to be compact [[hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and for the range to be an arbitrary metric space.  More general formulations of the theorem exist that give necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of functions from a [[Compactly generated space|compactly generated]] Hausdorff space into a [[uniform space]] to be compact in the [[compact-open topology]]. {{harvtxt|Kelley|1991|loc=page 234}}.

== Statement and first consequences ==
By definition, a sequence {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of [[continuous function]]s on an interval {{math|''I'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b'']}} is ''uniformly bounded'' if there is a number {{math|''M''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|f_n(x)\right| \le M&lt;/math&gt;

for every function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}} belonging to the sequence, and every {{math|''x'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']}}.  (Here, {{math|''M''}}  must be independent of {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''x''}}.) 

The sequence is said to be ''equicontinuous'' if, for every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} and {{math|''x''}}, there exists a {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|f_n(x)-f_n(y)\right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

whenever {{math|{{!}}''x'' − ''y''{{!}} &lt; ''δ''&amp;thinsp;}} for all functions {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}} in the sequence. (Here, {{math|''δ''}} may depend on {{math|''ε''}} and {{math|''x''}}, but not on {{math|''y''}} or {{math|''n''}}.)

One version of the theorem can be stated as follows:

:Consider a [[sequence]] of real-valued continuous functions {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defined on a closed and bounded [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the [[real line]]. If this sequence is [[uniformly bounded]] and [[equicontinuous]], then there exists a [[subsequence]] {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}&lt;sub&gt;''k'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]]. 
:The converse is also true, in the sense that if every subsequence of {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;} }}itself has a uniformly convergent subsequence, then {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;} }}is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. 

(See [[#Proof|below]] for a proof.)

===Examples===

====Differentiable functions====
The hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied by a uniformly bounded sequence {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;} }}of [[derivative|differentiable]] functions with uniformly bounded derivatives. Indeed, uniform boundedness of the derivatives implies by the [[mean value theorem]] that for all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}},

:&lt;math&gt;\left|f_n(x) - f_n(y)\right| \le K |x-y|,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is the [[supremum]] of the derivatives of functions in the sequence and is independent of {{mvar|n}}.  So, given {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, let {{math|''δ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ε''|2''K''}}}} to verify the definition of equicontinuity of the sequence.  This proves the following corollary:

* Let {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued differentiable functions on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that the derivatives {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;prime;} are uniformly bounded. Then there exists a subsequence {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''} that converges uniformly on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.

If, in addition, the sequence of second derivatives is also uniformly bounded, then the derivatives also converge uniformly (up to a subsequence), and so on. Another generalization holds for [[continuously differentiable function]]s.  Suppose that the functions {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}} are continuously differentiable with derivatives {{math|''f′&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Suppose that ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;prime; are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, and that the sequence {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;},}} is pointwise bounded (or just bounded at a single point).  Then there is a subsequence of the {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;} }}converging uniformly to a continuously differentiable function.

The diagonalization argument can also be used to show that a family of infinitely differentiable functions, whose derivatives of each order are uniformly bounded, has a uniformly convergent subsequence, all of whose derivative are also uniformly convergent. This is important particularly in the theory of distributions.

====Lipschitz and Hölder continuous functions====
The argument given above proves slightly more, specifically

* If {{math|{&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;} }}is a uniformly bounded sequence of real valued functions on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that each ''f'' is [[Lipschitz continuous]] with the same Lipschitz constant {{mvar|K}}:

::&lt;math&gt;\left|f_n(x) - f_n(y)\right| \le K|x-y|&lt;/math&gt;

:for all {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']}} and all {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}}, then there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.

The limit function is also Lipschitz continuous with the same value {{mvar|K}} for the Lipschitz constant. A slight refinement is

* A set {{math|'''F'''}} of functions {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} that is uniformly bounded and satisfies a [[Hölder condition]] of order {{mvar|α}}, {{math|0 &lt; ''α'' ≤ 1}}, with a fixed constant {{mvar|M}},

::&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x) - f(y)\right| \le M \, |x - y|^\alpha, \qquad x, y \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt;

:is relatively compact in {{math|C([''a'', ''b''])}}.  In particular, the unit ball of the [[Hölder condition|Hölder space]] {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;0,''α''&lt;/sup&gt;([''a'', ''b''])}} is compact in {{math|C([''a'', ''b''])}}.

This holds more generally for scalar functions on a compact metric space {{mvar|X}} satisfying a Hölder condition with respect to the metric on {{mvar|X}}.

====Euclidean spaces====
The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem holds, more generally, if the functions {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}} take values in {{mvar|d}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the proof is very simple: just apply the {{math|'''R'''}}-valued version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem {{mvar|d}} times to extract a subsequence that converges uniformly in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence that converges uniformly in the first two coordinates, and so on.  The above examples generalize easily to the case of functions with values in Euclidean space.

== Proof ==
The proof is essentially based on a [[diagonalization argument]].  The simplest case is of real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval:

* Let {{math|''I'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b''] ⊂ '''R'''}} be a closed and bounded interval.  If '''F''' is an infinite set of functions {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; : ''I'' → '''R'''}} which is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, then there is a sequence ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of elements of '''F''' such that ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges uniformly on ''I''.

Fix an enumeration {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[rational numbers]] in ''I''.  Since '''F''' is uniformly bounded, the set of points {''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;''f''∈'''F'''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded, and hence by the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], there is a sequence {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;} of distinct functions in '''F''' such that {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)} converges.  Repeating the same argument for the sequence of points {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}, there is a subsequence {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;} of {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;} such that {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)} converges.

By induction this process can be continued forever, and so there is a chain of subsequences

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{f_{n_1} \right \} \supseteq \left \{f_{n_2} \right \} \supseteq \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

such that, for each ''k'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., the subsequence {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Now form the diagonal subsequence {''f&lt;sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;} whose ''m''th term ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''m''th term in the ''m''th subsequence {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''}. By construction, ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges at every [[rational point]] of ''I''.

Therefore, given any {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} and rational ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''I'', there is an integer {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''N''(''ε'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;|f_n(x_k) - f_m(x_k)| &lt; \tfrac{\varepsilon}{3}, \qquad n, m \ge N.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the family '''F''' is equicontinuous, for this fixed ''ε'' and for every ''x'' in ''I'', there is an open interval ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;|f(s)-f(t)| &lt; \tfrac{\varepsilon}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''F''' and all ''s'',&amp;nbsp;''t'' in ''I'' such that {{math|''s'', ''t'' ∈ ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The collection of intervals ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I'',  forms an [[open cover]] of ''I''.  Since ''I''&amp;thinsp; is [[compact set|compact]], this covering admits a finite subcover {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''U&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  There exists an integer ''K'' such that each open interval ''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', {{math|1 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''J''}}, contains a rational ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' with {{math|1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''K''}}.  Finally, for any ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'', there are ''j'' and ''k'' so that ''t'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' belong to the same interval ''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.  For this choice of ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left |f_n(t)-f_m(t) \right| &amp;\le \left|f_n(t) - f_n(x_k) \right| + |f_n(x_k) - f_m(x_k)| + |f_m(x_k) - f_m(t)| \\
&amp;&lt; \tfrac{\varepsilon}{3} + \tfrac{\varepsilon}{3} + \tfrac{\varepsilon}{3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''n'', ''m'' &gt; ''N'' {{=}} max{''N''(''ε'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''N''(''ε'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;)}.}}  Consequently, the sequence {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is [[uniformly Cauchy]], and therefore converges to a continuous function, as claimed.  This completes the proof.

==Generalizations==

=== Compact metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces ===
The definitions of boundedness and equicontinuity can be generalized to the setting of arbitrary compact [[metric space]]s and, more generally still, [[compact set|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s.  Let ''X'' be a compact Hausdorff space, and let ''C''(''X'') be the space of real-valued [[continuous function]]s on ''X''. A subset {{math|'''F''' ⊂ ''C''(''X'')}} is said to be ''equicontinuous'' if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''X'' and every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, ''x'' has a neighborhood ''U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in U_x, \forall f \in \mathbf{F} : \qquad |f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

A set {{math|'''F''' ⊂ ''C''(''X'', '''R''')}} is said to be ''pointwise bounded'' if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''X'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ | f(x) | : f \in \mathbf{F} \} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

A version of the Theorem holds also in the space ''C''(''X'') of real-valued continuous functions on a [[compact set|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] ''X'' {{harv|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|loc=§IV.6.7}}:

:Let ''X'' be a compact Hausdorff space. Then a subset '''F''' of ''C''(''X'') is [[relatively compact]] in the topology induced by the [[uniform norm]] if and only if it is [[equicontinuous]] and pointwise bounded.

The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is thus a fundamental result in the study of the algebra of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space]].

Various generalizations of the above quoted result are possible.  For instance, the functions can assume values in a metric space or (Hausdorff) [[topological vector space]] with only minimal changes to the statement (see, for instance, {{harvtxt|Kelley|Namioka|1982|loc=§8}}, {{harvtxt|Kelley|1991|loc=Chapter 7}}):

:Let ''X'' be a compact Hausdorff space and ''Y'' a metric space. Then {{math|'''F''' ⊂ ''C''(''X'', ''Y'')}} is compact in the [[compact-open topology]] if and only if it is [[equicontinuous]], pointwise [[relatively compact]] and closed.

Here pointwise relatively compact means that for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', the set {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x'') : &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ '''F'''} }}is relatively compact in ''Y''.

The proof given can be generalized in a way that does not rely on the [[separable metric space|separability]] of the domain.  On a [[compact Hausdorff space]] ''X'', for instance, the equicontinuity is used to extract, for each ε&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', a finite open covering of ''X'' such that the [[oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] of any function in the family is less than ε on each open set in the cover.  The role of the rationals can then be played by a set of points drawn from each open set in each of the countably many covers obtained in this way, and the main part of the proof proceeds exactly as above.

==Necessity==
Whereas most formulations of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem assert sufficient conditions for a family of functions to be (relatively) compact in some topology, these conditions are typically also necessary.  For instance, if a set '''F''' is compact in ''C''(''X''), the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with respect to its uniform norm, then it is bounded in the uniform norm on ''C''(''X'') and in particular is pointwise bounded. Let ''N''(''ε'', ''U'') be the set of all functions in '''F''' whose [[oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] over an open subset ''U'' ⊂ ''X'' is less than ''ε'':

:&lt;math&gt;N(\varepsilon, U) = \{f | \operatorname{osc}_U f &lt; \varepsilon\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed ''x''&amp;isin;''X'' and ''ε'', the sets ''N''(''ε'', ''U'') form an open covering of '''F''' as ''U'' varies over all open neighborhoods of ''x''.  Choosing a finite subcover then gives equicontinuity.

== Examples ==
* To every function {{mvar|g}} that is [[Lp space#Lp spaces|{{mvar|p}}-integrable]] on {{math|[0, 1]}}, with {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' ≤ ∞}}, associate the function {{mvar|G}} defined on {{math|[0, 1]}} by

::&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_0^x g(t) \, \mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

:Let {{math|'''F'''}} be the set of functions {{mvar|G}} corresponding to functions {{mvar|g}} in the unit ball of the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''([0, 1])}}]]. If {{mvar|q}} is the Hölder conjugate of {{mvar|p}}, defined by {{math|{{sfrac|1|''p''}} + {{sfrac|1|''q''}} {{=}} 1}}, then [[Hölder inequality|Hölder's inequality]] implies that all functions in {{math|'''F'''}} satisfy a Hölder condition with {{math|''α'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''q''}}}} and constant {{math|''M'' {{=}} 1}}.

:It follows that {{math|'''F'''}} is compact in {{math|''C''([0, 1])}}. This means that the correspondence {{math|''g'' → ''G''}} defines a [[Compact operator|compact]] [[Linear map|linear operator]] {{mvar|T}} between the [[Banach space]]s {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''([0, 1])}} and {{math|''C''([0, 1])}}.  Composing with the injection of {{math|''C''([0, 1])}} into {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''([0, 1])}}, one sees that {{mvar|T}} acts compactly from {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''([0, 1])}} to itself.  The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} can be seen as a simple instance of the fact that the injection from the [[Sobolev space]] &lt;math&gt;H^1_0(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; into {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, for {{math|Ω}} a bounded open set in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is compact.

*When {{mvar|T}} is a compact linear operator from a Banach space {{mvar|X}} to a Banach space {{mvar|Y}}, its [[Dual space#Transpose of a continuous linear map|transpose]] {{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is compact from the (continuous) [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|dual]] {{math|''Y&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}} to {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. This can be checked by the Arzelà&amp;ndash;Ascoli theorem.

:Indeed, the image {{math|''T''(''B'')}} of the closed unit ball {{mvar|B}} of {{mvar|X}} is contained in a compact subset {{mvar|K}} of {{mvar|Y}}. The unit ball {{math|''B&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}} of {{math|''Y&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}} defines, by restricting from {{mvar|Y}} to {{mvar|K}}, a set {{math|'''F'''}} of (linear) continuous functions on {{mvar|K}} that is bounded and equicontinuous. By Arzelà&amp;ndash;Ascoli, for every sequence {{math|{''y''{{su|p=∗|b=''n''}}},}} in {{math|''B&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on {{mvar|K}}, and this implies that the image &lt;math&gt;T^*(y^*_{n_k})&lt;/math&gt; of that subsequence is Cauchy in {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.

*When {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in an open disk {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r'')}}, with modulus bounded by {{mvar|M}}, then (for example by [[Cauchy's integral formula|Cauchy's formula]]) its derivative {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;′}} has modulus bounded by {{math|{{sfrac|2''M''|''r''}}}} in the smaller disk {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, {{sfrac|''r''|2}}).}} If a family of holomorphic functions on {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is bounded by {{mvar|M}} on {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, it follows that the family {{math|'''F'''}} of restrictions to {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equicontinuous on {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Therefore, a sequence converging uniformly on {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be extracted.  This is a first step in the direction of  [[Montel's theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11123">In mathematics, the '''Banach–Caccioppoli [[fixed-point theorem]]''' (also known as the '''contraction mapping theorem''' or '''contraction mapping principle''') is an important tool in the theory of [[metric space]]s; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of certain self-maps of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points.  The theorem is named after [[Stefan Banach]] (1892–1945) and [[Renato Caccioppoli]] (1904–1959), and was first stated by Banach in 1922. Caccioppoli independently proved the theorem in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emis.de/journals/BJMA/tex_v1_n1_a1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
''Definition.'' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. Then a map &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[contraction mapping]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;q\in [0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(T(x),T(y)) \le q d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Banach Fixed Point Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty [[complete metric space]] with a contraction mapping &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''T'' admits a unique [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] ''x*'' in ''X'' (i.e. ''T''(''x*'') = ''x*''). Furthermore, ''x*'' can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;), then {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''x*''}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Remark 1.'' The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the [[Rate of convergence|speed of convergence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
d(x^*, x_n) &amp; \leq \frac{q^n}{1-q} d(x_1,x_0), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq \frac{q}{1-q} d(x_{n+1},x_n), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq q d(x^*,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Any such value of ''q'' is called a ''[[Lipschitz constant]]'' for ''T'', and the smallest one is sometimes called "the best Lipschitz constant" of ''T''.

''Remark 2.'' ''d''(''T''(''x''),&amp;nbsp;''T''(''y''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') for all ''x'' ≠ ''y'' is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map ''T'' : [1, ∞) → [1, ∞), ''T''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''x'', which lacks a fixed point. However, if ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''T''(''x'')), indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of ''T''. It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of ''T''.

''Remark 3.'' When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define ''X'' properly so that ''T''(''X'') ⊆ ''X''.

==Proof==

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X'' be arbitrary and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by setting ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first note that for all ''n'' ∈ '''N''', we have the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \le q^n d(x_1, x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

This follows by [[principle of mathematical induction|induction]] on ''n'', using the fact that ''T'' is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. In particular, let ''m'', ''n'' ∈ '''N''' such that ''m'' &gt; ''n'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d(x_m, x_n) &amp; \leq d(x_m, x_{m-1}) + d(x_{m-1}, x_{m-2}) + \cdots + d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \\
&amp; \leq q^{m-1}d(x_1, x_0) + q^{m-2}d(x_1, x_0) + \cdots + q^nd(x_1, x_0) \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} q^k \\
&amp; \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^\infty q^k \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ε &gt; 0 be arbitrary, since ''q'' ∈ [0, 1), we can find a large ''N'' ∈ '''N''' so that

:&lt;math&gt;q^N &lt; \frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, by choosing ''m'' and ''n'' greater than ''N'' we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_m, x_n)  \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) &lt; \left (\frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)} \right ) d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) = \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that the sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is Cauchy. By completeness of (''X'',''d''), the sequence has a limit ''x*'' ∈ ''X''. Furthermore, ''x*'' must be a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt; x^*=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} T(x_{n-1}) = T\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{n-1} \right) = T(x^*). &lt;/math&gt;

As a contraction mapping, ''T'' is continuous, so bringing the limit inside ''T'' was justified. Lastly, ''T'' cannot have more than one fixed point in (''X'',''d''), since any pair of distinct fixed points ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' would contradict the contraction of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(T(p_1),T(p_2)) = d(p_1,p_2) &gt; q d(p_1, p_2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
*A standard application is the proof of the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain [[ordinary differential equation]]s. The sought solution of the differential equation is expressed as a fixed point of a suitable integral operator which transforms continuous functions into continuous functions. The Banach fixed-point theorem is then used to show that this integral operator has a unique fixed point.
*One consequence of the Banach fixed-point theorem is that small Lipschitz perturbations of the identity are [[Lipschitz continuity#Definitions|bi-lipschitz]] homeomorphisms. Let Ω be an open set of a Banach space ''E''; let ''I'' : Ω → ''E'' denote the identity (inclusion) map and let ''g'' : Ω → ''E'' be a Lipschitz map of constant ''k'' &lt; 1. Then 
#Ω′ := (''I''+''g'')(Ω) is an open subset of ''E'': precisely, for any ''x'' in Ω such that ''B''(''x'', ''r'') ⊂ Ω one has ''B''((''I''+''g'')(''x''), ''r''(1−''k'')) ⊂ Ω′; 
#''I''+''g'' : Ω → Ω′ is a bi-lipschitz homeomorphism; 
:precisely, (''I''+''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is still of the form ''I'' + ''h'' : Ω → Ω′ with ''h'' a Lipschitz map of constant ''k''/(1−''k''). A direct consequence  of this result yields the proof of the [[inverse function theorem]].
*It can be used to give sufficient conditions under which Newton's method of successive approximations is guaranteed to work, and similarly for Chebyshev's third order method
*It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to integral equations

==Converses==
Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to [[Czesław Bessaga]], from 1959:

Let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map of an abstract [[set (mathematics)|set]] such that each [[iterated function|iterate]] ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a unique fixed point. Let ''q'' ∈ (0, 1), then there exists a complete metric on ''X'' such that ''f'' is contractive, and ''q'' is the contraction constant.

Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' is a map on a [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topological space]] with a unique [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] ''a'', such that for each ''x'' in ''X'' we have ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'') → ''a'', then there already exists a metric on ''X'' with respect to which ''f'' satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Seda |title=A ‘Converse’ of the Banach Contraction Mapping Theorem |journal=Journal of Electrical Engineering |volume=52 |issue=10/s |year=2001 |pages=3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the metric is in fact an [[ultrametric]].

==Generalizations==
There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries).&lt;ref name=Latif2014&gt;{{cite book |first=Abdul |last=Latif |title=Topics in Fixed Point Theory |chapter=Banach Contraction Principle and its Generalizations |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01586-6_2 |publisher=Springer |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''T'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are:
*Assume that some iterate ''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''T'' is a contraction. Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
*Assume that for each ''n'', there exist ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''d(T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(x), T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(y)) ≤ c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;d(x, y)'' for all ''x'' and ''y'', and that
::&lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_n c_n &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
In applications, the existence and unicity of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map ''T'' a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on [[fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for generalizations.

A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of [[metric space]], e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony |last2=Seda |title=Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics |location= |publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony K. |last=Seda |first2=Pascal |last2=Hitzler |title=Generalized Distance Functions in the Theory of Computation |journal=The Computer Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=443–464 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/bxm108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2741">In [[time series analysis]], '''Bartlett's method''' (also known as the '''method of averaged periodograms'''&lt;ref name="Engelberg"/&gt;), is used for estimating [[power spectrum|power spectra]]. It provides a way to reduce the variance of the [[periodogram]] in exchange for a reduction of resolution, compared to standard [[periodogram]]s.&lt;ref name="Bartlett1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett2"/&gt; A final estimate of the spectrum at a given frequency is obtained by averaging the estimates from the periodograms (at the same frequency) derived from a non-overlapping portions of the original series.

The method is used in [[physics]], [[engineering]], and applied [[mathematics]]. Common applications of Bartlett's method are frequency response measurements and general spectrum analysis.

The method is named after [[M S Bartlett|M. S. Bartlett]] who first proposed it.&lt;ref name="Bartlett1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett2"/&gt;

==Definition and procedure==
Bartlett’s method consists of the following steps:
# The original N point data segment is split up into K (non-overlapping) data segments, each of length M
# For each segment, compute the [[periodogram]] by computing the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT version which does not divide by M), then computing the squared magnitude of the result and dividing this by M.
# Average the result of the [[periodogram]]s above for the K data segments.
## The averaging reduces the variance, compared to the original N point data segment.

The end result is an array of power measurements vs. frequency "bin".

==Related methods==
*The [[Welch method]]: this is a method that uses a modified version of Bartlett’s method in which the portions of the series contributing to each periodogram are allowed to overlap.
*Periodogram smoothing.

'''Bootstrap aggregating''', also called '''bagging''', is a [[Ensemble learning|machine learning ensemble]] [[meta-algorithm]] designed to improve the stability and accuracy of [[machine learning]] algorithms used in [[statistical classification]] and [[Regression analysis|regression]]. It also reduces [[variance]] and helps to avoid [[overfitting]]. Although it is usually applied to [[Decision tree learning|decision tree]] methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the [[Ensemble learning|model averaging]] approach.

==Description of the technique==
Given a standard [[training set]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of size ''n'', bagging generates ''m'' new training sets &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;, each of size ''n′'', by [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] from ''D'' [[Probability distribution#With finite support|uniformly]] and [[Sampling (statistics)#Replacement of selected units|with replacement]]. By sampling with replacement, some observations may be repeated in each &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;. If ''n[[prime (symbol)|′]]''=''n'', then for large ''n'' the set &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is expected to have the fraction (1 - 1/''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'') (≈63.2%) of the unique examples of ''D'', the rest being duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Javed A.; Popa, Raluca A.; and Rivest, Ronald L. (2007); [http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/APR07.pdf ''On Estimating the Size and Confidence of a Statistical Audit''], Proceedings of the Electronic Voting Technology Workshop (EVT '07), Boston, MA, August 6, 2007. More generally, when drawing with replacement ''n′'' values out of a set of ''n'' (different and equally likely), the expected number of unique draws is &lt;math&gt;n(1 - e^{-n'/n})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of sample is known as a [[bootstrap (statistics)|bootstrap]] sample. The ''m'' models are fitted using the above ''m'' bootstrap samples and combined by averaging the output (for regression) or voting (for classification).

Bagging leads to "improvements for unstable procedures" (Breiman, 1996), which include, for example, [[artificial neural networks]], [[classification and regression tree]]s, and subset selection in [[linear regression]] (Breiman, 1994). An interesting application of bagging showing improvement in preimage learning is provided here.&lt;ref&gt;Sahu, A., Runger, G., Apley, D., Image denoising with a multi-phase kernel principal component approach and an ensemble version, IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop, pp.1-7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shinde, Amit, Anshuman Sahu, Daniel Apley, and George Runger. "Preimages for Variation Patterns from Kernel PCA and Bagging." IIE Transactions, Vol.46, Iss.5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it can mildly degrade the performance of stable methods such as K-nearest neighbors (Breiman, 1996).

== Example: Ozone data ==
To illustrate the basic principles of bagging, below is an analysis on the relationship between [[ozone]] and temperature (data from [[Peter Rousseeuw|Rousseeuw]] and Leroy (1986), analysis done in [[R (programming language)|R]]).

The relationship between temperature and ozone in this data set is apparently non-linear, based on the scatter plot. To mathematically describe this relationship, [[local regression|LOESS]] smoothers (with bandwidth 0.5) are used. 
Instead of building a single smoother from the complete data set, 100 [[bootstrap (statistics)|bootstrap]] samples of the data were drawn. Each sample is different from the original data set, yet resembles it in distribution and variability. For each bootstrap sample, a LOESS smoother was fit. Predictions from these 100 smoothers were then made across the range of the data. The first 10 predicted smooth fits appear as grey lines in the figure below. The lines are clearly very ''wiggly'' and they overfit the data - a result of the bandwidth being too small.

By taking the average of 100 smoothers, each fitted to a subset of the original data set, we arrive at one bagged predictor (red line). Clearly, the mean is more stable and there is less [[overfitting|overfit]].

== History ==

Bagging ('''B'''ootstrap '''agg'''regat'''ing''') was proposed by [[Leo Breiman]] in 1994 to improve classification by combining classifications of randomly generated training sets. See Breiman, 1994. Technical Report No. 421.

In [[statistics]], '''bucket evaluations''' is a method for [[Correlation and dependence|correlating vectors]]. This method is a [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]], [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] correlation method first published in 2012 by [[Daniel Shabtai|Shabtai]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shabtai|first=Daniel|author2=Guri Giaever|author3=Corey Nislow|title=An algorithm for chemical genomic profiling that minimizes batch effects: Bucket evaluations|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=25 September 2012|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-245|pmid=23009392|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/245/abstract|volume=13|pages=245|pmc=3780717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bucket evaluations was initially constructed for genetic research, and was used for finding a new potential anti-cancer drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheung-Ong|first=Kahlin |author2=Kyung Tae Song |author3=Zhidong Ma |author4=Daniel Shabtai |author5=Anna Y.

Bucket evaluations is named after the technique used to compare vectors in a matrix. Values in the [[Random vector|vector]] are compared in sections (buckets). The buckets are set in a descending order, where the smallest buckets hold the highest scores, and have the strongest effect on the final correlation score. The similarity between vectors is calculated by comparing the ranks of the scores in each bucket, which are summed up to a similarity score.

In [[mathematics]] and [[game theory]], '''Bulgarian solitaire''' is a [[playing card|card]] game that was introduced by [[Martin Gardner]].

In the game, a pack of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; cards is divided into several piles. Then for each pile, remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored).

If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[triangular number]] (that is, &lt;math&gt;N=1+2+\cdots+k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;), then it is known that Bulgarian solitaire will reach a stable configuration in which the sizes of the piles are &lt;math&gt;1,2,\ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;.  This state is reached in &lt;math&gt;k^2-k&lt;/math&gt; moves or fewer.  If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is not triangular, no stable configuration exists and a [[limit cycle]] is reached.

==Random Bulgarian solitaire==
In ''random Bulgarian solitaire'' or ''stochastic Bulgarian solitaire'' a pack of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; cards is divided into several piles.  Then for each pile, either leave it intact or, with a fixed [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored). This is a [[finite set|finite]] irreducible [[Markov chain]].

In 2004, [[Brazil]]ian [[probability|probabilist]] of [[Russia]]n origin [[Serguei Popov]] showed that stochastic Bulgarian solitaire spends "most" of its time in a "roughly" [[triangular distribution]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''Cantor function''' is an example of a  [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is [[continuous function|continuous]], but not [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. It is also referred to as the '''Cantor ternary function''', the '''Lebesgue function''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vestrup|2003|loc=Section 4.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lebesgue's singular function''', the '''Cantor-Vitali function''', the '''Devil's staircase''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|Bruckner|Bruckner|2008|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Cantor staircase function''',&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorStaircaseFunction.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Cantor-Lebesgue function'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bass|2013|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvs|txt|first=Georg |last=Cantor|authorlink=Georg Cantor|year=1884}} introduced the Cantor function and mentioned that Scheeffer pointed out that it was a [[counterexample]] to an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus claimed by [[Carl Gustav Axel Harnack|Harnack]]. The Cantor function was discussed and popularized by {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}}, {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}} and {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}}.

==Definition==
[[File:Cantor function.gif|300px|right]]

See figure. To formally define the Cantor function ''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1], let ''x'' be in [0,1] and obtain ''c''(''x'') by the following steps:

#Express ''x'' in base 3.  
#If ''x'' contains a 1, replace every digit strictly after the first 1 by 0.
#Replace any remaining 2s with 1s.
#Interpret the result as a binary number. The result is ''c''(''x'').

For example:
* 1/4 is 0.02020202... in base 3. There are no 1s so the next stage is still 0.02020202... This is rewritten as 0.01010101... When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/3, so ''c''(1/4) = 1/3.
* 1/5 is 0.01210121... in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.01000000... This is not rewritten since there are no 2s. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/4, so ''c''(1/5) = 1/4.
* 200/243 is 0.21102 (or 0.211012222...) in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.21. This is rewritten as 0.11. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 3/4, so ''c''(200/243) = 3/4.

==Properties==
The Cantor function challenges naive intuitions about [[continuous function|continuity]] and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]; though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c(x)&lt;/math&gt; goes from 0 to 1 as &lt;math display="inline&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; goes from 0 to 1, and takes on every value in between.  The Cantor function is the most frequently cited example of a real function that is [[uniformly continuous]] (precisely, it is [[Hölder continuous]] of  exponent  ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;2/log&amp;nbsp;3) but not [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. It is constant on intervals of the form (0.''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;022222..., 0.''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;200000...), and every point not in the Cantor set is in one of these intervals, so its derivative is 0 outside of the Cantor set. On the other hand, it has no [[derivative]] at any point in an [[uncountable]] subset of the [[Cantor set]] containing the interval endpoints described above.

The Cantor function can also be seen as the [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability distribution function]] of the 1/2-1/2 [[Bernoulli scheme|Bernoulli measure]] μ supported on the Cantor set: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c(x)=\mu([0,x])&lt;/math&gt;. This probability distribution, called the [[Cantor distribution]], has no discrete part. That is, the corresponding measure is [[Atom (measure theory)|atomless]]. This is why there are no jump discontinuities in the function; any such jump would correspond to an atom in the measure.

However, no non-constant part of the Cantor function can be represented as an integral of a [[probability density function]]; integrating any putative [[probability density function]] that is not [[almost everywhere]] zero over any interval will give positive probability to some interval to which this distribution assigns probability zero. In particular, as {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}} pointed out, the function is not the integral of its derivative even though the derivative exists almost everywhere.

The Cantor function is the standard example of a [[singular function]].

The Cantor function is non-decreasing, and so in particular its graph defines a [[rectifiable curve]].  {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}} showed that the arc length of its graph is 2.

===Lack of absolute continuity===
Because the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the [[Uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] [[Cantor set]] is 0, for any positive ''ε'' and ''δ'', there exists a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals with total length &lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ'' over which the Cantor function cumulatively rises more than ''ε''. If a given sequence did not, all but an arbitrarily short portion of each sub-interval containing a point in the Cantor set could be discarded and a finite number equal-length sub-intervals containing different points in the Cantor set added, iteratively, until the cumulative rise was greater than ''ε''.

== Alternative definitions ==

=== Iterative construction ===
[[File:Cantor function sequence.png|250px|right]]

Below we define a sequence {''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} of functions on the unit interval that converges to the Cantor function.

Let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x''.

Then, for every integer {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;ge; 0}}, the next function ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') will be defined in terms of ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') as follows:

Let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|0.5 &amp;times; ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(3''x'')}},&amp;nbsp; when {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1/3&amp;thinsp;}};

Let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= 0.5,&amp;nbsp; when {{nowrap|1/3 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 2/3&amp;thinsp;}};

Let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|0.5 + 0.5  &amp;times; ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(3&amp;thinsp;''x'' &amp;minus; 2)}},&amp;nbsp; when {{nowrap|2/3 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}}.

The three definitions are compatible at the end-points 1/3 and 2/3, because ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;= 0 and ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)&amp;nbsp;= 1 for every&amp;nbsp;''n'', by induction.  One may check that ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges pointwise to the Cantor function defined above.  Furthermore, the convergence is uniform.  Indeed, separating into three cases, according to the definition of ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, one sees that

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x \in [0, 1]} |f_{n+1}(x) - f_n(x)| \le \frac 1 2 \, \max_{x \in [0, 1]} |f_{n}(x) - f_{n-1}(x)|, \quad n \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''&amp;fnof;'' denotes the limit function, it follows that, for every ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x \in [0, 1]} |f(x) - f_n(x)| \le 2^{-n+1} \, \max_{x \in [0, 1]} |f_1(x) - f_0(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

Also the choice of starting function does not really matter, provided ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;= 0, ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1)&amp;nbsp;= 1 and ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Bounded function|bounded]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

=== Fractal volume ===
The Cantor function is closely related to the [[Cantor set]]. The Cantor set ''C'' can be defined as the set of those numbers in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that do not contain the digit 1 in their [[base (exponentiation)|base-3 (triadic) expansion]], except if the 1 is followed by zeros only (in which case the tail 1000&lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by 0222&lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; to get rid of any 1). It turns out that the Cantor set is a [[fractal]] with (uncountably) infinitely many points (zero-dimensional volume), but zero length (one-dimensional volume).  Only the D-dimensional volume &lt;math&gt; H_D &lt;/math&gt; (in the sense of a [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-measure]]) takes a finite value, where &lt;math&gt; D = \log(2)/\log(3) &lt;/math&gt; is the fractal dimension of ''C''.  We may define the Cantor function alternatively as the D-dimensional volume of sections of the Cantor set

: &lt;math&gt;
f(x)=H_D(C \cap (0,x)). 
&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==
Let

: &lt;math&gt;y=\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k 2^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;

be the [[dyadic rational|dyadic]] (binary) expansion of the real number 0 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 1 in terms of binary digits ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {0,1}. Then consider the function

: &lt;math&gt;C_z(y)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k z^{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/3, the inverse of the function ''x'' = 2&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') is the Cantor function.  That is, ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''(''x'') is the Cantor function. In general, for any ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1/2, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') looks like the Cantor function turned on its side, with the width of the steps getting wider as ''z'' approaches zero.

As mentioned above, the Cantor function is also the cumulative distribution function of a measure on the Cantor set. Different Cantor functions, or Devil's Staircases, can be obtained by considering different atom-less probability measures supported on the Cantor set or other fractals. While the Cantor function has derivative 0 almost everywhere, current research focusses on the question of the size of the set of points where the upper right derivative is distinct from the lower right derivative, causing the derivative to not exist. This analysis of differentiability is usually given in terms of [[fractal dimension]], with the Hausdorff dimension the most popular choice. This line of research was started in the 90s by Darst,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Hausdorff Dimension of the Nondifferentiability Set of the Cantor Function is [ ln(2)/ln(3) ]2|jstor = 2159830|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1993-09-01|pages = 105–108|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2159830|first = Richard|last = Darst}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of non-differentiability of the Cantor function is the square of the dimension of the Cantor set, &lt;math&gt;(\log2/\log3)^2&lt;/math&gt;. More recently [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Falconer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = One-sided multifractal analysis and points of non-differentiability of devil's staircases|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0305004103006960|journal = Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 1469-8064|pages = 167–174|volume = 136|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0305004103006960|first = Kenneth J.|last = Falconer|bibcode = 2004MPCPS.136..167F}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that this squaring relationship holds for all Ahlfor's regular, singular measures, i.e.&lt;math display="block"&gt;\dim_{H}\left\{x : f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{\mu([x,x+h])}{h}\text{ does not exist}\right\}=\left(\dim_{H}\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;Later, Troscheit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hölder differentiability of self-conformal devil's staircases|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0305004113000698|journal = Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|date = 2014-03-01|issn = 1469-8064|pages = 295–311|volume = 156|issue = 02|doi = 10.1017/S0305004113000698|first = Sascha|last = Troscheit|arxiv = 1301.1286|bibcode = 2014MPCPS.156..295T}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtain a more comprehensive picture of the set where the derivative does not exist for more general normalized Gibb's measures supported on self-conformal and [[Self-similarity|self-similar sets]].

[[Hermann Minkowski]]'s [[Minkowski's question mark function|question mark function]] loosely resembles the Cantor function visually, appearing as a "smoothed out" form of the latter; it can be constructed by passing from a continued fraction expansion to a binary expansion, just as the Cantor function can be constructed by passing from a ternary expansion to a binary expansion.  The question mark function has the interesting property of having vanishing derivatives at all rational numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13276">In mathematics, a '''Carleman matrix''' is a matrix  used to convert [[function composition]] into [[matrix multiplication]]. It is often used in iteration theory to find the continuous [[iterated function|iteration of functions]] which cannot be iterated by [[pattern recognition]] alone. Other uses of Carleman matrices occur in the theory of [[probability]] generating functions, and [[Markov chains]].

==Definition==
The '''Carleman matrix''' of an infinitely differentiable function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;M[f]_{jk} = \frac{1}{k!}\left[\frac{d^k}{dx^k} (f(x))^j \right]_{x=0} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
so as to satisfy the  ([[Taylor series]]) equation:
:&lt;math&gt;(f(x))^j = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} M[f]_{jk} x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

----

For instance,  the computation of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} M[f]_{1,k} x^k. ~&lt;/math&gt;
simply amounts to the dot-product of row 1 of &lt;math&gt; M[f] &lt;/math&gt; with a column vector &lt;math&gt;\left[1,x,x^2,x^3,...\right]^\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The entries of &lt;math&gt;M[f]&lt;/math&gt; in the next row give the 2nd power of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} M[f]_{2,k} x^k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and also, in order to have the zero'th power of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M[f]&lt;/math&gt;, we adopt the row 0 containing zeros everywhere except the first position, such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)^0 = 1 = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} M[f]_{0,k} x^k = 1+ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 0* x^k ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the dot product of &lt;math&gt;M[f]&lt;/math&gt; with the column vector &lt;math&gt;\left[1,x,x^2,...\right]^\tau&lt;/math&gt; yields the column vector &lt;math&gt;\left[1,f(x),f(x)^2,...\right]^\tau&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M[f] * \left[ 1,x,x^2,x^3,...\right]^\tau = \left[ 1,f(x),(f(x))^2,(f(x))^3,...\right]^\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bell matrix==
The '''Bell matrix''' of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;B[f]_{jk} = \frac{1}{j!}\left[\frac{d^j}{dx^j} (f(x))^k \right]_{x=0} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
so as to satisfy the equation
:&lt;math&gt;(f(x))^k = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} B[f]_{jk} x^j ~,&lt;/math&gt;
so it is the [[transpose]] of the  above Carleman matrix.

==Jabotinsky matrix==
Eri Jabotinsky developed that concept of matrices 1947 for the purpose of representation of convolutions of polynomials. In an article "Analytic Iteration" (1963) he introduces the term "representation matrix", and generalized that concept to two-way-infinite matrices. In that article only functions of the type &lt;math&gt;f(x)= a_1 x + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt; are discussed, but considered for positive *and* negative powers of the function. Several authors refer to the Bell matrices as "Jabotinsky matrix" since (D. Knuth 1992, W.D. Lang 2000), and possibly this shall grow to a more canonical name.

==Generalization==
A generalization of the Carleman matrix of a function can be defined around any point, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;M[f]_{x_0} = M_x[x - x_0]M[f]M_x[x + x_0]&lt;/math&gt; 
or &lt;math&gt;M[f]_{x_0} = M[g]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g(x) = f(x + x_0) - x_0&lt;/math&gt;. This allows the [[matrix power]] to be related as:
:&lt;math&gt;(M[f]_{x_0})^n = M_x[x - x_0]M[f]^nM_x[x + x_0]&lt;/math&gt;

=== General Series ===
:Another way to generalize it even further is think about a general series in the following way:
:Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_n c_n (f) \cdot \psi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a series approximation of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_n(x)\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a basis of the space containing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:We can define &lt;math&gt;G[f]_{mn} = c_n(\psi_m \circ f)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore we have &lt;math&gt;\psi_m \circ f = \sum_n c_n (\psi_m \circ f) \cdot \psi_n = \sum_n G[f]_{mn} \cdot \psi_n&lt;/math&gt;, now we can prove that &lt;math&gt;G[g \circ f] = G[g] \cdot G[f]&lt;/math&gt;, if we assume that &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_n(x)\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is also a basis for &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
:Let &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;\psi_l \circ g = \sum_m G[g]_{lm} \cdot \psi_m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G[g]_{lm} = c_m (\psi_l \circ g)&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now &lt;math&gt;    \sum_n G[g \circ f]_{mn} \psi_n 
=   \psi_l \circ (g \circ f)
=   (\psi_l \circ g) \circ f
=   \sum_m G[g]_{lm} (\psi_m \circ f)
=   \sum_m G[g]_{lm} \sum_n G[f]_{mn} \psi_n
=   \sum_{n,m} G[g]_{lm} G[f]_{mn} \psi_n
=   \sum_{n} (\sum_m G[g]_{lm} G[f]_{mn}) \psi_n&lt;/math&gt;
:Comparing the first and the last term, and from &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_n(x)\}_n&lt;/math&gt; being a base for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;G[g \circ f] =\sum_m G[g]_{lm} G[f]_{mn}= G[g] \cdot G[f]&lt;/math&gt;

==== Examples ====
If we set &lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x) = x^n&lt;/math&gt; we have the '''Carleman matrix'''

If &lt;math&gt;\{e_n(x)\}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a ortonormal basis for a Hilbert Space with a defined inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we can set &lt;math&gt;\psi_n = e_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_n (f)&lt;/math&gt; will be &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \langle f, e_n \rangle } &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;e_n(x) = e^{\sqrt{-1} n x}&lt;/math&gt; we have the analogous for Fourier Series, namely &lt;math&gt;c_n (f) = \cfrac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \displaystyle f(x) \cdot e^{-\sqrt{-1}nx}dx&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrix properties==
These matrices satisfy the fundamental relationships:
*&lt;math&gt;M[f \circ g] = M[f]M[g] ~,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;B[f \circ g] = B[g]B[f] ~,&lt;/math&gt;
which makes the Carleman matrix ''M'' a (direct) representation of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the Bell matrix ''B'' an ''anti-representation'' of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Here the term &lt;math&gt;f \circ g &lt;/math&gt; denotes the composition of functions &lt;math&gt;f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

Other properties include:
*&lt;math&gt;\,M[f^n] = M[f]^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\,f^n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[iterated function]] and 
*&lt;math&gt;\,M[f^{-1}] = M[f]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\,f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inverse function]] (if the Carleman matrix is [[invertible matrix|invertible]]).

\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots
\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Carleman Approximation==
Consider the following autonomous nonlinear system:
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x)+\sum_{j=1}^m g_j(x)d_j(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x\in R^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the system state vector. Also, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are known analytic vector functions, and &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; element of an unknown disturbance to the system.

At the desired nominal point, the nonlinear functions in the above system can be approximated by Taylor expansion
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x)\simeq f(x_0)+
\sum _{k=1}^\eta \frac{1}{k!}\partial f_{[k]}\mid _{x=x_0}(x-x_0)^{[k]}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
&lt;math&gt;\partial f_{[k]}\mid _{x=x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{[k]}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; Kronecker product.

Without loss of generality, we assume that &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is at the origin.

Applying Taylor approximation to the system, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot x\simeq \sum _{k=0}^\eta A_k x^{[k]}
+\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum _{k=0}^\eta B_{jk} x^{[k]}dj 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_k=\frac{1}{k!}\partial f_{[k]}\mid _{x=0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{jk}=\frac{1}{k!}\partial g_{j[k]}\mid _{x=0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently, the following linear system for higher orders of the original states are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d(x^{[i]})}{dt}\simeq \sum _{k=0}^{\eta-i+1} A_{i,k} x^{[k+i-1]}
+\sum_{j=1}^m \sum _{k=0}^{\eta-i+1} B_{j,i,k} x^{[k+i-1]}d_j
&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;A_{i,k}=\sum _{l=0}^{i-1}I^{[l]}_n \otimes A_k \otimes I^{[i-1-l]}_n&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly &lt;math&gt;B_{j,i,\kappa}=\sum _{l=0}^{i-1}I^{[l]}_n \otimes B_{j,\kappa} \otimes I^{[i-1-l]}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Employing Kronecker product operator, the approximated system is presented in the following form
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot x_{\otimes}\simeq Ax_{\otimes}
+\sum_{j=1}^m [B_jx_{\otimes}d_j+B_{j0}d_j]+A_r
&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;x_{\otimes}=\begin{bmatrix}
x^T &amp;x^{{[2]}^T}  &amp; ... &amp; x^{{[\eta]}^T}
 \end{bmatrix}^T&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A, B_j , A_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{j,0}&lt;/math&gt; matrices are defined in (Hashemian and Armaou 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hashemian |first1=N.|last2=Armaou|first2=A.|title=Fast Moving Horizon Estimation of nonlinear processes via Carleman linearization|date=2015|pages=3379–3385|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7171854&amp;tag=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7171854%26tag%3D1| journal = IEEE Proceedings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''computational problem''' is a [[mathematical object]] representing a collection of questions that [[computers]] might be able to solve.  For example, the problem of '''factoring'''

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', find a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''." 

is a computational problem.  Computational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science.  The field of [[algorithms]] studies methods of solving computational problems efficiently.  The complementary field of [[computational complexity]] attempts to explain why certain computational problems are intractable for computers.

A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance.  For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers ''n'', and solutions are prime numbers ''p'' that describe nontrivial prime factors of ''n''.  

It is conventional to represent both instances and solutions by binary [[String (computer science)|strings]], namely elements of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using the binary encoding. (For readability, we identify numbers with their binary encodings in the examples below.)

==Types of computational problems==
A [[decision problem]] is a computational problem where the answer for every instance is either yes or no. An example of a decision problem is ''[[primality testing]]'':

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', determine if ''n'' is prime." 

A decision problem is typically represented as the set of all instances for which the answer is ''yes''. For example, primality testing can be represented as the infinite set

:''L'' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}

In a [[search problem]], the answers can be arbitrary strings. For example, factoring is a search problem where the instances are (string representations of) positive integers and the solutions are (string representations of) collections of primes.

A search problem is represented as a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] consisting of all the instance-solution pairs, called a ''search relation''. For example, factoring can be represented as the relation

:''R'' = {(4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 5)...}

which consist of all pairs of numbers (''n'', ''p''), where ''p'' is a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''.

A [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]] asks for the number of solutions to a given search problem. For example, a counting problem associated with factoring is

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', count the number of nontrivial prime factors of ''n''."

A counting problem can be represented by a function ''f'' from {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to the nonnegative integers. For a search relation ''R'', the counting problem associated to ''R'' is the function

:''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''(x) = |{''y'': ''R''(''x'', ''y'') }|.

An [[optimization problem]] asks for finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem. One example is the ''[[Maximum independent set problem|maximum independent set]]'' problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', find an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of ''G'' of maximum size."

Optimization problems can be represented by their search relations.

In a [[function problem]] a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]], that is, it isn't just "yes" or "no". One of the most famous examples is the ''[[Travelling salesman problem|travelling salesman]]'' problem:

:"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city."

It is an [[NP-hard]] problem in [[combinatorial optimization]], important in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

==Promise problem==
{{Main|Promise problem}}

In [[computational complexity theory]], it is usually implicitly assumed that any string in {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represents an instance of the computational problem in question. However, sometimes not all strings {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represent valid instances, and one specifies a proper subset of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as the set of "valid instances".  Computational problems of this type are called [[promise problem]]s.

The following is an example of a (decision) promise problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', determine if every [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in ''G'' has size at most 5, or ''G'' has an independent set of size at least 10."

Here, the valid instances are those graphs whose maximum independent set size is either at most 5 or at least 10.

Decision promise problems are usually represented as pairs of disjoint subsets (''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;) of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The valid instances are those in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;.
''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt; represent the instances whose answer is ''yes'' and ''no'', respectively.  

Promise problems play an important role in several areas of [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]], including [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]], and [[interactive proof system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[graph theory]], a '''conference graph''' is a [[strongly regular graph]] with parameters ''v'', {{nowrap|1=''k'' = (''v'' &amp;minus; 1)/2,}} {{nowrap|1=λ = (''v'' &amp;minus; 5)/4,}} and {{nowrap|1=μ = (''v'' &amp;minus; 1)/4.}}  It is the graph associated with a symmetric [[conference matrix]], and consequently its order ''v'' must be 1 ([[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4) and a [[Sum of two squares theorem|sum of two squares]].

Conference graphs are known to exist for all small values of ''v'' allowed by the restrictions, e.g., ''v'' = 5, 9, 13, 17, 25, 29, and (the [[Paley graph]]s) for all prime powers congruent to 1 (modulo 4).  However, there are many values of ''v'' that are allowed, for which the existence of a conference graph is unknown.

The eigenvalues of a conference graph need not be integers, unlike those of other strongly regular graphs.  If the graph is connected, the eigenvalues are ''k'' with multiplicity 1, and two other eigenvalues, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt v}{2} , &lt;/math&gt; 
each with multiplicity {{nowrap|(''v'' &amp;minus; 1)/2.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[large deviations theory]] &amp;mdash; the '''contraction principle''' is a [[theorem]] that states how a large deviation principle on one space "pushes forward" (via the [[Pushforward measure|pushforward]] of a probability measure) to a large deviation principle on another space ''via'' a [[continuous function]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]s and let (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of [[probability measure]]s on ''X'' that satisfies the large deviation principle with [[rate function]] ''I''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞].  Let ''T''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' be a continuous function, and let ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;) be the push-forward measure of ''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''T'', i.e., for each [[measurable set]]/event ''E''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y'',  ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')).  Let

:&lt;math&gt;J(y) := \inf \{ I(x) \mid x \in X \text{ and } T(x) = y \},&lt;/math&gt;

with the convention that the [[infimum]] of ''I'' over the [[empty set]] ∅ is +∞.  Then:
* ''J''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] is a rate function on ''Y'',
* ''J'' is a good rate function on ''Y'' if ''I'' is a good rate function on ''X'', and
*  (''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the large deviation principle on ''Y'' with rate function ''J''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6324">In [[mathematics]], a '''cover''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of sets whose union contains &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subset]]. Formally, if
:&lt;math&gt;C = \lbrace U_\alpha: \alpha \in A\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[indexed family]] of sets &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cover in topology==
Covers are commonly used in the context of [[topology]]. If the set ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then a ''cover'' ''C'' of ''X'' is a collection of subsets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' whose union is the whole space ''X''. In this case we say that ''C'' ''covers'' ''X'', or that the sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ''cover'' ''X''. Also, if ''Y'' is a subset of ''X'', then a ''cover'' of ''Y'' is a collection of subsets of ''X'' whose union contains ''Y'', i.e., ''C'' is a cover of ''Y'' if

:&lt;math&gt;Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in C}U_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''C'' be a cover of a topological space ''X''. A '''subcover''' of ''C'' is a subset of ''C'' that still covers ''X''.

We say that ''C'' is an '''{{vanchor|open cover}}''' if each of its members is an [[open set]] (i.e. each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in ''T'', where ''T'' is the topology on ''X'').

A cover of ''X'' is said to be [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] if every point of ''X'' has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] which intersects only [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets in the cover.  Formally, ''C'' = {''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;} is locally finite if for any ''x'' ∈ ''X'', there exists some neighborhood ''N''(''x'') of ''x'' such that the set
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \alpha \in A : U_{\alpha} \cap N(x) \neq \varnothing \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. A cover of ''X'' is said to be '''point finite''' if every point of ''X'' is contained in only finitely many sets in the cover. A cover is point finite if it is locally finite, though the converse is not necessarily true.

==Refinement==
A '''refinement''' of a cover ''C'' of a topological space ''X'' is a new cover ''D'' of ''X'' such that every set in ''D'' is contained in some set in ''C''. Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;D = \{V_{\beta \in B}\} \; \text{is a refinement of} \; C = \{U_{\alpha \in A}\} \; \text{when} \; \forall \beta \ \exists \alpha \ V_\beta \subseteq U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, there is a '''refinement map''' &lt;math&gt;\phi: B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;V_{\beta} \subseteq U_{\phi(\beta)}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\beta \in B&lt;/math&gt;. This map is used, for instance, in the  [[Čech cohomology]] of X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology|date = 1982|last = Bott, Tu|page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every subcover is also a refinement, but the opposite is not always true. A subcover is made from the sets that are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any sets that are subsets of the sets in the cover.

The refinement relation is a [[preorder]] on the set of covers of ''X''.

Generally speaking, a refinement of a given structure is another that in some sense contains it. Examples are to be found when partitioning an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (one refinement of &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; ... &lt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; b_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; ... &lt; a_n &lt; b_1&lt;/math&gt;), considering [[topology|topologies]] (the [[standard topology]] in euclidean space being a refinement of the [[trivial topology]]). When subdividing [[simplicial complex]]es (the first [[barycentric subdivision]] of a simplicial complex is a refinement), the situation is slightly different: every [[simplex]] in the finer complex is a face of some simplex in the coarser one, and both have equal underlying polyhedra.

Yet another notion of refinement is that of [[star refinement]].

==Subcover==
A simple way to get a subcover is to omit the sets contained in another set in the cover. Turn to open cover.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be the topological basis of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=\{A\in\mathcal{B},A\subset U \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is any set in an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a refinement. For any &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, we select a &lt;math&gt;U_A\in\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; (require the selection axiom). Now &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\{U_A\in\mathcal{O},A\subset U_A \}&lt;/math&gt; is a subcover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the cardinal of a subcover of an open cover can be as small as that of  topological basis. And second countability implies Lindelöf spaces.

==Compactness==
The language of covers is often used to define several topological properties related to ''compactness''. A topological space ''X'' is said to be
;[[compact space|Compact]]: if every open cover has a finite subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a finite refinement);
;[[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]: if every open cover has a [[countable]] subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a countable refinement);
;[[metacompact space|Metacompact]]: if every open cover has a point finite open refinement;
;[[paracompact space|Paracompact]]: if every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement.

For some more variations see the above articles.

==Covering dimension==
A topological space ''X'' is said to be of [[covering dimension]] ''n'' if every open cover of ''X'' has a point finite open refinement such that no point of ''X'' is included in more than ''n+1'' sets in the refinement and if ''n'' is the minimum value for which this is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no such minimal ''n'' exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

In [[computer science]] the notion of highly connected subgraphs appears frequently. This notion can be formalized as follows. Let &lt;math&gt; G=(E,V)  &lt;/math&gt; be an [[undirected graph]] and let &lt;math&gt; S=(E_S,V_S)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''density'' of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt; d(S) = {|E_S|\over|V_S|} &lt;/math&gt;.

The densest subgraph problem is that of finding a subgraph of maximum density. In 1984, [[Andrew V. Goldberg]] developed a polynomial time algorithm to find the maximum density subgraph using a [[max flow]] technique.

==Densest {{mvar|k}} subgraph==
There are many variations on the densest subgraph problem. One of them is the densest &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; subgraph problem, where the objective is to find the maximum density subgraph on exactly &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; vertices. This problem generalizes the [[clique problem]] and is thus [[NP-hard]] in general graphs. There exists a polynomial algorithm approximating the densest &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; subgraph within a ratio of &lt;math&gt;n^{1/4 + \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;  for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Densest at most {{mvar|k}} subgraph==
The objective of the densest at most &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; problem is to find the maximum density subgraph on at most &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; vertices. Anderson and Chellapilla showed that if there exists an &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; approximation for this problem then that will lead to an &lt;math&gt; \Theta(\alpha ^2) &lt;/math&gt; approximation for the densest &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; subgraph problem.

==Densest at least {{mvar|k}} subgraph==
The densest at least &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; problem is defined similarly to the densest at most &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; subgraph problem. The problem is NP-complete,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=={{mvar|K}}-clique densest subgraph==
[[Charalampos Tsourakakis]] introduced the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-clique densest subgraph problem. This variation of the densest subgraph problem aims to maximize the average number of induced &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; cliques &lt;math&gt; d_{k}(S) = {|C_k(S)|\over|V_S|} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_k(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-cliques induced by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the densest subgraph problem is obtained as a special case for &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt;. This generalization provides an empirically successful poly-time approach for extracting large near-cliques from large-scale real-world networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6396">In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[axiomatic set theory]], the '''diamond principle''' {{math|◊}} is a [[combinatorial principle]] introduced by [[Ronald Jensen]] in {{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} that holds in the [[constructible universe]] ({{math|''L''}}) and that implies the [[continuum hypothesis]]. Jensen extracted the diamond principle from his proof that the [[Axiom of constructibility]] ({{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}) implies the existence of a [[Suslin tree]].

== Definitions ==
The diamond principle {{math|◊}} says that there exists a '''{{vanchor|◊-sequence}}''', in other words sets {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of [[First uncountable ordinal|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] the set of {{math|''α''}} with {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  is [[Stationary set|stationary]] in {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

There are several equivalent forms of the diamond principle. One states that there is a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal {{math|''α''}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a stationary subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α''  ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Another equivalent form states that there exist sets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{mvar|''A''}} of {{mvar|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is at least one infinite {{mvar|''α''}} with {{mvar|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

More generally, for a given [[cardinal number]] {{math|''κ''}} and a [[stationary set]] {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, the statement {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes written {{math|◊(''S'')}} or {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''κ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}) is the statement that there is a [[sequence]] {{math|⟨''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''α'' ∈ ''S''⟩}} such that

* each {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}}
* for every {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, {{math|{''α'' ∈ ''S'' : ''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is stationary in {{math|''κ''}}

The principle {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the same as {{math|◊}}.

The diamond-plus principle {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} says that there exists a '''{{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}-sequence''', in other words a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a closed unbounded subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Properties and use ==

{{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} showed that the diamond principle {{math|◊}} implies the existence of [[Suslin tree]]s. He also showed that [[V=L|{{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}]] implies the diamond-plus principle, which implies the diamond principle, which implies [[continuum hypothesis|CH]]. In particular the diamond principle and the diamond-plus principle are both [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the axioms of ZFC. Also {{math|[[clubsuit|♣]] + CH}} implies {{math|◊}}, but [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] gave models of {{math|♣ + ¬ CH,}} so {{math|◊}} and {{math|♣}} are not equivalent (rather, {{math|♣}} is weaker than {{math|◊}}).

The diamond principle {{math|◊}} does not imply the existence of a [[Kurepa tree]], but the stronger {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} principle implies both the {{math|◊}} principle and the existence of a Kurepa tree.

{{harvtxt|Akemann|Weaver|2004}} used {{math|◊}} to construct a [[C* algebra|{{math|''C''*}}-algebra]] serving as a [[counterexample]] to [[Naimark's problem]].

For all cardinals {{math|''κ''}} and [[stationary subset]]s {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds in the [[constructible universe]]. {{harvtxt|Shelah|2010}} proved that for {{math|''κ'' &gt; ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|◊{{su|b=''κ''|p=+}}(''S'')}} follows from {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} for stationary {{math|''S''}} that do not contain ordinals of cofinality {{math|''κ''}}.

Shelah showed that the diamond principle solves the [[Whitehead problem]] by implying that every [[Whitehead problem|Whitehead group]] is free.

'''Dr. Lancelot Priestley''' is a fictional investigator born in July 1869&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhode|first=John|title=The Ellerby Case|year=1927|publisher=Geoffrey Bles|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of books by [[John Rhode]]

After 1924 Dr. Priestley took over from [[Dr. Thorndyke]] as the leading fictional forensic investigator in Britain, and featured in 72 novels written over 40 years, solving many ingenious and misleading murders. Dr Priestley's involvement is usually at the request of the police but only if the case piques his scientific curiosity; having little, or no, interest in criminal justice. "''Hanslet had brought many problems which confronted him in the course of his duties to Dr. Priestley's notice, usually with results highly satisfactory to himself. But in nearly every case Dr. Priestly's interest in the problem ceased when he had solved it to his own satisfaction. The fate of the criminal was a matter of complete unconcern to him. He treated detection much as he would have treated a game of chess. The pieces in the game had no more than a passing interest to him. Not that he was unsympathetic by nature, as many people had good cause to know. But, in the problems which Hanslet set before him, he purposely took a detached and impersonal attitude. Only in this way, as he more than once remarked, was it possible to maintain an impartial judgement''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhode|first=John|title=The Claverton Affair|year=1986|publisher=Harper&amp;Row|isbn=0-06-080808-X|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Priestley had previously held the chair of Applied Mathematics at a leading [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] University until he abandoned his chair and retired to the house in Westbourne Terrace which he had inherited from his father, but is described as an independent researcher who delights in scientific controversy. Described in The Ellerby Case, Dr Priestley's book "Fact and Fallacy" "''..contained in every one of its two hundred odd pages a direct and trenchant attack upon those whom the author was apt to allude to as "The Orthodox Scientific School"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhode|first=John|title=The Ellerby Case|year=1927|publisher=Geoffrey Bles|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''So the reviews poured in by every post: denunciatory, indignant, sometimes distinctly abusive. And Dr Priestley would sit and gloat over them, as a primitive warrior might gloat over the blood of his adversaries''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhode|first=John|title=The Ellerby Case|year=1927|publisher=Geoffrey Bles|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early books Dr. Priestly provides assistance mainly to his friend Chief Inspector Hanslet. In later books Dr. Priestley becomes an [[armchair detective]] and the bulk of the legwork is done by Superintendent Jimmy Waghorn of [[Scotland Yard]] and Priestley's secretary and companion, Harold Merefield.  Harold Merefield, whom Dr Priestley had cleared of a murder charge in the first book ''The Paddington Mystery'', is engaged to Dr. Priestly's daughter April. Superintendent Hanslet (now retired) appears in several later works as a dinner guest of Dr. Priestly passing on his professional wisdom to Waghorn.

'''Erland Samuel Bring''' (19 August 1736 – 20 May 1798) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician.

Bring studied at [[Lund University]] between 1750 and 1757. In 1762 he obtained a position of a reader in history and was promoted to professor in 1779. At Lund he wrote eight volumes of mathematical work in the fields of algebra, geometry, analysis and astronomy, including ''Meletemata quaedam mathematica circa transformationem aequationum algebraicarum'' (1786). This work describes Bring's contribution to the [[algebraic solution]] of equations.

Bring had developed an important transformation to simplify a [[quintic equation]] to the form &lt;math&gt;x^5 + px + q = 0&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Bring radical]]). In 1832–35 the same transformation was independently derived by [[George Jerrard]]. However, whereas Jerrard knew from the past work by [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]] that a general quintic equation can not be solved, this fact was not known to Bring, putting him in a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;J J O'Connor and E F Robertson [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bring.html Erland Samuel Bring]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bring's curve]] is named after him.

'''Fan-Rong King Chung Graham''' ({{zh|c=金芳蓉|p=Jīn Fāngróng}}; born October 9, 1949), known professionally as '''Fan Chung''', is a Taiwanese-born American [[mathematician]] who works mainly in the areas of [[spectral graph theory]], [[extremal graph theory]] and  [[random graphs]], in particular in generalizing the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] for graphs with general degree distribution (including [[power law|power-law]] graphs in the study of large information networks).

==Life==
Since 1998, Chung has been the Akamai Professor in Internet Mathematics at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). She received her doctorate from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1974, under the direction of [[Herbert Wilf]]. After working at [[Bell Laboratories]] and Bellcore for nineteen years, she joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as the first female [[tenure]]d professor in mathematics. She serves on the editorial boards of more than a dozen international journals. Since 2003 she has been the editor-in-chief of ''Internet Mathematics''. She has been invited to give lectures at many conferences, including the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994 and a plenary lecture on the mathematics of PageRank at the 2008 Annual meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]].

==Biography==

Fan Chung was born on October 9, 1949 in [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan. Under the influence of her father, an engineer, she became interested in mathematics, especially in the area of [[combinatorics]] in high school in Kaohsiung. After high school, Chung entered the [[National Taiwan University]] (NTU) to start her career in mathematics formally. While Chung was an undergraduate, she was surrounded by many female mathematicians, and this helped encourage her to pursue and study mathematics.

After graduating from NTU with a B.S. in mathematics, Chung went on to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to pursue a career in mathematics. There she obtained the highest score in the qualifying exam by a wide margin, catching the attention of [[Herbert Wilf]], who would eventually become her doctoral advisor. Wilf suggested [[Ramsey theory]] as a subject Chung could work on. During a single week studying material Chung had come up with new proofs for established results in the field. Wilf said: "My eyes were bulging. I was very excited. I asked her to go to the blackboard and show me. What she wrote was incredible! In just one week, from a cold start, she had a major result in Ramsey theory. I told her she had just done two-thirds of a doctoral dissertation."&lt;ref name="Chung biography"/&gt;

Chung was awarded a M.S. in 1972 and a Ph.D. two years later. By this time, she was married and had already given birth to her first child. The same year she received her Ph.D. and started working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The position at [[Bell Laboratories]] was an opportunity to work with other excellent mathematicians, but also it contributed to her mathematical world powerfully. She published many impressive mathematical papers and published many joint papers with [[Ronald Graham (mathematician)|Ron Graham]].

After twenty years of work at [[Bell Laboratories]] and [[Bellcore]], Chung decided to go back [[University of Pennsylvania]] to become a professor of mathematics. In 1998, she was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at [[University of California]], San Diego. To date, she has over 200 publications to her name. The two best known books are ''Spectral Graph Theory'' and ''Erdős on Graphs''. ''[[Spectral Graph Theory]]'' studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties. ''Erdős on Graphs'', which was jointly written by Fan Chung and Ron Graham, studies many of [[Paul Erdős]] problems and conjectures in graph theory. Beyond her contributions to graph theory, Chung has used her knowledge to connect different fields of science. As she wrote in ''"Graph Theory in the Information Age"'',

: ''In the past decade, graph theory has gone through a remarkable shift and a profound transformation. The change is in large part due to the humongous amount of information that we are confronted with. A main way to sort through massive data sets is to build and examine the network formed by interrelations. For example, Google’s successful Web search algorithms are based on the WWW graph, which contains all Web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges. There are all sorts of information networks, such as biological networks built from biological databases and social networks formed by email, phone calls, instant messaging, etc., as well as various types of physical networks. Of particular interest to mathematicians is the collaboration graph, which is based on the data from Mathematical Reviews. In the collaboration graph, every mathematician is a vertex, and two mathematicians who wrote a joint paper are connected.''&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Fan ''Graph Theory in the Information Age'' January 2009, Washington D.C&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung's life was profiled in the 2017 documentary film ''Girls who fell in love with Math''.&lt;ref name=taiwanDocumentary&gt;{{cite web | title=''Girls who fell in love with Math''|url=http://taiwandocs.tfi.org.tw/en/film_detail/11792|publisher=Taiwan Film Institute| accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan Chung and Bell Laboratories==
In 1974, Fan Chung graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and became a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. She worked under [[Henry Pollak]]. During this time, Chung collaborated with many leading mathematicians who work for Bell Laboratories such as [[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]].

In 1975, Chung published her first joint paper with Graham on ''Multicolor Ramsey Numbers for Complete Bipartite Graphs''  which was published in the ''Journal of Combinatorial Theory''.

In 1983 the Bell Telephone Company was split up. Since Pollak joined and became head of a research unit within a new company, he asked Chung to become Research Manager. Until 1990, she was one of the first to receive a fellowship to spend a sabbatical at a university. She supervised many mathematicians in the unit.

According to Chung's words, although people respect her because of the power to make decisions with positions in management, she prefers to be respected because of her achievement in mathematics. Since then, she has returned to the academic world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;J J O'Connor and E F Roberson, ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', web, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan Chung and Ron Graham==
Fan Chung's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. However, when she worked at [[Bell Laboratories]], she met [[Ronald Graham]]. During that time, they became close friends and published many joint papers in graph theory, eventually marrying in 1983. In [[P Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]]'s book ''The Man Who Loved Only Numbers'', regarding his marriage with Chung, Graham said:

:''Many mathematicians would hate to marry someone in the profession. They fear their relationship would be too competitive. In our case, not only are we both mathematicians, we both do work in the same areas. So we can understand and appreciate what the other is working on, and we can work on things together and sometimes make good progress.''&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P  ''The man who loved only numbers'' London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Graham and Chung co-wrote the book ''Erdős on Graphs.''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Fan Chung and spectral graph theory==
Among Fan Chung's publications, her contributions to [[spectral graph theory]] are important to this area of graph theory. From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about the directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the [[spectral graph theory]] to the future graph theorist.

Spectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. According to the biography ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', "''[[Spectral graph theory]] studies how the spectrum of the [[Laplacian]] of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties."'''.

In 1997, the [[American Mathematical Society]] published Chung's book ''Spectral graph theory''. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study [[Spectral graph theory]] for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung’s study in the [[spectral graph theory]] brings this “algebraic connectivity” of graphs into a new and higher level.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Fan Chung won the [[Allendoerfer Award]] of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] in 1990 and was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a Fellow of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] in 2015 "for contributions to combinatorics, graph theory, and their applications".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fellows.siam.org/index.php?sort=year&amp;value=2015 SIAM Fellows Class of 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|200px|Ronald Fisher]]

'''Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection''' is an idea about [[genetic variance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12206233 | volume=56 | title=Perspective: Here's to Fisher, additive genetic variance, and the fundamental theorem of natural selection | journal=Evolution | pages=1313–6 | last1 = Crow | first1 = JF | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[1313:phstfa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.498.9934&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection Revisited by Sabin Lessard]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[population genetics]] developed by the [[statistics|statistician]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. The proper way of applying the abstract mathematics of the theorem to actual biology has been a matter of some debate.

It states:

:"The rate of increase in [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of any [[organism]] at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time."&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;[[R.A. Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Or in more modern terminology:

:"The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism at any time ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in [[gene frequencies]] is exactly equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time".&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | authorlink = A.W.F. Edwards | year = 1994 | title = The fundamental theorem of natural selection | url = | journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 443–474 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1994.tb01247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The theorem was first formulated in Fisher's 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; Fisher likened it to the [[Second law of thermodynamics|law of entropy]] in [[physics]], stating that "It is not a little instructive that so similar a law should hold the supreme position among the biological sciences". The model of [[Quasi-linkage equilibrium]] was introduced by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1965 as an approximation in the case of [[weak selection]] and weak [[epistasis]].&lt;ref  name="kimura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Motoo|title=Attainment of quasi linkage equilibrium when gene frequencies are changing by natural selection|journal=Genetics|year=1965|volume=52|pages=875–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghKrimbas2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Rama S.|last2=Krimbas|first2=Costas B.|title=Evolutionary Genetics: From Molecules to Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flmuDNNpYTIC&amp;pg=PA267|date=28 March 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57123-4|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely as a result of Fisher's feud with the American geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] about [[adaptive landscapes]], the theorem was widely misunderstood to mean that the average fitness of a population would always increase, even though models showed this not to be the case.&lt;ref name="Provine2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Provine|first=William B.|title=The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics: With a New Afterword|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mj0ptluGeQC&amp;pg=PA163|date=May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-68464-2|pages=140–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[George R. Price]] [[Price equation|showed]] that Fisher's theorem was indeed correct (and that Fisher's proof was also correct, given a typo or two), but did not find it to be of great significance. The sophistication that Price pointed out, and that had made understanding difficult, is that the theorem gives a formula for part of the change in gene frequency, and not for all of it. This is a part that can be said to be due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | authorlink = George R. Price | year = 1972 | title = Fisher's "fundamental theorem" made clear | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 129–140 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1972.tb00764.x | pmid=4656569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work (reviewed by Grafen in 2003) builds on Price's understanding in two ways. One aims to improve the theorem by completing it, i.e. by finding a formula for the whole of the change in gene frequency, and accounting for the effects of mutations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Basener, W.F. &amp; Sanford, J.C., P.|year=2017|title=The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|doi=10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The other argues that the partial change is indeed of great conceptual significance, and aims to extend similar partial change results into more and more general population genetic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=Alan |date=21 August 2003 |title=Fisher the evolutionary biologist |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~grafen/cv/fisher.pdf |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|The Statistician]] |publisher=[[Royal Statistical Society]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=319-329 |doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to confounding factors, tests of the fundamental theorem are quite rare though Bolnick in 2007 did test this effect in a natural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bolnick D. I. &amp; Nosil, P.|title=Natural Selection in Populations Subject to a Migration Load|journal=Evolution|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00179.x|volume=61|pages=2229–2243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GoldSim''' is dynamic, [[probabilistic]] [[simulation software]] developed by GoldSim Technology Group. 
This general-purpose simulator is a hybrid of several simulation approaches, combining an extension of [[system dynamics]] with some aspects of [[discrete event simulation]], and embedding the dynamic simulation engine within a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] framework.

While it is a general-purpose simulator, GoldSim has been most extensively used for environmental and engineering [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], with applications in the areas of [[water resource]] management

==History==

In 1990, [[Golder Associates]], an international engineering consulting firm, was asked by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to develop probabilistic simulation software that could be used to help with decision support and management within the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The results of this effort were two [[MS-DOS|DOS]]-based programs (RIP and STRIP), which were used to support radioactive waste management projects within the DOE.

In 1996, in an effort funded by Golder Associates, the US DOE, the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (currently the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]]) and the [[:es:ENRESA|Spanish National Radioactive Waste Company]] (ENRESA), the capabilities of RIP and STRIP were incorporated into a general purpose [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based simulator called GoldSim. Subsequent funding was also provided by [[NASA]].

Initially only offered to the original funding organizations, GoldSim was released to the public in 2002.   In 2004, GoldSim Technology Group LLC was spun off from Golder Associates and is now a wholly independent company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwdmag.com/Golder-Associates-Launches-Independent-Software-Company-Based-on-GoldSim-Software-NewsPiece6502 Golder Associates Launches Independent Software Company Based on GoldSim Software] (2004), ''Water &amp; Wastes DIGEST''&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable applications include providing the simulation framework for: 1) the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] Repository Performance Assessment model developed by [[Sandia National Laboratories]];&lt;ref name="rad-waste1" /&gt; 2) a comprehensive system-level computational model for performance assessment of [[Carbon capture and storage|geological sequestration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] developed by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]];&lt;ref name="CO2-1" /&gt; 3) a flood operations model to help better understand and fine tune operations of a large dam used for water supply and flood control in Queensland, Australia;&lt;ref name="water4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="water5" /&gt; and 4) models for simulating risks associated with future manned space missions in NASA’s [[Constellation program]] developed by [[NASA Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref name="nasa1" /&gt;

==Modeling Environment==

GoldSim provides a visual and hierarchical modeling environment, which allows users to construct models by adding “elements” (model objects) that represent data, equations, processes or events, and linking them together into graphical representations that resemble [[influence diagrams]]. Influence arrows are automatically drawn as elements are referenced by other elements. Complex systems can be translated into hierarchical GoldSim models by creating layer of “containers” (or sub-models). Visual representations and hierarchical structures help users to build very large, complex models that can still be explained to interested stakeholders (e.g., government regulators, elected officials, and the public).

Though it is primarily a continuous simulator, GoldSim has a number of features typically associated with [[Discrete event simulation|discrete simulators]].  By combining these two simulation methods, systems that are best represented using both continuous and discrete dynamics can often be more accurately simulated.  Examples include tracking the quantity of water in a reservoir that is subject to both continuous inflows and outflows, as well as sudden storm events; and tracking the quantity of fuel in a space vehicle as it is subjected to random perturbations (e.g., component failures, extreme environmental conditions).

Because the software was originally developed for complex environmental applications, in which many inputs are [[Uncertainty|uncertain]] and/or [[stochastic]], in addition to being a dynamic simulator, GoldSim is a [[Monte Carlo Method|Monte Carlo]] simulator, such that inputs can be defined as distributions and the entire system simulated a large number of times to provide probabilistic outputs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsim.com/Web/Introduction/Probabilistic/ Probabilistic Simulation].  ''GoldSim website''.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the software incorporates a number of computational features to facilitate probabilistic simulation of complex systems, including tools for generating and correlating stochastic [[time series]], advanced sampling capabilities (including [[latin hypercube sampling]], nested Monte Carlo analysis, and [[importance sampling]]), and support for [[distributed processing]].

A '''graded category''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] concept.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[category theory|category]], then a
'''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category'''
is a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[functor]]
&lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Monoid]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s can be thought of as categories with a single [[element (mathematics)|element]]. A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each [[morphism]] is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with [[function composition|composition]], in the sense that compositions have the product grade.

==Definition==

There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above.  A more concrete definition of a semigroup-graded Abelian category is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J. J.|title=Twisted Graded Algebras and Equivalences of Graded Categories|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|date=1 March 1996|volume=s3-72|issue=2|pages=281–311|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-72.2.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Abelian category]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; a [[semigroup]].  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{ S_{g} : g\in G \}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of [[functor]]s from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  If

* &lt;math&gt;S_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity functor on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}S_{h}=S_{gh}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,h\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Full and faithful functors|full and faithful functor]] for every &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;

we say that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category.

[[File:13-08-06-abu-dhabi-by-RalfR-102.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastern Arabic and Western Arabic numerals on a road sign in Abu Dhabi]]

The '''Hindu–Arabic numeral system'''&lt;ref name="booksmith"&gt;[[David Eugene Smith]] and [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/22599 The Hindu–Arabic Numerals], 1911&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the '''Arabic numeral system'''&lt;ref name="booksmith" /&gt; or '''Hindu numeral system''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIgxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22empire+was+expanding+and+contact+was+made+with+India%22&amp;dq=%22empire+was+expanding+and+contact+was+made+with+India%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi22ZabybvQAhWjLMAKHa9nAREQ6AEIGzAA|title=Collier's Encyclopedia, with bibliography and index|author=William Darrach Halsey, Emanuel Friedman|year=1983|quote=When the Arabian empire was expanding and contact was made with India, the Hindu numeral system and the early algorithms were adopted by the Arabs}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Hindustan|Hindu]] was the Persian name for "Indian" in the 10th century, when the Arabs adopted the number system. The connotation of "[[Hinduism|Hindu]]" as a religion was a later development.}} is a [[positional notation|positional]] [[decimal]] [[numeral system]], and is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world. It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]]. The system was adopted in [[Arabic mathematics]] by the 9th century. Influential were the books of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]]&lt;ref name="Brezina2006"&gt;{{citation|last=Brezina|first=Corona|title=Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor of Algebra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sfrxde0CXIC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2006|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4042-0513-0|pages=39–40}}: "Historians have speculated on al-Khwarizmi's native language. Since he was born in a former Persian province, he may have spoken the Persian language. It is also possible that he spoke Khwarezmian, a language of the region that is now extinct."&lt;/ref&gt; (''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;825) and  [[Al-Kindi]] (''On the Use of the Hindu Numerals'', {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;830).  The system later spread to medieval Europe by the [[High Middle Ages]].

The system is based upon ten (originally nine) different [[glyph]]s. The symbols (glyphs) used to represent the system are in principle independent of the system itself. The glyphs in actual use are descended from [[Brahmi numerals]] and have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]].

These symbol sets can be divided into three main families: [[Western Arabic numerals]] used in the [[Greater Maghreb]] and in [[Europe]], [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] (also called "Indic numerals") used in the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian numerals]] used in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==Etymology==
The Hindu-Arabic numerals were invented by mathematicians in India. Perso-Arabic mathematicians called them "Hindu numerals" (where "[[Hindu]]" meant Indian). Later they came to be called "Arabic numerals" in Europe, because they were introduced to the West by Arab merchants.&lt;ref name="UniOfNthC1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and "Arabic" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=2004-07-04|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positional notation ==
{{main article|Positional notation|0 (number)}}

The Hindu–Arabic system is designed for [[positional notation]] in a [[decimal]] system. In a more developed form, positional notation also uses a [[Decimal separator|decimal marker]] (at first a mark over the ones digit but now more usually a decimal point or a decimal comma which separates the ones place from the tenths place), and also a symbol for "these digits recur ''[[ad infinitum]]''". In modern usage, this latter symbol is usually a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (a horizontal line placed over the repeating digits). In this more developed form, the numeral system can symbolize any [[rational number]] using only 13 symbols (the ten digits, decimal marker, vinculum, and a prepended [[dash]] to indicate a [[negative number]]).

Although generally found in text written with the Arabic [[abjad]] ("alphabet"), numbers written with these numerals also place the most-significant digit to the left, so they read from left to right. The requisite changes in reading direction are found in text that mixes left-to-right writing systems with right-to-left systems.

== Symbols ==

Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, most of which developed from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s.

The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]], arranged in three main groups:
* The widespread Western "[[Arabic numerals]]" used with the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Greek alphabet]]s in the table, descended from the "West Arabic numerals" which were developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] (there are two [[Typography|typographic]] styles for rendering western Arabic numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).
* The "Arabic–Indic" or "[[Eastern Arabic numerals]]" used with Arabic script, developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals is used in Persian and Urdu.
* The [[Indian numerals]] in use with scripts of the [[Brahmic family]] in India and Southeast Asia. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs (as one will note when perusing Unicode character charts).

As in many numbering systems, the numerals 1, 2, and 3 represent simple [[tally marks]]; 1 being a single line, 2 being two lines (now connected by a diagonal) and 3 being three lines (now connected by two vertical lines). After three, numerals tend to become more complex symbols (examples are the [[Chinese numerals]] and [[Roman numerals]]). Theorists believe that this is because [[Subitizing and counting|it becomes difficult to instantaneously count objects past three]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6303 ''Language may shape human thought''], ''New Scientist'', news service, Celeste Biever, 19:00 19 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edicts of Ashoka numerals.jpg|thumb|The first [[Brahmi numerals]], ancestors of Hindu-Arabic numerals, used by [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]] circa 250 BCE.]]
The [[Brahmi numerals]] at the basis of the system predate the [[Common Era]]. They replaced the earlier [[Kharosthi numerals]] used since the 4th century BC. Brahmi and Kharosthi numerals were used alongside one another in the [[Maurya Empire]] period, both appearing on the 3rd century BC [[edicts of Ashoka]].&lt;ref&gt;Flegg (2002), p. 6ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist]] inscriptions from around 300 BC use the symbols that became 1, 4, and 6. One century later, their use of the symbols that became 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 was recorded. These [[Brahmi numeral]]s are the ancestors of the Hindu–Arabic glyphs 1 to 9, but they were not used as a [[positional system]] with a [[0 (number)|zero]], and there were rather separate numerals for each of the tens (10, 20, 30, etc.).

The actual numeral system, including positional notation and use of zero, is in principle independent of the glyphs used, and significantly younger than the Brahmi numerals.

===Development===
[[File:Per galera.PNG|thumb|right|The "[[Galley division|Galley]]" method of division.]]
The place-value system is used in the [[Bakhshali Manuscript]]. Although date of the composition of the manuscript is uncertain, the language used in the manuscript indicates that it could not have been composed any later than 400.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=The Bakhshali manuscript|author=Pearce, Ian|publisher=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Bakhshali_manuscript.html|date=May 2002|accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the positional decimal system takes its origins in [[Hindu mathematics]] during the [[Gupta period]]. Around 500, the astronomer [[Aryabhata]] uses the word ''kha'' ("emptiness") to mark "zero" in tabular arrangements of digits. The 7th century ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|Brahmasphuta Siddhanta]]'' contains a comparatively advanced understanding of the mathematical role of [[0 (number)|zero]]. The Sanskrit translation of the lost 5th century Prakrit  [[Jain cosmology|Jaina cosmological]] text ''[[Lokavibhaga]]''
may preserve an early instance of positional use of zero.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, G. The Universal History of Numbers: From prehistory to the invention of the computer. John Wiley and Sons Inc., 2000. Translated from the French by David Bellos, E.F. Harding, Sophie Wood and Ian Monk&lt;/ref&gt;

These Indian developments were taken up in [[Islamic mathematics]] in the 8th century, as recorded in [[al-Qifti]]'s ''Chronology of the scholars'' (early 13th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Qifti]]'s ''Chronology of the scholars'' (early 13th century):
: ''... a person from India presented himself before the [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] in the year 776 who was well versed in the siddhanta method of calculation related to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and having ways of calculating equations based on the half-chord [essentially the sine] calculated in half-degrees ...  Al-Mansur ordered this book to be translated into Arabic, and a work to be written, based on the translation, to give the Arabs a solid base for calculating the movements of the planets ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The numeral system came to be known to both the [[Persian literature|Persian]] mathematician [[Khwarizmi]], who wrote a book, ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' in about 825, and the [[Arab people|Arab]] mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, ''On the Use of the Hindu Numerals'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب في استعمال العداد الهندي}} [''kitāb fī isti'māl al-'adād al-hindī'']) around 830. These earlier texts did not use the Hindu numerals. [[Kushyar ibn Labban]] who wrote  ''Kitab fi usul hisab al-hind ([[Principles of Hindu Reckoning]])'' is one of the oldest surviving manuscripts using the Hindu numerals.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Levey and Marvin Petruck, Principles of Hindu Reckoning, translation of Kushyar ibn Labban Kitab fi usul hisab al-hind, p3, University of Wisconsin Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; These books are principally responsible for the diffusion of the Hindu system of numeration throughout the [[Islamic world]] and ultimately also to Europe.

The first dated and undisputed inscription showing the use of a symbol for zero appears on a stone inscription found at the [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Gwalior)|Chaturbhuja Temple]] at [[Gwalior]] in India, dated 876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/india-zero.html |title=All for Nought |work=Feature Column |author=[[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]] |publisher=AMS |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10th century  [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Islamic mathematics]], the system was extended to include [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], as recorded in a treatise by [[Abbasid Empire|Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in 952–953.&lt;ref name=Berggrenn&gt;{{cite book | first=J. Lennart | last=Berggren | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook | chapter=Mathematics in Medieval Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | page=518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption in Europe===
[[File:Nicolaus Kesler, about 1486.PNG|thumb|The bottom row shows the numeral glyphs as they appear in type in German [[incunabula]] (Nicolaus Kesler, [[Basel]], 1486)]]
{{main article|Arabic numerals}}

In Christian Europe, the first mention and representation of Hindu-Arabic numerals (from one to nine, without zero), is in the ''{{lang|la|[[Codex Vigilanus]]}}'', an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] compilation of various historical documents from the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period in [[Hispania|Spain]], written in the year 976 by three monks of the [[La Rioja (Spain)|Riojan]] monastery of [[San Martín de Albelda]].
Between 967 and 969, [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] discovered and studied Arab science in the Catalan abbeys. Later he obtained from these places the book ''{{lang|la|De multiplicatione et divisione}}'' (''On multiplication and division''). After becoming [[Pope Sylvester II]] in the year 999, he introduced a new model of [[abacus]], the so-called [[Pope Sylvester II#Abacus and Hindu–Arabic numerals|Abacus of Gerbert]], by adopting tokens representing Hindu-Arab numerals, from one to nine.

{{lang|it|[[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]]}} brought this system to Europe. His book ''{{lang|la|[[Liber Abaci]]}}'' introduced Arabic numerals, the use of zero, and the decimal place system to the Latin world. The numeral system came to be called "Arabic" by the Europeans. It was used in European mathematics from the 12th century, and entered common use from the 15th century to replace [[Roman numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halexandria.org/dward093.htm|title=Fibonacci Numbers|website=www.halexandria.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-4153/Leonardo-Pisano Leonardo Pisano – page 3: "Contributions to number theory"]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online, 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The familiar shape of the Western Arabic glyphs as now used with the Latin alphabet (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are the product of the late 15th to early 16th century, when they enter early [[typesetting]].
Muslim scientists used the [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian numeral system]], and merchants used the [[Abjad numerals]], a system similar to the [[Greek numerals|Greek numeral system]] and the [[Hebrew numerals|Hebrew numeral system]]. Similarly,  {{lang|it|Fibonacci}}'s introduction of the system to Europe was restricted to learned circles.
The credit for first establishing widespread understanding and usage of the decimal positional notation among the general population goes to {{lang|de|[[Adam Ries]]}}, an author of the [[German Renaissance]], whose 1522 ''{{lang|de|Rechenung auff der linihen und federn}}'' was targeted at the apprentices of businessmen and craftsmen.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Adoption in East Asia ===
In AD 690, [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] promulgated [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|Zetian characters]], one of which was "〇". The word is now used as a synonym for the number zero.

In [[China]], [[Gautama Siddha]] introduced Hindu numerals with zero in 718, but [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematicians]] did not find them useful, as they had already had the decimal positional [[counting rods]].&lt;ref name="qian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | publisher=Tōyō Shoten
 | place=Tokyo
 | year=1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese numerals, a circle (〇) is used to write zero in [[Suzhou numerals]].  Many historians think it was imported from [[Indian numerals]] by [[Gautama Siddha]] in 718, but some Chinese scholars think it was created from the Chinese text space filler "□".&lt;ref name="qian"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese and [[Japan]]ese finally adopted the Hindu–Arabic numerals in the 19th century, abandoning counting rods.

===Spread of the Western Arabic variant===

[[File:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|An Arab telephone keypad with both the Western "Arabic numerals" and the Arabic "Arabic–Indic numerals" variants.]]
The   "Western Arabic" numerals as they were in common use in Europe since the [[Baroque]] period have secondarily found worldwide use together with the [[Latin alphabet]], and even significantly beyond the contemporary [[spread of the Latin alphabet]], intruding into the writing systems in regions where other variants of the Hindu–Arabic numerals had been in use, but also in conjunction with [[Chinese script|Chinese]] and [[Japanese script|Japanese]] writing (see [[Chinese numerals]], [[Japanese numerals]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22753">In [[mathematics]], the '''incompressibility method''' is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] method like the [[probabilistic method]], the [[counting]] method or the [[pigeonhole principle]]. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is [[Incompressible string|incompressible]]. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by [[Computability theory|computable]] coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few [[bit]]s (are incompressible).

==History==
The incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] theory, named for [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&amp;jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=68&amp;option_lang=eng  A. N. Kolmogorov, "Three approaches to the definition of the concept 'quantity of information', ''Probl. Peredachi Inf.'', 1:1 (1965), 3–11]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity its theory of computation was to&lt;ref name="Pa"&gt;[http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Pa79.pdf W. J. Paul, "Kolmogorov's complexity and lower bounds", pp 325–333 in: L. Budach Ed., ''Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. Fund. Comput. Theory'', 1979.]&lt;/ref&gt; prove that the running time of a one-[[Punched tape|tape]] [[Turing machine]] is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and [[sorting algorithm]]s require at least &lt;math&gt;n \log n&lt;/math&gt; time to sort &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items. The first influential paper using the incompressibility method was published in 1980.&lt;ref name="PSS"&gt;[http://dlacm.org/citation.cfm?id=804685 W. J. Paul, J. I. Seiferas, J. Simon, "An information-theoretic approach to time bounds for on-line computation" (preliminary version), ''Proc. 12th  ACM Symp. Theory Comput (STOC)'', 357–367, 1980.]&lt;/ref&gt; The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.&lt;ref name="LV"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JvXiBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=vitanyi+Introduction M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Ccomplexity and Its Applications'', Springer, 1993, 1997, 2008, Chapter 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Kolmogorov complexity of an object, represented by a finite, binary string, is the length of the shortest binary program on a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]], [[Mathematical optimization|optimal]] [[universal Turing machine]]. Since the machine is fixed and the program concerned is the shortest, the Kolmogorov complexity is a definite positive [[Integer (computer science)|integer]]. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of the shortest binary program from which it can be computed. Therefore, it is a lower [[Upper and lower bounds|bound]] on the length of a computably-compressed version (in bits) of that object by any existing (or future) compression program.

==Applications==

===Number theory===
According to an [[Mathematical beauty|elegant]] [[Euclid]]ian proof, there is an infinite number of [[prime number]]s. [[Bernhard Riemann]] demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin]] proved in 1896 that this
number of primes is [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;n/\ln n&lt;/math&gt;; see [[Prime number theorem]] (use &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; for the natural logarithm an &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, [[G. J. Chaitin]] argued as follows:  Each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be described by its [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]] &lt;math&gt;n= p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_k^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; (which is unique), where &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots , p_k&lt;/math&gt; are the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; primes which are (at most) &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Exponentiation|exponents]] (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;, and can be described by &lt;math&gt; \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. The description of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be given in &lt;math&gt;k \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits, provided we know the value of &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; (enabling one to [[Parsing|parse]] the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; requires only &lt;math&gt;\log \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of binary length &lt;math&gt;l\approx \log n&lt;/math&gt; which cannot be described in fewer than &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; bits. This shows that the number of primes, &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt;  less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac{\log n}{\log \log n} -o(1).
&lt;/math&gt;

A more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n/p_k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is the largest prime number dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;. To parse the first block of the description &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be given in prefix form &lt;math&gt;P(k)=\log k +\log \log k +\log \varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\log p_k \leq P(k)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;p_k \leq n_k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n_k=\varepsilon(k)k\log k&lt;/math&gt; for a special sequence of values &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2,  \ldots &lt;/math&gt;. This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac n {\varepsilon(n)\log n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Both proofs are presented in more detail.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Graph theory===
A [[labeled graph]] &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes can be represented by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. &lt;math&gt;K(G) \geq {n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of each vertex satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
|d-n/2| = O\left(\sqrt{n \log n}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; below &lt;math&gt;K(G)&lt;/math&gt;; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sim \frac{2^{n \choose 2}}{n!}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539797327805  H. M. Buhrman, M. Li, J. T. Tromp, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Kolmogorov random graphs and the incompressibility method", ''SIAM J. Comput.'', 29:2(1999), 590–599.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorics===
A transitive [[tournament]] is a complete [[directed graph]], &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;(i,j),(j,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(i,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the set of all transitive tournaments on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes. Since a tournament is a labeled, directed [[complete graph]], it can be encoded by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits where each bit indicates the direction of the edge between the pair of nodes in that position. Using this encoding, every transitive tournament contains a transitive subtournament on (at least) &lt;math&gt;v(n)&lt;/math&gt; vertices with

:&lt;math&gt;
v(n) \leq 1+ \lfloor 2 \log n \rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

This was shown as the first problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/probabilistic-methods-in-combinatorics  P. Erdos, J. Spencer, ''Probabilistic methods in combinatorics'', Academic Press, 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is easily solved by the incompressibility method,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316594900647 M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi,  "Kolmogorov complexity arguments in combinatorics", ''J. Combinatorial Theory'', Series A, 66:2(1994), 226–236.]&lt;/ref&gt; as are the coin-weighing problem, the number of covering families and expected properties; for example, at least a fraction of &lt;math&gt;1-1/n&lt;/math&gt; of all transitive tournaments on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices have transitive subtournaments on not more than &lt;math&gt;1+2\lceil2 \log n \rceil&lt;/math&gt; vertices. &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large enough.

If a number of events are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] (in [[probability theory]]) of one another, the probability that none of the events occur can be easily calculated. If the events are dependent, the problem becomes difficult. [[Lovász local lemma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/scans/LocalLem.pdf P. Erdős, L. Lovász, "Problems and results on 3-chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions", in A. Hajnal, R. Rado, and V. T. Sós, eds. ''Infinite and Finite Sets (to Paul Erdős on his 60th birthday)''. North-Holland. pp. 609–627.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a principle that if events are mostly independent of one another and have an individually-small probability, there is a positive probability that none of them will occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1667060  R. A. Moser, G. Tardos, "A constructive proof of the general lovász local lemma", ''Journal of the ACM (JACM)'', 2:57(2010), 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was proven by the incompressibility method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?updated-min=2008-12-31T21:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max, L. Fortnow, "A Kolmogorov Complexity Proof of the Lovász Local Lemma", ''Computational Complexity Weblog'', 2 June 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the incompressibility method, several versions of [[Expander graph|expanders]] and superconcentrator graphs were shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2418%28200008%2917:1%3C64::AID-RSA5%3E3.0.CO;2-3/abstract U. Schoning, "Construction of expanders and superconcentrators using Kolmogorov complexity", ''Random Structures &amp; Algorithms'', 17:1(2000), 64–77.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topological combinatorics===

In the [[Heilbronn triangle problem]], throw &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in the unit square and determine the maximum of the minimal area of a triangle formed by three of the points over all possible arrangements. This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The original conjecture of [[Heilbronn]] was &lt;math&gt;O(1/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; during the early 1950s. [[Paul Erdős]] proved that this bound is correct for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound &lt;math&gt;\Omega((\log n)/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; (achievable; hence, [[Heilbronn]]'s conjecture is not correct for general &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and upper bound &lt;math&gt;\exp(c \sqrt{\log n})/n^{8/7}&lt;/math&gt; (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n^3)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rsa.10024/abstract  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M.

Borel]]) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01192146#page-2 M. Li, P. M. B.

==={{anchor|Turing machines time complexity}}Turing-machine time complexity===
The basic Turing machine, as conceived by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.

In 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the [[Best, worst and average case|worst case]]. In 1977, W. J. Paul&lt;ref name="Pa"/&gt; presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; time is required in the average case. For every integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accept state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a [[Crossing sequence (Turing machines)|crossing sequence]] of length &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; (with a total computation time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;), or some position has a crossing sequence of &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt;. In the latter case, the word (if it is a [[palindrome]]) can be identified by that crossing sequence.

If other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindome [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenated]] with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] described by &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt; bits is a contradiction.

Since the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case [[Time complexity|running time]]. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; work tapes are more powerful than those with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; work tapes in [[real-time computing|real time]] (here one symbol per step).&lt;ref name="PSS"/&gt;

In 1984, W. Maass&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1985-292-02/S0002-9947-1985-0808746-4/ W. Maass, "Combinatorial lower bound arguments for deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines", ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 292 (1985), 675–693.]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. Li and  P. M. B. Vitanyi &lt;ref name="LVa"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089054018890003X M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Tape versus queue and stacks: The lower bounds", ''Information and Computation'', 78:1(1988), 56–85.]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministically]] (optimally, solving a 30-year [[open problem]]) and &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt; time nondeterministically &lt;ref name = "LVa"/&gt; (in,&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt; this is &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log^2 n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt;. More results concerning tapes, [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] and [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]], deterministically and nondeterministically,&lt;ref name="LVa"/&gt; were proven with the incompressibiity method.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Theory of computation===
[[Heapsort]] is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by [[R. W. Floyd]], which always runs in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; that Williams' method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;2n \log n +O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time and Floyd's method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;n\log n+O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. The proof was suggested by [[Ian Munro (computer scientist)|Ian Munro]].

[[Shellsort]], discovered by [[Donald Shell]] in 1959, is a [[comparison sort]] which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of keys to be sorted, on the number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass Shellsort&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Computer-Programming-Searching/dp/0201896850 D. E. Knuth, ''Sorting and Searching'' (Vol. 3 ''The Art of Computer Programming''), 2nd Ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998, pp 83–95.]&lt;/ref&gt; and an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;O(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9608105 S. Janson, D. E. Knuth, "Shellsort with three increments", ''Random Structures Algorithms'' 10:1–2(1997), 125–142.]&lt;/ref&gt; for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass Shellsort was given&lt;ref name="JLV"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=355488  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "A lower bound on the average-case complexity of Shellsort", ''Journal of the ACM (JACM)'', 47:5(2000) 905–911.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are [[Logarithmic number system|logarithmically coded]] for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by &lt;math&gt;\Omega (pn^{1+1/p})&lt;/math&gt;. This was improved in &lt;ref&gt;P.M.B. Vitanyi (2018), On the average-case complexity of Shellsort, Random Structures and Algorithms, 52:2, 354--363&lt;/ref&gt; to a lower bound of 
:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega \left( n\sum_{k=1}^p h_{k-1}/h_k \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h_0=n&lt;/math&gt;. This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;
the Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; inversions.

Another example is as follows. &lt;math&gt;n,r,s&lt;/math&gt; are natural numbers and &lt;math&gt;2 \log n \leq r,s \leq n/4&lt;/math&gt;, it was shown that for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[Logical matrix|Boolean]] &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix; every &lt;math&gt;s \times (n-r)&lt;/math&gt; submatrix has a [[Matrix rank|rank]] at least &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; by the incompressibility method.

===Logic===
According to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain [[Peano arithmetic]], there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be described finitely (for example, in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; bits). In such a formal system, we can express &lt;math&gt;K(x) \geq |x|&lt;/math&gt; since it contains arithmetic. Given &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n\gg f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;K(y) \geq n&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, we obtain the first such string; &lt;math&gt;K(y) \leq \log n+f&lt;/math&gt;: contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Information-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer/dp/0521616042 G. J. Chaitin, ''Algorithmic Information Theory'', Cambridge University Press, 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other methods==
Although the [[probabilistic method]] generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of [[Shellsort]].&lt;ref name="JLV"/&gt;

In topology, a branch of mathematics, given a topological monoid ''X'' up to homotopy (in a nice way), an '''infinite loop space machine''' produces a [[group completion]] of ''X'' together with [[infinite loop space]] structure. For example, one can take ''X'' to be the [[classifying space]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] ''S''; that is, &lt;math&gt;X = BS&lt;/math&gt;. Then the machine produces the group completion &lt;math&gt;BS \to K(S)&lt;/math&gt;. The space &lt;math&gt;K(S)&lt;/math&gt; may be described by the [[K-theory spectrum]] of ''S''.

While at the University of Texas, she met geneticist [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Cold War Politics of Genetic Research: An Introduction to the Lysenko Affair|first=William|last=deJong-Lambert|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9789400728394|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzxvfRbIMbAC&amp;pg=PA12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1923. Their son [[David E. Muller|David]], who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the ''Drosophila'' laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period.&lt;ref name="gl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Muller|first1=H.

The marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County.&lt;ref name="gl"/&gt;

In 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago. Assisted by his wife, Carlos pursued experimental work necessary for his Ph.D. Jessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in 1940 the family moved to California, where they hoped she could recuperate. In 1942, her health had deteriorated and she was forced to enter a sanitarium, and was institutionalized at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="gl"/&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Knaster&amp;ndash;Kuratowski fan''' (named after Polish mathematicians [[Bronisław Knaster]] and [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]) is a specific [[connected space|connected]] [[topological space]] with the property that the removal of a single point makes it [[totally disconnected]]. It is also known as '''Cantor's leaky tent''' or '''Cantor's [[tipi|teepee]]''' (after [[Georg Cantor]]), depending on the presence or absence of the [[apex (geometry)|apex]].

Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Cantor set]], let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the point &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2})\in\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;L(c)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt;, denote the line segment connecting &lt;math&gt;(c,0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt; is an endpoint of an interval deleted in the Cantor set, let &lt;math&gt;X_{c} = \{ (x,y) \in L(c) : y \in \mathbb{Q} \}&lt;/math&gt;; for all other points in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;X_{c} = \{ (x,y) \in L(c) : y \notin \mathbb{Q} \}&lt;/math&gt;; the Knaster&amp;ndash;Kuratowski fan is defined as &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{c \in C} X_{c}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the subspace topology inherited from the standard topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The fan itself is connected, but becomes totally disconnected upon the removal of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2363">In [[geometry]], the '''link''' of a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of a 2-[[dimension]]al [[simplicial complex]] is a [[Graph theory|graph]] that encodes information about the local structure of the complex at the vertex.

It is a [[Graph theory|graph-theoretic]] analog to a sphere centered at a point.

==Definition==
[[File:Tetrahedron.svg|thumb|The [[tetrahedron]] is a 2-complex.]]
[[File:Graphe complet K3.png|thumb|The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is the triangle.]]
Let {{mvar|X}} be a simplicial complex. The '''link of a vertex''' {{mvar|v}} is the graph {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} constructed as follows. &amp;nbsp;The vertices of {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} are precisely the edges of {{mvar|X}} incident to {{mvar|v}}. &amp;nbsp;Two such edges are [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] in {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} [[iff]] they are [[Incidence (geometry)|incident]] to a common 2-cell at {{mvar|v}}.  

The graph {{math|Lk(''v'', ''X'')}} is often given the [[topology]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of small radius centred at {{mvar|v}}.

Similarly, for an [[abstract simplicial complex]] and a face {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|X}}, there is also a notion of the '''link of a face''' {{mvar|F}}, denoted {{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}}. &amp;nbsp;{{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}} is the set of faces {{mvar|G}} such that 
:&lt;math&gt;G\cap F=\emptyset\text{ and }G\cup F\in X&lt;/math&gt;. 
Because {{mvar|X}} is simplicial, there is a [[bijection|set isomorphism]] between {{math|Lk(''F'', ''X'')}} and 
:&lt;math&gt;X_F = \{G \in X\text{ such that }F \subset G\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is a triangle – the three vertices of the link corresponds to the three edges incident to the vertex, and the three edges of the link correspond to the faces incident to the vertex. In this example, the link can be visualized by cutting off the vertex with a plane; formally, intersecting the tetrahedron with a plane near the vertex – the resulting cross-section is the link.

'''Madhava's sine table''' is the [[table (information)|table]] of [[sine|trigonometric sines]] of various [[angle]]s constructed by the 14th century [[Kerala]] [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]]. The table lists the trigonometric sines of the twenty-four angles 3.75°, 7.50°, 11.25°, ..., and 90.00° (angles that are [[integer|integral]] [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3.75°, i.e. 1/24 of a right angle, beginning with 3.75 and ending with 90.00). The table is [[character encoding|encoded]] in the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] of [[Devanagari]] using the [[Katapayadi system]]. This gives the entries in the table an appearance of the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of a [[poem]] in [[Sanskrit]].

Madhava's original work containing the sine table has not yet been traced. The table is seen reproduced in the ''Aryabhatiyabhashya'' of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544) and also in the ''Yuktidipika/Laghuvivrti'' commentary of [[Tantrasamgraha]] by [[Sankara Variar]] (circa. 1500-1560).

==Values in Madhava's table==
[[Image:Madhavasine.jpeg|thumb|center|300px|Diagram explaining the meaning of the values in Madhava's table]]

To understand the meaning of the values tabulated by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]], consider some angle whose measure is A. Consider a [[circle]] of unit radius and center O. Let the arc PQ of the circle subtend an angle A at the center O. Drop the [[perpendicular]] QR from Q to OP; then the length of the line segment RQ is the  value of the trigonometric sine of the angle A. Let PS be an arc of the circle whose length is equal to the length of the segment RQ.  For various angles A, Madhava's  table gives the measures of the corresponding angles &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt;POS in [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]], [[arcsecond]]s and sixtieths of an [[arcsecond]].

As an example, let A be an angle whose measure is 22.50°. In Madhava's table, the entry corresponding to 22.50° is the measure in arcminutes, arcseconds and sixtieths of arcseconds of the angle whose radian measure is the modern value of sin 22.50°. The modern numerical value of sin 22.50° is 0.382683432363 and,

:0.382683432363 radians = 180 / &amp;pi; &amp;times; 0.382683432363 degrees = 21.926145564094 degrees.

and

:21.926145564094 degrees = 1315 arcminutes  34 arcseconds   07 sixtieths of arcsecond.

In the [[Katapayadi system]] the digits are written in the reverse order. Thus in Madhava's table, the entry corresponding to 22.50° is 70435131.

==Derivation of trigonometric sines from Madhava's table==

For an angle whose measure is  ''A'', let

:&lt;math&gt;\angle POS = m \text{ arcminutes,  } s \text{ arcseconds,  } t \text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin (A) &amp; = RQ \\
&amp; = \text{length of arc } PS \\
&amp; = \angle POS \text{ in radians}\\
&amp; = \frac{\pi}{180\times 60}\left( m + \frac{s}{60}+ \frac{t}{60\times 60}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the lines in the table specifies eight digits. Let the digits corresponding to angle A (read from left to right) be

:&lt;math&gt; d_1\quad d_2\quad d_3\quad d_4\quad d_5\quad d_6\quad d_7\quad d_8 &lt;/math&gt;

Then according to the rules of the [[Katapayadi system]] of Kerala mathematicians we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m &amp; = d_8\times 1000 + d_7\times 100 + d_6 \times 10 +d_5\\
s &amp; = d_4\times 10 + d_3\\
t &amp; = d_2\times 10 + d_1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Madhava's value of pi ==

To complete the numerical computations one must have a knowledge of the value of [[pi]](&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;). It is appropriate that we use the value of [[pi|&amp;pi;]] computed by Madhava himself. [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] has given this value of π in his [[Āryabhaṭīya]]-Bhashya as follows:&lt;ref name="Raju"/&gt;

[[Image:Madhava value of pi.JPG|thumb|center|400px|Madhava's value of pi]]

A transliteration of the last two lines:

&lt;poem&gt;
     vibudha-netra-gaja-ahi-hutāśana
     tri-guṇa-veda-bha-vāraṇa-bāhavaḥ
     nava-nikharva-mite vr̥tivistare
     paridhi-mānam idaṁ jagadur budhāḥ
&lt;/poem&gt;

The various words indicate certain numbers encoded in a scheme known as the [[bhūtasaṃkhyā system]]. The meaning of the words and the numbers encoded by them (beginning with the units place) are detailed in the following translation of the verse: 
"Gods (vibudha : 33), eyes (netra : 2), elephants (gaja : 8), snakes (ahi : 8), fires (hutāśana : 3), three (tri : 3), qualities (guṇa : 3), vedas (veda : 4), nakṣatras (bha : 27), elephants (vāraṇa : 8), and arms (bāhavaḥ : 2) - the wise say that this is the measure of the circumference when the diameter of a circle is nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000)."

So, the translation of the poem using the [[bhūtasaṃkhyā system]] will simply read  "2827433388233 is, as the wise say, the circumference of a circle whose diameter is nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000)". That is, divide 2827433388233 (the number from the first two lines of the poem in reverse order) by nava-nikharva (900,000,000,000) to get the value of pi(π). This calculation yields the value π = 3.1415926535922. This is the value of π used by Madhava in his further calculations and is accurate to 11 decimal places.

==Example==

Madhava's table lists the following digits corresponding to the angle 45.00°:

:&lt;math&gt;5\quad 1\quad 1\quad 5\quad 0\quad 3\quad 4\quad 2&lt;/math&gt;

This yields the angle with measure

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m &amp; = 2\times 1000 + 4\times 100 + 3\times 10 + 0 \text{ arcminutes}\\
  &amp; = 2430 \text{ arcminutes} \\
s &amp; = 5\times 10 + 1 \text{ arcseconds}\\
  &amp; = 51 \text{ arcseconds}\\
t &amp; = 1\times 10 + 5 \text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}\\
  &amp; = 15 \text{ sixtieths of an arcsecond}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The value of the trigonometric sine of 45.00° as given in Madhava's table is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180\times 60}\left( 2430 + \frac{51}{60} + \frac{15}{60\times 60}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the value of π computed by Madhava in the above expression, one gets sin 45° as 0.70710681.

This value may be compared with the modern exact value of sin 45.00°, namely, 0.70710678.

== Comparison of Madhava's and modern sine values ==
In table below the first column contains the list of the twenty-four angles beginning with 3.75 and ending with 90.00. The second column contains the values tabulated by Madhava in [[Devanagari]] in the form in which it was given by Madhava. (These are taken from ''Malayalam Commentary of [[Karanapaddhati]]'' by P.K. Koru&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Puthumana Somayaji]]|title=[[Karanapaddhati]] (with a commentary in [[Malayalam]] by P.K. Koru)|publisher=Astro Printing and Publishing Company|location= [[Cherpu]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]}} (Published in 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; and are slightly different from the table given in ''Cultural foundations of mathematics'' by C.K. Raju.&lt;ref name="Raju"/&gt;)  The third column contains [[ISO 15919|ISO 15919 transliterations]] of the lines given in the second column. The digits encoded by the lines in second column are given in [[Arabic numeral]]s in the fourth column. The values of the trigonometric sines derived from the numbers specified in Madhava's table are listed in the fifth column. These values are  computed using the approximate value 3.1415926535922 for π obtained by Madhava. For comparison, the exact values of the trigonometric sines of the angles are given in the sixth column.

==Madhava's method of computation==

No work of Madhava detailing the methods used by him for the computation of the sine table has survived. However  from the writings of later Kerala mathematicians like [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] ([[Tantrasangraha]]) and  [[Jyeshtadeva]] ([[Yuktibhāṣā]]) that give ample references to Madhava's accomplishments, it is conjectured that Madhava computed his sine table using the power series  expansion of sin ''x''.

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4214">In mathematics, the '''method of dominant balance''' is used to determine the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an [[ordinary differential equation]] without fully solving the equation. The process is iterative, in that the result obtained by performing the method once can be used as input when the method is repeated, to obtain as many terms in the [[asymptotic expansion]] as desired.&lt;ref&gt;

# Assume that the asymptotic behavior has the form

# Make an informed guess as to which terms in the ODE might be negligible in the limit of interest.
# Drop these terms and solve the resulting simpler ODE.
# Check that the solution is consistent with step 2. If this is the case, then one has the controlling factor of the asymptotic behavior; otherwise, one needs try dropping different terms in step 2, instead.
# Repeat the process to higher orders, relying on the above result as the leading term in the solution.

==Example==
For arbitrary constants  {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|a}}, consider  
::&lt;math&gt;xy''+(c-x)y'-ay=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation cannot be solved exactly. However, it is useful to consider how the solutions behave for large {{mvar|x}}: it turns out that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; behaves like &lt;math&gt;e^x\,&lt;/math&gt; as ''x'' → ∞ . 

More rigorously, we will have &lt;math&gt;\log(y)\sim {x}&lt;/math&gt;, not &lt;math&gt;y\sim e^{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since we are interested in the behavior of {{mvar|y}} in the large {{mvar|x}} limit, we change variables to  {{mvar|y}} = exp(''S''(''x'')), and re-express the ODE in terms of ''S''(''x''),
::&lt;math&gt;xS''+xS'^2+(c-x)S'-a=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
or
::&lt;math&gt;S''+S'^2+\left(\frac{c}{x}-1\right)S'-\frac{a}{x}=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]] to evaluate  the derivatives of {{mvar|y}}.

Now  ''suppose'' first that a solution to this ODE satisfies 
::&lt;math&gt;S'^2\sim S',&lt;/math&gt; 
as  ''x'' → ∞, so that   
::&lt;math&gt;S'',~\frac{c}{x}S',~\frac{a}{x}=o(S'^2),~o(S')\,&lt;/math&gt;  
as  ''x'' → ∞.  Obtain then the dominant asymptotic behaviour by setting
::&lt;math&gt;S_0'^2=S_0'.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the above asymptotic conditions, then the above assumption is consistent. The terms we dropped will have been negligible with respect to the ones we kept. 

&lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a solution to the ODE for {{mvar|S}}, but it represents ''the dominant asymptotic behavior'', which is what we are interested in. Check that this choice for &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is consistent,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
             S_0' &amp;= 1 \\
           S_0'^2 &amp;= 1 \\
            S_0'' &amp;= 0 = o(S_0') \\
  \frac{c}{x}S_0' &amp;= \frac{c}{x} = o(S_0') \\
      \frac{a}{x} &amp;= o(S_0')
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Everything is indeed consistent. 

Thus the dominant asymptotic behaviour of a solution to our ODE has been found,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      S_0 &amp;\sim x \\
  \log(y) &amp;\sim x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By convention, the full asymptotic series is written as

::&lt;math&gt;y\sim Ax^p e^{\lambda x^r}\left(1 + \frac{u_1}{x} + \frac{u_2}{x^2} + \cdots + \frac{u_k}{x^k} + o\left(\frac{1}{x^k}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

so to get at least the first term of this series we have to  take a further step to see if there is a power of {{mvar|x}} out the front.

Proceed by  introducing a new subleading dependent variable,

::&lt;math&gt;S(x)\equiv S_0(x)+C(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and then seek asymptotic solutions for ''C''(''x''). Substituting into the above ODE for ''S''(''x'') we find
::&lt;math&gt;C''+C'^2+C'+\frac{c}{x}C'+\frac{c-a}{x}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Repeating the same process as before, we keep {{math|''C' ''}} and {{math|(''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'')/''x''}} to find that

::&lt;math&gt;C_0=\log x^{a-c}.&lt;/math&gt;

The leading asymptotic behaviour is then

::&lt;math&gt;y\sim x^{a-c}e^x. &lt;/math&gt;

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], a '''moment measure''' is a [[mathematical]] quantity, [[Function (mathematics)|function]] or, more precisely, [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  that is defined in relation to [[mathematical objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are types of [[stochastic processes]] often used as [[mathematical model]]s of physical phenomena representable as [[random]]ly positioned [[Point (geometry)|points]] in [[time]], [[space]] or both. Moment measures generalize the idea of (raw) [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] of [[random variable]]s, hence arise often in the study of point processes and related fields.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"&gt;D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones. ''An introduction to the theory of point processes. Vol. {II''}. Probability and its Applications (New York). Springer, New York, second edition, 2008.

&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a moment measure is the '''first moment measure''' of a point process, often called '''mean measure''' or '''intensity measure''', which gives the [[Expected value|expected]] or average number of points of the point process being located in some region of space.&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Błaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume I – Theory'', volume 3, No 3-4 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, if the number of points of a point process located in some region of space is a random variable, then the first moment measure corresponds to the first moment of this random variable.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', volume 2. Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point process notation==
{{Main|Point process notation}}

Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying [[mathematical space]]. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in physical space, time or both, the underlying space is usually ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ d}&lt;/math&gt;, but they can be defined on more [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] mathematical spaces.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"/&gt;

Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of [[point process notation]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"/&gt;  For example, if a point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;, then this can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in {N},&lt;/math&gt;

and represents the point process being interpreted as a random [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Alternatively, the number of points of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is often written as:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B), &lt;/math&gt;

which reflects a [[random measure]] interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably.&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

==Definitions==

===''n''-th power of a point process===

For some [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th power of a point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {N}^n(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)= \prod_{i=1}^n{N}(B_i) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B_1,...,B_n&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of not necessarily disjoint Borel sets (in  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ d}&lt;/math&gt;), which form a &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-fold [[Cartesian product]] of sets denoted by &lt;math&gt; B_1\times\cdots\times B_n&lt;/math&gt;. The symbol  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Pi&lt;/math&gt; denotes standard [[multiplication#Capital Pi notation|multiplication]].

The notation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B_i)&lt;/math&gt; reflects the interpretation of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; as a random measure.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

The   &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th power of a point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; can be equivalently defined as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {N}^{n}(B_1\times\cdots\times B_n)= \sum_{(x_1,\dots, x_n)\in {N} } \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{B_i}(x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

where  [[summation]] is performed over all &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuples]] of (possibly repeating) points, and  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes an [[indicator function]] such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{1}_{B_1} &lt;/math&gt;is a [[Dirac measure]]. This definition can be contrasted with the definition of the [[Factorial moment measure#n-th factorial power of a point process|''n''-factorial power of a point process]] for which each ''n''-[[tuples]] consists of ''n'' points.

===''n''-th moment measure===

The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th moment measure is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; M^n(B_1\times\ldots\times B_n)=E [{N}^n(B_1\times\ldots\times B_n)], &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''E'' denotes the [[Expected value|expectation]] ([[Operator (mathematics)#Probability theory|operator]]) of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the ''n''-th moment measure is the expectation of the ''n''-th power of some point process.

The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n\,&lt;/math&gt;th moment measure of a point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalently defined&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{R}^{n d}}f(x_1,\dots,x_n)  M^n(dx_1,\dots,dx_n)=E \left[ \sum_{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in {N} } f(x_1,\dots,x_n)   \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is any [[non-negative]] [[measurable function]] on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{n d}&lt;/math&gt; and the sum is over &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuple]]s of points for which repetition is allowed.

===First moment measure===

For some Borel set ''B'', the first moment of a point process ''N'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; M^1(B)=E [{N}(B)], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M^1&lt;/math&gt; is known, among other terms, as the ''intensity measure''&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; or ''mean measure'',&lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"&gt;J. F. C. Kingman. ''Poisson processes'', volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.

&lt;/ref&gt; and is interpreted as the expected or average number of points of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; found or located in the set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;.

===Second moment measure===

The second moment measure for two Borel sets &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; M^2(A\times B)=E [{N}(A){N}(B)], &lt;/math&gt;

which for a single Borel set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt; M^2(B\times B)=(E [{N}(B)])^2+\text{Var}[{N}(B)], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \text{Var}[{N}(B)]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[variance]] of the random variable &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The previous variance term alludes to how moments measures, like moments of random variables, can be used to calculate quantities like the variance of point processes. A further example is the [[covariance]] of a point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; for two Borel sets &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Cov}[{N}(A),{N}(B)]=M^2(A\times B)-M^1(A)M^1(B) &lt;/math&gt;

==Example: Poisson point process==

For a general [[Poisson point process]] with intensity measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the first moment measure is:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^1(B)=\Lambda(B), &lt;/math&gt;

which for a [[homogeneous Poisson point process]] with [[Mathematical constant|constant]] intensity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lambda&lt;/math&gt; means:

:&lt;math&gt; M^1(B)=\lambda|B|, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |B|&lt;/math&gt; is the length, area or volume (or more generally, the [[Lebesgue measure]]) of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;.

For the Poisson case with measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the second moment measure defined on the product set &lt;math&gt;(B \times B)&lt;/math&gt; is:&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M^2(B \times B)=\Lambda(B)+\Lambda(B)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

which in the homogeneous case reduces to

:&lt;math&gt; M^2(B \times B)=\lambda|B|+(\lambda|B|)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Multiple description coding (MDC)''' is a [[Channel coding|coding]] technique that fragments a single [[Streaming media|media stream]] into ''n'' substreams (''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2) referred to as descriptions. The [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] of each description are routed over multiple, (partially) disjoint paths. In order to decode the media stream, any description can be used, however, the quality improves with the number of descriptions received in parallel. The idea of MDC is to provide error resilience to media streams. Since an arbitrary subset of descriptions can be used to decode the original stream, [[network congestion]] or packet loss — which are common in [[best-effort network]]s such as the [[Internet]] — will not interrupt the stream but only cause a (temporary) loss of quality. The quality of a stream can be expected to be roughly proportional to data rate sustained by the receiver.

MDC is a form of data partitioning, thus comparable to layered coding as it is used in [[MPEG-2]] and [[MPEG-4]]. Yet, in contrast to MDC, layered coding mechanisms generate a base layer and n enhancement layers. The base layer is necessary for the media stream to be decoded, enhancement layers are applied to improve stream quality. However, the first enhancement layer depends on the base layer and each enhancement layer ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 depends on its subordinate layer&amp;nbsp;''n'', thus can only be applied if ''n'' was already applied. Hence, media streams using the layered approach are interrupted whenever the base layer is missing and, as a consequence, the data of the respective enhancement layers is rendered useless. The same applies for missing enhancement layers. In general, this implies that in lossy networks the quality of a media stream is not proportional to the amount of correctly received data.

Besides increased fault tolerance, MDC allows for rate-adaptive streaming: Content providers send all descriptions of a stream without paying attention to the download limitations of clients. Receivers that cannot sustain the data rate only subscribe to a subset of these streams, thus freeing the content provider from sending additional streams at lower data rates.

The vast majority of state-of-the art [[codec]]s uses single description (SD) video coding. This approach does not partition any data at all. Despite the aforementioned advantages of MDC, SD codecs are still predominant. The reasons are probably the comparingly high complexity of codec development, the loss of some compression efficiency as well as the caused transmission overhead.

Though MDC has its practical roots in media communication, it is widely researched in the area of [[information theory]].

In [[physics]], the '''no-communication theorem''' or '''no-signaling principle''' is a [[no-go theorem]] from [[quantum information theory]] which states that, during measurement of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled quantum state]], it is not possible for one observer, by making a measurement of a subsystem of the total state, to communicate information to another observer. The theorem is important because, in [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum entanglement]] is an effect by which certain widely separated events can be correlated in ways that suggest the possibility of instantaneous communication. The no-communication theorem gives conditions under which such transfer of information between two observers is impossible.  These results can be applied to understand the so-called paradoxes in [[quantum mechanics]], such as the [[EPR paradox]], or violations of [[local realism]] obtained in tests of [[Bell's theorem]]. In these experiments, the no-communication theorem shows that failure of local realism does not lead to what could be referred to as "spooky communication at a distance" (in analogy with Einstein's labeling of [[quantum entanglement]] as "spooky action at a distance").

==Informal overview==
The no-communication theorem states that, within the context of quantum mechanics, it is not possible to transmit classical bits of information by means of carefully prepared [[mixed state (physics)|mixed]] or [[pure state]]s, whether [[entangled state|entangled]] or not. The theorem disallows all communication, not just faster-than-light communication, by means of shared quantum states.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The theorem disallows not only the communication of whole bits, but even fractions of a bit. This is important to take note of, as there are many classical radio communications encoding techniques that can send arbitrarily small fractions of a bit across arbitrarily narrow, noisy [[communications channel]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In particular, one may imagine that there is some [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] that can be prepared, with small portions of the ensemble communicating a fraction of a bit; this, too, is not possible.

The theorem is built on the basic presumption that the laws of quantum mechanics hold. Similar theorems may or may not hold for other related theories,&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, D. Rohrlich (1997) "Causality and Nonlocality as Axioms for Quantum Mechanics", ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Causality and Locality in Modern Physics and Astronomy'' (York University, Toronto, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[hidden variable theory|hidden variable theories]]. The no-communication theorem is not meant to constrain other, non-quantum-mechanical theories.

The basic assumption entering into the theorem is that a quantum-mechanical system is prepared in an initial state, and that this initial state is describable as a mixed or pure state in a [[Hilbert space]] ''H''.  The system then evolves over time in such a way that there are two spatially distinct parts, ''A'' and ''B'', sent to two distinct observers, [[Alice and Bob]], who are free to perform quantum mechanical measurements on their portion of the total system (viz, A and B).  The question is: is there any action that Alice can perform that would be detectable by Bob? The theorem replies 'no'.

An important assumption going into the theorem is that neither Alice nor Bob is allowed, in any way, to affect the preparation of the initial state. If Alice were allowed to take part in the preparation of the initial state, it would be trivially easy for her to encode a message into it; thus neither Alice nor Bob participates in the preparation of the initial state.  The theorem does not require that the initial state be somehow 'random' or 'balanced' or 'uniform': indeed, a third party preparing the initial state could easily encode messages in it, received by Alice and Bob. Simply, the theorem states that, given some initial state, prepared in some way, there is no action that Alice can take that would be detectable by Bob.

The proof proceeds by defining how the total Hilbert space ''H'' can be split into two parts, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, describing the subspaces accessible to Alice and Bob. The total state of the system is assumed to be described by a [[density matrix]] σ. This appears to be a reasonable assumption, as a density matrix is sufficient to describe both pure and mixed states in quantum mechanics.  Another important part of the theorem is that measurement is performed by applying a generalized [[projection operator]] ''P'' to the state σ.  This again is reasonable, as projection operators give the appropriate mathematical description of  [[quantum measurement]]s.  After a measurement by Alice, the state of the total system is said to have ''[[wave-function collapse|collapsed]]'' to a state ''P''(σ).

The goal of the theorem is to prove that Bob cannot in any way distinguish the pre-measurement state σ from the post-measurement state ''P''(σ).  This is accomplished mathematically by comparing the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of σ and the trace of ''P''(σ), with the trace being taken over the subspace ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the trace is only over a subspace, it is technically called a [[partial trace]]. Key to this step is the assumption that the (partial) trace adequately summarizes the system from Bob's point of view. That is, everything that Bob has access to, or could ever have access to, measure, or detect, is completely described by a partial trace over ''H''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of the system σ.  Again, this is a reasonable assumption, as it is a part of standard quantum mechanics.  The fact that this trace never changes as Alice performs her measurements is the conclusion of the proof of the no-communication theorem.

== Formulation ==
The proof of the theorem is commonly illustrated for the setup of [[Bell test]]s in which two observers [[Alice and Bob]] perform local observations on a common bipartite system, and uses the statistical machinery of quantum mechanics, namely [[density state]]s  and [[quantum operation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Peres, A. and Terno, D. |title=Quantum Information and Relativity Theory |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=76 |pages=93–123 |year=2004 |arxiv=quant-ph/0212023|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.76.93|bibcode = 2004RvMP...76...93P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice and Bob perform measurements on system '''S''' whose underlying [[Hilbert space]] is

:&lt;math&gt;  H = H_A \otimes H_B. &lt;/math&gt;

It is also assumed that everything is finite-dimensional to avoid convergence issues.  The state of the composite system is given by a density operator on ''H''.  Any [[density operator]] σ on ''H'' is a sum of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma = \sum_i T_i \otimes S_i &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and  ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are operators on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. For the following, it is not required to assume that ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and  ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''  are state projection operators: ''i.e.'' they need not necessarily be non-negative, nor have a trace of one. That is, σ can have a definition somewhat broader than that of a density matrix; the theorem still holds. Note that the theorem holds trivially for [[separable state]]s. If the shared state σ is separable, it is clear that any local operation by Alice will leave Bob's system intact. Thus the point of the theorem is no communication can be achieved via a shared entangled state.

Alice performs a local measurement on her subsystem. In general, this is described by a quantum operation, on the system state, of the following kind

:&lt;math&gt; P(\sigma) = \sum_k (V_k \otimes I_{H_B})^* \ \sigma \ (V_k \otimes I_{H_B}), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are called [[completely positive map|Kraus matrices]] which satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_k V_k V_k^* = I_{H_A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The term

:&lt;math&gt;I_{H_B}&lt;/math&gt;

from the expression

:&lt;math&gt;(V_k \otimes I_{H_B})&lt;/math&gt;

means that Alice's measurement apparatus does not interact with Bob's subsystem.

Supposing the combined system is prepared in state σ and assuming, for purposes of argument, a non-relativistic situation, immediately (with no time delay) after Alice performs her measurement, the relative state of Bob's system is given by the [[partial trace]] of the overall state with respect to Alice's system. In symbols, the relative state of Bob's system after Alice's operation is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(P(\sigma))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}_{H_A}&lt;/math&gt; is the partial trace mapping with respect to Alice's system.

One can directly calculate this state:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(P(\sigma)) = \operatorname{tr}_{H_A} \left(\sum_k (V_k \otimes I_{H_B})^* \sigma (V_k \otimes I_{H_B} )\right) &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt; = \operatorname{tr}_{H_A} \left(\sum_k \sum_i V_k^* T_i V_k \otimes S_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:::: &lt;math&gt; = \sum_i \sum_k \operatorname{tr}(V_k^* T_i V_k) S_i &lt;/math&gt;

:::: &lt;math&gt; = \sum_i \sum_k \operatorname{tr}(T_i V_k V_k^*) S_i &lt;/math&gt;

::::  &lt;math&gt;  = \sum_i \operatorname{tr}\left(T_i \sum_k V_k V_k^*\right) S_i &lt;/math&gt;

:::: &lt;math&gt; = \sum_i \operatorname{tr}(T_i)  S_i &lt;/math&gt;

:::: &lt;math&gt; =  \operatorname{tr}_{H_A}(\sigma). &lt;/math&gt;

From this it is argued that, statistically, Bob cannot tell the difference between what Alice did and a random measurement (or whether she did anything at all).

== Some comments ==

*If the density operator &lt;math&gt;P(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to evolve under the influence of non-local interactions between A and B, then in general the calculation in the proof no longer holds, unless suitable commutation relations are assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Peacock |first1=K.A. |last2=Hepburn |first2=B. |title=Begging the Signaling Question: Quantum Signaling and the Dynamics of Multiparticle Systems |booktitle= Proceedings of the Meeting of the Society of Exact Philosophy |year= 1999 | arxiv=quant-ph/9906036|bibcode=1999quant.ph..6036P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The no-communication theorem thus says shared entanglement alone cannot be used to transmit any information. Compare this with the [[no-teleportation theorem]], which states a [[classical information channel]] cannot transmit quantum information. (By ''transmit'', we mean transmission with full fidelity.) However, [[quantum teleportation]] schemes utilize both resources to achieve what is impossible for either alone.
* The no-communication theorem implies the [[no-cloning theorem]], which states that quantum states cannot be (perfectly) copied.  That is, cloning is a sufficient condition for the communication of classical information to occur.   To see this, suppose that quantum states could be cloned. Assume parts of a [[Maximally entangled state|maximally entangled]] [[Bell state]] are distributed to Alice and Bob. Alice could send bits to Bob in the following way: If Alice wishes to transmit a "0", she measures the spin of her electron in the '''z''' direction, collapsing Bob's state to either &lt;math&gt;|z+\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|z-\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;.  To transmit "1", Alice does nothing to her [[qubit]]. Bob creates many copies of his electron's state, and measures the spin of each copy in the '''z''' direction. Bob will know that Alice has transmitted a "0" if all his measurements will produce the same result; otherwise, his measurements will have outcomes &lt;math&gt;|z+\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|z-\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt; with equal probability. This would allow Alice and Bob to communicate classical bits between each other (possibly across [[space-like]] separations, violating [[causality]]).
* The version of the no-communication theorem discussed in this article assumes that the quantum system shared by Alice and Bob is a composite system, i.e. that its underlying Hilbert space is a tensor product whose first factor describes the part of the system that Alice can interact with and whose second factor describes the part of the system that Bob can interact with. In [[quantum field theory]], this assumption can be replaced by the assumption that Alice and Bob are [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|spacelike separated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Eberhard |first1=Phillippe H. |last2=Ross |first2=Ronald R.|title=Quantum field theory cannot provide faster than light communication |year= 1989 | journal=Foundations of Physics Letters | volume=2 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/bf00696109|bibcode=1989FoPhL...2..127E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This alternate version of the no-communication theorem shows that [[faster-than-light communication]] cannot be achieved using processes which obey the rules of quantum field theory.
* The proof of the no-communication theorem assumes that all measurable properties of Bob's system can be calculated from its reduced density matrix.  This assumption is true assuming the [[Born rule]] for calculating the probability of making various measurements.  However, modifying the Born rule generally results in theories with physically measurable quantities that cannot be captured by a reduced density matrix, and that therefore allow faster-than-light signalling.&lt;ref&gt;Zurek, Wojciech Hubert.

'''Quantum programming''' is the process of [[Assembly language|assembling]] sequences of instructions, called quantum programs, that are capable of running on a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]]. Quantum [[programming language]]s help express [[quantum algorithm]]s using high-level constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Jarosław Adam Miszczak |title= High-level Structures in Quantum Computing | isbn=9781608458516|year= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quantum programming languages ==
There are two main groups of quantum programming languages: imperative quantum programming languages and functional quantum programming languages.

=== Imperative languages ===
The most prominent representatives of the imperative languages are QCL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bernhard Omer |title=The QCL Programming Language |url=http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; LanQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hynek Mlnařík |title=LanQ – a quantum imperative programming language |url=http://lanq.sourceforge.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Q|SI&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== QCL ====
{{main|Quantum Computation Language}}
[[Quantum Computation Language]] (QCL) is one of the first implemented quantum [[programming languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html |title=QCL - A Programming Language for Quantum Computers |website=tuwien.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important feature of QCL is the support for user-defined operators and functions. Its [[syntax]] resembles the syntax of the [[C programming language]] and its classical [[data type]]s are similar to primitive data types in C. One can combine classical code and quantum code in the same program.

==== Quantum pseudocode ====
Quantum pseudocode proposed by E. Knill is the first formalized language for description of [[quantum algorithm]]s.  It was introduced and, moreover, was tightly connected with a model of quantum machine called [[Quantum Random Access Machine]] (QRAM).

====Q|SI&gt;====
Q|SI&gt; is a platform embedded in [[.NET Framework|.Net]] language supporting quantum programming in a quantum extension of while-language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shusen|last2=Zhou|first2=li|last3=Guan|first3=Ji|last4=He|first4=Yang|last5=Duan|first5=Runyao|last6=Ying|first6=Mingsheng|date=2017-05-09|title=Q&amp;#124;SI&gt;: A Quantum Programming Language|journal=SCIENTIA Sinica Information|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1300|doi=10.1360/N112017-00095|arxiv=1710.09500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying|first=Mingsheng|date=January 2012|title=Floyd–hoare Logic for Quantum Programs|journal=ACM Trans.

Q Language is the second implemented imperative quantum programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sra.itc.it/people/serafini/qlang/ |title=Software for the Q language |date=2001-11-23 |accessdate=2017-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620011647/http://sra.itc.it/people/serafini/qlang/ |archivedate=2009-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Q Language was implemented as an extension of C++ programming language. It provides classes for basic quantum operations like QHadamard, QFourier, QNot, and QSwap, which are derived from the base class Qop.  New operators can be defined using C++ class mechanism.

Quantum memory is represented by class Qreg.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
Qreg x1; // 1-qubit quantum register with initial value 0
Qreg x2(2,0); // 2-qubit quantum register with initial value 0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The computation process is executed using a provided simulator. Noisy environments can be simulated using parameters of the simulator.

==== qGCL ====
Quantum Guarded Command Language (qGCL) was defined by P. Zuliani in his PhD thesis. It is based on [[Guarded Command Language]] created by [[Edsger Dijkstra]].

It can be described as a language of quantum programs specification.

==== QMASM ====
Quantum Macro Assembler (QMASM) is a low-level language specific to quantum annealers such as the D-Wave.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Pakin, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7761637/ "A Quantum Macro Assembler"], Proceedings of the 20th Annual IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference  2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Functional languages ===
Efforts are underway to develop [[functional programming languages]] for [[quantum computing]]. Functional programming languages are well-suited for reasoning about programs. Examples include Selinger's QPL,&lt;ref name="qpl"&gt;Peter Selinger, [http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers.html#qpl "Towards a quantum programming language"], Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 14(4):527-586, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell-like]] language QML by Altenkirch and Grattage.&lt;ref name="qml1"&gt;[http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~jjg/qml.html Jonathan Grattage: QML Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qml2"&gt;T. Altenkirch, V. Belavkin, J. Grattage, A. Green, A. Sabry, J. K. Vizzotto, [http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/qml QML: A Functional Quantum Programming Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710201728/http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/QML/ |date=2006-07-10 }} (website)&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-order quantum programming languages, based on [[lambda calculus]], have been proposed by van Tonder,&lt;ref&gt;Andre van Tonder, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S0097539703432165 "A Lambda Calculus for Quantum Computation"], SIAM J. Comput., 33(5), 1109–1135. (27 pages), 2004. Also available from [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307150 arXiv:quant-ph/0307150]&lt;/ref&gt; Selinger and Valiron&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selinger and Benoît Valiron, [http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/#qlambda "A lambda calculus for quantum computation with classical control"], Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 16(3):527-552, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Arrighi and Dowek.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Arrighi, Gilles Dowek, [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612199 "Linear-algebraic lambda-calculus: higher-order, encodings and confluence"], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== QFC and QPL ====
QFC and QPL are two closely related quantum programming languages defined by Peter Selinger. They differ only in their syntax: QFC uses a flow chart syntax, whereas QPL uses a textual syntax. These languages have classical control flow but can operate on quantum or classical data. Selinger gives a denotational semantics for these languages in a category of [[superoperator]]s.

==== QML ====
QML is a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like quantum programming language by Altenkirch and Grattage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230222/http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/QML/ | title=QML: A Functional Quantum Programming Language| date=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qml1"/&gt; Unlike Selinger's QPL, this language takes duplication, rather than discarding, of quantum information as a primitive operation. Duplication in this context is understood to be the operation that maps &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle\otimes|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and is not to be confused with the impossible operation of [[no cloning theorem|cloning]]; the authors claim it is akin to how sharing is modeled in classical languages. QML also introduces both classical and quantum control operators, whereas most other languages rely on classical control.

An [[operational semantics]] for QML is given in terms of [[quantum circuit]]s, while a [[denotational semantics]] is presented in terms of [[superoperator]]s, and these are shown to agree. Both the operational and denotational semantics have been implemented (classically) in Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Grattage, [http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/qml/compiler QML: A Functional Quantum Programming Language (compiler)], 2005–2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====  LIQUi|&gt; ====
LIQUi|&gt; (pronounced ''liquid'') is a quantum simulation extension on the [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stationq.github.io/Liquid/|title=The Language Integrated Quantum Operations Simulator |website=github.io |date=|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently being developed by the Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC)&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC), https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/quantum-architectures-and-computation-group-quarc/, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; part of the StationQ efforts at Microsoft Research. LIQUi|&gt; seeks to allow theorists to experiment with quantum algorithm design before physical quantum computers are available for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stationq.microsoft.com/ |title=StationQ |website=microsoft.com |date=|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes a programming language, optimization and scheduling algorithms, and quantum simulators. LIQUi|&gt; can be used to translate a quantum algorithm written in the form of a high-level program into the low-level machine instructions for a quantum device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/language-integrated-quantum-operations-liqui/|title=Language-Integrated Quantum Operations: LIQUi&amp;#124;&amp;#62;|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quantum lambda calculi ====
Quantum lambda calculi are extensions of the classical [[lambda calculus]] introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the 1930s. The purpose of quantum lambda calculi is to extend quantum programming languages with a theory of [[higher-order functions]].

The first attempt to define a quantum lambda calculus was made by Philip Maymin in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Maymin, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9612052 "Extending the Lambda Calculus to Express Randomized and Quantumized Algorithms"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
His lambda-q calculus is powerful enough to express any quantum computation. However, this language can efficiently solve [[NP-complete]] problems, and therefore appears to be strictly stronger than the standard quantum computational models (such as the [[quantum Turing machine]] or the [[quantum circuit]] model). Therefore, Maymin's lambda-q calculus is probably not implementable on a physical device.

In 2003, André van Tonder defined an extension of the [[lambda calculus]] suitable for proving correctness of quantum programs. He also provided an implementation in the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=André van Tonder |title=A lambda calculus for quantum computation (website) |url=http://www.het.brown.edu/people/andre/qlambda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Selinger and Valiron defined a [[strongly typed]] lambda calculus for quantum computation with a type system based on [[linear logic]].

==== Quipper ====
{{for|the education technology company|Quipper (company)}}
Quipper was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/ | title=The Quipper Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alexander S. Green |author2=Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine |author3=Neil J. Ross |author4=Peter Selinger |author5=Benoît Valiron |title=The Quipper Language (website) |url=http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implemented as an embedded language, using [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] as the host language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Alexander S. Green |author2=Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine |author3=Neil J. Ross |author4=Peter Selinger |author5=Benoît Valiron |title=An Introduction to Quantum Programming in Quipper |arxiv=1304.5485|year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38986-3_10 |volume=7948 |pages=110–124|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-642-38985-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, quantum programs written in Quipper are written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] using provided libraries. For example, the following code implements preparation of a superposition
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
    import Quipper
    
    spos :: Bool -&gt; Circ Qubit
    spos b = do q &lt;- qinit b
                r &lt;- hadamard q
                return r

[[File:Regular grid.svg|thumb|right|Example of a regular grid]]
A '''regular grid''' is a [[tessellation]] of '''''n'''''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] by congruent [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]]s (e.g. [[brick]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Uznanski, Dan.|title=Grid.|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Grid.html|publisher=From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein.|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grids of this type appear on [[graph paper]] and may be used in [[finite element analysis]], [[finite volume method]]s, [[finite difference method]]s, and in general for discretization of parameter spaces. Since the derivatives of field variables can be conveniently expressed as finite differences,&lt;ref name="Preface, P-1.1"&gt;{{cite book|last=J.F. Thompson, B. K . Soni &amp; N.P. Weatherill|title=Handbook of Grid Generation|year=1998|publisher=CRC-Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2687-5|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/isbn/9781420050349}}&lt;/ref&gt; structured grids mainly appear in finite difference methods. [[Unstructured grid]]s offer more flexibility than structured grids and hence are very useful in finite element and finite volume methods.

Each cell in the grid can be addressed by index (i, j) in two [[dimension]]s or (i, j, k) in three dimensions, and each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] has [[coordinate]]s &lt;math&gt;(i\cdot dx, j\cdot dy)&lt;/math&gt; in 2D or &lt;math&gt;(i\cdot dx, j\cdot dy, k\cdot dz)&lt;/math&gt; in 3D for some real numbers ''dx'', ''dy'', and ''dz'' representing the grid spacing.

==Related grids==
A '''Cartesian grid''' is a special case where the elements are [[unit square]]s or [[unit cube]]s, and the vertices are [[integer point]]s.

{{anchor|Rectilinear grid}}A '''rectilinear grid''' is a tessellation by rectangles or [[parallelepiped]]s that are not, in general, all [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to each other. The cells may still be indexed by integers as above, but the mapping from indexes to vertex coordinates is less uniform than in a regular grid. An example of a rectilinear grid that is not regular appears on [[logarithmic scale]] [[graph paper]].

A '''curvilinear grid''' or '''structured grid''' is a grid with the same combinatorial structure as a regular grid, in which the cells are quadrilaterals or [[cuboid]]s rather than rectangles or rectangular parallelepipeds.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''relativistic Lagrangian mechanics''' is [[Lagrangian mechanics]] applied in the context of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]].

==Lagrangian formulation in special relativity==

Lagrangian mechanics can be formulated in [[special relativity]] as follows. Consider one particle (''N'' particles are considered later).

===Coordinate formulation===

If a system is described by a Lagrangian ''L'', the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

retain their form in [[special relativity]], provided the Lagrangian generates equations of motion consistent with special relativity. Here '''r''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') is the [[position vector]] of the particle as measured in some [[lab frame]] where [[Cartesian coordinates]] are used for simplicity, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}  = \left(\frac{dx}{dt},\frac{dy}{dt},\frac{dz}{dt}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

is the coordinate velocity, the [[derivative]] of position '''r''' with respect to [[coordinate time]] ''t''. (Throughout this article, overdots are with respect to coordinate time, not proper time). It is possible to transform the position coordinates to [[generalized coordinates]] exactly as in non-relativistic mechanics, '''r''' = '''r'''('''q''', ''t''). Taking the [[total differential]] of '''r''' obtains the transformation of velocity '''v''' to the generalized coordinates, generalized velocities, and coordinate time

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial q_j}\dot{q}_j +\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial t} \,, \quad \dot{q}_j = \frac{dq_j}{dt}  &lt;/math&gt;

remains the same. However, the [[energy]] of a moving particle is different to non-relativistic mechanics. It is instructive to look at the total [[Relativistic energy-momentum equation|relativistic energy]] of a free test particle. An observer in the lab frame defines events by coordinates '''r''' and [[coordinate time]] ''t'', and measures the particle to have coordinate velocity '''v''' = ''d'''''r'''/''dt''. By contrast, an observer moving with the particle will record a different time, this is the ''[[proper time]]'', ''τ''. Expanding in a [[power series]], the first term is the particle's [[rest energy]], plus its non-relativistic [[kinetic energy]], followed by higher order relativistic corrections;

:&lt;math&gt;E = m_0 c^2 \frac{dt}{d \tau} = \frac{m_0 c^2}{\sqrt {1 - \frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 (t)}{c^2}}} = m_0 c^2 + {1 \over 2} m_0 \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 (t) + {3 \over 8} m_0 \frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}^4(t)}{c^2} + \cdots \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum. The [[differential of a function|differential]]s in ''t'' and ''τ'' are related by the [[Lorentz factor]] ''γ'',&lt;ref group=nb name=lineelement&gt;The [[line element]] squared is the [[Lorentz invariant]]

:&lt;math&gt;c^2d\tau^2 = \eta_{\alpha\beta}dx^\alpha dx^\beta = c^2dt^2 - d\mathbf{r}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which takes the same values in all [[inertial frame]]s of reference. Here ''η&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor, ''dx&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'' = (''cdt'', ''d'''''r''') = (''cdt'', ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'') are the components of the differential position [[four vector]], the [[summation convention]] over the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant]] spacetime indices ''α'' and ''β'' is used, each index takes the value 0 for timelike components, and 1, 2, 3 for spacelike components, and

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}^2 \equiv d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \equiv dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is a shorthand for the square differential of the particle's position coordinates. Dividing by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; allows the conversion to the lab coordinate time as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\tau^2}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{c^2}\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}= 1-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{d\mathbf{r}^2}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})^2} &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;d\tau = \frac{1}{c}\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}} dt = \frac{dt}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} \,. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dt=\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})d\tau \,, \quad \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2}{c^2}}} \,,\quad \dot{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \,, \quad \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 (t) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}(t) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}(t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]]. The relativistic kinetic energy for an uncharged particle of [[rest mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;T = (\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}}) - 1)m_0c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

and we may naïvely guess the relativistic Lagrangian for a particle to be this relativistic kinetic energy minus the potential energy. However, even for a free particle for which ''V'' = 0, this is wrong. Following the non-relativistic approach, we expect the derivative of this seemingly correct Lagrangian with respect to the velocity to be the relativistic momentum, which it is not.

The definition of a generalized momentum can be retained, and the advantageous connection between [[cyclic coordinate]]s and [[conservation law|conserved quantities]] will continue to apply. The momenta can be used to "reverse-engineer" the Lagrangian. For the case of the free massive particle, in Cartesian coordinates, the ''x'' component of relativistic momentum is

:&lt;math&gt;p_x = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} = \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})m_0 \dot{x}\,,\quad&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' components. Integrating this equation with respect to ''dx''/''dt'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;L = -\frac{m_0c^2}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} + X(\dot{y},\dot{z}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' is an arbitrary function of ''dy''/''dt'' and ''dz''/''dt'' from the integration. Integrating ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' obtains similarly

:&lt;math&gt;L = -\frac{m_0c^2}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} + Y(\dot{x},\dot{z}) \,,\quad L = -\frac{m_0c^2}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} + Z(\dot{x},\dot{y}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''Y'' and ''Z'' are arbitrary functions of their indicated variables. Since the functions ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' are arbitrary, without loss of generality we can conclude the common solution to these integrals, a possible Lagrangian that will correctly generate all the components of relativistic momentum, is

:&lt;math&gt;L = -\frac{m_0c^2}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' = ''Y'' = ''Z'' = 0.

Alternatively, since we wish to build a Lagrangian out of relativistically invariant quantities, take the action as proportional to the integral of the [[Lorentz invariant]] [[line element]] in [[spacetime]], the length of the particle's [[world line]] between proper times ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref group=nb name=lineelement/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = \varepsilon \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} d\tau = \varepsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{dt}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} \,,\quad L = \frac{\varepsilon}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} = \varepsilon\sqrt{1-\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2}{c^2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' is a constant to be found, and after converting the proper time of the particle to the coordinate time as measured in the lab frame, the integrand is the Lagrangian by definition. The momentum must be the relativistic momentum,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}} = \left(\frac{- \varepsilon}{c^2}\right)\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})\dot{\mathbf{r}} = m_0 \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})\dot{\mathbf{r}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which requires ''ε'' = −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in agreement with the previously obtained Lagrangian.

Either way, the position vector '''r''' is absent from the Lagrangian and therefore cyclic, so the Euler–Lagrange equations are consistent with the constancy of relativistic momentum,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt} (m_0 \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})\dot{\mathbf{r}} ) = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which must be the case for a free particle. Also, expanding the relativistic free particle Lagrangian in a power series to first order in ('''v'''/''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; L = -m_0 c^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(- \frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2}{c^2}\right) + \cdots \right] \approx -m_0 c^2 + \frac{m_0}{2}\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in the non-relativistic limit when '''v''' is small, the higher order terms not shown are negligible, and the Lagrangian is the non-relativistic kinetic energy as it should be. The remaining term is the negative of the particle's rest energy, a constant term which can be ignored in the Lagrangian.

For the case of an interacting particle subject to a potential ''V'', which may be non-conservative, it is possible for a number of interesting cases to simply subtract this potential from the free particle Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;L = -\frac{m_0 c^2}{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})} - V(\mathbf{r}, \dot{\mathbf{r}}, t) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

and the Euler–Lagrange equations lead to the relativistic version of [[Newton's second law]], the coordinate time derivative of relativistic momentum is the force acting on the particle;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial V}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}} = \frac{d}{dt}(m_0 \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})\dot{\mathbf{r}})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

assuming the potential ''V'' can generate the corresponding force '''F''' in this way. If the potential cannot obtain the force as shown, then the Lagrangian would need modification to obtain the correct equations of motion.

It is also true that if the Lagrangian is explicitly independent of time and the potential ''V''('''r''') independent of velocities, then the total relativistic energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{r}}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{r}} - L = \gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}})m_0c^2 + V(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

is conserved, although the identification is less obvious since the first term is the relativistic energy of the particle which includes the rest mass of the particle, not merely the relativistic kinetic energy. Also, the argument for homogenous functions does not apply to relativistic Lagrangians.

The extension to ''N'' particles is straightforward, the relativistic Lagrangian is just a sum of the "free particle" terms, minus the potential energy of their interaction;

:&lt;math&gt;L = - c^2 \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{m_{0k} }{\gamma(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_k)} - V(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1,\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2,\ldots, t) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where all the positions and velocities are measured in the same lab frame, including the time.

The advantage of this coordinate formulation is that it can be applied to a variety of systems, including multiparticle systems. The disadvantage is that some lab frame has been singled out as a preferred frame, and none of the equations are ''[[manifestly covariant]]'' (in other words, they do not take the same form in all frames of reference). For an observer moving relative to the lab frame, everything must be recalculated; the position '''r''', the momentum '''p''', total energy ''E'', potential energy, etc. In particular, if this other observer moves with constant relative velocity then [[Lorentz transformation]]s must be used. However, the action will remain the same since it is Lorentz invariant by construction.

A seemingly different but completely equivalent form of the Lagrangian for a free massive particle, which will readily extend to general relativity as shown below, can be obtained by inserting&lt;ref group=nb name=lineelement/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d\tau = \frac{1}{c}\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}} dt \,, &lt;/math&gt;

into the Lorentz invariant action so that

:&lt;math&gt;S = \varepsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{1}{c}\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}} dt \quad\Rightarrow\quad L = \frac{\varepsilon}{c}\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}}  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' = −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is retained for simplicity. Although the line element and action are Lorentz invariant, the Lagrangian is ''not'', because it has explicit dependence on the lab coordinate time. Still, the equations of motion follow from [[Hamilton's principle]]

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S = 0\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the action is proportional to the length of the particle's worldline (in other words its trajectory in spacetime), this route illustrates that finding the stationary action is akin to finding the trajectory of shortest or largest length in spacetime. Correspondingly, the equations of motion of the particle are akin to the equations describing the trajectories of shortest or largest length in spacetime, ''[[geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]]s''.

For the case of an interacting particle in a potential ''V'', the Lagrangian is still

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{\varepsilon}{c}\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{dt}\frac{dx^\beta}{dt}} - V  &lt;/math&gt;

which can also extend to many particles as shown above, each particle has its own set of position coordinates to define its position.

===Covariant formulation ===

In the covariant formulation, time is placed on equal footing with space, so the coordinate time as measured in some frame is part of the configuration space alongside the spatial coordinates (and other generalized coordinates).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a particle, either [[massless particle|massless]] or massive, the Lorentz invariant action is (abusing notation)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|page=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = \int_{\sigma_1}^{\sigma_2} \Lambda(x^\nu(\sigma),u^\nu(\sigma),\sigma) d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

where lower and upper indices are used according to [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]], ''σ'' is an ''[[affine parameter]]'', and ''u&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''dx&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''/''dσ'' is the [[four-velocity]] of the particle.

For massive particles, ''σ'' can be the arc length ''s'', or proper time ''τ'', along the particle's world line,

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = c^2d\tau^2 = g_{\alpha\beta} d x^\alpha d x^\beta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For massless particles, it cannot because the proper time of a massless particle is always zero;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha\beta} d x^\alpha d x^\beta = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For a free particle, the Lagrangian has the form&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|Nightingale|1995|page=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|page=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = g_{\alpha\beta}\frac{d x^\alpha}{d\sigma} \frac{d x^\beta}{d\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

where the irrelevant factor of 1/2 is allowed to be scaled away by the scaling property of Lagrangians. No inclusion of mass is necessary since this also applies to massless particles. The Euler–Lagrange equations in the spacetime coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\sigma}\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial u^\alpha} - \frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x^\alpha} = \frac{d^2 x^\alpha}{d\sigma^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\sigma}\frac{dx^\gamma}{d\sigma} = 0\,, &lt;/math&gt;

which is the geodesic equation for affinely parameterized geodesics in spacetime. In other words, the free particle follows geodesics. Geodesics for massless particles are called "null geodesics", since they lie in a "[[light cone]]" or "null cone" of spacetime, while those for massive particles are called "non-null geodesics".

This manifestly covariant formulation does not extend to an ''N'' particle system, since then the affine parameter of any one particle cannot be defined as a common parameter for all the other particles.

==Examples in special relativity==

===Special relativistic 1d harmonic oscillator===

For a 1d relativistic [[simple harmonic oscillator]], the Lagrangian is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L = - m c^2 \sqrt {1 - \frac{\dot{x}^2(t)}{c^2}} - \frac{k}{2}x^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the spring constant.

===Special relativistic constant force===

For a particle under a constant force, the Lagrangian is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L = - m c^2 \sqrt {1 - \frac{\dot{x}^2(t)}{c^2}} - max \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the force per unit mass.

===Special relativistic test particle in an electromagnetic field===

{{main|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism}}

In special relativity, the Lagrangian of a massive charged test particle in an electromagnetic field modifies to&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = - m c^2 \sqrt {1 - \frac{v^2 }{c^2}} - q \phi  + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian equations in '''r''' lead to the [[Lorentz force]] law, in terms of the [[relativistic momentum]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{m \dot{\mathbf{r}}} {\sqrt {1 - \frac{v^2 }{c^2}}}\right) = q \mathbf{E} + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \times \mathbf{B}  \,. &lt;/math&gt;

In the language of [[four vector]]s and [[tensor index notation]], the Lagrangian takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; L(\tau) = \frac{1}{2}m u^\mu(\tau)u_\mu(\tau) + qu^\mu(\tau)A_\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''dx&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''/''dτ'' is the [[four-velocity]] of the test particle, and ''A&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'' the [[electromagnetic four potential]].

The Euler–Lagrange equations are (notice the total derivative with respect to proper time instead of [[coordinate time]])

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x^\nu} - \frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{\partial L}{\partial u^\nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

obtains

:&lt;math&gt; qu^\mu\frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^\nu} = \frac{d}{d\tau} (m u_\nu + q A_\nu) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Under the [[total derivative]] with respect to proper time, the first term is the relativistic momentum, the second term is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d A_\nu}{d\tau} = \frac{\partial A_\nu}{\partial x^\mu} \frac{d x^\mu}{d\tau} = \frac{\partial A_\nu}{\partial x^\mu} u^\mu \,, &lt;/math&gt;

then rearranging, and using the definition of the antisymmetric [[electromagnetic tensor]], gives the covariant form of the Lorentz force law in the more familiar form,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau} (m u_\nu) = qu^\mu F_{\nu\mu} \,,\quad F_{\nu\mu} = \frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^\nu} - \frac{\partial A_\nu}{\partial x^\mu} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

==Lagrangian formulation in general relativity==

The Lagrangian is that of a single particle plus an interaction term ''L''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = - m c^2 \frac{d \tau}{d t} + L_I \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Varying this with respect to the position of the particle ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sup&gt; as a function of time ''t'' gives
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \delta L &amp; = m \frac{d t}{2 d \tau} \delta \left( g_{\mu\nu} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d t} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} \right) + \delta  L_I \\
&amp; = m \frac{d t}{2 d \tau} \left( g_{\mu\nu,\alpha} \delta x^{\alpha} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d t} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} + 2 g_{\alpha\nu} \frac{d \delta x^{\alpha}}{d t} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} \right) + \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \delta x^{\alpha} + \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t}} \frac{d \delta x^{\alpha}}{d t} \\
&amp; = \frac12 m g_{\mu\nu,\alpha} \delta x^{\alpha} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d \tau} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} - \frac{d }{d t} \left( m g_{\alpha\nu} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d \tau} \right) \delta x^{\alpha} + \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \delta x^{\alpha} - \frac{d }{d t} \left( \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t}} \right) \delta x^{\alpha} + \frac{d (\cdots)}{d t} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the equation of motion
:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \frac12 m g_{\mu\nu,\alpha} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d \tau} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} - \frac{d }{d t} \left( m g_{\alpha\nu} \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d \tau} \right) + f_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; f_{\alpha} = \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial x^{\alpha}} - \frac{d }{d t} \left( \frac{\partial L_I}{\partial \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
is the non-gravitational force on the particle. (For ''m'' to be independent of time, we must have &lt;math&gt; f_{\alpha} \tfrac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.)

Rearranging gets the force equation
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d }{d t} \left( m \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d \tau} \right) = - m \Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\sigma} \frac{d x^{\mu}}{d \tau} \frac{d x^{\sigma}}{d t} + g^{\nu\alpha} f_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;Gamma; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] which is the gravitational force field.

If we let
:&lt;math&gt; p^{\nu} =  m \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d \tau} &lt;/math&gt;
be the (kinetic) linear momentum for a particle with mass, then
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d p^{\nu}}{d t} = - \Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\sigma} p^{\mu} \frac{d x^{\sigma}}{d t} + g^{\nu\alpha} f_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d x^{\nu}}{d t} = \frac{p^{\nu}}{p^0} &lt;/math&gt;
hold even for a massless particle.

==Examples in general relativity==

===General relativistic test particle in an electromagnetic field===

In [[general relativity]], the first term generalizes (includes) both the classical kinetic energy and the interaction with the gravitational field. For a charged particle in an electromagnetic field it is

:&lt;math&gt; L(t) = - m c^2 \sqrt {-  c^{-2} g_{\mu\nu}(x(t)) \frac{d x^{\mu}(t)}{d t} \frac{d x^{\nu}(t)}{d t}} + q \frac{d x^{\mu}(t)}{d t} A_{\mu}(x(t))\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the four spacetime coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;µ&lt;/sup&gt; are given in arbitrary units (i.e. unitless), then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt; in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the rank 2 symmetric [[metric tensor]] which is also the gravitational potential. Also, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;µ&lt;/sub&gt; in V·s is the electromagnetic 4-vector potential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5309">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''rencontres numbers''' are a [[triangular array]] of [[integer]]s that enumerate [[permutation]]s of the set {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;} with specified numbers of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]]: in other words, '''partial derangements'''.  (''Rencontre'' is French for ''encounter''.  By some accounts, the problem is named after a [[solitaire]] game.)  For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and 0 ≤ ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', the rencontres number ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of permutations of {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;} that have exactly ''k'' fixed points.

For example, if seven presents are given to seven different people, but only two are destined to get the right present, there are ''D''&lt;sub&gt;7,&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;924 ways this could happen. Another often cited example is that of a dance school with 7 couples, where after tea-break the participants are told to ''randomly'' find a partner to continue, and there are ''D''&lt;sub&gt;7,&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;924 possibilities once more, now, that 2 previous couples meet again just by chance.

The numbers in the ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 column enumerate [[derangement]]s.  Thus
 
:&lt;math&gt;D_{0,0} = 1, \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D_{1,0} = 0, \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D_{n+2,0} = (n + 1)(D_{n+1,0} + D_{n,0}) \!&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative ''n''. It turns out that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{n,0} = \left\lceil\frac{n!}{e}\right\rfloor,&lt;/math&gt;

where the ratio is rounded up for even ''n'' and rounded down for odd ''n''. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, this gives the nearest integer. 

More generally, for any &lt;math&gt;k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;D_{n,k} = {n \choose k} \cdot D_{n-k,0}.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof is easy after one knows how to enumerate derangements: choose the ''k'' fixed points out of ''n''; then choose the derangement of the other ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' points.

The numbers {{math|D&lt;sub&gt;&lt;VAR&gt;n&lt;/VAR&gt;,0&lt;/sub&gt;/(&lt;VAR&gt;n&lt;/VAR&gt;!)}} are [[generating function|generated]] by the [[power series]] {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;VAR&gt;z&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/(1 &amp;minus; &lt;VAR&gt;z&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}; accordingly,
an explicit formula for ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; can be derived as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; D_{n, m}
= \frac{n!}{m!} [z^{n-m}] \frac{e^{-z}}{1-z}
= \frac{n!}{m!} \sum_{k=0}^{n-m} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This immediately implies that

:&lt;math&gt; D_{n, m} = {n \choose m} D_{n-m, 0} \; \; \mbox{ and } \; \;
\frac{D_{n, m}}{n!} \approx \frac{e^{-1}}{m!}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' large, ''m'' fixed.

==Probability distribution==

The sum of the entries in each row for the table in "'''''Numerical Values'''''" is the total number of permutations of {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;}, and is therefore ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  If one divides all the entries in the ''n''th row by ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;, one gets the [[probability distribution]] of the number of fixed points of a uniformly distributed [[random permutation]] of {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;}.  The probability that the number of fixed points is ''k'' is

:&lt;math&gt;{D_{n,k} \over n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, the [[expected value|expected]] number of fixed points is&amp;nbsp;1 (a fact that follows from linearity of expectation).

More generally, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', the ''i''th [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of this probability distribution is the ''i''th moment of the [[Poisson distribution]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Pitman, "Some Probabilistic Aspects of [[partition of a set|Set Partitions]]", [[American Mathematical Monthly]], volume&amp;nbsp;104, number&amp;nbsp;3, March 1997, pages&amp;nbsp;201&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', the ''i''th moment is smaller than that of that Poisson distribution.  Specifically, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', the ''i''th moment is the ''i''th [[Bell number]], i.e.&amp;nbsp;the number of [[partition of a set|partitions]] of a set of size ''i''.

===Limiting probability distribution===

As the size of the permuted set grows, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} {D_{n,k} \over n!} = {e^{-1} \over k!}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is just the probability that a Poisson-distributed [[random variable]] with expected value 1 is equal to ''k''.  In other words, as ''n'' grows, the probability distribution of the number of fixed points of a random permutation of a set of size ''n'' approaches the [[Poisson distribution]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4583">:''This article is about the ''rotation number'', which is sometimes called the ''map winding number'' or simply ''winding number''. There is another meaning for [[winding number]], which appears in [[complex analysis]].''

In [[mathematics]], the '''rotation number''' is an [[Topological property|invariant]] of [[homeomorphism]]s of the [[circle]]. 

==History==

It was first defined by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1885, in relation to the [[precession]] of the [[perihelion]] of a [[planetary orbit]]. Poincaré later proved a theorem characterizing the existence of [[periodic orbit]]s in terms of [[rational number|rationality]] of the rotation number.

== Definition ==

Suppose that ''f'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is an orientation preserving [[homeomorphism]] of the [[circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = [[Circle group|'''R'''/'''Z''']]. Then ''f'' may be [[Lift (mathematics)|lifted]] to a [[homeomorphism]] ''F'': '''R''' → '''R''' of the real line, satisfying

: &lt;math&gt; F(x + m) = F(x) +m &lt;/math&gt;

for every real number ''x'' and every integer ''m''.

The '''rotation number''' of ''f'' is defined in terms of the [[iterated function|iterates]] of ''F'':

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F^n(x)-x}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]] proved that the limit exists and is independent of the choice of the starting point ''x''. The lift ''F'' is unique modulo integers, therefore the rotation number is a well-defined element of '''R'''/'''Z'''. Intuitively, it measures the average rotation angle along the [[orbit (dynamics)|orbits]] of ''f''.

== Example ==

If ''f'' is a rotation by ''2πθ'' (where ''0≤θ&lt;2π''), then

: &lt;math&gt; F(x)=x+\theta, &lt;/math&gt;

then its rotation number is ''θ'' (cf [[Irrational rotation]]).

== Properties ==

The rotation number is invariant under [[topological conjugacy]], and even topological '''semiconjugacy''': if ''f'' and ''g'' are two homeomorphisms of the circle and

: &lt;math&gt; h\circ f = g\circ h &lt;/math&gt;

for a continuous map ''h'' of the circle into itself (not necessarily homeomorphic) then ''f'' and ''g'' have the same rotation numbers. It was used by Poincaré and [[Arnaud Denjoy]] for topological classification of homeomorphisms of the circle. There are two distinct possibilities.

* The rotation number of ''f'' is a [[rational number]] ''p''/''q'' (in the lowest terms). Then ''f'' has a [[periodic orbit]], every periodic orbit has period ''q'', and the order of the points on each such orbit coincides with the order of the points for a rotation by ''p''/''q''. Moreover, every forward orbit of ''f'' converges to a periodic orbit. The same is true for ''backward'' orbits, corresponding to iterations of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but the limiting periodic orbits in forward and backward directions may be different.
* The rotation number of ''f'' is an [[irrational number]] ''θ''. Then ''f'' has no periodic orbits (this follows immediately by considering a periodic point ''x'' of ''f''). There are two subcases.

:# There exists a dense orbit. In this case ''f'' is topologically conjugate to the [[irrational rotation]] by the angle ''&amp;theta;'' and all orbits are [[dense set|dense]]. Denjoy proved that this possibility is always realized when ''f'' is twice continuously differentiable.
:# There exists a [[Cantor set]] ''C'' invariant under ''f''. Then ''C'' is a unique minimal set and the orbits of all points both in forward and backward direction converge to ''C''. In this case, ''f'' is semiconjugate to the irrational rotation by ''&amp;theta;'', and the semiconjugating map ''h'' of degree 1 is constant on components of the complement of ''C''.

The rotation number is ''continuous'' when viewed as a map from the group of homeomorphisms (with &lt;math&gt; C^0 &lt;/math&gt; topology) of the circle into the circle.

'''Rudolf Otto Sigismund Lipschitz''' (14 May 1832 – 7 October 1903) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] who made contributions to [[mathematical analysis]] (where he gave his name to the [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuity condition]]) and [[differential geometry]], as well as [[number theory]], [[algebra over a field|algebras]] with [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] and [[classical mechanics]].

==Biography==
Rudolf Lipschitz was born on 14 May 1832 in [[Königsberg]]. He was the son of a landowner and was raised at his father's estate at Bönkein which was near Königsberg.&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lipschitz.html&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[University of Königsberg]] when he was 15, but later moved to the [[University of Berlin]] where he studied with [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Gustav Dirichlet]]. Despite having his studies delayed by illness, in 1853 Lipschitz graduated with a PhD in Berlin.&lt;ref name=AtoZ&gt;{{cite book| last = McElroy| first = Tucker | title=A to Z of Mathematicians | year=2009| publisher=Infobase Publishing | location  = | isbn= 978-1-438-10921-3 | pages= 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his PhD, Lipschitz started teaching at local [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]]. In 1857 he married Ida Pascha, the daughter of one of the landowners with an estate near to his father's.&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt; In 1857 he earned his [[habilitation]] at the [[University of Bonn]] and remained there as a [[privatdozent]]. In 1862 Lipschitz became an extraordinary professor at the [[University of Breslau]] where he spent the following two years. In 1864 Lipschitz moved back to Bonn as a full professor, remaining there for the rest of his career. Here he examined the dissertation of [[Felix Klein]]. Lipschitz died on 7 October 1903 in Bonn.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite book| last = Chang| first = Sooyoung | title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians | year=2011| publisher=World Scientific | location  = | isbn= 978-9-814-28229-1 | pages= 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery of Clifford algebra==
Lipschitz discovered [[Clifford algebra]]s in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Principes d'un calcul algébrique qui contient comme espèces particulières le calcul des quantités imaginaires et des quaternions|author=R. Lipschitz|journal=C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris|volume=91|year=1880|pages=619–621, 660–664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Correspondence|author=R. Lipschitz (signed)|journal=Ann. of Math.|volume=69|year=1959|pages=247–251|doi=10.2307/1970102|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after [[William K. Clifford]] (1845–1879) and independently of him, and he was the first to use them in the study of [[orthogonal transformation]]s. Up to 1950 people mentioned "Clifford–Lipschitz numbers" when they referred to this discovery of Lipschitz. Yet Lipschitz's name suddenly disappeared from the publications involving Clifford algebras; for instance [[Claude Chevalley]] (1909–1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Chevalley|first1=Claude| title =The Algebraic Theory of Spinors and Clifford Algebras| publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |edition=Collected Works Vol. 2| year=1997|isbn=978-3-540-57063-9|pages=48, 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the name "[[Clifford group]]" to an object that is never mentioned in Clifford's works, but stems from Lipschitz's. [[Pertti Lounesto]] (1945–2002) contributed greatly to recalling the importance of Lipschitz's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Lounesto|first1=Pertti| title = Clifford Algebras and Spinors| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1997|isbn=978-0-521-59916-0 |page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Helmstetter, Artibano Micali: ''Quadratic Mappings and Clifford Algebras'', Birkhäuser, 2008, {{isbn|978-3-7643-8605-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_VfARQsSO8C&amp;pg=PR9 Introduction, p. ix ''ff.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">'''Schur's lemma''' is a result in Riemannian geometry that says, heuristically, whenever certain curvatures are pointwise constant then they are forced to be globally constant. It is essentially a degree of freedom counting argument.

== Statement of the Lemma ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;(M^n,g)^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riemannian manifold]] and &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.  Then if

* the [[sectional curvature]] is pointwise constant, that is, there exists some function &lt;math&gt;f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sect}^{}_{}(\Pi_p) = f(p)&lt;/math&gt; for all two-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;\Pi_p \subset T_p M&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;p \in M,&lt;/math&gt;
:then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and the manifold has constant sectional curvature (also known as a [[space form]] when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is complete); alternatively
* the [[Ricci curvature]] [[endomorphism]] is pointwise a multiple of the identity, that is, there exists some function &lt;math&gt;f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Ric}^{}_{}(X_p) = f(p) X_p&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; X_p \in T_p M&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;p \in M,&lt;/math&gt; 
:then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and the manifold is [[Einstein manifold|Einstein]].

The requirement that &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; cannot be lifted. This result is far from true on two-dimensional surfaces. In two dimensions sectional curvature is always pointwise constant since there is only one two-dimensional subspace &lt;math&gt;\Pi_p \subset T_p M&lt;/math&gt;, namely &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, in two dimensions the Ricci curvature endomorphism is always a multiple of the identity (scaled by [[Gauss curvature]]). On the other hand, certainly not all two-dimensional surfaces have constant sectional (or Ricci) curvature.

'''Spacetime symmetries''' are features of [[spacetime]] that can be described as exhibiting some form of [[symmetry]]. The role of [[symmetry in physics]] is important in simplifying solutions to many problems. Spacetime symmetries are used in the study of [[exact solutions]] of [[Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. Spacetime symmetries are distinguished from [[internal symmetries]].

==Physical motivation==
Physical problems are often investigated and solved by noticing features which have some form of symmetry. For example, in the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the role of [[spherically symmetric spacetime|spherical symmetry]] is important in [[deriving the Schwarzschild solution]] and deducing the physical consequences of this symmetry (such as the nonexistence of gravitational radiation in a spherically pulsating star). In cosmological problems, symmetry finds a role to play in the [[cosmological principle]] which restricts the type of universes that are consistent with large-scale observations (e.g. the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric]]). Symmetries usually require some form of preserving property, the most important of which in general relativity include the following:

*preserving geodesics of the spacetime
*preserving the metric tensor
*preserving the curvature tensor

These and other symmetries will be discussed below in more detail. This preservation property which symmetries usually possess (alluded to above) can be used to motivate a useful definition of these symmetries themselves.

==Mathematical definition==
A rigorous definition of symmetries in general relativity has been given by Hall (2004). In this approach, the idea is to use (smooth) [[vector fields]] whose [[local diffeomorphism|local flow diffeomorphisms]] preserve some property of the [[spacetime]]. (Note that one should emphasize in one's thinking this is a diffeomorphism—a transformation on a '''differential''' element. The implication is that the behavior of objects with extent may not be as manifestly symmetric.) This preserving property of the diffeomorphisms is made precise as follows. A smooth vector field {{math|''X''}} on a spacetime {{math|''M''}} is said to ''preserve'' a smooth tensor {{math|''T''}} on {{math|''M''}} (or {{math|''T''}} is '''invariant''' under {{math|''X''}}) if, for each smooth local flow diffeomorphism {{math|''ϕ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}} associated with {{math|''X''}}, the tensors {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''ϕ''{{su|b=''t''|p=∗}}(''T'')}} are equal on the domain of {{math|''ϕ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. This statement is equivalent to the more usable condition that the [[Lie derivative]] of the [[tensor]] under the vector field vanishes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X T=0&lt;/math&gt;

on {{math|''M''}}. This has the consequence that, given any two points {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} on {{math|''M''}}, the coordinates of {{math|''T''}} in a coordinate system around {{math|''p''}} are equal to the coordinates of {{math|''T''}} in a coordinate system around {{math|''q''}}. A ''symmetry on the spacetime'' is a smooth vector field whose local flow diffeomorphisms preserve some (usually geometrical) feature of the spacetime. The (geometrical) feature may refer to specific tensors (such as the metric, or the energy-momentum tensor) or to other aspects of the spacetime such as its geodesic structure. The vector fields are sometimes referred to as ''collineations'', ''symmetry vector fields'' or just ''symmetries''. The set of all symmetry vector fields on {{math|''M''}} forms a [[Lie algebra]] under the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] operation as can be seen from the identity:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \mathcal{L}_X (\mathcal{L}_Y T) - \mathcal{L}_Y (\mathcal{L}_X T)&lt;/math&gt;

the term on the right usually being written, with an [[abuse of notation]], as

:&lt;math&gt;[\mathcal{L}_X, \mathcal{L}_Y] T.&lt;/math&gt;

==Killing symmetry==
{{Main|Killing vector field}}
A Killing vector field is one of the most important types of symmetries and is defined to be a smooth [[vector field]] that preserves the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt;

This is usually written in the expanded form as:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{a;b}+X_{b;a} \, =0&lt;/math&gt;

Killing vector fields find extensive applications (including in [[classical mechanics]]) and are related to [[conservation laws]].

==Homothetic symmetry==
{{Main|Homothetic vector field}}
A homothetic vector field is one which satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=2c g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c''}} is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] in general relativity.

==Affine symmetry==
{{Main|Affine vector field}}
An affine vector field is one that satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab})_{;c}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

An affine vector field preserves [[geodesic]]s and preserves the affine parameter.

The above three vector field types are special cases of [[projective vector fields]] which preserve geodesics without necessarily preserving the affine parameter.

==Conformal symmetry==
{{Main|Conformal vector field}}
A conformal vector field is one which satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=\phi g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ϕ''}} is a smooth real-valued function on {{math|''M''}}.

==Curvature symmetry==
{{Main|Curvature collineation}}
A curvature collineation is a vector field which preserves the [[Riemann tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X {R^a}_{bcd}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bcd&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the components of the Riemann tensor. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[smooth function|smooth]] curvature collineations forms a [[Lie algebra]] under the [[Lie bracket]] operation (if the smoothness condition is dropped, the set of all curvature collineations need not form a Lie algebra). The Lie algebra is denoted by {{math|''CC''(''M'')}} and may be [[infinity|infinite]]-[[dimension]]al. Every affine vector field is a curvature collineation.

==Matter symmetry==
{{Main|Matter collineation}}
A less well-known form of symmetry concerns vector fields that preserve the energy-momentum tensor. These are variously referred to as matter collineations or matter symmetries and are defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X T_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the energy-momentum tensor components. The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field {{math|''X''}} is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of {{math|''X''}}, this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that ''every Killing vector field is a matter collineation'' (by the Einstein field equations, with or without [[cosmological constant]]). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, ''a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor''. When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every Killing vector field preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an electromagnetic field, a Killing vector field does ''not necessarily'' preserve the electric and magnetic fields.

==Local and global symmetries==
{{main|Local symmetry|Global symmetry}}

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Applications==
As mentioned at the start of this article, the main application of these symmetries occur in general relativity, where solutions of Einstein's equations may be classified by imposing some certain symmetries on the spacetime.

===Spacetime classifications===
Classifying solutions of the EFE constitutes a large part of general relativity research. Various approaches to classifying spacetimes, including using the [[Segre classification]] of the energy-momentum tensor or the [[Petrov classification]] of the [[Weyl tensor]] have been studied extensively by many researchers, most notably Stephani ''et al.'' (2003). They also classify spacetimes using symmetry vector fields (especially Killing and homothetic symmetries). For example, Killing vector fields may be used to classify spacetimes, as there is a limit to the number of global, smooth Killing vector fields that a spacetime may possess (the maximum being 10 for four-dimensional spacetimes). Generally speaking, the higher the dimension of the algebra of symmetry vector fields on a spacetime, the more symmetry the spacetime admits. For example, the Schwarzschild solution has a Killing algebra of dimension 4 (three spatial rotational vector fields and a time translation), whereas the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric]] (excluding the [[Einstein static]] subcase) has a Killing algebra of dimension 6 (three translations and three rotations). The Einstein static metric has a Killing algebra of dimension 7 (the previous 6 plus a time translation).

The assumption of a spacetime admitting a certain symmetry vector field can place restrictions on the spacetime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7014">{{redirect-distinguish|Triangle postulate|Triangle inequality}}
In several [[geometries]], a [[triangle]] has three ''[[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]'' and three ''[[Edge (geometry)|sides]]'', where three '''angles''' of a triangle are formed at each vertex by a pair of adjacent sides. In a [[Euclidean space]], the [[summation|sum]] of measures of these three angles of any triangle is invariably equal to the [[straight angle]], also expressed as 180 [[degree (angle)|°]], [[pi|{{Pi}}]] [[radians]], two right angles, or a half-[[turn (geometry)|turn]]. 

It was unknown for a long time whether other geometries exist, where this sum is different. The influence of this problem on mathematics was particularly strong during the 19th century. Ultimately, the answer was proven to be positive: in other spaces (geometries) this sum can be greater or lesser, but it then must depend on the triangle. Its difference from 180° is a case of ''[[angular defect]]'' and serves as an important distinction for geometric systems.

[[Image:Triangle angles sum to 180 degrees.svg|thumb|right|145px|Equivalence of the parallel postulate and the "sum of the angles equals to 180°" statement]]

==Cases==
===Euclidean geometry===
In [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''triangle postulate''' states that the sum of the angles of a triangle is two [[right angle]]s. This postulate is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref name=Parallel&gt;
{{Cite book|title=CRC concise encyclopedia of mathematics |author= Eric W. Weisstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFDWuZZslUUC&amp;pg=PA2147 |page=2147 |quote=The parallel postulate is equivalent to the ''Equidistance postulate'', ''Playfair axiom'', ''Proclus axiom'', the ''Triangle postulate'' and the ''Pythagorean theorem''. |edition=2nd |isbn=1-58488-347-2 |year=2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of the other axioms of Euclidean geometry, the following statements are equivalent:&lt;ref name=Devlin&gt;
{{Cite book|title=The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible |author=Keith J. Devlin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pT0mlWWgpzQC&amp;pg=PA161 |page=161 |isbn=0-8050-7254-3 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Triangle postulate''': The sum of the angles of a triangle is two right angles.
*[[Playfair's axiom]]: Given a straight line and a point not on the line, exactly one straight line may be drawn through the point parallel to the given line.
*[[Proclus' axiom]]: If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, it must intersect the other also.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially, the [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of parallelism.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Equidistance postulate''': Parallel lines are everywhere equidistant (i.e. the [[distance]] from each point on one line to the other line is always the same.)
*'''Triangle area property''': The [[area]] of a triangle can be as large as we please.
*'''Three points property''': Three points either lie on a line or lie on a [[circle]].
*[[Pythagoras' theorem]]: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;ref name="Parallel"/&gt; &lt;!--Removed second reference as per comments of author, see talk page--&gt;

===Hyperbolic geometry===
{{main|Hyperbolic triangle}}
The sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is less than 180°. The relation between angular defect and the triangle's area was first proven by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds|volume=149|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=John|last=Ratcliffe|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9780387331973|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JV9m8o-ok6YC&amp;pg=PA99|quotation=That the area of a hyperbolic triangle is proportional to its angle defect first appeared in Lambert's monograph ''Theorie der Parallellinien'', which was published posthumously in 1786.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can easily see how [[hyperbolic geometry]] breaks Playfair's axiom, Proclus' axiom (the parallelism, defined as non-intersection, is intransitive in an hyperbolic plane), the equidistance postulate (the points on one side of, and equidistant from, a given line do not form a line), and Pythagoras' theorem. A circle&lt;ref&gt;Defined as the set of points at the fixed [[distance]] from its centre.&lt;/ref&gt; cannot have arbitrarily small [[curvature]],&lt;ref&gt;Defined in the differentially-geometrical sense.&lt;/ref&gt; so the three points property also fails.

The sum of the angles can be arbitrarily small (but positive). For an [[ideal triangle]], a generalization of hyperbolic triangles, this sum is equal to zero.

===Spherical geometry===

{{See also|Triangle#Non-planar triangles}}

For a [[spherical triangle]], the sum of the angles is greater than 180° and can be up to 540°. Specifically, the sum of the angles is

:180° × (1 + 4''f'' ),

where ''f'' is the fraction of the sphere's area which is enclosed by the triangle. 

Note that spherical geometry does not satisfy several of [[Euclid's axioms]] (including the [[parallel postulate]].)

==Exterior angles==
[[Image:Triangle somme des angles.png|thumb|right|133px|The picture shows exterior angles along with interior ones, for the rightmost vertex it is shown as {{nowrap|1=&lt;span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:0.5ex; font-size:85%; color:#0000FF"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5ex; font-size:85%; color:#009900; text-decoration:line-through"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;}}]]
{{main|Internal and external angle}}
Angles between adjacent sides of a triangle&lt;!-- can be defined unambiguously and--&gt; are referred to as ''interior'' angles in Euclidean and other geometries. ''Exterior'' angles can be also defined, and the Euclidean triangle postulate can be formulated as the [[exterior angle theorem]]. One can also consider the sum of all three exterior angles, that equals to 360°&lt;ref&gt;From the definition of an exterior angle, its sums up to the straight angle with the interior angles. So, the sum of three exterior angles added to the sum of three interior angles always gives three straight angles.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Euclidean case (as for any [[convex polygon]]), is less than 360° in the spherical case, and is greater than 360° in the hyperbolic case.

==In differential geometry==
In the [[differential geometry of surfaces]], the question of a triangle's angular defect is understood as a special case of the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]] where the curvature of a [[closed curve]] is not a function, but a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with the [[support (mathematics)|support]] in exactly three points – vertices of a triangle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7709">In [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Witten conjecture''' is a conjecture about [[intersection number]]s of stable classes on the [[moduli space of curves]], introduced by [[Edward Witten]] in the paper {{harvs|txt|last=Witten|authorlink=Edward Witten|year=1991}}, and generalized in {{harvtxt|Witten|1993}}. 
Witten's original conjecture was proved by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] in the paper {{harvtxt|Kontsevich|1992}}. 

Witten's motivation for the conjecture was that two different models of 2-dimensional [[quantum gravity]] should have the same partition function. The partition function for one of these models can be described in terms of intersection numbers on the [[moduli stack]] of [[algebraic curve]]s, and the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] for the other is the logarithm of the τ-function of the [[KdV hierarchy]]. Identifying these partition functions gives Witten's conjecture that a certain generating function formed from intersection numbers should satisfy the differential equations of the KdV hierarchy.

==Statement==

Suppose that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the moduli stack of compact Riemann surfaces of genus ''g'' with ''n'' distinct marked points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 
and {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is its Deligne–Mumford compactification. There are ''n'' line bundles ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on 
{{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, whose fiber at a point of the moduli stack is given by the cotangent space of a Riemann surface at the marked point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The intersection index 〈τ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., τ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;〉 is the intersection index of Π ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on {{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where Σ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = dim{{overline|''M''}}&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''g'' – 3 + ''n'', and 0 if no such ''g'' exists, where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first [[Chern class]] of a line bundle. Witten's generating function
:&lt;math&gt;F(t_0,t_1,\ldots) 
= \sum\langle\tau_0^{k_0}\tau_1^{k_1}\cdots\rangle\prod_{i\ge 0} \frac{t_i^{k_i}}{k_i!}
=\frac{t_0^3}{6}+ \frac{t_1}{24} + \frac{t_0t_2}{24} + \frac{t_1^2}{24}+ \frac{t_0^2t_3}{48} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
encodes all the intersection indices as its coefficients. 

Witten's  conjecture states that the partition function ''Z'' = exp ''F'' is a τ-function for the [[KdV hierarchy]], in other words it satisfies a certain series of partial differential equations corresponding to elements ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''≥–1 of the [[Virasoro algebra]].

==Proof==

Kontsevich used a combinatorial description of the moduli spaces in terms of ribbon graphs to show that 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d_1+\cdots+d_n=3g-3+n}\langle \tau_{d_1},\ldots,\tau_{d_n}\rangle  \prod_{1\le i\le n} \frac{(2d_i-1)!!}{\lambda_i^{2d_i+1}}
=\sum_{\Gamma\in G_{g,n}}\frac{2^{-|X_0|}}{|\text{Aut} \Gamma|}\prod_{e\in X_1}\frac{2}{\lambda(e)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the sum on the right is over the set ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ribbon graphs ''X'' of compact Riemann surfaces of genus ''g'' with ''n'' marked points.  The set of edges ''e'' and points of ''X'' are denoted by ''X''&lt;sub&gt; 0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The function λ is thought of as a function from the marked points to the reals, and extended to edges of the ribbon graph by setting λ of an edge equal to the sum of λ at the two marked points corresponding to each side of the edge. 

By Feynman diagram techniques, this implies that 
''F''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...) is an asymptotic expansion of 
:&lt;math&gt; \log\int \exp(i \text{tr} X^3/6)d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
as Λ lends to infinity, where Λ and Χ are positive definite ''N'' by ''N'' hermitian matrices, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; t_i = \frac{- \text{tr} \Lambda^{-1-2i}}{1\times3\times5\times\cdots\times (2i-1)}&lt;/math&gt;
and the probability measure μ on the positive definite hermitian matrices is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; d\mu =c_\Lambda\exp(-\text{tr} X^2\Lambda/2)dX&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is a normalizing constant. This measure has the property that
:&lt;math&gt;\int X_{ij}X_{kl}d\mu = \delta_{il}\delta_{jk}\frac{2}{\Lambda_i+\Lambda_j}&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that its expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams is the expression for ''F'' in terms of ribbon graphs. 

From this he deduced that exp F is a τ-function for the KdV hierarchy, thus proving Witten's conjecture.

==Generalizations==

The Witten conjecture is a special case of a more general relation between [[integrable systems]] of Hamiltonian PDEs and the geometry of certain families of 2D topological field theories (axiomatized in the form of the so-called cohomological field theories by Kontsevich and Manin), which was explored and studied systematically by B. Dubrovin and Y. Zhang, A. Givental, C. Teleman and others.

The [[Virasoro conjecture]] is a generalization of the Witten conjecture.
