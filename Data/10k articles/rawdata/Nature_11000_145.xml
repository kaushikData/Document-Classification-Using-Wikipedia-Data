[[File:46 degree Lunar Halo.JPG|thumb|A 22° halo around the Moon]]

A '''22° halo''' is an [[optical phenomenon]] that belongs to the family of ice crystal [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], in the form of a ring with a radius of approximately 22° around the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]]. When visible around the moon, it is called a moon ring or winter halo. It forms as the sun- or moonlight is [[refraction|refracted]] in millions of [[hexagonal]] [[ice crystal]]s suspended in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circ2.htm|title="Disk with a hole" in the sky|website=www.atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The halo is large; the radius is roughly the size of an outstretched hand at arm's length.&lt;ref name="atoptics-circular-halo" /&gt; A 22° halo may be visible on as many as 100 days per year—much more frequently than rainbows.&lt;ref name="collector"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cloud Collector's Handbook | publisher=Chronicle Books | author=Pretor-Pinney, Gavin | year=2011 | location=San Francisco, California | pages=120 | isbn=978-0-8118-7542-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
[[File:Path of rays in a hexagonal prism.png|left|thumb|Pathway of light through a hexagonal prism in the optimal angle resulting in minimum deviation.]]
[[File:22 degree halo Observer looking at 22 degree halo.svg|thumb|upright= 0.65|Path of the light from the clouds to the observer.]]

Even though it is one of the most common types of halo, the exact shape and orientation of the ice crystals responsible for the 22° halo are still the topic of debate. Hexagonal, randomly oriented columns are usually put forward as the most likely candidate, but this explanation presents problems, such as the fact that the aerodynamic properties of such crystals leads them to be oriented horizontally rather than randomly. Alternative explanations include the involvement of clusters of bullet-shaped ice columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tape |first1=Walter |last2=Moilanen |first2=Jarmo |date= |title=Atmospheric Halos and the Search for Angle ''x'' |url= |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Geophysical Union |page=15 |isbn=0-87590-727-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fza103.htm |title=Bullet Rosettes &amp; 22° Halos |last=Cowley |first=Les |date=April 2016 |website=Atmospheric Optics | access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As light passes through the 60° apex angle of the hexagonal ice [[prism (optics)|prisms]] it is deflected twice resulting in deviation angles ranging from 22° to 50°. The angle of minimum deviation is almost 22° (or more specifically 21.84° on average; 21.54° for red light and 22.37° for blue light). This wavelength-dependent variation in refraction causes the inner edge of the circle to be reddish while the outer edge is bluish.

The ice crystals in the clouds all deviate the light similarly, but only the ones from the specific ring at 22 degrees contribute to the effect for an observer at a set distance. As no light is refracted at angles smaller than 22°, the sky is darker inside the halo.&lt;ref name="atoptics-circular-halo-formation"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circ1.htm
 | title = 22° Halo Formation | publisher = Atmospheric Optics
 | accessdate = 2007-04-15 | author = Les Cowley
}} (Including excellent illustrations and animations.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon resulting in a ring around the Sun or Moon—and therefore sometimes confused with the 22° halo—is the [[Corona (meteorology)|corona]]. Unlike the 22° halo, however, it is produced by water droplets instead of ice crystals and it is much smaller and more colorful.&lt;ref name="atoptics-circular-halo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weather relation ==
In [[folklore]], moon rings are said to warn of approaching storms.&lt;ref name="earthsky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why a halo around the sun or moon?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-makes-a-halo-around-the-moon|website=earthsky.org|publisher=EarthSky|accessdate=3 August 2016|quote=Lunar halos are signs that storms are nearby.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other ice halos, 22° halos appear when the sky is covered by thin [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus cloud]]s that often come a few days before a large storm front.&lt;ref name="7news"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/30355738/detail.html | title=Nelson: Ring Around Moon Sign Of Approaching Storm | work=The Denver Channel | date=February 1, 2012 | agency=TheDenverChannel.com | accessdate=February 4, 2012 | author=Harrison, Wayne | location=Denver}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the same clouds can also occur without any associated weather change, making a 22° halo unreliable as a sign of bad weather.

It features guest appearances from [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[Prince Po]], [[Busdriver]] and [[Nobody (producer)|Nobody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urb.com/2010/09/28/2mex-dead-hand-control-and-track-listing/ |title=2Mex – Dead Hand Control and Track Listing (MP3) |publisher=URB |first=Trav |last=Glave |date=September 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101125740/http://www.urb.com/2010/09/28/2mex-dead-hand-control-and-track-listing/ |archivedate=January 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
2Mex is featured in Ava Duvernay's award-winning documentary ''[[This Is the Life (2008 film)|This Is the Life]]'', chronicling the music movement that was birthed at The [[Good Life Cafe]] in [[South Los Angeles|South Central]], Los Angeles. The Good Life Cafe is the open-mic workshop where he first performed with Of Mexican Descent in 1993.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The '''Antiproton Decelerator''' ('''AD''') is a [[storage ring]] at the [[CERN]] laboratory near [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/accelerators/antiproton-decelerator|title=The Antiproton Decelerator - CERN|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built as a successor to the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR) and started operation in the year 2000. [[Antiprotons]] are created by impinging a proton beam from the [[Proton Synchrotron]] on a metal target. The AD decelerates the resultant antiprotons to an energy of 5.3 MeV, which are then ejected to one of several connected experiments.

==ATHENA==
{{Redirect|ATHENA|[[ESA]] X-ray space telescope|Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics|the Greek goddess|Athena|other uses|Athena (disambiguation)}}
'''ATHENA''' was an [[antimatter]] research project that took place at the Antiproton Decelerator. In August 2002, it was the first experiment to produce 50,000 low-energy [[antihydrogen]] atoms, as reported in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ATHENA was disbanded and many of the former members worked on the subsequent [[#ALPHA|ALPHA experiment]].

===ATHENA physics===

The ATHENA apparatus comprises four main subsystems: the [[antiproton]] catching trap, the positron accumulator, the antiproton/positron mixing trap, and the antihydrogen annihilation detector.   All traps in the experiment are variations on the [[Penning trap]], which uses an axial [[magnetic field]] to transversely confine the charged particles, and a series of hollow cylindrical electrodes to trap them axially (Fig. 1a). The catching and mixing traps are adjacent to each other, and coaxial with a 3 T magnetic field from a superconducting solenoid.  The positron accumulator has its own magnetic system, also a solenoid, of 0.14 T.  A separate [[cryogenic]] heat exchanger in the bore of the [[superconducting magnet]] cools the catching and mixing traps to about 15 K. The ATHENA apparatus features an open, modular design that allows great experimental flexibility, particularly in introducing large numbers of [[positrons]] into the apparatus.

The catching trap  slows, traps, cools, and accumulates [[antiprotons]].  To cool antiprotons, the catching trap is first loaded with {{val|3|e=8}} electrons, which cool by synchrotron radiation in the 3 T magnetic field.   Typically, the AD delivers {{val|2|e=7}} antiprotons having kinetic energy 5.3 MeV and a pulse duration of 200 ns to the experiment at 100 s intervals.  The antiprotons are slowed in a thin foil and trapped using a pulsed [[electric field]]. The antiprotons lose energy and equilibrate with the cold electrons by [[Coulomb interaction]]. The electrons are ejected before mixing the antiprotons with positrons. Each AD shot results in about {{val|3|e=3}} cold antiprotons for interaction experiments.  The positron accumulator slows, traps and accumulates positrons emitted from a radioactive source (1.{{val|4|e=9}} Bq Na&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;). Accumulation for 300 s yields 1.{{val|5|e=8}} positrons, 50% of which are successfully transferred to the mixing trap, where they cool by synchrotron radiation.

The mixing trap has the axial potential configuration of a nested Penning trap (Fig. 1b), which permits two plasmas of opposite charge to come into contact. In ATHENA, the spheroidal positron cloud can be characterized by exciting and detecting axial plasma oscillations. Typical conditions are: {{val|7|e=7}} stored positrons, a radius of 2 – 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, a length of 32&amp;nbsp;mm, and a maximum density of 2.{{val|5|e=8|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Key to the observations reported here is the [[antihydrogen]] annihilation detector (Fig. 1a), situated coaxially with the mixing region, between the trap outer radius and the magnet bore. The detector is designed to provide unambiguous evidence for antihydrogen production by detecting the temporally and spatially coincident [[annihilation]]s of the antiproton and positron when a neutral antihydrogen atom escapes the electromagnetic trap and strikes the trap electrodes. An antiproton typically annihilates into a few charged or neutral pions. The charged pions are detected by two layers of double-sided, position sensitive, silicon microstrips. The path of a charged particle passing through both layers can be reconstructed, and two or more intersecting tracks allow determination of the position, or vertex, of the antiproton annihilation.  The uncertainty in vertex determination is approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm  and is dominated by the unmeasured curvature of the charged [[pion]]s’ trajectories in the magnetic field.  The temporal coincidence window is approximately 5 microseconds. The solid angle coverage of the interaction region is about 80% of 4π.

A positron annihilating with an electron yields two or three [[photons]]. The positron detector, comprising 16 rows each containing 12  scintillating, pure CsI crystals, is designed to detect the two-photon events, consisting of two 511 keV photons which are always emitted back-to-back. The energy resolution of the detector is 18% FWHM at 511 keV, and the photo-peak detection efficiency for single photons is about 20%.  The maximum readout rate of the whole detector is about 40&amp;nbsp;Hz. Ancillary detectors include large scintillator paddles external to the magnet, and a thin, position sensitive, silicon diode through which the incident antiproton beam passes before entering the catching trap.   To produce antihydrogen atoms, a positron well in the mixing region is filled with about {{val|7|e=7}} positrons and allowed to cool to the ambient temperature (15 K). The nested trap is then formed around the positron well.   Next, approximately 104 antiprotons are launched into the mixing region by pulsing the trap from one potential configuration (dashed line, Fig. 1b) to another (solid line). The mixing time is 190 s, after which all particles are dumped and the process repeated.  Events triggering the imaging silicon detector (three sides hit in the outer layer) initiate readout of both the silicon and the CsI modules.

Using this method, ATHENA could produce - for the first time - several thousands of cold antihydrogen atoms in 2002.

==ATRAP==
The '''ATRAP''' collaboration at [[CERN]] developed out of [[TRAP experiment|TRAP]], a collaboration whose members pioneered cold [[antiproton]]s, cold [[positron]]s, and first made the ingredients of cold [[antihydrogen]] to interact. ATRAP members also pioneered accurate [[hydrogen]] [[spectroscopy]] and first observed hot antihydrogen atoms.

===Positron production and accumulation===

ATRAP is a collaboration between physicists around the world with the goal of creating and experimenting with antihydrogen. ATRAP accumulates positrons emitted from a radioactive [[Sodium|&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na]] source. 
There are two effective ways to slow down the fast positrons by inelastic processes. The ATRAP collaboration initially chose a different method to ATHENA. The positrons which were emitted by the &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na were first slowed down with a 10&amp;nbsp;µm thick titanium foil and then passed through a 2&amp;nbsp;µm thick tungsten crystal.
Within the crystal there is a possibility that a positively charged positron and a negatively charged electron form a [[Rydberg atom|Rydberg]] [[Positronium]] atom. In this process, the positrons lose much of their energy so that it is no longer necessary (as in ATHENA) to decelerate further with collisions in gas. When the loosely bound Rydberg positronium atom reaches the Penning trap at the end of the apparatus, it is [[Ionization|ionized]] and the positron is caught in the trap.

Since this method of positron accumulation was not particularly efficient, ATRAP switched to a Surko-type buffer gas accumulator as is now standard in experiments requiring large numbers of positrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positrons.ucsd.edu/publications.php|title=UC San Diego: Department of Physics - Surko Plasma Research Group|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the storage of the largest ever number of positrons in an Ioffe trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitzakerley  |first1=D.

Unlike ATHENA, ATRAP has not yet been terminated and can be continuously improved and expanded. ATRAP now has a [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|Ioffe trap]], which can store the electrically neutral antihydrogen using a magnetic quadrupole field. This is possible because the magnetic moment of antihydrogen is non-zero. It is intended that laser spectroscopy will be performed on antihydrogen stored in the Ioffe trap.

==ASACUSA==
'''ASACUSA''' (Atomic Spectroscopy And Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons) is an experiment testing for [[CPT-symmetry]] by laser spectroscopy of [[antiprotonic helium]] and microwave spectroscopy of the [[hyperfine structure]] of [[antihydrogen]]. It also measures atomic and nuclear [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] of antiprotons on various targets at extremely low energies.&lt;ref&gt;http://asacusa.web.cern.ch/ASACUSA/&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson for the experiment is [[Ryugo S. Hayano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]]. It was originally proposed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asacusa.web.cern.ch/ASACUSA/home/general.html|title=ASACUSA - General|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://asacusa.web.cern.ch/ASACUSA/home/spsc/proposal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==ALPHA==
[[File:AlphaCollaboration.png|thumb|200px|right|ALPHA Logo]]

The '''ALPHA''' experiment is designed to trap neutral [[antihydrogen]] in a [[magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]], and conduct experiments on them. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cold antihydrogen: a new frontier in fundamental physics |last=Madsen |first=N. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=368 |date=2010 |pages=3671–82 |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/368/1924/3671.full.pdf |doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0026 |pmid=20603376|bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.3671M |issue=1924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ALPHA collaboration consists of some former members of the [[#ATHENA|ATHENA collaboration]] (the first group to produce cold antihydrogen, in 2002), as well as a number of new members.

===ALPHA physics===
ALPHA faces several challenges. Magnetic traps – wherein neutral atoms are trapped using their [[magnetic moment]]s – are notoriously weak; only atoms with kinetic energies equivalent to less than one [[kelvin]] may be trapped. The cold antihydrogen created first in 2002 by the [[#ATHENA|ATHENA]] and the [[#ATRAP|ATRAP]] collaborations was produced by merging cold [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] of [[positron]]s (also called antielectrons) and [[antiproton]]s. While this method has been quite successful, it creates antiatoms with kinetic energies too large to be trapped. Furthermore, to do [[laser spectroscopy]] on these anti-atoms, it is important that they are in their [[ground state]], something which does not seem to be the case for the majority of the anti-atoms created thus far.

Antiprotons are received by the Antiproton Decelerator and are 'mixed' with positrons from a specially-designed positron accumulator in a versatile [[Penning trap]]. The central region where the mixing and thus antihydrogen formation takes place is surrounded by a [[superconducting]] octupole magnet and two axially separated short solenoids "mirror-coils" to form a "minimum-[[B-field|B]]" magnetic trap. Once trapped [[antihydrogen]] can be subjected to detailed study and be compared to [[hydrogen]].

In order to detect trapped [[antihydrogen]] atoms ALPHA also comprises a silicon vertex detector. This cylindrically shaped detector consists of three layers of silicon panels (strips). Each panel acts as a position sensitive detector for charged particles passing through. By recording how the panels are excited ALPHA can reconstruct the tracks of charged particles traveling through their detector. When an antiproton annihilates (disintegrates) the process typically results in the emission of 3-4 charged [[pion]]s. These can be observed by the ALPHA detector and by reconstructing their tracks through the detector their origin, and thus the location of the annihilation, can be determined. These tracks are quite distinct from the tracks of cosmic rays which are also detected but are of high energy and pass straight through the detector. By carefully analyzing the tracks ALPHA distinguishes between cosmic rays and antiproton annihilations.

To detect successful trapping the ALPHA trap magnet that created the minimum B-field was designed to allow it to be quickly and repeatedly de-energized. The currents' decay  during de-energization has a characteristic time of 9 ms, orders of magnitude faster than similar systems. This fast turn-off and the ability to suppress false signal from cosmic rays should allow ALPHA to detect the release of even a single trapped antihydrogen atom during de-energization of the trap.

In order to make antihydrogen cold enough to be trapped the ALPHA collaboration has implemented a novel technique, well known from atomic physics, called evaporative cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

State-of-the art minimum-B traps like the one ALPHA comprises have depths in temperature units of order one Kelvin. As no readily available techniques exist to cool antihydrogen, the constituents must be cold and kept cold for the formation. Antiprotons and positrons are not easily cooled to cryogenic temperatures and the implementation of evaporative cooling is thus an important step towards antihydrogen trapping.

ALPHA is presently studying the gravitational properties of antimatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/universe-shouldn-t-exist-cern-physicists-conclude|title=Universe shouldn’t exist, CERN physicists conclude|date=2017-10-23|publisher=Cosmos Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A preliminary experiment in 2013 found that the [[gravitational mass]] of [[antihydrogen atom]]s was between -65 and 110 times their [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], leaving considerable room for refinement using larger numbers of colder antihydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alpha.web.cern.ch/news|title=ALPHA probes antimatter gravity|publisher=CERN/Alpha experiment|date=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2787|title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen|author=The ALPHA Collaboration &amp; A.

'''AEgIS''' ('''A'''ntimatter '''E'''xperiment: '''g'''ravity, '''I'''nterferometry, '''S'''pectroscopy), is an experiment currently being set up at the Antiproton Decelerator.

===AEgIS physics===

AEgIS would attempt to determine if [[gravity]] affects [[antimatter]] in the same way it affects [[matter]] by testing its effect on an [[antihydrogen]] beam. The first phase of the experiment creates antihydrogen: antiprotons from the Antiproton Decelerator are coupled with [[positron]]s, making a pulse of horizontally-travelling antihydrogen atoms. These atoms are sent through a series of [[diffraction grating]]s, ultimately hitting a surface and thus [[annihilate|annihilating]]. The points where the antihydrogen annihilates are measured with a precise detector. Areas behind the gratings are shadowed, while those behind the slits are not. The annihilation points reproduce a periodic pattern of light and shadowed areas. Using this pattern, it can be measured how many atoms of different velocities drop during horizontal flight. Therefore, the Earth's gravitational force on antihydrogen can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;

The GBAR project, aims to measure the free fall acceleration of ultracold neutral anti [[Antihydrogen|hydrogen atoms]] in the terrestrial [[gravitational field]].

'''BASE''' ('''B'''aryon '''A'''ntibaryon '''S'''ymmetry '''E'''xperiment), is a multinational collaboration at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) of CERN.

The goal of the Japanese/German BASE collaboration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://base.web.cern.ch| title= official BASE website}}&lt;/ref&gt; are high-precision investigations of the fundamental properties of the antiproton, namely the charge-to-mass ratio and the magnetic moment. To this end single antiprotons are stored in an advanced [[Penning trap]] system, which has a double-trap system at its core. It consists of a precision trap and an analysis trap. The precision trap is for high precision frequency measurements, the analysis trap has a strong magnetic field inhomogeneity superimposed, which is used for single particle [[Spin-flip|spin flip]] [[spectroscopy]]. By measuring the spin flip rate as a function of the frequency of an externally applied magnetic-drive, a resonance curve is obtained. Together with a measurement of the cyclotron frequency, the magnetic moment is extracted.

The BASE collaboration developed techniques to observe the first spin flips of a single trapped proton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ulmer |first1=S. |display-authors=etal. |title=Observation of Spin Flips with a Single Trapped Proton |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |date=20 June 2011 |volume=106 |issue=25 |pages=253001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.253001|bibcode=2011PhRvL.106y3001U |arxiv = 1104.1206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied the double-trap technique to measure the magnetic moment of the proton with a fractional precision of three parts in a billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mooser |first1=A. |display-authors=etal |year=2014 |title=Direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment of the proton |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=509 |issue=7502 |pages=596–599 |doi=10.1038/nature13388|bibcode=2014Natur.509..596M |arxiv = 1406.4888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being the most precise measurement of this fundamental property of the proton. The application of the technique to measure the magnetic moment of the antiproton with similar precision will improve the precision of this value by at least a factor of 1000, and will provide one of the most stringent tests of CPT invariance to date.

Located mostly in the Arctic [[North Pole|north polar]] region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].  It is partly covered by [[sea ice]] throughout the year and almost completely in [[winter]]. The Arctic Ocean's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]] and [[salinity]] vary seasonally as the [[Arctic ice pack|ice cover]] melts and freezes;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psc.apl.washington.edu/HLD/Lomo/OM2001AagaardWoodgate.pdf Some Thoughts on the Freezing and Melting of Sea Ice and Their Effects on the Ocean] K.

Retrieved 7 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low [[evaporation]], heavy [[fresh water]] inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.&lt;ref name=Pidwirny/&gt; The US [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.

==History==
Human habitation in the North American polar region goes back at least 50,000–17,000 years ago, during the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. At this time, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the [[Bering land bridge]] that joined [[Siberia]] to north west North America (Alaska), leading to the [[Settlement of the Americas]].&lt;ref name=Goebel&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497–502 |vauthors=Goebel T, Waters MR, O'Rourke DH|bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G |citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cambridge Bay Thule Site 1998-06-28.jpg|left|thumb|Thule archaeological site]]

Paleo-Eskimo groups included the [[Pre-Dorset]] (c. 3200 – 850 B.C.); the [[Saqqaq culture]] of Greenland (2500 – 800 B.C.); the [[Independence I culture|Independence I]] and [[Independence II culture]]s of northeastern Canada and Greenland (c. 2400 – 1800 B.C. and c. 800 – 1 B.C.); the [[Groswater]] of [[Labrador]] and [[Nunavik]], and the Dorset culture (500 B.C. to 1500 A.D.), which spread across Arctic North America. The Dorset were the last major Paleo-Eskimo culture in the Arctic before the migration east from present-day [[Alaska]] of the [[Thule people|Thule]], the ancestors of the modern Inuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18630.asp "The Prehistory of Greenland"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102219/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18630.asp |date=16 May 2008 }}, Greenland Research Centre, National Museum of Denmark, accessed 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thule Tradition]] lasted from about 200 B.C. to 1600 A.D. around the Bering Strait, the Thule people being the prehistoric ancestors of the Inuit who now live in Northern Labrador.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Park |first=Robert W. |title=Thule Tradition |website=Arctic Archaeology |publisher=Department of Anthropology, University of Waterloo |url=http://anthropology.uwaterloo.ca/ArcticArchStuff/thule.html |access-date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of [[History of Europe|European history]], the north [[polar region]]s remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille|Massilia]] recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called "[[Thule|Eschate Thule]]", where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance "on which one can neither walk nor sail". He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as "[[Iceberg|growler]]s" or "bergy bits"; his "Thule" was probably [[Norway]], though the [[Faroe Islands]] or [[Shetland]] have also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/pytheas.html Pytheas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918073035/http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/pytheas.html |date=18 September 2008 }} Andre Engels. Retrieved 16 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Map of the Arctic, 1780s - B&amp;W.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Emanuel Bowen]]'s 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".]]
Early [[Cartography|cartographer]]s were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in [[Johannes Ruysch]]'s [[:File:Ruysch map.jpg|map of 1507]], or [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s [[:File:Mercator Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.jpg|map of 1595]]) or water (as with [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s [[:File:UniversalisCosmographia.jpg|world map of 1507]]). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the [[Northern Sea Route]] or the [[Northwest Passage]], to "[[Cathay]]" ([[China]]) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as [[Johann Homann]] featured an extensive "Oceanus Septentrionalis" at the northern edge of their charts.

The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the [[Arctic Circle]] in this era added only small islands, such as [[Novaya Zemlya]] (11th century) and [[Spitzbergen]] (1596), though since these were often surrounded by [[Drift ice|pack-ice]], their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of [[Nautical chart|navigational chart]]s, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.

This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the [[Mythology|myth]] of an "[[Open Polar Sea]]" was persistent. [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]], longtime Second Secretary of the British [[Admiralty]], [[Arctic exploration|promoted exploration]] of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.

In the [[United States]] in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers [[Elisha Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook ''The Physical Geography of the Sea'' (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the [[polar ice cap]] is quite thick, and persists year-round.

[[Fridtjof Nansen]] was the first to make a [[Seamanship|nautical]] crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896. The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by [[Wally Herbert]] in 1969, in a [[dog sled]] expedition from [[Alaska]] to [[Svalbard]], with air support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/sir+wally+herbert+dies/558357 Channel 4, "Sir Wally Herbert dies" 13 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]], and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the [[icebreaker]] [[Arktika (1972 nuclear icebreaker)|NS Arktika]].

Since 1937, [[Soviet]] and Russian manned [[drifting ice station]]s have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean. Scientific settlements were established on the drift ice and carried thousands of kilometers by ice floes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html North Pole drifting stations (1930s–1980s)]. [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[World War II]], the European region of the Arctic Ocean was [[Arctic Ocean operations of World War II|heavily contested]]: the [[Arctic convoys|Allied commitment to resupply the Soviet Union via its northern ports]] was opposed by German naval and air forces.

Since 1954 commercial airlines have flown over the Arctic Ocean (see [[Polar route]]).

The ocean's Arctic shelf comprises a number of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], including the Canadian Arctic shelf, underlying the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], and the [[Continental shelf of Russia|Russian continental shelf]], which is sometimes simply called the "Arctic Shelf" because it is greater in extent. The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the [[Barents Shelf]], [[Chukchi Sea Shelf]] and [[Siberian Shelf]]. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement]]. The whole area is subject to international [[Territorial claims in the Arctic|territorial claims]].

===Underwater features===
An [[Mid-ocean ridge|underwater ridge]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], divides the deep sea [[Arctic Basin|North Polar Basin]] into two [[oceanic basin]]s: the [[Eurasian Basin]], which is between {{convert|4000|and|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and the [[Amerasian Basin]] (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} deep. The [[bathymetry]] of the ocean bottom is marked by [[fault block]] ridges, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[Oceanic trench|ocean deeps]], and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is {{convert|1038|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mariana Trench – Oceanography| work=www.marianatrench.com | url=http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm | date=4 April 2003| accessdate=2 December 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061207210451/http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm| archivedate= 7 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest point is [[Litke Deep]] in the Eurasian Basin, at {{convert|5450|m|abbr=on}}.

The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the [[Canada Basin]] (between Alaska/Canada and the [[Alpha Ridge]]), [[Makarov Basin]] (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), [[Amundsen Basin]] (between Lomonosov and [[Gakkel Ridge|Gakkel]] ridges), and [[Nansen Basin]] (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the [[Franz Josef Land]]).

In large parts of the Arctic Ocean, the top layer (about {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}}) is of lower salinity and lower temperature than the rest. It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams ([[Ob River|Ob]], [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Lena River|Lena]], [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]]), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called [[halocline]], in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|A [[copepod]]]]

Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.&lt;ref name=Tomczak&gt;[Regional Oceanography: An Introduction. Tomczak, Godfrey. Retrieved 18 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean.  Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the [[Eurasian]] side and anticyclonic in the [[Canadian Basin]].&lt;ref name=Talley&gt;{{cite book|title=Descriptive Physical Oceanography|author= Pickard, George L. and Emery, William J. |publisher=Pergamon|isbn=9781483278773|year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around {{convert|900|m|abbr=off}} depth.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt; It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow [[Bering Strait]] at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the [[Chukchi Sea]].&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/arctic-ocean-circulation-going-around-at-the-102811553 Arctic Ocean Circulation: Going Around at the Top of the World. Retrieved 2 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm/s.&lt;ref name=Talley/&gt; This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a [[halocline]].&lt;ref name=Polar&gt;[http://polardiscovery.whoi.edu/arctic/circulation.html  Arctic Ocean Circulation]. Polar Discovery&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nares strait border (Kennedy channel).png|thumb|left| The [[Kennedy Channel]].]]
This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt;  Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.

In the depth range of {{convert|150|-|900|m|abbr=off}} is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the [[North Atlantic Current]] enters through the [[Fram Strait]], cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the [[Arctic Basin]] counter-clockwise.  This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; It flows slowly, at about 0.02&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt; Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt;  When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the [[Beaufort Gyre]]. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.&lt;ref name=Polar/&gt;

The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from {{convert|150|-|200|m|abbr=off}}. The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the [[Siberian Shelf]].&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt; As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3–0.6&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt; Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.

Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard Island]], which is about {{convert|2,700|m|abbr=off}} deep and {{convert|350|km|abbr=off}} wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the [[Coriolis force]], which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the [[Norwegian Current]] on the eastern side.&lt;ref name=Tomczak/&gt; Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the [[Hudson Strait]] (1–2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses.  With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year.  For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the [[Siberian High]] system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.&lt;ref name=Talley/&gt; During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a [[sea level pressure]] (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the [[Icelandic Low]], which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to center over the North Pole in the summer.  These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months.  There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=Talley/&gt;

[[Iceberg]]s occasionally break away from northern [[Ellesmere Island]], and icebergs are formed from [[glacier]]s in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. Icebergs are not sea ice but may becoming embedded in the pack ice. Icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] is one of the most famous. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the [[superstructure]] of ships are subject to [[Icing (nautical)|icing]] from October to May.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Before the advent of modern [[icebreaker]]s, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the ''[[SS Baychimo|Baychimo]]'' drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).

The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of [[seawater]]. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach {{Convert|−1.8|C}} before freezing occurs.

The [[density]] of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper {{convert|100|–|150|m|abbr=on}} of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/intro.html |title=NSIDC sea ice |accessdate=10 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117114629/http://nsidc.org/seaice/intro.html |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]].

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about {{convert|20|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} over the frozen ocean.

The detector allows to assess cumulative mass concentration of suspended particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air. Notation: 1 – air inlet; 2 – cycling ribbon; 3 and 4 – beta radiation sources; D1 and D2 – beta radiation detectors; 5 – air pump; 6 – air exhaust.]]

'''Beta attenuation monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is a widely used [[air monitoring]] technique employing the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[beta radiation]] by solid particles extracted from air flow. This technique allows for the detection of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|PM]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|PM]]&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, which are monitored by most air pollution regulatory agencies. The main principle is based on a kind of [[Bouguer's law|Bouguer]] ([[Lambert–Beer law|Lambert–Beer]]) law: the amount by which the flow of beta radiation ([[electron]]s) is attenuated by a [[Solid|solid matter]] is exponentially dependent on its [[mass]] and not on any other feature (such as [[density]], chemical composition or some [[optical]] or [[electrical]] properties) of this matter.&lt;ref name=Liberti&gt;A. Liberti. Modern Methods for Air Pollution Monitoring. ''Pure and Applied Chemistry'' '''1975''', ''44''(''3''). – pp. 519–534.&lt;/ref&gt; So, the air is drawn from outside of the detector through an "infinite" (cycling) ribbon made from some [[Air filter|filter]]ing material so that the particles are collected on it. There are two sources of beta radiation placed one before and one after the region where air flow passes through the ribbon leaving particles on it; and there are also two detectors on the opposite side of the ribbon, facing the detectors. The sources' [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] and detectors' [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] being the same (or corrected with appropriate [[Calibration curve|calibration]] lookup table), the intensity of beta rays detected by one of detectors is compared to that of the other. Thus one can deduce how much mass has the ribbon acquired upon being exposed to air flow; knowing the drain velocity, actual particle mass concentration in air could be assessed.

The radiation source can be a gas chamber, filled with &lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;[[Kripton|Kr]] gas, or a pieces of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;[[Carbon-14|C]]-rich polymer plastic, such as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;''Compendium of Methods for the Determination of Inorganic Compounds in Ambient Air. Chapter IO-1. Continuous measurement of PM10 suspended particulate matter (SPM) in ambient air.'' EPA:Cincinnati, 1999. – 7 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OPSIS&gt;Enviro Technology Services. Product overview: OPSIS SM200 PM10 PM2.5 Sampler. Online: http://www.et.co.uk/products/air-quality-monitoring.&lt;/ref&gt; Detector is simply a [[Geiger counter|Geiger–Mueller counter]]. The particulate matter content measured is affected by the [[moisture]] content in the air, unfortunately.&lt;ref name=BV&gt;''UK Equivalence Programme for Monitoring of Particulate Matter. Final report.'' Bureau Veritas: London, 2006. – 126 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

To discriminate between particle of different sizes (e. g., between PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), some preliminary separation could be accomplished, for example, by [[Cyclonic separation|cyclone]] battery.

A similar method exists, where instead of beta particle flow an [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy|X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopic]] monitoring is applied on the either side of air flow contact with the ribbon. This allows to obtain not only cumulative measurement of particle mass, but also to detect their average chemical composition (technique works for [[potassium]] and elements heavier than it).&lt;ref&gt;Enviro Technology Services.

[[Image:Insular Omineca arcs.png|thumb|right|The Bridge River Ocean between North America and the Insular Islands]]
The '''Bridge River Ocean''' was an ancient [[ocean]] that existed between [[North America]] and the [[Insular Islands]] during the [[Paleozoic]] time. Similar to the earlier [[Slide Mountain Ocean]], the Bridge River Ocean had a [[subduction zone]] on the ocean floor called the [[Insular Trench]]. The closure of the Bridge River Ocean occurred about 115 million years ago, during the mid [[Cretaceous]] period.

The namesake of the Bridge River Ocean is the [[Bridge River]] in the [[Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]], about 100 miles north of the city of [[Vancouver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6354">'''CLaMS''' ('''C'''hemical '''La'''grangian '''M'''odel of the '''S'''tratosphere) is a modular [[chemistry transport model]] (CTM) system developed at [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], [[Germany]].  CLaMS was first described by McKenna et al. (2000a,b) and was expanded into three dimensions by Konopka et al. (2004).  CLaMS has been employed in recent European field campaigns [[THESEO]], [[EUPLEX]], [[TROCCINOX]] [[SCOUT-O3]], and [[RECONCILE]] with a focus on simulating [[ozone depletion]] and [[water vapour]] transport.   

Major strengths of CLaMS in comparison to other CTMs are 
# its applicability for [[reverse domain filling]] studies
# its [[anisotropic]] mixing scheme
# its integrability with arbitrary observational data
# its comprehensive chemistry scheme

== CLaMS gridding ==

Unlike other CTMs (e.g. [[SLIMCAT]], [[REPROBUS]]), CLaMS operates on a Lagrangian model grid (see section about model grids in [[general circulation model]]):  an air parcel is described by three space coordinates and a time coordinate.  The [[time evolution]] path that an air parcels traces in space is called a [[trajectory]].  A specialised mixing scheme ensures that physically realistic [[diffusion]] is imposed on an ensemble of
trajectories in regions of high [[wind shear]]. 

CLaMS operates on arbitrarily resolved horizontal grids.  The space coordinates are [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[potential temperature]].

== CLaMS Hierarchy ==

CLaMS is composed of four modules and several preprocessors. The four modules are
# a trajectory module
# a box chemistry module
# a Lagrangian mixing module
# a Lagrangian sedimentation scheme

=== Trajectory module ===
Integration of trajectories with 4th order  [[Runge-Kutta method]], integration time step 30 minutes. Vertical displacement of trajectories is calculated from radiation budget.  

=== Box chemistry module ===

Chemistry is based on the [[ASAD]] chemistry code of the [[University of Cambridge]].  More than 100 chemical reactions involving 40+ chemical
species are considered.  Integration time step is 10 minutes, species
can be combined into chemical families to facilitate integration.  The
module includes a radiative transfer model for the determination of
photolysis rates. The module also includes heterogeneous reactions on
NAT, ice and liquid particle surfaces.

=== Lagrangian mixing ===
Mixing is based on grid deformation of quasi uniform air parcel
distributions.  The contraction or elongation factors of the distances
to neighboring air parcels are examined: if a critical elongation
(contraction) is reached, new air parcels are introduced (taken away).
This way, anisotropic diffusion is simulated in a physically realistic
manner.

=== Lagrangian sedimentation ===

Lagrangian sedimentation is calculated by following individual nitric
acid trihydrate (NAT) particles that may grow or shrink by the uptake
or release of HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from/to the gas phase. These particle parcels are
simulated independently from the Lagrangian air parcels. Their
trajectories are determined using the horizontal winds and their
vertical settling velocity that depends on the size of the individual
particles.  NAT particles are nucleated assuming a constant nucleation
rate and they evaporate where temperatures grow too high.  With this,
a vertical redistribution of HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (denitrification and
renitrification) is determined.

== CLaMS data sets ==

A [[chemical transport model]] does not simulate the dynamics of the atmosphere.  For CLaMS, the following meteorological data sets have been used
*  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([[ECMWF]]), Predictions, Analyses, ERA-15, [[ERA-40]]
*  United Kingdom [[Met Office]] (UKMO)
*  European Centre Hamburg Atmospheric Model (ECHAM4), in the DLR version

To initialize the chemical fields in CLaMS, data from a large variety of instruments have provided data.
* on satellite (CRISTA, MIPAS, MLS, HALOE, ILAS, ...), 
* on aircraft and balloons (HALOX, FISH, Mark IV, BONBON...)

If no observations are present, the chemical fields can be initialised
from two-dimensional chemical models, [[chemistry-climate model]]s,
climatologies, or from correlations between chemical species or
chemical species and dynamical variables.

[[File:Carbon Disclosure Project logo.svg|thumb|Carbon Disclosure Project logo]]
The '''CDP''' (formerly the '''Carbon Disclosure Project''') is an organisation based in the United Kingdom which supports companies and cities to disclose the environmental impact of major corporations. It aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm, and drive disclosure, insight and action towards a sustainable economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdp.net/ar/articles/climate/environmental-disclosure-from-transparency-to-transformation|title=Environmental disclosure: from transparency to transformation | website=CDP|language=ar|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 over 6,000 companies have publicly disclosed environmental information through CDP. 

== Background ==
CDP piggybacked on GRI’s concept of environmental disclosure in 2002, focusing on individual companies rather than on nations. At the time CDP had just 35 [[institutional investor|investor]]s signing its request for climate information and 245 companies responding. Today, nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions are reported through CDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdp.net/en/investor/ghg-emissions-dataset|title=GHG Emissions Dataset |website=CDP|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDP works with investors, companies, cities, states and regions towards a well below 2 degree, water secure world. 

Some corporations have higher [[greenhouse gas]] emissions than individual nation states. Some leading companies have moved to become carbon neutral, but for others there is the scope to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas-emissions through the adoption of energy-efficiency methods and business planning.

== Mechanism ==
CDP works with over 6000 [[corporations]], as well as over 550 cities and 100 states and regions to help them ensure that an effective [[carbon emissions]] reductions strategy is made integral to their operations. The collection of self-reported data from thousands of companies is supported by over 800 institutional investors with US$100 trillion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Pages/About-Us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CDP operates from [[Berlin]], [[New York City|New York]], [[London]] and has partners in 18 of the world's major economies which help deliver the programme globally. It has:

* Established the most comprehensive collection of self-reported environmental data in the world, accounting for over 20% of global [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] emissions.
* Started to establish a globally used standard for emissions and energy reporting
* Examined the 250 major electric utilities globally (high GHG emitters)
* Obtained backing from [[blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] investors including [[HSBC]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Bank of America]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[American International Group]], and State Street Corp.
* Active staff or partner organisations in the United States, China, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Canada, India, Brazil, [[Nordic region]], South Africa, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand, among others
* Works with corporations including WalMart, Tesco, Cadbury Schweppes, Procter and Gamble, and many others to measure emissions through the supply chain.

Much of the data [[wikt:elicited|elicited]] has never been collected before. This information is helpful to investors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sri-connect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=475:faq-do-investors-use-cdp-data&amp;catid=132:take-control-of-sri-communications&amp;Itemid=1112&lt;/ref&gt; corporations, and regulators in making informed decisions on taking action towards a sustainable economy by measuring and understanding their environmental impact and taking meaningful steps to address and limit their risk to climate change, deforestation and water security. 

== CDP's Programs ==

CDP operates in most major economies worldwide and channels information and progress through individual programs. These are: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150627221416/https://www.cdp.net/en-us/programmes/pages/climate-change-programs.aspx Climate Change], [https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101026/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/cdp-water-disclosure.aspx Water], [https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/CDP-Supply-Chain.aspx Supply Chain], [https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100930/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/forests.aspx Forests] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20150703021720/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/CDP-Cities.aspx Cities]. Its  [https://web.archive.org/web/20150526200327/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/Initiatives-CDP-Carbon-Action.aspx Carbon Action] initiative encourages investors to accelerate carbon reduction in high emitting industries and to implement emissions reducing projects that generate positive return on investment.

=== Climate Change ===

CDP's climate change program aims to reduce companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change risk. CDP requests information on climate risks and low carbon opportunities from the world’s largest companies on behalf of over 800 institutional investor signatories with a combined US$100 trillion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/CDP-Investors.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526212355/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/CDP-Investors.aspx |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===

In 2014, 573 investors used the CDP Water program, collectively representing US$60 trillion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/CDP-Global-Water-Report-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The program motivates companies to disclose and reduce their environmental impacts by using the power of investors and companies. 

=== Supply Chain ===

In 2016, some 90 organizations, representing over US$2.5 trillion of purchasing power requested that their suppliers disclose information on how they are approaching climate and water risks and opportunities. Data was gathered from over 4,000 suppliers worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/CDP-Supply-Chain-Report-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who reported over US$12 billion worth of savings from emission reduction activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3blmedia.com/News/Forging-Missing-Link-What-2017-CDP-Supply-Chain-Report-Says-About-Supplier-Engagement|title=Forging the Missing Link: What the 2017 CDP Supply Chain Report Says About Supplier Engagement|last=BSR|website=3blmedia.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Forests ===

CDP's forests program acts on behalf of over 290 signatory investors representing over US$20 trillion in assets. CDP collects information from companies through the lens of the four agricultural commodities responsible for most deforestation: timber, palm oil, cattle and soy. CDP’s forests program was first set up by the Global Canopy Programme [[Global Canopy Programme]] which remains a prime funder for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/forests.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100930/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/forests.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cities ===
[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728181527/https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/CDP-Cities.aspx CDP Cities] provides the global platform for cities to measure, manage and disclose their environmental data. More than 500 cities are now measuring and disclosing environmental data on an annual basis. The potential and need for this program is enormous since soon over half of the world’s population will live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Joel, E|title=The Human Population: the next half century|journal=Science|year=2003|volume=302|pages=1172–1175|doi=10.1126/science.1088665|pmid=14615528|issue=5648}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 March 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CDP Cities provides an easy to use global platform based upon a simple questionnaire that allows city governments to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emission data. One of the greatest values of the annual report, first released in June 2011, is to city leaders who can identify peers who are addressing similar risks and issues with new and innovative strategies for reducing carbon emissions and for mitigating risk from climate change.

=== Carbon Action Initiative ===

Carbon Action is an investor-led initiative which shows how companies in investment portfolios are managing carbon emissions and energy efficiency. 

Over 300 investors with US$25 trillion in assets under management ask the world’s highest emitting companies to take three specific actions in response to climate change:

* Make emissions reductions (year-on-year); 
* Publicly disclose emission reduction targets; and
* ROI-positive investments in projects

In 2016, the Carbon Action request went to over 1300 of the highest emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/Initiatives-CDP-Carbon-Action.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526200327/https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Programmes/Pages/Initiatives-CDP-Carbon-Action.aspx |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDP launched a new research series at the beginning of 2015, taking a sector by sector approach.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.responsible-investor.com/home/article/cdp_auto_investor_research/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership Indices ==

CDP recognizes companies with high-quality disclosure in its annual scoring process, with top companies making it onto CDP's A-List.

Scores are calculated according to a standardized methodology which measures whether and how well, a company responds to each question. A company goes through four main steps, starting with disclosure of their current position, moving to awareness which looks at whether a company is conscious of it environmental impact, to management, and finally leadership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdp.net/en/guidance/guidance-for-companies|title=Guidance for companies |website=CDP|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A high CDP score is usually indicative of a company’s high environmental awareness, advanced sustainability governance and leadership to address climate change &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.esg.adec-innovations.com/blog/how-does-positive-cdp-performance-drive-positive-financial-performance|title=How Does Positive CDP Performance Drive Positive Financial Performance|website=esg.adec-innovations.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Carl N. Hodges''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Atmospheric physics|atmospheric physicist]] and founder of the [[Seawater foundation]]. He is the main driving force behind ideas of using sea canals to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] [[desert]]s.

The idea is to grow sea farms in the artificial sea canals using plants like [[salicornia]] and [[mangrove]], and introducing fish and shrimp. This is thought to be able to resurrect ecosystems, create jobs, wealth and food sources. This has been proposed as a solution for [[starvation]] and even being able to counter the [[effects of global warming]] and rising sea levels.

'''Charlton Ogburn Jr.''' (15 March 1911, [[Atlanta, Georgia]] – 19 October 1998, [[Beaufort, South Carolina]]) was an American journalist and author, most notably of memoirs and non-fiction works. Before he established himself as a writer he served in the US army, and then as a State Department official, specialising in South-East Asian affairs.

In his later years he was best known as an advocate of the [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship]], leading the revival of public interest in the theory in the 1980s. He wrote over a dozen books and numerous magazine articles.

==Life==
Ogburn was the son of lawyer [[Charlton Greenwood Ogburn]] and writer Dorothy Ogburn née Stevens. His uncle was the sociologist [[William Fielding Ogburn]]. He was raised in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[New York City]], graduated from [[Harvard]] in 1932 and wrote and worked in publishing.&lt;ref name = em/&gt; During [[World War II]] he joined [[military intelligence]], serving in the East Asian theater, most notably as communications officer for [[Merrill's Marauders]]. He left with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. He returned to the US to begin a career with the [[U.S. State Department|State Department]]. From 1946 to 1949, he worked at the Division of South-East Asian Affairs. He went on to work at the Department of State. He held several posts, including Political Advisor to the United States Delegation to the United Nations Security Council's Committee of Good Offices for the Indonesian Dispute.&lt;ref name = em/&gt;

Ogburn was among the first State Department officials to explicitly oppose the growing U.S. involvement in the [[First Indochina War]], which would later evolve into the [[Vietnam war]]. In 1950 he wrote a memo in which he predicted that [[Ho Chi Minh]] would not "wilt" under the impact of American aid to the colonial French forces, and that any military victory would simply send Ho's troops "underground until a more propitious occasion presented itself".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Atwood Lawrence and Fredrik Logevall, ''The first Vietnam War: Colonial Conflict and Cold War Crisis'', Harvard University Press, 2007, p. 342. The authors call "prescient" Ogburn's early critique of the assumptions guiding U.S. policy.&lt;/ref&gt; Ogburn also unsuccessfully opposed American policy of supporting the Vietnamese monarchy of [[Bảo Đại]].

After the success of his story "Merrill's Marauders", a ''Harper's Magazine'' cover story in 1957, [[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Bros.]] offered an advance for a book and he quit the government to write full-time in 1957.&lt;ref name = em/&gt;

He committed suicide in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/10/22/charlton-ogburn-dies-at-87/5d93f642-c9f7-4570-8ecd-41d7a8efc4fd/|title=CHARLTON OGBURN DIES AT 87|date=1998-10-22|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogburn's papers are archived at Emory University.&lt;ref name = em&gt;[http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8zqjk Emory University: Charlton Ogburn papers, 1898-1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Ogburn was married twice. With his first wife, he had one son, who was also called Charlton, (referred to as Charlton Ogburn, III). The couple divorced, after which Charlton III's name was changed by his mother to William Fielding Ogburn. He was later known as Will Aldis. Ogburn married Vera M. Weidman in 1951, with whom he fathered two daughters, Nyssa and Holly Ogburn.&lt;ref name = em/&gt;

==Works==

===The Marauders===

For most of Ogburn's life, his best-known work was ''The Marauders'' (1959), a first person account of the [[Burma Campaign]] in [[World War II]]. It was later filmed as ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]'' (1962).

Versions of the following [[quotation]] are frequently misattributed to [[Petronius]].&lt;ref name = brow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael, "Autobiograbbical Voices (1, 2, 3) and Mosaic Memory Experimental Sondages in the (Post)modern World", in Ashley, Gilmore, Peters (ed), ''Autobiography &amp; Postmodernism'', University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, MA., 1994, p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Michaelson, ''Sun Tzu: The Art of War for Managers: 50 Strategic Rules'', Adams Media, Avon, MA., 2001, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;  
:We trained hard ... but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.

In fact it is from the magazine article "Merrill's Marauders" (''Harper's Magazine'', 1957) that earned Ogburn his book contract.&lt;ref name = brow&gt;Brown, D.S., "Petronius or Ogburn", ''Public Administration Review'', 38: 3, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt; In full, it reads thus:
:We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganized. Presumably the plans for our employment were being changed. I was to learn later in life that, perhaps because we are so good at organizing, we tend as a nation to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization.

===''The Winter Beach'' and other works===

Ogburn won the [[John Burroughs Medal]] in 1967 for ''The Winter Beach''. His account of travels along the largely deserted northeastern shore is considered a classic of nature-writing. [[Stewart Udall]] wrote, "In ''The Winter Beach'', literary courage, eloquence and wisdom have, I think, brought about a triumph."&lt;ref name = ny&gt;''The New York Times Book Review'', Volume 71, 1966, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Tory Peterson]] said, "Ogburn has written a most extraordinary book... he is a very sensitive, reflective writer in the Thoreauvian tradition".&lt;ref name = ny/&gt; In 1976, his book, ''The Adventure of Birds'' was published with drawings by Matthew Kalmenoff.

Ogburn also wrote fiction. He began his literary career with "The White Falcon", a story published by Houghton Mifflin in 1955. His short novel ''The Bridge'' was a work of [[young adult fiction]] with illustrations by [[Evaline Ness]]. It told the story of an elderly man and his teenage granddaughter battling to preserve their way of life, threatened by greedy relatives and a dangerous storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1957nov16-00088?View=PDF ''The Saturday Review'', November 16, 1957, pp. 88-92]&lt;/ref&gt; Another book for young adults was ''Big Caesar'', illustrated by [[Joe Krush]], a story about a boy's interest in an old truck. In 1965 he published ''The Gold of the River Sea'', a novel based on his early experiences traveling in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;John W.

Today Ogburn may be known best for several books and articles on the [[Shakespeare authorship]] question, continuing the passion of his parents, who had written several books on the topic including ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083810/http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/Star/toc.htm This Star of England: "William Shakes-speare" Man of the Renaissance]'' (Coward-McCann, 1952). Ogburn junior's last and most well-known book, ''The Mysterious William Shakespeare: The Myth and the Reality'' (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1984), led directly to an appearance on [[William F. Buckley]]'s ''Firing Line'', followed by a 1987 ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary on the authorship question narrated by Al Austin, and mock trials in America and Britain.&lt;ref name = shap/&gt;

More than a thousand people attended the [[moot court]] case sponsored by [[American University]] in 1987. Three [[US Supreme Court]] justices —[[John Paul Stevens]], [[Harry Blackmun]] and [[William J. Brennan]]—heard arguments in favor of the orthodox view of Shakespearean authorship and the [[Oxfordian theory]] that attributes the works to [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] (1550–1604). Although the justices held in favor of the traditional account of authorship, Justice Stevens later wrote an article supporting Ogburn's position, "The Shakespeare Canon of Statutory Construction", ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'' (1991).

Ogburn's book reinvigorated the [[Oxfordian theory]];&lt;ref name = shap&gt;Shapiro, James (2010). ''Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?''. UK edition: Faber and Faber {{ISBN|978-0-571-23576-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; inspired a succession of articles in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (1988), ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' (1991), and ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' (1999) and provoked a nationally broadcast three-hour teleconference on the topic ''Uncovering Shakespeare: An Update'' with moderator [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]].

'''Comet ISON''', formally known as '''C/2012 S1''', was a [[sungrazing comet]] discovered on 21 September 2012 by [[Vitaly Nevsky]] (Виталий Невский, [[Vitebsk]], [[Belarus]]) and [[Artyom Novichonok]] (Артём Новичонок, [[Kondopoga]], [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name="Trigo-Rodriguez2013"/&gt; The discovery was made using the {{convert|0.4|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope|reflector]] of the [[International Scientific Optical Network]] (ISON) near [[Kislovodsk]], Russia.&lt;ref name="Remanzacco"/&gt; Data processing was carried out by automated asteroid-discovery program CoLiTec.&lt;ref name="NAS20121012"/&gt; [[Precovery]] images by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] from 28 December 2011 and by [[Pan-STARRS]] from 28 January 2012 were quickly located.&lt;ref name="MPEC2012-S63"/&gt; Follow-up observations were made on 22 September by a team from [[Remanzacco]] Observatory in Italy using the [[iTelescope]] network.&lt;ref name="Remanzacco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="universetoday1"/&gt; The discovery was announced by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 24 September.&lt;ref name="MPEC2012-S63"/&gt; Observations by [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] in January 2013 suggested that Comet ISON's [[comet nucleus|nucleus]] was around {{convert|5|km|0|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt; Later estimates were that the nucleus was only about {{convert|2|km|0|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="slate131121"/&gt; [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO) observations suggested the nucleus was smaller than {{convert|0.5|mi|1|order=flip|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="NASA131210"/&gt;

Shortly after Comet ISON's discovery, the media reported that it might become brighter than the [[full Moon]]. However, as events transpired, it never became bright enough to be readily visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, it broke apart as it passed close to the [[Sun]]. Reports on 28 November 2013 (the day of [[perihelion]] passage)&lt;ref name="CIOC131128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel131128"/&gt; indicated that Comet ISON had partially or completely disintegrated due to the Sun's heat and [[tidal force]]s. However, later that day CIOC (NASA ''C''omet ''I''SON ''O''bserving ''C''ampaign) members discovered a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]]-like feature, suggesting a small fragment of it may have survived perihelion.&lt;ref name="CIOC131128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel131128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SungrazerComets/status/406252924705071104 |title=Alright we're calling it... |work=Twitter.com |first=Karl |last=Battams |date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate131129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20131129"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/science/space/comet-presumed-dead-shows-new-life.html |title=Comet ISON, Presumed Dead, Shows New Life |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |date=29 November 2013 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November 2013, the coma dimmed to an [[apparent magnitude]] of 5.&lt;ref name="CIOC131129"/&gt; By the end of 30 November 2013, the coma had further faded to below naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.&lt;ref name=Battams131130/&gt; On 1 December, the coma continued to fade even further as it finished traversing the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]]'s view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/comet-isons-leftovers-fade-away-right-satellites-eyes-f2D11674277 |title=Comet ISON's leftovers fade away, right before a satellite's eyes |work=NBC News |first=Alan |last=Boyle |date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIOC131130"/&gt; On 2 December 2013, the CIOC announced that Comet ISON had fully disintegrated.&lt;ref name="CIOC131202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20131202"/&gt; The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] failed to detect fragments of ISON on 18 December 2013.&lt;ref name="HST131221"/&gt; On 8 May 2014, a detailed examination of the disintegration was published, suggesting that the comet fully disintegrated hours before perihelion.&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20140508" /&gt;

==Discovery==
During routine observations on 21 November 2012, Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok monitored areas of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] and [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] after their observations were delayed by clouded weather for much of the night. The team used ISON's {{convert|0.4|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope|reflector]] near [[Kislovodsk]], Russia, and [[CCD imaging]] to carry out their observations. Shortly after their session, Nevski processed data using CoLiTec, an automated asteroid discovery [[software]] program. In analysis he noted an unusually bright object with slow apparent movement, indicating a position outside the orbit of [[Jupiter]] based on the use of four 100-second CCD&amp;nbsp;exposures.&lt;ref name=Cometography&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cometography.com/lcomets/2012s1.html |title=C/2012 S1 (ISON) |work=Cometography.com |first=Gary W. |last=Kronk |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSA-ISON-About /&gt; At the time of discovery, the object's [[apparent magnitude]] ranged from 19.1 to as bright as 18.8.&lt;ref group="note" name="magnitude"&gt;Astronomical magnitudes decrease as brightness increases, from large positive values, through zero, to negative values for very bright objects.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegram3258&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.eps.harvard.edu/2012S1/cbet003238.txt |title=Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) |work=Central Bureau Electronic Telegrams |publisher=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, International Astronomical Union |date=24 September 2012 |id=Electronic Telegram No. 3258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group reported their discovery to the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]] as an asteroidal object, which was subsequently forwarded to the [[Minor Planet Center]]. However, the group later reported that the object had a cometary appearance with a [[coma (cometary)|coma]] approximately 8&amp;nbsp;[[minute of arc|arcseconds]] across.&lt;ref name=CSA-ISON-About&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.eps.harvard.edu/2012S1/ |title=Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) |work=Cometary Science Archive |publisher=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, International Astronomical Union |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object's position and cometary appearance was confirmed by several other unaffiliated observers, and as such the comet was named ''ISON'', after the international observational project and in accordance with [[International Astronomical Union]] naming guidelines.&lt;ref name=Cometography /&gt;&lt;ref name=CSA-ISON-About /&gt; Comet ISON was [[precovery|precovered]] in analysis of [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] imagery by G. V. Williams and [[Pan-STARRS]] imagery in [[Haleakalā]]. Precovery images from Mount Lemmon were first taken on 28 December 2011 and indicated that the comet had an estimated apparent magnitude ranging from 19.5 to 19.9. Images from Pan-STARRS were taken on 28 January 2012 and in those images the comet had an estimated apparent magnitude ranging from 19.8 to 20.6.&lt;ref name=Cometography /&gt;

==Orbit==
Comet ISON came to [[Apsis|perihelion]] (closest approach to the Sun) on 28 November 2013 at a distance of {{convert|0.0124|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the center point of the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPEC2013-W16"/&gt; Accounting for the [[solar radius]] of {{convert|695500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Comet ISON passed approximately {{convert|1165000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name="Guardian20131013" /&gt; Its trajectory appeared to be [[Hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]], which suggested that it was a dynamically new comet coming freshly from the [[Oort cloud]]&lt;ref name="astronomynow1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt; or even a candidate interstellar comet.&lt;ref name=hyperbolics&gt;{{cite journal |title=Where the Solar system meets the solar neighbourhood: patterns in the distribution of radiants of observed hyperbolic minor bodies |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] Letters |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=Carlos |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Raúl |last3=Aarseth |first3=Sverre J. |volume=476 |issue=1 |pages=L1-L5 |date=6 February 2018 |arxiv=1802.00778 |bibcode=2018MNRAS.476L...1D |doi=10.1093/mnrasl/sly019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near perihelion, a generic heliocentric [[two-body problem|two-body solution]] to the orbit suggests that the orbital period was around 400,000 years.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt; But for objects at such high eccentricity, the Sun's [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycentric coordinates]] are more stable than heliocentric coordinates.&lt;ref name="Kaib2009"/&gt; The orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the [[osculating orbit]] is computed at an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|center of mass of the Solar System]]. Using [[JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System|JPL Horizons]], the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 1 January 2050 generate a hyperbolic solution.&lt;ref name="barycenter"/&gt; On its closest approach, Comet ISON passed about {{convert|0.07248|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Mars on 1 October 2013, and the remnants of Comet ISON passed about {{convert|0.43|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth on 26 December 2013.&lt;ref name="jpl-close"/&gt;

Shortly after its discovery, similarities between the [[orbital elements]] of Comet ISON and the [[Great Comet of 1680]] led to speculation that there might be a connection between them.&lt;ref name="GC1680"/&gt; Further observations of ISON, however, showed that the two comets are not related.&lt;ref name="Kirch"/&gt;

When Earth passed near the orbit of Comet ISON on 14–15 January 2014, it was predicted that micron-sized dust particles blown by the Sun's radiation might cause a [[meteor shower]] or [[noctilucent cloud]]s;&lt;ref name="astrobob20121019" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiegert"/&gt; however, both events were considered unlikely. Because Earth only passed near Comet ISON's orbit, not through the tail, the chances that a meteor shower would occur were slim.&lt;ref name="sekharandasher2013"/&gt; In addition, meteor showers from long-period comets that make just one pass into the inner solar system are very rare, if ever recorded.&lt;ref name="nightskyfaq2"/&gt; The possibility that small particles left behind on the orbital path—almost one hundred days after the nucleus has passed—could form noctilucent clouds is also slim. No such events are known to have taken place in the past under similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="nightskyfaq2"/&gt;

==Brightness, observations, and visibility==
[[File:Comet ISON tracks through the constellations Gemini, Cancer and Leo as it falls toward the sun.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The path of Comet ISON from December 2012 through October 2013 as it passed through [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]], and [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]]]

At the time of its discovery, Comet ISON's [[apparent magnitude]] was approximately 18.8, far too dim to be seen with the [[naked eye]], but bright enough to be imaged by amateurs with large telescopes.&lt;ref name="space1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astronomy1"/&gt; It then followed the pattern of most comets and increased gradually in brightness on approach to the Sun.

At least a dozen spacecraft imaged Comet ISON.&lt;ref name="nasa20131202"/&gt; It was first imaged by the Swift and [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]] spacecraft in January and February 2013, and shown to be active with an extended tail. In April and May 2013 the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) measured Comet ISON's size, and the color, extent, and polarization of its emitted dust. The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] (SST) observed Comet ISON on 13 June and estimated [[carbon dioxide]] outgassing at about 1 million kilograms (2.2 million pounds) per day.&lt;ref name="spitzer"/&gt; From 5 June to 29 August 2013, Comet ISON had an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] less than 30 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt; No obvious rotational variability was detected by either Deep Impact, HST, or Spitzer. [[Amateur astronomer]] Bruce Gary recovered it on 12 August 2013 when it was 6 degrees above the [[horizon]] and 19 degrees from the Sun.&lt;ref name="Gary"/&gt; Due to it brightening more slowly than predicted, Comet ISON only became visible through small telescopes during early October 2013.&lt;ref name="universetoday130923"/&gt;

[[File:ISON-Cor2B-20131129 012400.png|thumb|[[STEREO|STEREO-B]] COR2 image of Comet ISON re-emerging ~7 hours after [[Apsis|perihelion]]]]

On 28 September 2013, NASA launched [[BRRISON]], a stratospheric science balloon carrying a {{convert|0.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} telescope and science instruments designed to capture images and data on Comet ISON from an altitude of {{convert|37|km|mi|abbr=on}}. However, about two and a half hours after launch, the telescope returned to its stowed position too quickly, driving it past a stow latch. Operators were unable to redeploy the telescope, resulting in mission failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=BRRISON |title=BRRISON |work=NASA Solar System Exploration |date=29 September 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2013, Comet ISON passed within {{convert|0.07|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} of Mars. Between 29 September and 2 October, the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO) detected Comet ISON.&lt;ref name="MRO"/&gt; The twin [[STEREO]] spacecraft began detecting Comet ISON in the second week of October.&lt;ref name="STEREO"/&gt; October 2013 images of Comet ISON displayed a greenish tint, probably attributable to the release of [[cyanogen]] and [[diatomic carbon]].&lt;ref name="ut Why Green"/&gt; On 31 October 2013, Comet ISON was detected with 10×50 [[binoculars]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez131031"/&gt;

On 14 November 2013, Comet ISON was reported to be visible to the naked eye by experienced observers located at dark sites.&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel131114"/&gt; It had an appearance similar to comet [[C/2013 R1]] that was also visible to the naked eye. Comet ISON was not expected to reach the naked-eye magnitude of 6 until mid-November,&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel-2013-06"/&gt; and was not expected to be observable by the general public until it brightened to about magnitude 4.&lt;ref name="universetoday130923"/&gt; On 17–18 November, when Comet ISON was brighter and much closer to the morning [[twilight]], it passed the bright star [[Spica]] in the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].&lt;ref name="UT131115"/&gt; But due to the [[full Moon]] and glow of twilight, Comet ISON had not become bright enough to be seen without optical aid by the general public. On 22 November, it started to drop below Mercury in the bright twilight.&lt;ref name="astrobob131111"/&gt; [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] started to view it on 27 November, first with the [[Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] coronograph.&lt;ref name="STEREO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soho.esac.esa.int//data/realtime/sps/lasco/c3/2013/11/20131127_1606_c3_512.jpg |title=LASCO image dated 27 November 16:08 |work=ESA.int |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November ISON brightened to magnitude −2&lt;ref group="note" name="magnitude"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIOC131127"/&gt; and passed [[Delta Scorpii]].&lt;ref name="Musgrave131128"/&gt; Around the time it reached [[perihelion]] on 28 November, it might have become extremely bright if it had remained fully intact. However, predicting the brightness of a comet is difficult, especially one that passes so close to the Sun and is affected by the [[forward scatter]]ing of light. Originally, media sources predicted that it might become brighter than the full Moon,&lt;ref name="astronomynow1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist1"/&gt; but based on more recent observations, it was only expected to reach around [[apparent magnitude]] {{nowrap|−3 to −5}}, about the same brightness as [[Venus]].&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel-2013-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIOC"/&gt; In comparison, the brightest comet since 1935 was [[Comet Ikeya–Seki]] in 1965 at {{nowrap|magnitude −10}}, which was much brighter than Venus.&lt;ref name="brightest" /&gt; On 29 November 2013, Comet ISON had dimmed to magnitude 5 in the LASCO images.&lt;ref name="CIOC131129"/&gt; By the end of 30 November 2013, it had further faded to below naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.&lt;ref name=Battams131130&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SungrazerComets/status/406940937919533056 |title=If #ISON had a nucleus... |work=Twitter.com |first=Karl |last=Battams |date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HubbleSite-C2012S1-20130410.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Comet ISON, imaged by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] on 10 April 2013—near Jupiter's orbit;&lt;ref name="spacetel20130424"/&gt; also, enhanced (coma model ratio) version]]

In a February 2013 study, 1,897 observations were used to create a [[light curve]]. The resulting plot showed Comet ISON increasing its brightness relatively quickly at R{{sup|+4.35}}.{{Fix|date=March 2013|text=Unit?}}&lt;ref name="Ferrin2013" /&gt; If this had continued to perihelion, it would have reached {{nowrap|magnitude −17}}, brighter than the full Moon. It had since exhibited a "slowdown event", however, similar to the ones exhibited by many other [[Oort cloud]] comets, among them [[C/2011 L4]]. Therefore, Comet ISON's brightness increased less quickly than predicted and it did not become as bright as expected. Further observations suggested that, even if it had remained intact, it might only brighten to about {{nowrap|magnitude −6}}.&lt;ref name="CIOC" /&gt; It had been determined that it was a "baby comet" (i.e. an object with a photometric age less than four comet years).&lt;ref name="Ferrin2013" /&gt; The temperature at perihelion had been calculated to reach {{convert|2700|C|F}}, sufficient to melt iron. Additionally, it was within the [[Roche limit]], meaning it might disintegrate due to the Sun's gravity.

Comet ISON was expected to be brightest around the time it was closest to the Sun; but because it was less than 1° from the Sun at its closest, it would have been difficult to see against the Sun's glare.&lt;ref name="sky&amp;tel"/&gt; Comet ISON would have been well placed for observers in the northern hemisphere during mid to late December 2013.&lt;ref name="Dickinson" /&gt; If it had survived its perihelion passage fully intact, it might have remained visible to the naked eye until January 2014.&lt;ref name="astronomynow1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astronomy1"/&gt; As Comet ISON moved north on the celestial sphere it would have passed within two degrees of [[Polaris]] on 8 January.&lt;ref name="astronomy1" /&gt;

==Science results==
On 22 May 2014, the [[Eurasian Astronomical Society]] and [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]] published preliminary results of observations of the observed meteor shower of Comet ISON from January 2014. Scientists from Ukraine and Belarus were assisted by meteor observation groups around the world. The results confirmed that particles of Comet ISON, which likely [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimated]] at perihelion, entered Earth's atmosphere as meteor particles. 43 meteor events were recorded after analyzing 54,000 images from 10–17 January 2014.&lt;ref name="Golubaev2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://comet.sai.msu.ru/~gmr/AC/AC1611.pdf |title=Preliminary Results of the Observations of a Meteor Shower of Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) in January 2014 |journal=Astronomicheskii Tsirkulyar |first1=A.

On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of [[Hydrogen cyanide|{{chem2|HCN}}]], [[Hydrogen isocyanide|{{chem2|HNC}}]], [[Formaldehyde|{{chem2|H2CO}}]], and [[dust]] inside the [[Coma (cometary)|comae]] of comets [[C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)]] and C/2012 S1 (ISON).&lt;ref name="NASA-20140811"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/august/goddard/nasa-s-3-d-study-of-comets-reveals-chemical-factory-at-work |title=NASA's 3-D Study of Comets Reveals Chemical Factory at Work |publisher=NASA |first1=Elizabeth |last1=Zubritsky |first2=Nancy |last2=Neal-Jones |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014 |id=Release 14-038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20140811"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mapping the Release of Volatiles in the Inner Comae of Comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON) Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first1=M.

==Name==
[[File:Comet ISON Oct 08 2013.jpg|thumb|Comet ISON seen from the Mount Lemmon SkyCenter on 8 October 2013, as it passes through the constellation of Leo]]
{{details|Naming of comets}}
Comet ISON's [[Comet#Nomenclature|formal designation]] was C/2012 S1.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The "C" indicates that it was non-periodic, followed by the year of discovery. The "S" represents the half-month of discovery—in the case of C/2012 S1, the second half of September—and the number "1" shows that this was the first comet found in that half month.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nightskyfaq"/&gt; It was named "ISON" after the organization where its discovery was made, the Russia-based [[International Scientific Optical Network]]. The initial report of the object to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams identified the object as an asteroid, and it was listed on the Near Earth Objects Confirmation Page. Follow-up observations by independent teams were the first to report cometary features. Therefore, under the International Astronomical Union's comet-naming guidelines, Comet ISON was named after the team that discovered it, rather than the individual discoverers.&lt;ref name="HUCSA2012" /&gt;

==Media coverage==
After it was discovered in 2012, some media sources called Comet ISON the "Comet of the Century" and speculated that it might outshine the full Moon.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131127"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/us/comet-nears-sun-offering-planetary-clues.html |title=Comet Nears Sun, Offering Planetary Clues |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Astronomy Now'' columnist wrote in September 2012 that "if predictions hold true then Comet ISON will certainly be one of the greatest comets in human history."&lt;ref name=astronomynow1 /&gt; As recently as October 2013, a ''[[Daily Mail]]'' columnist described Comet ISON as "the Comet of the Century" and said it was "hoped to be 15 times brighter than the Moon."&lt;ref name="dailymail20131018"/&gt;

Astronomer Karl Battams criticized the media's suggestion that Comet ISON would be "brighter than the full Moon", saying that members of the Comet ISON Observing Campaign did not foresee ISON becoming that bright.&lt;ref name="unitoday20130730"/&gt;

Comet ISON has been compared to [[Comet Kohoutek]], seen in 1973–1974, another highly anticipated Oort cloud comet that peaked early and fizzled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-comets-backstory06-20131205,0,5507364.story |title=Back Story: Comet Kohoutek was another flameout |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |first=Frederick N. |last=Rasmussen |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/01/05/10-lessons-comet-century |title=10 Lessons from the "Comet of the Century" |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Cory S. |last=Powell |date=5 January 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25426">'''Cyclogenesis''' is the development or strengthening of [[cyclonic circulation]] in the atmosphere (a [[low-pressure area]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arctic Climatology and Meteorology |url=http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |title=Cyclogenesis |publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center |accessdate=2006-12-04 |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830135741/http://www.nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/cyclogenesis.html |archivedate=2006-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for at least three&lt;!--this introduces extratropical, tropical, mesocyclone--&gt; different processes, all of which result in the development of some sort of [[cyclone]], and at any size from the [[microscale meteorology|microscale]] to the [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]].

* [[Tropical cyclone]]s form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, developing a warm core.
* [[Extratropical cyclone]]s form as waves along [[weather fronts]] before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones.
* [[Mesocyclone]]s form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to [[tornado]] formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical [[wind shear]].

The process in which an extratropical cyclone undergoes a [[rapid deepening|rapid drop in atmospheric pressure]] (24 millibars or more) in a 24-hour period is referred to as [[explosive cyclogenesis]], and is usually present during the formation of a [[nor'easter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Synoptic-dynamic climatology of the "Bomb"|url=http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/atoc541/index_files/sandersgyakum1980.pdf|author1=Sanders, F. |author2=J. R. Gyakum|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Cambridge|accessdate=2012-01-21|date=1980-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anticyclonic equivalent, the process of formation of [[high pressure area]]s, is [[anticyclogenesis]].&lt;ref name="CyclogenesisDef"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] |work= Glossary of Meteorology | title= Cyclogenesis | date = 26 January 2012 | url = http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cyclogenesis | accessdate = 2016-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of cyclogenesis is [[cyclolysis]].

== Meteorological scales ==
There are four main scales, or sizes of systems, dealt with in meteorology: the macroscale, the synoptic scale, the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]], and the microscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mesoscale Dynamics and Modeling Laboratory|url=http://mesolab.meas.ncsu.edu/~linyl/mea713/Ch1_Note.doc |title=Part I: Introduction to Mesoscale Dynamics|accessdate=2006-12-04|date=2006-09-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908102254/http://mesolab.meas.ncsu.edu/~linyl/mea713/Ch1_Note.doc |archivedate = 2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The macroscale deals with systems with global size, such as the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]]. Synoptic scale systems cover a portion of a continent, such as [[extratropical cyclones]], with dimensions of {{convert|1,000|-|2,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arctic Climatology and Meteorology|date=2006 |url=http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/synoptic_scale.html |title=Synoptic Scale |accessdate=2006-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827170650/http://www.nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/synoptic_scale.html |archivedate=2006-08-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mesoscale is the next smaller scale, and often is divided into two ranges: meso-alpha phenomena range from {{convert|200|-|2,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} across (the realm of the [[tropical cyclone]]), while meso-beta phenomena range from {{convert|20|–|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} across (the scale of the [[mesocyclone]]). The microscale is the smallest of the meteorological scales, with a size under {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} (the scale of [[tornado]]es and [[waterspout]]s).&lt;ref&gt;University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. [http://meted.ucar.edu/mesoprim/mesodefn/print.htm Definition of Mesoscale.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; These horizontal dimensions are not rigid divisions but instead reflect typical sizes of phenomena having certain dynamic characteristics. For example, a system does not necessarily transition from meso-alpha to synoptic scale when its horizontal extent grows from {{convert|2,000|to|2,001|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

=== Norwegian cyclone model ===
[[Image:Jetstreak.png|thumb|An upper level jet streak. DIV areas are regions of divergence aloft, which will lead to surface convergence and aid cyclogenesis.]]

The [[Norwegian cyclone model]] is an idealized formation model of cold-core cyclonic storms developed by Norwegian meteorologists during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JetStream|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/cyclone.htm|title=Norwegian Cyclone Model|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main concept behind this model, relating to cyclogenesis, is that cyclones progress through a predictable evolution as they move up a frontal boundary, with the most mature cyclone near the northeast end of the front and the least mature near the tail end of the front.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology. [http://weather.ou.edu/~metr4424/Files/Norwegian_Cyclone_Model.pdf The Norwegian Cyclone Model.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901000000/http://weather.ou.edu/~metr4424/Files/Norwegian_Cyclone_Model.pdf |date=September 1, 2006 }} Retrieved on 2006-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precursors for development ===
{{main|Frontogenesis}}

A preexisting frontal boundary, as defined in [[surface weather analysis]], is required for the development of a mid-latitude cyclone. The cyclonic flow begins around a disturbed section of the stationary front due to an upper level disturbance, such as a [[Shortwave (meteorology)|short wave]] or an upper-level trough,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=short+wave&amp;submit=Search|title=Definition of Short Wave|accessdate=2009-10-26|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609104745/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=short+wave&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2009-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=upper-level-trough1|title=Definition of Upper-Level Trough|date=June 2000|accessdate=2009-10-26|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609192058/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=upper-level-trough1|archivedate=2009-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; near a favorable quadrant of the upper level jet.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle H.

=== Vertical motion affecting development ===

Cyclogenesis can only occur when temperature decreases polewards (to the north, in the northern hemisphere), and pressure perturbation lines tilt westward with height. Cyclogenesis is most likely to occur in regions of cyclonic vorticity [[advection]], downstream of a strong westerly jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Atmospheric Science An Introductory Survey |author1=Wallace, John M.  |author2=Peter V. Hobbs |publisher=[[University of Washington]], Seattle |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of vorticity advection and thermal advection created by the temperature gradient and a low pressure center cause upward motion around the low.
&lt;!---------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;!--start of techie footnote--&gt;{{efn|Using [[Q-Vectors]], we can determine the direction of vertical motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|author=Holton, James R.|publisher=[[University of Washington]], Seattle|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Southerly flow and warm advection induce an upward motion while northerly flow and cold advection induce a downward motion. These vertical motions cause the low to be stretched and vorticity around the system is increased. This increase in system vorticity can be shown through the QG vorticity equation (a [[partial differential equation]]):  
:&lt;math&gt;{D \zeta \over Dt} + \beta v = f_0 {\partial w \over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the relative vorticity,  &lt;math&gt;f = f_0 + \beta y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis parameter]] under the beta-plane approximation, &lt;math&gt;{\partial w \over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial derivative]] of vertical motion with respect to height, and &lt;math&gt;{D \zeta \over Dt}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[material derivative]].&lt;ref name="Holton, James R. 2004"&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology |author=Holton, James R. |publisher=[[University of Washington]], Seattle |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; With planetary vorticity term staying constant, we can deduce that with an increase in stretching, vorticity must increase as well. The vertical motion also increases temperature advection, by the equation &lt;math&gt;v_g = -{1 \over f_0} {\partial \Phi \over \partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt; is the geostrophic meridional wind and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; represents [[geopotential]].&lt;ref name="Holton, James R. 2004"&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology |author=Holton, James R. |publisher=[[University of Washington]], Seattle |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--end of techie footnote--&gt;

If the temperature gradient is strong enough, temperature advection will increase, driving more vertical motion. This increases the overall strength of the system. Shearwise updrafts{{efn|Shearwise updrafts are upward motions in a system of vertical movements which are changing in direction.}} are the most important factor in determining cyclonic growth and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= American Meteorological Society|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/MWR3416.1?prevSearch=Lower-Tropospheric&amp;searchHistoryKey= |author=Martin, Jonathon E. |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]], Madison  |date=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of development ===
The surface low could have a variety of causes for forming. Topography can force a surface low when dense low-level high pressure system ridges in east of a north-south mountain barrier.&lt;ref&gt;COMET Program [http://meted.ucar.edu/mesoprim/flowtopo/print.htm Flow Interaction With Topography]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mesoscale Convective System|Mesoscale convective systems]] can spawn surface lows which are initially warm core.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond D. Menard1, and J.M. Fritsch [http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0493(1989)117%3C1237:AMCCGI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 A Mesoscale Convective Complex-Generated Inertially Stable Warm Core Vortex]&lt;/ref&gt;  The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the [[Surface weather analysis|front]] and the low will be positioned at the crest. Around the low, flow will become cyclonic, by definition. This rotational flow will push polar air equatorward west of the low via its trailing cold front, and warmer air will push poleward low via the warm front. Usually the cold front will move at a quicker pace than the warm front and “catch up” with it due to the slow erosion of higher density airmass located out ahead of the cyclone and the higher density airmass sweeping in behind the cyclone, usually resulting in a narrowing warm sector.&lt;ref&gt;The Physics Factbook [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/RachelChu.shtml Density of Air]&lt;/ref&gt;  At this point an [[occluded front]] forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a '''[[trowal]]''' (a '''tro'''ugh of '''w'''arm air '''al'''oft).&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis University [http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm What is a trowal?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916000000/http://www.eas.slu.edu/CIPS/Presentations/Conferences/NWA2002/Snow_NWA_02/tsld003.htm |date=September 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All developing low pressure areas share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lower surface pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=bomb1|title=QG Notes|author=Joel Norris|publisher=[[University of California]], San Diego|accessdate=2009-10-26|date=2005-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maturity ===
Maturity is after the time of occlusion when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mariner's Weather Log|author1=Joan Von Ahn |author2=Joe Sienkiewicz |author3=Greggory McFadden |date=April 2005|volume=49|number=1|url=http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/april_05/cyclones.shtml|title=Hurricane Force Extratropical Cyclones Observed Using QuikSCAT Near Real Time Winds|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, the strength of the storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper level trough or upper level low, becoming increasingly cold core. The spin-down of cyclones, also known as cyclolysis, can be understood from an energetics perspective. As occlusion occurs and the warm air mass is pushed upwards over a cold air airmass, the atmosphere becomes increasingly stable and the centre of gravity of the system lowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pierce College|author=Steve W. Woodruff|url=http://www.piercecollege.edu/offices/weather/stability.html|title=About Atmospheric Stability|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2009-10-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612212855/http://www.piercecollege.edu/offices/weather/stability.html |archivedate = June 12, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the occlusion process extends further down the warm front and away from the central low, more and more of the available potential energy of the system is exhausted. This potential energy sink creates a kinetic energy source which injects a final burst of energy into the storm's motions. After this process occurs, the growth period of the cyclone, or cyclogenesis, ends, and the low begins to spin down (fill) as more air is converging into the bottom of the cyclone than is being removed out the top since upper-level divergence has decreased.

Occasionally, cyclogenesis will re-occur with occluded cyclones. When this happens a new low center will form on the triple-point (the point where the cold front, warm front, and occluded front meet). During triple-point cyclogenesis, the occluded parent low will fill as the secondary low deepens into the main weathermaker.

== Tropical cyclones ==
{{Main|Tropical cyclogenesis}}

Tropical cyclones exist within a mesoscale alpha domain. As opposed to mid-latitude cyclogenesis, tropical cyclogenesis is driven by strong convection organised into a central core with no [[baroclinic]] zones, or fronts, extending through their center. Although the formation of [[tropical cyclone]]s is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood, there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis:  [[sea surface temperature]]s that are warm enough, atmospheric instability, high [[humidity]] in lower to middle levels of the [[troposphere]], enough [[Coriolis force]] to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical [[wind shear]]. These warm core cyclones tend to form over the oceans between 10 and 30 degrees of the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea |publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form? |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Environment Canada|url=http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/hurricanes1a.html |title=Tropical Cyclone Formation|accessdate=2009-10-26|date=2003-09-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927232022/http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/hurricanes1a.html |archivedate = 2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mesocyclones ==
{{Main|Mesocyclone}}

Mesocyclones range in size from mesoscale beta to microscale. The term mesocyclone is usually reserved for mid-level rotations within severe thunderstorms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Allen Jones|url=http://students.ou.edu/J/Thomas.A.Jones-1/mesopaper.html|title=Mesocyclone Formation and Maintenance: A Review of Conceptual Models|accessdate=2009-10-26|date=2007-03-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311115216/http://students.ou.edu/J/Thomas.A.Jones-1/mesopaper.html |archivedate = March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are warm core cyclones driven by latent heat of its associated thunderstorm activity.

Tornadoes form in the warm sector of [[extratropical cyclones]] where a strong upper level jet stream exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|date=September 2000|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/tornado/formation.html|title=How a Tornado Forms|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height ("[[wind shear]]") sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to draw up this spinning air, tilting the rolls' orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.

As the updraft rotates, it may form what is known as a wall cloud. The wall cloud is a spinning layer of clouds descending from the mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone. It should be noted the wall clouds do not necessarily need a mesocyclone to form and do not always rotate. As the wall cloud descends, a funnel-shaped cloud may form at its center. This is the first stage of tornado formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Branick|date=2008-06-11|url=http://www.geographic.org/climate/w.html|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather|accessdate=2009-10-26|publisher=Geographic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a mesocyclone is believed to be a key factor in the formation of the strong tornadoes associated with severe thunderstorms.

Image:Meso-2.svg|The updraft (blue) 'tips' the spinning air upright.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Tornadoes ==
{{Main|Tornadogenesis}}

Tornadoes exist on the microscale or low end of the mesoscale gamma domain. The cycle begins when a strong thunderstorm develops a rotating mesocyclone a few miles up in the atmosphere, becoming a supercell. As rainfall in the storm increases, it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the [[rear flank downdraft]] (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=12th Conference on Severe Local Storms |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=January 1982 |author1=Timothy P. Marshall |author2=Erik N. Rasmussen |url=http://www.stormtrack.org/library/1981/warren.htm |title=The Mesoscale Evolution of the Warren, Oklahoma Tornadoes |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921075014/http://www.stormtrack.org/library/1981/warren.htm |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating wall cloud. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Storm Prediction Center.

== Waterspouts ==
{{Main|Waterspout}}

Waterspouts exist on the microscale. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical [[wind shear]] along lines of convergence, such as [[land breeze]]s, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry K. Choy and Scott M. Spratt. [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/spout.html A WSR-88D Approach to Waterspout Forecasting.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005182337/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/spout.html |date=October 5, 2006 }} Retrieved on 2006-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as significant as a [[thunderstorm]]. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal [[wind shear]] near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, across eastern Colorado have been witnessed to develop in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="CHOY"&gt;Barry K. Choy and Scott M. Spratt.

[[File:Deccan Scrub Forests at Mastyagiri 02.JPG|thumb|Scrub forests at Mastyagiri, [[Telangana]]]]
The '''Deccan thorn scrub forests''' are a [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrubland]] [[ecoregion]] of [[India]] and southernmost [[Sri Lanka]]. Historically this area was covered by tropical dry deciduous forest, but this only remains in isolated fragments. The vegetation now consists of
mainly of southern tropical thorn scrub type forests. These consist of open woodland with thorny trees with short trunks and low, branching crowns; spiny and xerophytic shrubs; and dry grassland. This is the habitat of the [[great Indian bustard]] and [[blackbuck]], though these and other animals are declining in numbers; this area was at one time home to large numbers of elephants and tigers. Almost 350 species of bird have been recorded here. The remaining natural habitat is threatened by [[overgrazing]] and invasive weeds, but there are a number of small protected areas which provide a haven for the wildlife.

==Location and description==
This ecoregion covers the arid portions of the Deccan Plateau, extending across the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Tamil Nadu]] to the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]] of Sri Lanka. Only small patches of natural habitat remain, as most of the region has been cleared for grazing.

The annual rainfall is less than {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}}, all falling during the short rainy season, and the area receives no rainfall during the months of November to April. Temperatures can exceed {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}} during the hotter months.

==Flora==
Today the remaining forest is mostly southern tropical thorn scrub,&lt;ref name="Champion, H. G. 1968"&gt;Champion, H. G., and S. K. Seth. 1968. A revised survey of the forest types of India. Government of India Press&lt;/ref&gt; and also includes patches of the original vegetation, tropical dry deciduous forests. The southern tropical thorn scrub forests consist of open, low vegetation with thorny trees with short trunks and low, branching crowns that rarely meet to form a closed canopy. The trees grow up to {{convert|6|–|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Typical grasses of the ecoregion include ''[[Chrysopogon fulvus]]'', ''[[Heteropogon contortus]]'', ''[[Eremopogon foveolatus]]'', ''[[Aristida setacea]]'', and ''[[Dactyloctenium]]'' species.

The second storey of the thorn scrub forests in Maharashtra is poorly developed and mainly consists spiny and xerophytic species, mostly shrubs. An ill-defined lower storey can also be seen during the brief wet season. The plant species that dominate the vegetation in these forests are Acacia species, ''[[Balanites roxburghii]]'', ''[[Cordia myxa]]'', ''[[Capparis]]'' spp., ''[[Prosopis]]'' spp., ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'', ''[[Cassia fistula]]'', ''[[Diospyros chloroxylon]]'', ''[[Carissa carandas]]'', and ''[[Phoenix sylvestris]]''. There are also several other habitat types found in these forests.

The driest, rockiest areas of the ecoregion are covered with a scrub dominated by species of ''[[Euphorbia]]''.&lt;ref name="Champion, H. G. 1968"/&gt; The soil is usually bare in these areas; however, some grassy growth may also appear during the short [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon season]].

The parts of the ecoregion found in Tamil Nadu receive even less rainfall than most, and the vegetation in these parts is mainly made up of thinly spread thorny forests of ''[[Acacia planifrons]]'', with umbrella-shaped crowns.

The remaining patches of forest are also home to a large number of plants, some of medicinal and botanical interest, including an endemic cycad (''[[Cycas beddomei]]'') and ''[[Psilotum nudum]]''. A small patch of the tree ''[[Shorea talura]]'' also exists within the Chittoor forest division, part of which is being maintained as a preservation plot by the Forest Department of Andhra Pradesh.

Finally, the area between the [[Nallamala Hills|Nallamala]] and [[Seshachalam Hills]] is well known for the red sanders (''[[Pterocarpus santalinus]]''), a rare, endemic tree species that is harvested for the medicinal value of its wood.

==Fauna==
The dry grasslands that predominate do provide habitat for the native fauna remaining scattered amid the thorn scrub. The grasslands of southern Andhra Pradesh support a good population of the [[great Indian bustard]] (''Ardeotis nigriceps'') and [[blackbuck]] (''Antilope cervicapra''), although these and other species are declining in number.

The forests used to provide habitat for three prominent mammal species, the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris tigris''), the [[Indian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus indicus''), whose populations have recently dwindled and may have even become locally extinct, and the [[nilgai]] antelope (''Boselaphus tragocamelus'').

The ecoregion is home to 96 mammal species, out of which three are considered endemic: [[split roundleaf bat]] (''Hipposideros schistaceus''), [[Kondana soft-furred rat]] (''Millardia kondana''), and [[Elvira rat]] (''Cremnomys elvira''). Other threatened mammal species found in these forests include the tiger, [[gaur]] (''Bos gaurus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), [[sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus''), [[chousingha]] (''Tetracerus quadricornis''), and blackbuck (''Antilope cervicapra'').

The Deccan thorn scrub forests are home to a richer variety of birds: almost 350 species, of which three are considered near-endemic: [[Jerdon's courser]] (''Rhinoptilus bitorquatus''), [[Sri Lanka junglefowl]] (''Gallus lafayetii''), and [[yellow-fronted barbet]] (''Megalaima flavifrons''). Among these, the [[Jerdon's courser]] is also considered a globally threatened species, and was rediscovered in this ecoregion in 1986 after being recorded for the last time in 1900. Other globally threatened bird species such as the [[lesser florican]] (''Sypheotides indicus'') and Indian bustard can also be found in the ecoregion.

==Threats and conservation==
The remaining deciduous woodland continues to be cleared for grazing land, while the pasture that has been created is itself threatened by overgrazing and invasive weeds. One large area of natural forest remains in southern Andhra Pradesh and there are eleven protected areas, but all of these are small: the largest is the [[Rollapadu Bird Sanctuary]] for the great Indian [[bustard]] near [[Nandikotkur]] in [[Kurnool]], Andhra Pradesh.

'''Devils Postpile National Monument''' is a [[United States National Monument|National Monument]] located near [[Mammoth Mountain]] in [[eastern California]].  The monument protects Devils Postpile, an unusual rock formation of [[Basalt#Columnar basalt|columnar basalt]]. It encompasses {{convert|798|acres}} and includes two main tourist attractions: the Devils Postpile formation and [[Rainbow Falls (California)|Rainbow Falls]], a waterfall on the Middle Fork of the [[San Joaquin River]]. In addition, the [[John Muir Trail]] and [[Pacific Crest Trail]] merge into one trail as they pass through the monument.&lt;ref name="guide2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/depo/parknews/upload/ThePost2011LowRes.pdf |title=Visitor Guide to Devils Postpile and the Reds Meadow Valley, 2011-2012 |publisher=National Forest Service/National Park Service |page=10 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding a small developed area containing the monument headquarters, visitor center and a campground; the National Monument lies within the borders of the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=acreage&amp;WID=12 Ansel Adams Wilderness acreage breakdown, Wilderness.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The monument was created in 1911 as Devil Postpile National Monument,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DjQPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 | title = A Proclamation | work = Statutes of the United States of America | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is widely referred to as Devils Postpile National Monument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BooAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=170 | title = Devil Postpile National Monument | work = Sierra Club Bulletin – Vol. 8 | year = 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has been officially styled as plural without the apostrophe since the 1930s. The monument was once part of [[Yosemite National Park]], but discovery of [[gold]] in 1905 near [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] prompted a boundary change that left the Postpile on adjacent [[public land]].&lt;ref name="guild2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/depo/photosmultimedia/upload/Final_2009_For%20Web.pdf |title=Visitor Guide to Devils Postpile and the Reds Meadow Valley, 2009-2010 |publisher=National Forest Service/National Park Service |page=1 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a proposal to build a [[hydroelectric dam]] called for blasting the Postpile into the river. Influential Californians, including [[John Muir]], persuaded the federal government to stop the demolition and, in 1911, President [[William Howard Taft]] protected the area as a [[United States National Monument|National Monument]].&lt;ref name="guild2009"/&gt;

The flora and fauna at Devils Postpile are typical of the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref name="naturescience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/depo/naturescience/index.htm |title=Devils Postpile – Nature &amp; Science |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument area contains animals and plants such as [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[American marten|pine marten]]s, [[mule deer]], [[coyote]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/depo/naturescience/animals.htm |title=Devils Postpile - Animals |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quaking aspen]], [[black cottonwood]], [[alder]], and [[willow]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/depo/naturescience/plants.htm |title=Devils Postpile - Plants |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many wildflowers, such as [[cinquefoil]] and [[Dodecatheon alpinum|alpine shooting star]].&lt;ref name=sherpa&gt;{{cite book |title=Longstreet Highroad Guide to the California Sierra Nevada |first=Mark |last=Grossi |publisher=Sherpa Guides |chapter=Devils Postpile National Monument |chapterurl=http://www.sherpaguides.com/california/mountains/eastern_sierra/devils_postpile_national_monument.html |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark-eyed junco]]s and [[white-crowned sparrow]]s are common in the summer.&lt;ref name=sherpa/&gt;

==Access==

The most common method for accessing Devils Postpile is via the mandatory shuttle bus operated by Eastern Sierra Transit Authority in the summer months&lt;ref name="dpesta"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/depo/planyourvisit/reds-meadow-and-devils-postpile-shuttle-information.htm |title=Reds Meadow/Devils Postpile Shuttle Information |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, followed by a 1/4 mile walk. The shuttle route begins at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's Adventure Center and makes several stops throughout the valley and begins operating when the Reds Meadow Road opens in the summer, and continues through Labor Day weekend. 

Devils Postpile is also accessible on foot from Mammoth Lakes by hiking over Mammoth Pass and into the Reds Meadow Valley. During the winter months, there are no services available, but adventurers can visit the site via cross-country ski or snowshoe.&lt;ref name="dpwinter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcalifornia.com/attraction/devils-postpile |title=Devils Postpile |publisher=Visit California |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devils Postpile==
[[File:California, Devils Postpile National Monument, columns top.jpg|thumb|upright|The tops of the postpile columns are accessible to visitors. The shapes of the columns are seen clearly here.]]

The name "Devils Postpile" refers to a dark cliff of [[columnar basalt]]. [[Radiometric dating]] indicates the formation was created by a lava flow at some time less than 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=USGSNPS/&gt; The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near [[Upper Soda Springs]] [[campground]] at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the [[San Joaquin River]], from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile. Estimates of the formation’s thickness range from {{convert|400|ft}} to {{convert|600|ft}}. The lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.&lt;ref name=USGSNPS/&gt;

Because of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the columns are so long and so symmetrical. Columnar jointing occurs when certain types of lava contract while cooling.

A [[glacier]] later removed much of this mass of rock and left a polished surface on top of the columns with very noticeable [[glacial striations]] and [[glacial polish]].&lt;ref name=USGSNPS/&gt;

The Postpile's columns average {{convert|2|ft|m}} in diameter, the largest being {{convert|3.5|ft|m}}, and many are up to {{convert|60|ft|m}} long. Together they look like tall posts stacked in a pile, hence the feature's name. If the lava had cooled perfectly evenly, all of the columns would be expected to be hexagonal, but some of the columns have different polygonal cross-sections due to variations in cooling. A survey of 400 of the Postpile's columns found that 44.5% were 6-sided, 37.5% 5-sided, 9.5% 4-sided, 8.0% 7-sided, and 0.5% 3-sided.&lt;ref name=USGSNPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/usgsnps/depo/dpgeol5.html |title=Devils Postpile National Park Geologic Story |publisher=[[USGS]]/National Park Service |date=January 2, 2000 |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527174149/http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/usgsnps/depo/dpgeol5.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other examples of columnar jointing, the Postpile has more hexagonal columns. Another feature that places the Postpile in a special category is the lack of horizontal jointing.

Several stones from the Devils Postpile can be seen at the entrance to the [[United States Geological Survey]] headquarters lot in [[Reston, Virginia]].

Although the basaltic columns are impressive, they are not unique. Basalt columns are a common volcanic feature, and they occur on many scales (faster cooling produces smaller columns).

Columnar basalt can also be seen in a high desert dry river falls area just north of [[Lajitas, Texas]].

[[File:Рябь течения.jpg|thumb|350px|Giant current ripples in the Kuray Basin, Altai, Russia]]

Historically, '''diluvium''' was a term in [[geology]] for superficial deposits formed by [[flood]]-like operations of water, and so contrasted with [[alluvium]] or [[alluvial]] deposits formed by slow and steady [[aqueous]] agencies. The term was formerly given to the [[boulder clay]] deposits, supposed to have been caused by the [[Noah|Noachian]] deluge.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Diluvium |volume=8 |page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diluvial bars in Central Altay Mountains July 2011 by Alexei Rudoy.jpg|thumb|350px|Diluvial terraces in Central Altay Mountains, [[Katun River]], Little Yaloman Village. July 2011]]
In the late 20th century Russian geologist [[:ru:Рудой, Алексей Николаевич|Alexei Rudoy]] proposed the term "'''diluvium'''" for description of deposits created as a result of [[Glacial lake outburst flood|catastrophic outbursts]] of [[Pleistocene]] giant glacier-dammed lakes in intermontane basins of the Altai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/Geology/AltaiFlood_red.pdf Lee, Keenan, 2004, ''The Altai Flood'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest of these lakes, Chuya and Kuray, had volumes of water in hundreds of cubic kilometers, and their discharge in peak hydrograph flow rate exceeded the maximum rates of the well-known Pleistocene [[Lake Missoula]] floods in [[North America]].  The term "diluvium" in the meaning of A. N. Rudoy has become accepted, and the process of diluvial morpholithogenesis can be found in modern textbooks.

==Flood deposits of the Altai region==
Nearly all intermountain depressions in southern [[Siberia]] and northern [[Mongolia]] hosted [[glacier]]-dammed lakes during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]].  Climatic changes and hydrostatic alterations of the ice dams were followed by repeated fillings and releases of the basin lakes. The [[Glacial lake outburst flood|lake outbursts]] had a cataclysmic character.  In accordance with climatic conditions, the glaciers would protrude again into the main drainage valleys immediately after dam deformations and lake outbursts and would again dam the basins.

The greatest of the lakes (Lakes Chuya, Kuray, Uymon, Darkhat and others)
achieved volumes up to hundreds of cubic kilometres, while the discharges of the outburst
floods reached millions of cubic metres per second.  These floods transformed the
drainage valleys, repeatedly building new sediment deposits.  The dating of the latter proves
the occurrence of large-scale floods in the Chuya and the Katun River valleys in the interval
between 23 and 7 thousand years ago.  During that period there were at least five
large-scale flooding events.  Enormous water masses were drained simultaneously and repeatedly
toward the south of West Siberia.  The total water volume out of the Altai basins
only used to reach 10 thousand cubic kilometres.  With some periodicity, all of the
basins of South Siberia were able to deliver northwards about 60 thousand cubic kilometres
of flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoy A.N. Mountain Ice-Dammed Lakes of Southern Siberia and their Influence on the Development and Regime of the Runoff Systems of North Asia in the Late Pleistocene.

A '''drought''' is a natural disaster of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, [[surface water]] or [[ground water]]. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/its-a-scorcher-and-ireland-is-officially-in-drought-29431138.html It's a scorcher - and Ireland is officially 'in drought'] Irish Independent, 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt; It can have a substantial impact on the [[ecosystem]] and [[agriculture]] of the affected region&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml Living With Drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218192510/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml |date=2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and harm to the local [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/environmental/Australian-Drought.html Australian Drought and Climate Change], retrieved on June 7th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual dry seasons in the [[tropics]] significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires.  Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of [[water vapour]].

Many plant species, such as those in the family Cactaceae (or [[Cactus|cacti]]), have [[Drought tolerant|drought tolerance]] adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Keddy|first=P.A.|date=2007|title=Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK.|isbn=978-0521864800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged droughts have caused [[mass migration]]s and humanitarian crisis.  Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity. The most prolonged drought ever in the world in [[recorded history]] occurred in the [[Atacama Desert]] in [[Chile]] (400 Years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremescience.com/driest.htm|title=Driest Place: Atacama Desert, Chile|publisher=Extreme Science|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought.  Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high [[pressure system]]s, [[wind]]s carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of [[high pressure area]]s aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region.

=== El Niño ===
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|Regional impacts of warm ENSO episodes ([[El Niño]])]]
{{See also|El Niño}}

Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the [[Amazon River]] Basin, [[Colombia]], and [[Central America]] during El Niño events.  Winters during the El Niño are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls.  Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Botswana]].  Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Northern Australia]], increasing [[bush fire]]s, worsening [[haze]], and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in [[Queensland]], inland [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], inland [[New South Wales]], and eastern [[Tasmania]] from June to August.  As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3&amp;nbsp;mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35&amp;nbsp;°C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4&amp;nbsp;mm of rain fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1040778/1/.html|title=channelnewsasia.com - February 2010 is driest month for S'pore since records began in 1869|date=3 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303222328/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1040778/1/.html|archivedate=3 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation).  Suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2004|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|title=Dunes&amp;nbsp;– Getting Started|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fields outside benambra.jpg|thumb|right|Fields outside [[Benambra, Victoria]], [[Australia]] suffering from drought conditions.]]

[[Loess]] is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, [[friable]], slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, [[silt]]y, pale yellow or buff, windblown ([[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]]) [[sediment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. von Richthofen|year=1882|title=On the mode of origin of the loess|journal=Geological Magazine (Decade II)|doi=10.1017/S001675680017164X |volume= 9|issue=7|pages=293–305|bibcode=1882GeoM....9..293R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.E.K. Neuendorf |author2=J.P. Mehl, Jr. |author3=J.A. Jackson |year=2005|title=Glossary of Geology|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]], New York|page=779|isbn=978-3-540-27951-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Getis|author2=Judith Getis and Jerome D. Fellmann|title=Introduction to Geography, Seventh Edition|year=2000|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=978-0-697-38506-2|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.&lt;ref name="Erosion"/&gt;  Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the [[Great Plains]], it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiggs, Giles F.S.|chapter=Geomorphological hazards in drylands|editor=Thomas, David S.G.|title=Arid Zone Geomorphology: Process, Form and Change in Drylands|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-71076-0|page=588|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swz4rh4KaLYC&amp;pg=PA588}}
The distribution of all the water on the earth’s surface is not even. Some places have lots of fresh water (rivers, lakes, lagoons, ponds etc.) and are continuously replenished by rainfall, runoffs and water from underground. Others places too are known to have very little water.

Therefore, if a region that has lots of rainfall, goes for a couple of weeks without rains, and people, animals and plants begin to experience a bit of dryness, it can be called drought. At the same time, that condition may be very normal for places with no water, and can go for months without any rains with little problems.

== Types of drought ==
As a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases. People tend to define droughts in three main ways:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qianfeng_Wang|title=Qianfeng Wang|work=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] drought is brought about when there is a prolonged time with less than average precipitation. Meteorological drought usually precedes the other kinds of drought.&lt;ref name="NOAAsurprise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/climate/Drought.pdf|title=What is a Drought?|date=August 2006|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] droughts affect crop production or the ecology of the [[Range (biology)|range]]. This condition can also arise independently from any change in precipitation levels when [[soil]] conditions and erosion triggered by poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause a shortfall in water available to the crops. However, in a traditional drought, it is caused by an extended period of below average precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;
The alleviating trend of drought in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China based on the daily SPEI. International
Journal of Climatology.2015. doi: 10.1002/joc.4244   Wang, Qianfeng, Shi, Peijun, Lei, Tianjie, Geng, Guangpo, Liu, Jinghui, Mo, Xinyu, Li, Xiaohan, Zhou, Hongkui. and Wu, Jianjun&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Hydrology|Hydrological]] drought is brought about when the water reserves available in sources such as [[aquifer]]s, [[lake]]s and [[reservoir]]s fall below the [[statistical]] [[average]]. Hydrological drought tends to show up more slowly because it involves stored water that is used but not replenished. Like an agricultural drought, this can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall. For instance, around 2007 [[Kazakhstan]] was awarded a large amount of money by the [[World Bank]] to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the [[Aral Sea]] under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6538219.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Dam project aims to save Aral Sea|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar circumstances also place their largest lake, [[Lake Balkhash|Balkhash]], at risk of completely drying out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3397077.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Kazakh lake 'could dry up'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences of drought ==
[[File:Mongolian Gazelle dead of drought.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Mongolian gazelle]] dead due to drought.]] One can divide the effects of droughts and water shortages into three groups: environmental, economic and social.
* In the case of environmental effects: lower surface and subterranean water-levels, lower flow-levels (with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life), increased pollution of surface water, the drying out of wetlands, more and larger fires, higher deflation intensity, [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and dendroid diseases.
* Economic losses include lower agricultural, forests, game and fishing output, higher food-production costs, lower energy-production levels in hydro plants, losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue, problems with water supply for the energy sector and for technological processes in metallurgy, mining, the chemical, paper, wood, foodstuff industries etc., disruption of water supplies for municipal economies. 
* Social costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), possible limitation of water supplies, increased pollution levels, high food-costs, stress caused by failed harvests, etc. This explains why droughts and fresh water shortages operate as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Prokurat|first= Sergiusz|date= 2015|title= Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf|journal= Journal of Modern Science|volume= 26|issue =3|doi= |pmid= |access-date= 4 August 2016|via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects vary according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food-sources. Areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food-source are more vulnerable to famine.

Drought can also reduce water quality,&lt;ref&gt;Mosley LM (2014). Drought impacts on the water quality of freshwater systems; review and integration. Earth Science Reviews.

Water Resources Management 26: 3923–3946.&lt;/ref&gt; because lower water-flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase [[contamination]] of remaining water-sources. Common consequences of drought include:
* Diminished [[crop yield|crop growth or yield productions]] and [[carrying capacity]] for [[livestock]]
* [[Dust bowl]]s, themselves a sign of [[erosion]], which further erode the [[landscape]]

By far the largest part of [[Australia]] is [[Deserts of Australia|desert]] or semi-arid lands commonly known as the [[outback]]. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to [[human]] settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented [[monsoon]]s from reaching interior Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/news/pr/05-01.htm Sensitivity of the Australian Monsoon to insolation and vegetation: Implications for human impact on continental moisture balance], Geological Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole [[Murray-Darling basin]] if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7460492.stm Australian rivers 'face disaster'], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSYD6747620080707 Australia faces worse, more frequent droughts: study], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt; Australian environmentalist [[Tim Flannery]], predicted that unless it made drastic changes, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in [[Western Australia]] could become the world’s first [[ghost town|ghost metropolis]], an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6620919.stm Metropolis strives to meet its thirst], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;  The long Australian [[2000s Australian drought|Millennial drought]] broke in 2010.

Recurring droughts leading to [[desertification]] in [[East Africa]] have created grave ecological catastrophes, prompting food shortages in [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|1984–85]], [[2006 Horn of Africa food crisis|2006]] and [[2011 East Africa drought|2011]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sara Pantuliano and Sara Pavanello (2004) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3591&amp;title=drought-livelihoods-pastoralists-humanitarian Taking drought into account Addressing chronic vulnerability among pastoralists in the Horn of Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103951/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3591&amp;title=drought-livelihoods-pastoralists-humanitarian |date=March 7, 2012 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2011 drought, an estimated 50,000 to 150,000 people were reported to have died,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://world.time.com/2012/01/18/fatal-failure-did-aid-agencies-let-up-to-100000-somalis-die-in-2011/ Fatal Failure: Did Aid Agencies Let Up To 100,000 Somalis Die in 2011?]".

== Protection, mitigation and relief ==

Agriculturally, people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by [[population growth|ever-increasing]] population densities.  President Roosevelt on April 27, 1935, signed documents creating the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)—now the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Models of the law were sent to each state where they were enacted.  These were the first enduring practical programs to curtail future susceptibility to drought, creating agencies that first began to stress soil conservation measures to protect farm lands today.  It was not until the 1950s that there was an importance placed on water conservation was put into the existing laws (NRCS 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/newsroom/contacts/?cid=nrcs143_014208|title=State Conservation District Laws Development and Variations – NRCS|work=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategies for drought protection, mitigation or relief include:
* [[Dam]]s – many dams and their associated reservoirs supply additional water in times of drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Fresno Bee |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/06/01/3956458/should-calif-add-new-dams.html |title=Should California build dams, reservoirs to help with future droughts? |date=2014-06-01 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |author1=Matt Weiser |author2=Jeremy B.

* [[Cloud seeding]] – a form of intentional weather modification to induce rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/24/content_351196.htm|title=Cloud seeding helps alleviate drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This remains a hotly debated topic, as the [[National Research Council (United States)|United States National Research Council]] released a report in 2004 stating that to date, there is still no convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NRC|title=Critical Issues in Weather Modification Research|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10829.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Desalination]] – use of sea water for irrigation or consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/pw/resources/system/sources/desalination.asp|author=City of Santa Barbara|title=Desalinization|date=2014-12-22|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drought monitoring – Continuous observation of rainfall levels and comparisons with current usage levels can help prevent man-made drought. For instance, analysis of water usage in [[Yemen]] has revealed that their [[water table]] (underground water level) is put at grave risk by over-use to fertilize their [[Khat]] crop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm BBC's] [[From Our Own Correspondent]] on khat water usage&lt;/ref&gt; Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires, using such metrics as the [[Keetch-Byram Drought Index]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; or [[Palmer Drought Index]].
* Land use – Carefully planned [[crop rotation]] can help to minimize [[erosion]] and allow farmers to plant less water-dependent crops in drier years.
* [[Outdoor water-use restriction]] – Regulating the use of sprinklers, hoses or buckets on outdoor plants, filling pools, and other water-intensive home maintenance tasks.  [[Xeriscaping]] yards can significantly reduce unnecessary water use by residents of towns and cities.
* [[Rainwater harvesting]] – Collection and storage of rainwater from roofs or other suitable catchments.
* [[Recycled water]] – Former wastewater (sewage) that has been treated and purified for reuse.
* [[Transvasement]] – Building canals or redirecting rivers as massive attempts at [[irrigation]] in drought-prone areas.

'''Earth science''' or '''geoscience''' includes all fields of [[natural science]] related to the [[planet]] [[Earth]]. It is the branch of science dealing with the physical constitution of the earth and its atmosphere. Earth science is the study of our planet’s physical characteristics, from earthquakes to raindrops, and floods to fossils. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [[planetary science]], but with a much older history. “Earth science” encompasses four main branches of study, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]], each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields.

There are both [[reductionism|reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of the Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth [[Scientist|scientists]] use their knowledge of the Earth to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as [[Volcano|volcanoes]], [[Earthquake|earthquakes]], and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events. 

The Earth sciences can include the study of [[geology]], the [[lithosphere]], and the large-scale structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[biosphere]]. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from [[geography]], [[chronology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth works and evolves. Earth science affects our everyday lives. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists study water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to predict where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists mainly work “in the field”—climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then they record their findings on charts and maps.

== Fields of study ==
The following [[branches of science|fields of science]] are generally categorized within the Earth sciences:
* [[Physical geography]], covers aspects of [[geomorphology]], [[pedology (soil study)|soil study]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[biogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html|title=1(b). Elements of Geography – 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006|work=physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the [[Earth's crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], geomorphology, [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], [[engineering geology]], and [[sedimentology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name="smith 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geophysics]] and [[geodesy]] investigate the [[figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]], its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity field]]s. Geophysicists explore the [[Inner core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.&lt;ref name="smith 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0|title=WordNet Search – 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html|title=NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Global Positioning Tutorial|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of [[geologist]]s in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. [[Seismologist]]s use geophysics to understand plate tectonic shifting, as well as predict seismic activity. See [[geophysical survey]].
* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub] broken link? {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030004610/http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major subdisciplines include [[edaphology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html|title=Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why Study Soils? excerpted from Miller, R.W. &amp; D.T. Gardiner, 1998. Soils in our Environment, 8th Edition|work=nau.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology]] covers the interactions between the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], with their natural environment. This field of study differentiates the study of the Earth, from the study of other planets in the [[Solar System]]; the Earth being the only planet teeming with life.
* [[Hydrology]], [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] are a study revolved around the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involves all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the earth and its atmosphere (or [[hydrosphere]]). "Sub-disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatheadwatershed.org/watershed/hydrology.shtml|title=Hydrology of the Watershed|last=Craig|first=Kendall|authorlink=Craig N. Kendall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).
* [[Atmospheric sciences]] cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&amp;nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, [[atmospheric chemistry]], and [[atmospheric physics]].

== Earth's interior ==
[[File:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[volcanic]] eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth.&lt;!---originating from radioactive decay and season gravitational sorting in Earth's core and mantle, and residual energy gained during the Earth's formation---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, Academic Press, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Plate tectonics]], [[mountain]] ranges, [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are [[geology|geological phenomena]] that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html|title=Earth's Energy Budget|work=ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
Beneath the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] lies the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] which is heated by the [[radioactive decay]] of [[heavy elements]]. The mantle is not quite solid and consists of [[magma]] which is in a state of semi-perpetual [[wikt:convection|convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simison|2007|loc=paragraph 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 94–95, 100, 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 13–17, 218, G-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|pp= 101,103,104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of [[seafloor spreading]], new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through  [[subduction]], oceanic crust and lithosphere returns to the convecting mantle.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called ''divergent boundaries'', those where it is brought back into the Earth are ''convergent boundaries'' and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as [[transform fault|transform]] (or conservative) boundaries&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earthquakes]] result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the Earth as part of subduction.&lt;ref name="smith subduction"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 325–26, 329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
[[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the [[asthenosphere]] melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface—giving birth to volcanoes.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smith subduction" /&gt;

== Earth's atmosphere ==
{{Main article|Atmosphere of Earth}}
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[magnetosphere]] shields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the [[solar wind]].&lt;!---It is compressed on the day (Sun) side due to the force of the arriving particles, and extended on the night side.---&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(''image not to scale.'')]]
The [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]] are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% [[nitrogen]], 20.9% [[oxygen]], and 0.92% [[argon]]. 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere, the bottom-most layer. The remaining one percent of the atmosphere (all but the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon) contains small amounts of other gases including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water vapors.&lt;ref name="adams atmosphere"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water vapors and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allow the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through a phenomenon called the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding some of the Earth's surface from [[cosmic rays]]—of which are often incorrectly thought to be deflected by the [[magnetic field]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=Eugene|title=Shielding Space|publisher=Scientific American|date=March 2006 |url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field—created by the internal motions of the core—produces the [[magnetosphere]] which protects the Earth's atmosphere from the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Earth is [[Age of the earth|4.5 billion]] years old,&lt;ref name="age earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.

== Earth's magnetic field ==
An [[electromagnet]] is a magnet that is created by an electric current.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth has a solid iron [[Earth core|inner core]] surrounded by fluid [[outer core]] that convects;&lt;ref name="oldroyd core" /&gt; therefore, the Earth is an [[electromagnet]]. The motion of fluid convection [[dynamo theory|sustains]] the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="oldroyd core"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|p= 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |title=Dynamo Theory and Earth's Magnetic Field. |author=Demorest, Paul |date=2001-05-21 |accessdate=2007-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221094040/http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Methodologies vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied. Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or go to many of the world's most exotic locations to study Earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or hot spot island chains).

A foundational idea within the study Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism. Uniformitarianism dictates that "ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study Earth's history to apply knowledge of how Earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout deep history.

== Earth's spheres ==
{{Nature timeline}}
Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]];&lt;ref name="wheeling"&gt;[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=August 31, 2007 }}. ©1997–2000. Wheeling Jesuit University/NASA Classroom of the Future. Retrieved November 11, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; these correspond to [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[water]], [[air]] and [[life]]. Also included by some are the [[cryosphere]] (corresponding to [[ice]]) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the [[pedosphere]] (corresponding to [[soil]]) as an active and intermixed sphere.

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

'''Electricity retailing''' is the final sale of [[electricity]] from [[electricity generation|generation]] to the end-use consumer. This is the fourth major step in the electricity delivery process, which also includes [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]].

== Beginnings ==

Electricity [[retail]]ing began at the end of the 19th century when the bodies which generated electricity for their own use made supply available to third parties. In the beginning, electricity was primarily used for street [[lighting]] and [[tram]]s.  The public could buy once large scale
electric companies had been started.

The provision of these services was generally the responsibility of electric companies or [[municipal authorities]] who either set up their own departments or contracted the services from private entrepreneurs. Residential, commercial and industrial use of electricity was confined, initially, to lighting but this changed dramatically with the development of [[electric motor]]s, [[electric heater|heaters]] and [[communication]] devices.

The basic principle of supply has not changed much over time.  The amount of energy used by the domestic consumer, and thus the amount charged for, is measured through an [[electricity meter]] that is usually placed near the input of a home to provide easy access to the meter reader.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Customers are usually charged a monthly service fee and additional charges based on the electrical energy (in [[kWh]]) consumed by the household or business during the month.  Commercial and industrial consumers normally have more complex pricing schemes. These require meters that measure the energy usage in time intervals (such as a half-hour) to impose charges based on both the amount of energy consumed and the maximum rate of consumption, i.e. the maximum demand. This is usually called peak demand charge. Frequent reporting also allows the retailer to pass on the spot price (with some markup) to its customers.

== Monopoly supply ==

The rapid growth in electric appliance usage in the early part of the 20th century contributed to an explosive growth in [[electricity|electrification]] around the world.

The supply of electricity to homes, offices, shops, factories, farms, and mines became the responsibility of [[public utility|public utilities]], which were either private organizations subject to [[monopoly]] [[regulation]] or public authorities owned by local, state or national bodies.

In some countries a statutory or [[government-granted monopoly]] was created to be controlled by legislation, for example [[Eskom]] in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

&lt;!--[[File:Electric meter.jpg|frame|right|Home electrical meters {{deletable image-caption|Friday, January 14, 2011|date=January 2011}}]]--&gt;
Electricity retailing in the period from approximately 1890 to 1990 consisted of managing the connection, disconnection and billing of electricity consumers by the local monopoly supplier.

In many utilities there was a [[marketing]] function which encouraged electricity usage when there was excess capacity to supply and encouraged conservation when supply was tight.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Creating a market ==

An electricity provider is often known as "the '''[[Electric power industry|electric company]]'''" or "the '''power company'''".

In 1990 there was a significant development in the way electricity was bought and sold.  In many countries, the [[electricity market]] was [[deregulation|deregulated]] to open up the supply of electricity to competition.  In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[electricity supply industry]] was radically reformed to establish competition, including a market in [[energy switching services in the UK|advising users about switching supplier]]. This trend continued in other countries (see [[New Zealand Electricity Market]] and [[deregulation]]) and the role of electricity retailing changed from what was essentially an administrative function within an integrated utility to become a risk management function within a competitive [[electricity market]].

Electricity retailers now offer fixed prices or variable for electricity to their customers and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. This development has not been without casualties. The most notable example of poor risk management (coupled with poor market regulation) was the [[California electricity crisis|2001 California electricity crisis]], when [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] and [[Southern California Edison]] were driven into bankruptcy by having to purchase electricity at high spot prices and sell at low fixed rates.

Customers may choose from a number of competing suppliers. They may also opt to purchase [[green electricity|"green" power]], i.e. electricity sourced from [[renewable energy]] generation such as [[wind power]] or [[solar power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASK PSC - What You Should Know Before Choosing An Energy Supplier|url=http://www.askpsc.com/askpsc/page/?PageAction=renderPageById&amp;PageId=7f285010bbcba4320235157257b2dc82|website=New York Public Services Commission|publisher=New York Public Services Commission|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Over the past several decades, many US states have moved to deregulate their electric markets, with 24 states allowing for at least some competition among retail electric providers (REPs) including [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quantumgas.com/list_of_energy_deregulated_states_in_united_states.html&lt;/ref&gt; These companies include [[Ambit Energy]], [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]], [[Just Energy]], [[Con Edison]], [[Champion Energy]], [[Constellation Energy]], and [[Reliant Energy]] among many others. Deregulation of electric retailers has been subject to much controversy as more states have opted for competitive markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressherald.com/business/Maine-Experts-debate-impact-of-electricity-deregulation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erralogo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of the Energy Regulators Regional Association]]The '''Energy Regulators Regional Association''' (ERRA) is a voluntary organization of independent energy regulatory bodies primarily from the Central European and Eurasian region, with Affiliates from Africa, Asia the Middle East and the USA. 

==Purpose and objectives==
The purpose and objectives of the association are:
*To improve national energy regulation in member countries;
*To foster development of stable energy regulators with autonomy and authority;
*To improve cooperation among energy regulators;
*To facilitate the exchange of information, research, training and experience among members and other regulators around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erranet.org/AboutUs/Purpose  ERRA website] - 'About Us'&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first energy regulatory bodies of the ERRA region were established in the mid-1990s as an essential part of restructuring and reforms taking place in these countries. ERRA began as a cooperative initiative of 12 energy regulatory bodies. They were then supported from 1999 to 2008 by the US [[National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners]] (NARUC), which, with the participation of [[US Agency for International Development|USAID]], arranged technical forums, meetings and study tours for mutual training and development. As a consequence, fifteen energy regulators established ERRA on 11 December 2000 in [[Bucharest]].  The association was registered in [[Hungary]] in April 2001 and its secretariat is based in [[Budapest]]. To date ERRA lists 23 full and 14 associate members.

{{Globalize/US|date=November 2016}}
A '''fall line''' (or '''fall zone''') is the [[geomorphology|geomorphologic]] break that demarcates the border between an upland region of relatively hard [[Basement (geology)|crystalline basement rock]] and a [[coastal plain]] of softer [[sedimentary rock]].&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{cite book |last= Schneider |first= Craig W. |author2=Richard B. Searles |title= Seaweeds of the southeastern United States: Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral |year= 1991 |publisher= Duke University Press |isbn= 978-0-8223-1101-0 |pages= 5–7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA5kv_0g3cC&amp;pg=PA5 |accessdate= 17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fall line is typically prominent when crossed by a river, for there will often be rapids or [[waterfall]]s. Many times a fall line will recede upstream as the river cuts out the uphill dense material, often forming "c"-shaped waterfalls and exposing bedrock shoals. Because of these features riverboats typically cannot travel any farther inland without [[portage|portaging]], unless locks are built there. On the other hand, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, makes the fall line a good location for [[water mill]]s, [[grist mill]]s, and [[sawmill]]s. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements often develop where rivers cross a fall line.

==Geography==
[[File:Bulletin 426 Fig 2 Fall Line.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram showing the Fall Line. [[USGS]] figure.]]
The slope of fall zones on rivers played a role in settlement patterns. For example, the fall line represents the inland limit of navigation on many rivers.  As such, many fall line cities grew around transferring people and goods between land-based and water-based transportation at this point.&lt;ref name=UGA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/1122EUSMISR.html |title=The Fall Line and major cities of the Eastern U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, fall lines proved useful for hydroelectric dams such as those at [[Rochester, New York]] (on the [[Niagara Escarpment]]), at [[Columbia, South Carolina]], and at [[Conowingo, Maryland]], on the [[Susquehanna River]] (on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]]).  Cities established along fall lines in the United States include:

===Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line===
{{Main|Atlantic Seaboard fall line}}
{{GeoGroupTemplate|align=left}}

The '''Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line''', or '''Fall Zone''', is a {{convert|900|mi|km|adj=on}} [[escarpment]] where the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] meet in the eastern [[United States]].&lt;ref name=freitag&gt;{{cite book |last= Freitag |first= Bob |author2=Susan Bolton|author3=Frank Westerlund|author4=Julie Clark |title= Floodplain Management: A New Approach for a New Era |year= 2009 |publisher= Island Press |isbn= 978-1-59726-635-2 |page= 77 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e1lr3gQiO8gC&amp;pg=PA77 |accessdate= 17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line passes through areas where no evidence of [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] is present.

The fall line marks the geologic boundary of hard metamorphosed terrain—the product of the [[Taconic orogeny]]—and the sandy, relatively flat outwash plain of the upper continental shelf, formed of unconsolidated [[Cretaceous]] and [[Tertiary]] [[sediment]]s. Examples of the Fall Zone include the Potomac River's [[Little Falls (Potomac River)|Little Falls]] and the rapids in [[Richmond, Virginia]], where the [[James River]] falls across a series of rapids down to the tidal estuary of the James River. [[Columbia, South Carolina]] is similar as well with the [[Congaree River]].

Before navigation improvements such as locks, the fall line was often the [[wikt:head of navigation|head of navigation]] on rivers due to rapids and waterfalls, such as the [[Little Falls (Potomac River)|Little Falls]] of the [[Potomac River]]. Numerous cities were founded at the intersection of rivers and the fall line. [[U.S. Route 1]] links many of the fall line cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4997">'''Ground vibrations''' is a technical term that is being used to describe mostly man-made [[vibration]]s of the ground, in contrast to natural vibrations of the Earth studied by [[seismology]]. For example, vibrations caused by explosions, construction works, railway and road transport, etc. - all belong to ground vibrations. 

== General information ==
Like in seismology, ground vibrations are associated with different types of [[elastic waves]] propagating through the ground. These are [[surface waves]], mostly [[Rayleigh waves]], and bulk [[longitudinal waves]] and [[transverse waves]] (or shear waves) propagating into the ground depth. Typical frequency range for environmental ground vibrations is 1 – 200&amp;nbsp;Hz. Waves of lower frequencies (below 1&amp;nbsp;Hz) are usually called [[microseism]]s, and they are normally associated with natural phenomenae, e.g. [[water waves]] in the oceans. Environmental ground vibrations generated by rail and road traffic may cause annoyance to residents of nearby buildings both directly and via generated structure-borne interior noise. Very strong ground vibrations, e.g. generated by heavy lorries on bumped roads, may even cause structural damage to very close buildings. Magnitudes of ground vibrations are usually described in terms of particle vibration velocity (in mm/s or m/s). Sometimes they are also described in [[decibel]]s (relative to the reference particle velocity of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; m/s). Typical values of ground vibration particle velocity associated with vehicles passing over traffic calming road humps are in the range of 0.1 – 2&amp;nbsp;mm/s. Magnitudes of ground vibrations that are considered to be able to cause structural damage to buildings are above 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

== Ground vibrations from railways ==
The main sources of ground vibrations generated by railway trains are dynamic forces transmitted from tracks to the ground. These forces are associated with complex processes of interaction of moving train axles with railway tracks supported by the elastic ground. The magnitudes of these forces generally increase with the increase of train speeds. Therefore, the levels of generated ground vibrations may be substantial in the case of high-speed trains. If a train speed becomes larger than Rayleigh wave velocity in the ground, an additional very large increase in generated ground vibrations takes place. This phenomenon is termed [[ground vibration boom]], and it is similar to [[sonic boom]] generated by supersonic aircraft.

== Ground vibrations from road traffic ==
The main mechanism responsible for generation of ground vibrations by moving cars and lorries is the dynamic forces associated with vehicle passage over road irregularities, such as bumps, peats, etc. These forces, and hence generated ground vibrations, can be reduced by keeping road surfaces in good condition.

== Ground vibrations at construction ==
The main sources of ground vibrations at construction are pile driving, dynamic compaction, blasting, and operation of heavy construction equipment. These vibrations may harmfully affect surrounding buildings, and their effect ranges from disturbance of residents to visible structural damage.

'''''Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of Energy Independence''''' is a book by [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] which was released in 2008 and is published by [[PublicAffairs]].

==Synopsis==
In 2008 the United States imported 60 per cent of its oil.&lt;ref name="Online Interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/04/17/DI2008041703255.html|title=Online interview|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=April 24, 2008|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post|page=1|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce argues that, given the size of its energy needs, the United States needs to continue importing oil. He also favors increasing domestic production of oil and gas. He acknowledges that [[North American energy independence|energy independence]] has appeal as a slogan, but says that the reality is energy interdependence.

As in his later book ''[[Power Hungry]]'' he makes a case that renewable sources such as [[wind power]] and [[solar energy]] cannot meet the United States' (growing) energy requirements. Bryce dismisses [[ethanol fuel in the United States|ethanol fuel]] as having a cost that far outweighs the benefits. However, he believes that as world prices rise in the longer term, it will be economic to move to non-fossil sources.

==Reception==
Dr. [[Michael J. Economides]]&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael J. Economides, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at University of Houston, [http://www.chee.uh.edu/faculty/economides/main Personal page.]&lt;/ref&gt; writing for ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine said Bryce "fires in all directions, at liberals, conservatives, Republicans and Democrats. His is a no-holds barred attack on what he believes is not just the sale of a pipedream in a global economy but one whose pursuit has become the basis for massive worldwide scams. If for nothing else, that makes this book a must read for anyone interested in navigating a future energy path".&lt;ref name="Michael Economides"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/06/07/reflections-and-lessons-on-energy-challenges/|title=Reflections and lessons on energy challenges|last=Economides|first=Michael|date=March 20, 2008|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes|page=1|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]] wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that Bryce employs a "slashing, [[ad hominem]] style of attack that can undercut his credibility, especially when he moves away from economics and technology and ventures into politics, an arena to which he brings no particular expertise."&lt;ref name="William Grimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/books/07book.html?_r=1|title=Heard the one about the farmer’s ethanol?|last=Grimes|first=William|date=March 7, 2008|work=New York Times|publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Whittaker]] writing in the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' said, "Bryce makes a solid case that energy independence, a totem to both left and right, is not simply unachievable and undesirable but harmful. He depicts himself as the reasonable man facing down a cadre of [[Xenophobia|xenophobes]], [[Luddite]]s, [[boondogglers]], and politicos. He doesn't differentiate between the guilty parties along political lines, laying into [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Al Gore]] equally. But there are bogus conflations, like saying energy consumption equals wealth and wealth equals low child-mortality rates, even though the Btu-guzzling U.S. has one of the worst [[Boondoggle (project)|infant death rates]] of all industrialized nations".&lt;ref name="Richard Whittaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid:599502|title=Readings|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|date=March 7, 2008|work=[[Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16624">The early concepts of soil were based on ideas developed by a German chemist, [[Justus von Liebig]] (1803–1873), and modified and refined by agricultural scientists who worked on samples of soil in laboratories, greenhouses, and on small field plots. The soils were rarely examined below the depth of normal tillage. These chemists held the "balance-sheet" theory of plant nutrition. Soil was considered a more or less static storage bin for plant nutrients—the soils could be used and replaced. This concept still has value when applied within the framework of modern soil science, although a useful understanding of soils goes beyond the removal of nutrients from soil by harvested crops and their return in manure, lime, and fertilizer.

The early geologists generally accepted the balance-sheet theory of soil fertility and applied it within the framework of their own discipline. They described soil as disintegrated rock of various sorts—granite, sandstone, glacial till, and the like. They went further, however, and described how the weathering processes modified this material and how geologic processes shaped it into landforms such as glacial moraines, alluvial plains, loess plains, and marine terraces. Geologist [[Nathaniel Shaler]] (1841–1906) monograph (1891) on the origin and nature of soils summarized the late 19th century geological concept of soils.

Early soil surveys were made to help farmers locate soils responsive to different management practices and to help them decide what crops and management practices were most suitable for the particular kinds of soil on their farms. Many of the early workers were geologists because only geologists were skilled in the necessary field methods and in scientific correlation appropriate to the study of soils. They conceived soils as mainly the weathering products of geologic formations, defined by landform and lithologic composition. Most of the soil surveys published before 1910 were strongly influenced by these concepts. Those published from 1910 to 1920 gradually added greater refinements and recognized more soil features but retained fundamentally geological concepts.

The balance-sheet theory of plant nutrition dominated the laboratory and the geological concept dominated field work. Both approaches were taught in many classrooms until the late 1920s. Although broader and more generally useful concepts of soil were being developed by some soil scientists, especially [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] (1833–1916) and [[George Nelson Coffey]] (1875-1967) in the United States and soil scientists in Russia, the necessary data for formulating these broader concepts came from the field work of the soil survey. {{Harv|Soil Survey Staff|1993}}

== Vasily Dokuchaev ==
[[File:Докучаев, Василий Васильевич.jpg|thumb|V. Dokuchaev with [[chernozem]]]]
:The scientific basis of soil science as a natural science was established by the classical works of [[Vasily V. Dokuchaev]]. Previously, soil had been considered a product of physicochemical transformations of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious mineral elements. Soil and bedrock were in fact equated.
:Dokuchaev considers the soil as a natural body having its own genesis and its own history of development, a body with complex and multiform processes taking place within it. The soil is considered as different from bedrock. The latter becomes soil under the influence of a series of soil-forming factors—climate, vegetation, country, relief and age. According to him, soil should be called the "daily" or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of living and dead organisms.
:Source: Krasil'nikov, N.A. (1958) Soil Microorganisms and Higher Plants. [http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010112Krasil/010112krasil.intro.html]

Beginning in 1870, the Russian school of soil science under the leadership of [[Vasily V. Dokuchaev|V. V. Dokuchaev]] (1846–1903) and N. M. Sibirtsev (1860–1900)&lt;ref&gt;''Sibirtzev N. M.'' Étude des sols de la Russie // Compte rendu: Congrès géologique international, 7-me session, Russie, 1897. St. Pétersbourg: M. Stassuléwitsch, 1899. P. 73-125: carte : 2 pl.&lt;/ref&gt; was developing a new concept of soil. The Russian workers conceived of soils as independent natural bodies, each with unique properties resulting from a unique combination of climate, living matter, parent material, relief, and time. They hypothesized that properties of each soil reflected the combined effects of the particular set of genetic factors responsible for the soil's formation. Hans Jenny later emphasized the functionally relatedness of soil properties and soil formation. The results of this work became generally available to Americans through the publication in 1914 of [[Konstantin Glinka|K.D. Glinka]]'s textbook in German and especially through its translation into English by C.F. Marbut in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Glinka K.D. The great soil groups of the world and their development. Michigan: Edwards bros. 1927. 234 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concepts were revolutionary. Properties of soils no longer were based wholly on inferences from the nature of the rocks or from climate or other environmental factors, considered singly or collectively; rather, by going directly to the soil itself, the integrated expression of all these factors could be seen in the morphology of the soils. This concept required that all properties of soils be considered collectively in terms of a completely integrated natural body. In short, it made possible a science of soil.

The early enthusiasm for the new concept and for the rising new discipline of soil science led some to suggest the study of soil could proceed without regard to the older concepts derived from geology and agricultural chemistry. Certainly the reverse is true. Besides laying the foundation for a soil science with its own principles, the new concept makes the other sciences even more useful. Soil morphology provides a firm basis on which to group the results of observation, experiments, and practical experience and to develop integrated principles that predict the behavior of the soils. {{Harv|Soil Survey Staff|1993}}

== Curtis Marbut ==
Under the leadership of [[Curtis F. Marbut|C. F. Marbut]], the Russian concept was broadened and adapted to conditions in the United States.This concept emphasized individual soil profiles to the subordination of external soil features and surface geology. By emphasizing soil profiles, however, soil scientists at first tended to overlook the natural variability of soils which can be substantial even within a small area. Overlooking the variability of soils seriously reduced the value of the maps which showed the location of the soils.

Furthermore, early emphasis on genetic soil profiles was so great as to suggest that material lacking a genetic profile, such as recent alluvium, was not soil. A sharp distinction was drawn between rock weathering and soil formation. Although a distinction between these sets of processes is useful for some purposes, rock and mineral weathering and soil formation are commonly indistinguishable.

The concept of soil was gradually broadened and extended during the years following 1930, essentially through consolidation and balance. The major emphasis had been on the soil profile. After 1930, morphological studies were extended from single pits to long trenches or a series of pits in an area of a soil. The morphology of a soil came to be described by ranges of properties deviating from a central concept instead of by a single "typical" profile. The development of techniques for mineralogical studies of clays also emphasized the need for laboratory studies.

Marbut emphasized strongly that classification of soils should be based on morphology instead of on theories of soil genesis, because theories are both ephemeral and dynamic. He perhaps overemphasized this point to offset other workers who assumed that soils had certain characteristics without examining the soils. Marbut tried to make clear that examination of the soils themselves was essential in developing a system of Soil Classification and in making usable soil maps. In spite of this, Marbut's work reveals his personal understanding of the contributions of geology to soil science. His soil classification of 1935 depends heavily on the concept of a "normal soil," the product of equilibrium on a landscape where downward erosion keeps pace with soil formation.

Clarification and broadening of the concept of a soil science also grew out of the increasing emphasis on detailed soil mapping. Concepts changed with increased emphasis on predicting crop yields for each kind of soil shown on the maps. Many of the older descriptions of soils had not been quantitative enough and the units of classification had been too heterogeneous for making yield and management predictions needed for planning the management of individual farms or fields.

During the 1930s, soil formation was explained in terms of loosely conceived processes, such as "podzolization," "laterization," and "calcification." These were presumed to be unique processes responsible for the observed common properties of the soils of a region. {{Harv|Soil Survey Staff|1993}}

== Hans Jenny ==
In 1941 [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)|Hans Jenny]]'s (1899–1992) Factors of Soil Formation, a system of quantitative pedology, concisely summarized and illustrated many of the basic principles of modern soil science to that date. Since 1940, time has assumed much greater significance among the factors of soil formation, and geomorphological studies have become important in determining the time that soil material at any place has been subjected to soil-forming processes. Meanwhile, advances in soil chemistry, soil physics, soil mineralogy, and soil biology, as well as in the basic sciences that underlie them, have added new tools and new dimensions to the study of soil formation. As a consequence, the formation of soil has come to be treated as the aggregate of many interrelated physical, chemical, and biological processes. These processes are subject to quantitative study in soil physics, soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, and soil biology. The focus of attention also has shifted from the study of gross attributes of the whole soil to the co-varying detail of individual parts, including grain-to-grain relationships. {{Harv|Soil Survey Staff|1993}}

== Guy Smith ==
In both the classification of Marbut and the 1938 classification developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the classes were described mainly in qualitative terms. Classes were not defined in quantitative terms that would permit consistent application of the system by different scientists. Neither system definitely linked the classes of its higher categories, largely influenced by genetic concepts initiated by the Russian soil scientists, to the soil series and their subdivisions that were used in soil mapping in the United States. Both systems reflected the concepts and theories of soil genesis of the time, which were themselves predominantly qualitative in character. Modification of the 1938 system in 1949 corrected some of its deficiencies but also illustrated the need for a reappraisal of concepts and principles. More than 15 years of work under the leadership of Guy Smith culminated in a new soil classification system. This became the official classification system of the U.S. National Cooperative Soil Survey in 1965 and was published in 1975 as Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys.  The Smith system was adopted in the U.S. and many other nations for their own classification system.

Another factor has had an immense impact on soil survey, especially during the 1960s. Before 1950, the primary applications of soil surveys were farming, ranching, and forestry. Applications for highway planning were recognized in some States as early as the late 1920s, and soil interpretations were placed in field manuals for highway engineers of some States during the 1930s and 1940s. Nevertheless, the changes in soil surveys during this period were mainly responses to the needs of farming, ranching, and forestry. During the 1950s and 1960s nonfarm uses of the soil increased rapidly. This created a great need for information about the effects of soils on those nonfarm uses. {{Harv|Soil Survey Staff|1993}}

== Bioturbation ==
A major re-evaluation of soil formation and the role of biota commenced in the 1980s, as soil-geomorphologists began to re-evaluate [[Charles Darwin]]'s and [[Nathaniel Shaler]]'s early ideas on the role of [[bioturbation]] in soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C., 1881, The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms, with observations on their habits: London, John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaler, N. S., 1891, The origin and nature of soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, p. 213-45.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is now ample evidence to support Darwin's conclusions, and in many areas biota that burrow in soil are major agents of [[pedogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, M. T., and Humphreys, G. S., 2005, Exploring pedogenesis via nuclide-based soil production rates and OSL-based bioturbation rates: Australian Journal of Soil Research, v. 43, p.767-779.&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.uky.edu/AS/Geography/People/Faculty/Wilkinson/2005-WilkinsonHumphreysPedogenesisAJSR.pdf].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, G.

[[File:Fiber to crystalite transformation.jpg|thumb|Fiber-like J-aggregates (yellow) and light-guiding microcrystallites (red)]]
A '''J-aggregate''' is a type of [[dye]] with an [[absorption band]] that shifts to a longer [[wavelength]] ([[bathochromic shift]]) of increasing sharpness (higher [[absorption coefficient]]) when it aggregates under the influence of a solvent or additive or concentration as a result of [[supramolecular]] self-organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Würthner, F., Kaiser, T. E. and Saha-Möller, C. R. (2011), ''J-Aggregates: From Serendipitous Discovery to Supramolecular Engineering of Functional Dye Materials''. Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 50: 3376–3410. {{doi|10.1002/anie.201002307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dye can be characterized further by a small [[Stokes shift]] with a narrow band. The J in J-aggregate refers to E.E. Jelley who discovered the phenomenon in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectral Absorption and Fluorescence of Dyes in the Molecular State'' EDWIN E. JELLEY Nature 138, 1009-1010 (12 December 1936) {{doi|10.1038/1381009a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nature 139, 631 (10 April 1937) | {{doi|10.1038/139631b0}} ''Molecular, Nematic and Crystal States of I: I-Diethyl--Cyanine Chloride'' EDWIN E. JELLEY&lt;/ref&gt; The dye is also called a Scheibe aggregate after G. Scheibe who also independently published on this topic in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Naturwissenschaften Volume 25, Number 5, 75, {{DOI|10.1007/BF01493278}} ''Polymerisation und polymere Adsorption als Ursache neuartiger Absorptionsbanden von organischen Farbstoffen'' G. Scheibe, L. Kandler and H. Ecker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Über die Veränderlichkeit der Absorptionsspektren in Lösungen und die Nebenvalenzen als ihre Ursache'' G. Scheibe Angewandte Chemie Volume 50, Issue 11, pages 212–219, 13. März 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheibe and Jelley independently observed that in [[ethanol]] the dye '''PIC chloride''' has two broad [[absorption maxima]] at around 19,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 20,500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (526 and 488&amp;nbsp;nm respectively) and that in water a third sharp absorption maximum appears at 17,500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  (571&amp;nbsp;nm). The intensity of this band further increases on increasing [[concentration]] and on adding [[sodium chloride]]. In the oldest aggregation model for PIC chloride the individual molecules are stacked like a roll of coins forming a [[supramolecular polymer]] but the true nature of this aggregation phenomenon is still under investigation. Analysis is complicated because PIC chloride is not a planar molecule. The molecular axis can tilt in the stack creating a helix pattern. In other models the dye molecules orient themselves in a brickwork, ladder, or staircase fashion.  In various experiments the J-band was found to split as a function of temperature, [[liquid crystal]] phases were found with concentrated solutions and [[CryoTEM]] revealed aggregeate rods 350&amp;nbsp;nm long and 2.3&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.

J-aggregate dyes are found with [[polymethine]] dyes in general, with [[cyanine]]s, [[merocyanine]]s, [[squaraine]] and [[perylene bisimide]]s. Certain π-conjugated macrocycles, reported by Swager and co-workers at MIT, were also found to form J-aggregates and exhibited exceptionally high photoluminescence quantum yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Julian M. W.|last2=Tischler|first2=Jonathan R.|last3=Kooi|first3=Steve E.|last4=Bulovic|first4=Vladimir|last5=Swager|first5=Timothy M.|title=Synthesis of J-Aggregating Dibenz[a,j]anthracene-Based Macrocycles|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|date=2009|volume=131|pages=5659–5666|doi=10.1021/ja900382r}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In H-aggregates a [[hypsochromic shift]] is observed with low or no [[fluorescence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">A '''lagg''', also called a '''moat''', is the very wet zone on the perimeter of [[peatland]] or a [[bog]] where water from the adjacent upland collects and flows slowly around the main [[peat]] mass. &lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson (1985), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
A lagg is an area of wetland, especially at the edge of [[raised bog]]s, in which water collects.&lt;ref&gt;Landesanstalt für Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-Württemberg: [http://www.fachdokumente.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/50130/pabl130008.html Feuchtgebiete und ihre Heuschreckenfauna ("Wetlands and their Grasshopper Fauna")] (retrieved 9 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It is often markedly different from the terrain either side and may consist of a morass of shrubs and murky water.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

In addition to water gathered from surrounding uplands, the lagg also picks up water flowing down from the domed centre of a [[raised bog]] through small channels - soaks or water tracks - to the steeply sloping shoulder or ''rand'' of the bog. At the foot of the ''rand'', the water collects and meets the water of the surrounding area on the boundary between the peat soil and mineral soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">[[File:Lac de Köycegiz (2839771466).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lake Köyceğiz]] Having an area of 5200 hectares, '''Lake Köyceğiz''' in the [[Muğla Province|province of Muğla]] is one of the vastest coastal lakes of [[Turkey]]. It bears the name of the town of [[Köyceğiz]], situated on its north bank. It is connected to the [[Mediterranean]] through a narrow and reedy channel called "Dalyan" which flows by a township of the same name ([[Dalyan]]) and the ancient city of [[Kaunos]]. Dalyan channel joins the sea at [[İztuzu Beach]]. 
 
The surroundings of the lake as a whole and particularly the banks of its Dalyan sea connection are important nature reserves and popular tourist attractions. 
They are part of the [[Köyceğiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area]]

== Characterization ==
[[File:Eilandje in het Meer van Koycegiz.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Island in Lake Köyceğiz]] 
The lake is fed by the Namnam and Yuvarlakçay rivers and a number of mountain brooks. The water of brooks, melting water and fresh water wells, mixes with warm sulfurous water that is released from a [[fault (geology)|fault]] and mildly brackish, oxygenated water that flows upriver with the rising tide.  The depth of the lake varies from 20 to 60 metres. The lake is abundant with fish.

At the northeast and southeast of Köyceğiz Lake there are plains, whereas other parts are surrounded by hills. The highest of these are [[Ölemez Mountain]] (937 meter) in the southwest, and [[Bozburun Tepesi]] (556 meter) in the south. In the lake there are five uninhabited islands, one of them known as'' Hapishane Adası'', Prison Island. Initially the island was used for military purposes, then turned into a prison island. It is no longer in use as such and deserted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Die Amphibien und Reptilien der Südwest-Türkei; M. Franzen, M. Bußmann, Th. Kordges. B. Thiesmeier; Laurent Verlag; 2008; {{ISBN|978-3-933066-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
The lake was formed about 7500 years ago, when the entire eastern part of the Mediterranean was afflicted by earthquakes.  At the south side of Köyceğiz Lake, there is a NW - SE [[fault line]], bordered by several sulfurous hot springs, amongst others [[Sultaniye]] Spa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Special Protection Area ==
[[File:Libellen in de rietkragen.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Dragonflies in the reeds]]The lake has evolved into an ecologically important area. Together with its banks and the Dalyan basin it comprises the [[Köyceğiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area]]. &lt;br /&gt;
On the banks north of Sultaniye, northwest of Hamitköy, at Köyceğiz, at Kavakarası and at Tepearası, there are still vast marshy forests with the endemic [[Liquidambar orientalis|Oriental Gumtree]]. The species primarily occurs in the province of Muğla, near Marmaris and in the Köyceğiz-Dalyan SEPA. The small [[wetlands]] around the lake are interesting because of their birdlife. The area attracts many birdwatchers. The area is also rich with reptiles (tortoises, turtles, [[terrapin]]s, snakes) and insects (dragonflies, damselflies).&lt;ref&gt;Cantecleer Natuur reisgidsen Turkije, blz. 81-86; Aygün Kasparek en Max Kasparek; 1992; {{ISBN|90-213-1000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the fish species in the lake are two [[Endemism|endemic]] dwarf gobies, ''[[Knipowitschia byblisia]]'' and ''[[Knipowitschia caunosi|K. caunosi]]'', which were only described to science in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ahnelt, H.

Since 1950, 121&amp;nbsp;known [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], tropical storms and tropical depressions have affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. Many of these storms also affect the country's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]], since the city is located on territory ceded by Maryland. Hurricanes are the most intense classification of these storms, while tropical storms and tropical depressions are generally weaker. The [[Delmarva Peninsula]] is often affected by cyclones   that brush the [[U.S. East Coast|East Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Tropical Prediction Center]]|title=Best Track Analysis|publisher=[[Unisys Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-05-08|url=http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028061629/http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/index.html|archive-date=2005-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central and [[Western Maryland]], as well as Washington, D.C., commonly receive rainfall from the remnants of storms that make landfall elsewhere and track northward.&lt;ref name="Mid Atl"/&gt; On rare occasions, the area experiences the effects of [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific storms]]; one such example of this is [[Hurricane Tico (1983)|Hurricane Tico]], which made landfall on [[Mexico]] and moved inland.

[[Hurricane Agnes]] of the [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season|1972 season]] was the deadliest storm, killing 19&amp;nbsp;people as a result of heavy flooding. The most damaging storm was [[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], which resulted in $151 million in damage. [[Hurricane Hazel]] caused sustained hurricane-force winds (winds of 75&amp;nbsp;mph (121&amp;nbsp;km/h) or greater) in the state, the only storm during the time period to do so.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt; No storms made landfall in Maryland at hurricane intensity.

[[File:Kraftwerk im Dunst.jpg|thumb|250px|Power station visible through mist]]
[[File:Oberfallenberg 8.jpg|thumb|250px|Mist near the [[Austria]]-[[ Switzerland ]] border in December 2006.]]

'''Mist''' is a phenomenon caused by small droplets of [[water]] suspended in [[air]]. Physically, it is an example of a [[dispersion_(chemistry)|dispersion]]. It is most commonly seen where warm, moist air meets sudden cooling, such as in [[exhalation|exhale]]d air in the winter, or when throwing water onto the hot stove of a [[sauna]]. It can be created artificially with [[aerosol spray|aerosol canisters]] if the [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] conditions are right. It can also occur as part of natural [[weather]], when [[relative humidity|humid air]] cools rapidly, for example when the air comes into contact with surfaces that are much cooler than the air.

The formation of mist, as of other [[suspension_(chemistry)|suspension]]s, is greatly aided by the presence of [[nucleation site]]s on which the suspended water phase can congeal. Thus even such unusual sources as small particulates from [[volcanic eruption]]s, releases of [[hydrogen fluoride|strongly polar gas]]es, and even the [[magnetospheric]] ions associated with [[aurora|polar lights]] can in right conditions trigger the formation of mist and can make mirrors appear foggy.

==Description==
[[Cloud cover]] is often referred to as "mist" when encountered on mountains, whereas moisture suspended above a [[body of water]] or [[marsh]] area is usually called "fog". One difference between mist and [[fog]] is [[visibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcn27.dial.pipex.com/cloudsrus/mistnfog.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-01-16 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121210065921/http://www.rcn27.dial.pipex.com/cloudsrus/mistnfog.html |archive-date=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is called fog if the visibility is {{cvt|1|km|yd}} or less. In the U.K., the definition of fog is visibility less than {{cvt|100|m|ft}} (for driving purposes, UK Highway Code rule 226),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/driving-adverse-weather-conditions-226-to-237/overview-226 |title=Driving in adverse weather conditions (226 to 237) |publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]] |work=gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for pilots the distance is 1&amp;nbsp;km. Otherwise, it is known as mist.

Mist makes a [[light beam]] visible from the side via [[refraction]] and [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] on the suspended water droplets.

"Scotch mist" is a light steady drizzle.

Mist usually occurs near the shores and is often associated with fog. Mist can be as high as mountain tops when extreme temperatures are low.

==Freezing mist==
'''Freezing mist''' is similar to [[freezing fog]], only the density is less and the visibility greater (when fog falls below {{cvt|0|C|F}}, it is known as freezing fog).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/359/ |title=What Is Difference Between Ice Fog and Freezing Fog? |first=Jeff |last=Haby |publisher=theweatherprediction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

An '''oceanic core complex''', or '''megamullion''', is a seabed [[geology|geologic]] feature that forms a long ridge perpendicular to a [[mid-ocean ridge]]. It contains smooth domes that are lined with transverse ridges like a corrugated roof.  They can vary in size from 10 to 150&amp;nbsp;km in length, 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;km in width, and 500 to 1500&amp;nbsp;m in height.

==History, distribution and exploration==
The first oceanic core complexes described were identified in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cann|Blackman|Smith|McAllister|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Tucholke|Lin|Kleinrock|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then numerous such structures have been identified primarily in oceanic lithosphere formed at intermediate, slow- and ultra-slow spreading [[mid-ocean ridges]], as well as [[back-arc basins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fujimoto|Cannat|Fujioka|Gamo|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Ohara|Yoshida|Kato|Kasuga|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include 10-1000 square km expanses of ocean floor and therefore of the oceanic lithosphere, particularly along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]&lt;ref name="Smith-etal-2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Cann|Escartí|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Escartín|Smith|Cann|Schouten|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cannat|Sauter|Mendel|Ruellan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these structures have been drilled and sampled, showing that the footwall can be composed of both [[mafic]] plutonic and [[ultramafic]] rocks ([[gabbro]] and [[peridotite]] primarily, in addition to [[diabase]]), and a thin shear zone that includes hydrous [[phyllosilicates]].  Oceanic core complexes are often associated with active hydrothermal fields.

==Formation==

Oceanic core complex structures form at slow spreading oceanic [[plate boundaries]] which have a limited supply of upwelling [[magma]]. These zones have low upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] temperatures and long [[transform faults]] develop. [[Rift valley]]s do not develop along the expansion axes of slow spreading boundaries.  Expansion takes place along low-angle [[detachment fault]]s. The core complex builds on the uplifted side of the fault where most of the [[gabbro]]ic (or crustal) material is stripped away to expose mantle [[peridotite]].  They comprise peridotites [[ultramafic rock]]s of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and to a lesser extent gabbroic rocks from the Earth's crust.

Each detachment fault has three notable features: a breakaway zone where the fault began, an exposed fault surface that rides over the dome and a termination, which is usually marked by a valley and adjacent ridge.

However, the formation process through detachment faults has its limitations, such as the scarce seismic evidence that low-angle normal faulting do exist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholz|first1=C.H.|title=The Mechanics of Earthquakes and faulting, 2nd ed.|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where the presumably significant offset along such faults, which transect the lithosphere at low angle should be involved with some friction. The rarity of [[eclogite]] in oceanic core complexes also casts doubt on the deep source in such domains. The abundance of peridotites in oceanic core complexes could be accounted for by a unique variation of ocean-ocean subduction at the junction of slow-spreading oceanic ridges and fracture zones. Analog models of subduction show that density contrast of more than 200 kg/m^3 between two juxtaposed lithospheric slabs would lead the underthrusting of the denser one to depth of circa 50 km, where remineralization of pyroxenes into garnets would increase the slab's density and drive it into the mantle, provided that the friction between the slabs would be low &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mart|first1=Y.|last2=Aharonov|first2=E.|last3=Mulugeta|first3=G.|last4=Ryan|first4=W.B.F.|last5=Tentler|first5=T|last6=Goren|first6=L|page=1081|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is ground to presume that at slow ridge and fracture zone intersections, the density contrast of the juxtaposed slabs would exceed 200 kg/m^3, the friction between the slabs would be low, the thermal gradient would be ca. 100 deg. C/km, and with ca. 5% water contents, the drop of the solidus of basalt at relatively low pressure would enable the co-occurrence of serpentinites and peridotites, the abundant rock-types in oceanic core complexes.

==Examples==
[[Image:Amotoki ASPSP Megamullion En.jpg|thumb|400px|Saint Peter Saint Paul Megamullion, Equatorial Atlantic Ocean&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Motoki|Sichel|Campos|Srivastava|2009|loc=Fig. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some 50 oceanic core complexes have been identified, including:
* Godzilla Mullion, part of the [[Parece Vela Rift]] in the Western [[Pacific Ocean]] between [[Japan]] and the [[Philippines]] was discovered in 2001. It is about 150&amp;nbsp;km long, about as large as the State of Delaware, and is the largest Ocean Core Complex in the world. 
*The Saint Peter Saint Paul complex lies in the equatorial [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is 90&amp;nbsp;km long and 4000&amp;nbsp;m high. The apex forms the [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]]. This is one of the few known examples where sea floor mantle rocks are exposed above sea level.

==Research==

Scientific interest in core complexes has dramatically increased following an expedition in 1996 which mapped the [[Atlantis Massif]]. This expedition was the first to associate the complex structures with detachment faults.  Research includes:
*To investigate the structure of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]:
:The complexes provide cross sections of mantle material which could only otherwise be found by drilling deep into the mantle. The deep drilling that is required to penetrate 6-7&amp;nbsp;km through the crust is beyond current technical and financial constraints. Selective sample drilling into the complex structures are already underway.

*To study mineralisation and the release of minerals from the mantle:
:A steeply sloping detachment fault which penetrates deeply can be a conduit for hot mineral-rich [[hydrothermal]] fluids to circulate towards the surface and build [[mineral deposit]]s.  These deposits can grow massive because detachment faults persist for hundreds of thousands of years. The Woods Hole Institution is studying one such site, called the TAG hydrothermal field on the Atlantis Massif.
*To investigate marine magnetic anomalies:
:The conventional view that marine [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] arose in the upper, extrusive layer of the [[oceanic crust]] requires a rethink because perfectly normal magnetic anomalies arise at core complexes, where the crust has been stripped away. This suggests that the lower part of the ocean crust contains a substantial magnetic signature.

{{globalize|article|USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Onesource|date=February 2015}}

'''Onsite''' (or '''on-site''') '''sewage facilities''' ('''OSSF''') are [[wastewater]] systems designed to treat and dispose of effluent on the same property that produces the wastewater.

A [[septic tank]] and [[Septic drain field|drainfield]] combination is a fairly common type of on-site sewage facility in the United States. OSSFs account for approximately 25% of all domestic [[wastewater treatment]] in the United States. Onite sewage facilities may also be based on small-scale [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[biofilter]] units, [[Membrane bioreactor|membrane bioreactors]] or [[Sequencing batch reactor|sequencing batch reactors]]. These can be thought of as scaled down versions of municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants.

==Process description==
[[File:Septic field.jpg|thumb|Septic field (background) in public park at [[Wallendbeen]], Australia]]
The primary mechanism of biological waste recycling in the natural environment is performed by other organisms such as animals, insects, soil microorganisms, plants, and fungi, which consume all available nutrients in the waste, leaving behind fully decomposed solids that become part of [[topsoil]], and pure [[drinking water]] that has been stripped of everything that can possibly be consumed and utilized. This natural biological purification requires time and space to process wastes.

In virtually all engineered onsite sewage facilities, recycling and decomposition by natural organisms is still the primary mechanism of sewage disposal. Giving the organisms the time they need to decompose wastes is accomplished by establishing minimum sewage retention and settling times, and minimum liquid flow distances between sewage disposal sites and [[surface water]] or [[water well]]s.

===Differences===
It is normal for animals such as mice, rats, flies, and parasites to participate in the fully natural biological waste recycling process. Engineered facilities typically attempt to exclude them to prevent out of control population explosions and [[infestation]], and prevent spread of [[vermin]] and [[disease]].

Although the solids collected by onsite sewage facilities can potentially be used as compost to build topsoil, these solids are often incompletely decomposed due to either a lack of onsite storage space to wait for decomposition (municipal facilities), or because the solids are being stacked in a layered structure of new waste solids on top of previously decomposed solids (septic tanks and outhouses). Due to the incomplete state of decomposition, when removed from an onsite sewage facility, these solids are typically referred to as ''sludge'' rather than ''compost'', and have powerful offensive odors arising from the microorganisms still consuming nutrients in the sludge. 

Engineered facilities that use water suspension to transport solids (private septic systems and municipal facilities) typically form a floating layer in their primary settling tank, consisting of low-density liquids such as oils, buoyant solids, and soap foam. This is referred to as ''scum'' and is slowly decomposed by microorganisms, eventually falling to the bottom of the settling tank as part of the sludge. When private septic tanks are emptied of solids, the tank is typically vacuumed empty and the incompletely digested scum is added to the incompletely digested sludge, further adding to its aroma and bioactivity.

If left completely undisturbed and exposed to the open air through a vent, the sludge and scum in a settling tank will eventually be turned completely into low-odor compost. By building two tanks side by side, and diverting sewage between them, one tank can be allowed to rest while the other is in use, and the resting tank can be safely and easily cleaned out by hand before it is used again. This has been proposed as a solution for onsite sewage facilities in subsistence agriculture economies where hand labor is the most abundant.

Although human body waste is no different from the waste of any other animal, municipal facilities may be required to bury the collected solids in landfills, due to the risk of toxic contaminants placed into the shared communal sewage system, by humans unaware of the harm they are causing. Municipal facilities may also collect runoff from roadways, which contains traces of all the various chemicals used in vehicles such as brake fluid and engine oil, and those used in melting ice and snow.  Private septic systems typically do not experience these issues, as the homeowner is directly aware that they must not pour toxic chemicals down the drain.

==Improving treatment through performance requirements==

Most onsite wastewater treatment systems are of the conventional type, consisting of a septic tank and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS). Site limitations and more stringent performance requirements have led to significant improvements in the design of wastewater treatment systems and how they are managed. Over the past 20 years the onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) industry has developed many new treatment technologies that can achieve high performance levels on sites with size, soil, ground water, and landscape limitations that might preclude installing conventional systems. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies are based on defining the performance requirements of the system, characterizing wastewater flow and pollutant loads, evaluating site conditions, defining performance and design boundaries, and selecting a system design that addresses these factors.

Performance requirements can be expressed as numeric criteria (e.g., pollutant concentration or mass loading limits) or narrative criteria (e.g., no odors or visible sheen) and are based on the assimilative capacity of regional ground water or surface waters, water quality objectives, and public health goals. Wastewater flow and pollutant content help define system design and size and can be estimated by comparing the size and type of facility with measured effluent outputs from similar, existing facilities. Site evaluations integrate detailed analyses of regional hydrology, geology, and water resources with site specific characterization of soils, slopes, structures, property lines, and other site features to further define system design requirements and determine the physical placement of system components.

Most of the alternative treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains settleable solids, grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, [[trickling filters|fixed-media filtration]], and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.

==Usage==
===United States===
In the United States, on site sewage facilities collect, treat, and release about {{convert|4|e9USgal|m3}} of treated effluent per day from an estimated 26 million homes, businesses, and recreational facilities nationwide (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). Recognition of the impacts of onsite systems on ground water and surface water quality (e.g., nitrate and bacteria contamination, nutrient inputs to surface waters) has increased interest in optimizing the systems' performance. [[Public health]] and environmental protection officials now acknowledge that onsite systems are not just temporary installations that will be replaced eventually by centralized sewage treatment services, but permanent approaches to treating wastewater for release and reuse in the environment. Onsite systems are recognized as viable, low-cost, long-term, decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment if they are planned, designed, installed, operated, and maintained properly (USEPA, 1997). NOTE: In addition to existing state and local oversight, decentralized wastewater treatment systems that serve more than 20 people might become subject to regulation under the USEPA's Underground Injection Control Program, although EPA has proposed not to include them (64FR22971:5/7/01).

Although some onsite wastewater management programs have functioned successfully in the past, problems persist. Most current onsite regulatory programs focus on permitting and installation.

Few programs address onsite system operation and maintenance, resulting in failures that lead to unnecessary costs and risks to public health and water resources. Moreover, the lack of coordination among agencies that oversee land use planning, zoning, development, water resource protection, public health initiatives, and onsite systems causes problems that could be prevented through a more cooperative approach. Effective management of onsite systems requires rigorous planning, design, installation, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and controls.

====Public health and water resource impacts====
State and tribal agencies report that onsite septic systems currently constitute the third most common source of [[groundwater pollution]] and that these systems have failed because of inappropriate siting or design or inadequate long-term maintenance (USEPA, 1996a). In the 1996 Clean Water Needs Survey (USEPA, 1996b), states and tribes also identified more than 500 communities as having failed septic systems that have caused public health problems. The discharge of partially treated sewage from malfunctioning onsite systems was identified as a principal or contributing source of degradation in 32 percent of all harvest-limited shellfish growing areas. Onsite wastewater treatment systems have also contributed to an overabundance of nutrients in ponds, lakes, and coastal estuaries, leading to the excessive growth of algae and other nuisance aquatic plants (USEPA, 1996b). In addition, onsite systems contribute to contamination of drinking water sources. USEPA estimates that 168,000 viral illnesses and 34,000 bacterial illnesses occur each year as a result of consumption of drinking water from systems that rely on improperly treated ground water. Malfunctioning septic systems have been identified as one potential source of ground water contamination (USEPA, 2000).

=== Europe ===
The potential market volume of on-site treatment is suggested to be about 35 million [[Population equivalent|population equivalents]] for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eggimann S., Truffer, B., Feldmann, U., Maurer, M.|year=2018|title=Screening European market potentials for small modular wastewater treatment systems – an inroad to sustainability transitions in urban water management?|journal=Land use Policy|volume=78|pages=711-725|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Dominic}}

'''Operation Dominic''' was a series of 31 [[nuclear test]] explosions with a 38.1 Mt total yield conducted in 1962 by the United States in the [[Pacific Proving Grounds|Pacific]].&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; This test series was scheduled quickly, in order to respond in kind to the Soviet resumption of testing after the tacit 1958–1961 test moratorium. Most of these shots were conducted with free-fall bombs dropped from [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber aircraft. Twenty of these shots were to test new weapons designs; six to test weapons effects; and several shots to confirm the reliability of existing weapons. The [[Thor (rocket)|Thor missile]] was also used to lift warheads into near-space to conduct [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] tests; these shots were collectively called [[Operation Fishbowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/863/1 | title=Space ghost | date=May 7, 2007 | author=[[Dwayne A. Day]] | work=[[The Space Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Dominic occurred during a period of high [[Cold War]] tension between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], since the Cuban [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] had occurred not long before. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the end of a three-year [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on nuclear testing on August 30, 1961, and Soviet tests recommenced on September 1, initiating a series of tests that included the detonation of [[Tsar Bomba]]. President [[John F. Kennedy]] responded by authorizing ''Operation Dominic''. It was the largest nuclear weapons testing program ever conducted by the United States and the last atmospheric test series conducted by the U.S., as the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] was signed in [[Moscow]] the following year.

The operation was undertaken by [[Joint Task Force]] 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_24/frigate_bird.htm |title=The Other Frigate Bird |date=Fall 2004 |author=Edward C.

A '''power distribution center (PDC)''' is [[electrical equipment]] designed to regulate the distribution of [[electricity|electrical power]] to various equipment, be that to machines in a factory or to various systems on an automotive vehicle. Typically, a [[switchgear]] supplies power to the PDC. The PDC housing contains a [[transformer]], which steps down the incoming power to a lower [[voltage]] to feed other plant loads such as [[motor control center]]s (MCC's). Feeder breakers for these loads will be located on the PDC. PDC's will often contain additional protective relays, monitoring equipment, fuses, terminal points, etc.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities.  SAIFI is the average number of interruptions that a customer would experience, and is calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SAIFI} = \frac{\sum{\lambda_i N_i}}{N_T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; is the failure rate, &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of customers for location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of customers served. In other words,

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SAIFI} = \frac{\mbox{total number of customer interruptions}}{\mbox{total number of customers served}}&lt;/math&gt;

SAIFI is measured in units of interruptions per customer. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.10 interruptions per customer.

'''Samuel Shenton''' (March 1903 – 2 March 1971) was the founder in 1956 of the ''Flat Earth Society'', based in [[Dover, England]]. He lectured tirelessly on this to youth clubs, political and student groups and during the [[Space Race]] in the 1960s he was frequently seen on television and in newspapers promoting his views. He was well known for his promotion of the theory, but had a reputation as being a primary school dropout.

==Life==
Samuel Shenton was a signwriter, who lived with his wife Lillian in a ginger-brick terrace in suburban Dover. He was son of an army sergeant major, born in [[Great Yarmouth]], and by the 1920s claimed to have invented an airship that would rise into the atmosphere and remain stationary until the earth spun westwards at {{convert|1000|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to the desired destination at the same latitude. Shenton could not understand why someone had not previously thought of this idea until he discovered, in the reading room of the [[British Library]] at [[Bloomsbury]] that [[Charles Isaac Stevens|Archbishop Stevens]], a friend of Lady Blount, the founder of the [[Universal Zetetic Society]], had suggested an aircraft design similar to his own. When he discovered [[Samuel Rowbotham|Parallax]]'s ''Zetetic Astronomy'' he was an instant convert. "What the authorities were concealing, Shenton decided, was the 'fact' that the earth was flat".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=220–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He discovered this theory in primary school, and had a reputation in his community as being an primary school drop out.

Shenton soon constructed a cosmology, based partly on his interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], that the earth was a flat disk centred on the [[North Pole]] with the zetetic notion of the [[South Pole]] being an impenetrable wall of ice, that marked the edge of the pit that is the earth in the endless flat plane forming the universe. The sun cast a narrow beam like a flashlight moving over a table as it traced flat circles that varied over the 365-day cycles. The sun was {{convert|32|mi}} in diameter {{convert|3000|mi}} above the earth and the moon also 32 miles in diameter but only {{convert|2550|mi}} above the earth.

In 1956 he founded the Flat Earth Society as a direct descendant of the Universal Zetetic Society but with a less religious emphasis, found a president in William Mills, a relative of one of Lady Blount's followers and held its inaugural meeting in November at Mills' home in London, with Shenton as secretary. One of the attendees, attending out of curiosity, was the ''[[The Sky at Night|Sky at Night]]'' astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] who recounted his experience in his book ''Can you speak Venusian?''. Shenton claimed that [[George Bernard Shaw]] attended one meeting, declaring the presentation was "very persuasive".&lt;ref name="Gilmore 1967" /&gt; Despite his contrary ideas, Shenton was elected a fellow of both the [[Royal Astronomical Society|Royal Astronomical]] and [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical]] Societies.&lt;ref name="Gilmore 1967"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484882/the_cincinnati_enquirer|title=So now we know: The Earth is not only flat—it's motionless, too|last=Gilmore|first=Eddy|date=26 March 1967|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=26-I|subscription=y|via=Newspapers.com}}  {{free access}} Readable clippings in four parts: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484925/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ 1] •

Despite the launch in October 1957 of [[Sputnik]], the world's first artificial satellite, Shenton proved a popular speaker to small groups, enjoying particularly talking to children, never declining an invitation. [[File:SF10084a.jpg|thumb|Samuel Shenton lecturing at the Science Fiction Society, UCL, in 1966.]] He claimed that satellites simply circled over a flat disc-world: "Would sailing round the [[Isle of Wight]] prove that it were spherical?", he demanded. As manned space flight started in 1961, Shenton began to attract international media attention with his denials, telling the ''[[Coshocton Tribune]]'' on 10 May that the astronauts could never travel into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17487617/the_tribune/|title=Orbiting globe impossible, Flat Earth Society claims|last=Musel|first=Robert|date=10 May 1961|work=The Tribune|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=United Press International|location=Coshocton, Ohio|page=12|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[John Glenn]] orbited the world, he was sent an IFERS membership with the message "Ok Wise Guy" added to it.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|author=John Glenn|title=Friendship 7, 20 Years Later Random Remembrances|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/legacy/20year.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904153343/http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/legacy/20year.htm|archivedate=4 Sep 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Shenton continued to lecture largely at his own expense but he suffered two strokes in 1963 probably as a result of his exertions.{{According to whom|date=February 2018|probably as a result of his exertions.}} In January 1964 the ''[[New York Times]]'' carried a piece about the IFERS.{{Relevance inline|sentence|date=February 2018}}  During a parliamentary debate, [[Enoch Powell]] likened his opponents to "flat-earthers" and [[Harold Wilson]] reportedly slung back the insult in turn. Shenton was outraged and wrote letters of complaint.

The [[Gemini 4]] mission marked a change of pace for his campaign and he was to receive letters from across the world for the next few years.&lt;ref name="Gilmore 1967" /&gt; In 1966 he produced a pamphlet, ''The Plane Truth'', which included a circular informing members "that modern astronomy and space flight were insults to God and divine punishment for humankind's arrogance was a mere matter of time". But the [[Lunar Orbiter program]] led to a sharp decline in membership. "Visual images, whether they were globes, photographs or television pictures, were clearly critical to how people perceived the earth's shape .. and pre-school children could know that it was round even if they had no grasp of the words 'mathematics', 'geography', 'astronomy' and 'science'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=234–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, his health had deteriorated further and his signwriting business had collapsed although the media attention continued. But he stuck to his principles of 'zetetic enquiry' in which only personally acquired facts were permissible. In January 1969, IFERS had dropped to 100 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="Coleman 1969"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17488536/the_guardian/|title=The league of lost causes–4: Globites are not convinced|last=Coleman|first=Terry|date=2 January 1969|work=The Guardian|location=London, England|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=7|subscription=y|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}} Readable clippings in three parts: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17488548/the_guardian/ 1] •

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3530">[[Norway]] is sometimes referred to as '''"The Neutral Ally"'''. During World War I, while theoretically a neutral country, British pressure and anti-German sentiment in the population prompted the government to favour Britain highly in relation to Norway's large shipping fleet and vast fish supplies. The term was coined by Norwegian historian [[Olav Riste]] in the 1960s.

In 1905, when Norway gained independence, the nation's politicians agreed that Norway should remain neutral in international conflicts. Since the [[Great Power]]s had no desire for unrest in [[Scandinavia]], they signed an agreement respecting Norway's neutrality. Still, the political direction was clear: fearing [[Russia]]n ambition in the north, the sentiment was that Norway should be neutral if war broke out, and rely on help from Great Britain if attacked.

This affinity westwards was substantiated by international trade. In the early 1900s, Norway's [[merchant fleet]] was one of the largest in the world, and the country required vast supplies of oil, coal and steel to build and operate it. When war broke out in 1914, Norway was exporting great amounts of fish to Germans and British alike, much to the dismay of the British Government. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] started preventing the Germans from purchasing these fish stocks by overbidding them, but trade in other areas continued. Imports of Norwegian [[copper ore]], nickel and [[pyrite]] were vital to the German war industry, and by the end of 1916, Norway's Government was put under heavy pressure. Several agreements were made, none completely satisfying to the British.

On Christmas Eve 1916, the British issued an [[ultimatum]], informing the Norwegian [[Foreign Minister]], [[Nils Claus Ihlen]], that British exports of coal to Norway would cease unless trade with Germany stopped. The Norwegian Government felt they had no option but to comply with this demand. This coincided with Germany's expansion of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] at the beginning of 1917. In total, 436&lt;ref&gt;NAA: A5954, 192/34 http://www.naa.gov.au/go.aspx?i=645339&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian ships were sunk in the period 1914–1917, out of 847 in the course of the whole war. More than 1150 sailors died during this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ssb.no/emner/historisk_statistikk/aarbok/ht-030110-115.html| publisher = ssb.no| title = Krigsforliste skip og sjøfolk omkommet under første verdenskrig.| accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating an increasingly anti-German sentiment throughout the shipping nation of Norway.

Thus, both commerce and political sympathies tied Norway and Britain together during World War I, even though Norway remained officially neutral.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the concept of ''tube sound'' did not exist, because practically all electronic amplification of audio signals was done with vacuum tubes and other comparable methods were not known or used.

Many [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]], and keyboard players in several genres also prefer the sound of tube [[instrument amplifier]]s or preamplifiers. Tube amplifiers are also preferred by some listeners for stereo systems.{{Explain|date=March 2018}}

==History==
Before the commercial introduction of [[transistor]]s in the 1950s, electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes (known in Great Britain as "valves"). By the 1960s, [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] (transistorized) amplification had become more common because of its smaller size, lighter weight, lower heat production, and improved reliability.  Tube amplifiers have retained a loyal following amongst some audiophiles and musicians. Some tube designs command very high prices, and tube amplifiers have been going through a revival since Chinese and Russian markets have opened to global trade—tube production never went out of vogue in these countries.{{Explain|date=March 2018}}

== Musical instrument amplification ==

Some musicians&lt;ref&gt;For example, Robert Walser ''Running with the Devil: power, gender, and madness in heavy metal music'', Wesleyan University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8195-6260-2}} 
 pages 43-44 discusses the "tube sound" sought by [[Eddie Van Halen]]&lt;/ref&gt;
prefer the [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]] characteristics of tubes over transistors for electric guitar, bass, and other instrument amplifiers. In this case, generating deliberate (and in the case of electric guitars often considerable) audible [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] or ''overdrive'' is usually the goal. The term can also be used to describe the sound created by specially-designed transistor amplifiers or [[Digital data|digital]] modeling devices that try to closely emulate the characteristics of the tube sound.

The tube sound is often subjectively described as having a "warmth" and "richness", but the source of this is by no means agreed on. Possible explanations mention non-linear clipping, or the higher levels of second-order harmonic distortion in single-ended designs, resulting from the tube interacting with the [[inductance]] of the output transformer.

{{See also|Distortion (guitar)|Guitar effects}}

==Audible differences==
The sound of a tube amplifier is partly a function of the circuit topologies typically used with tubes versus the topologies typically used with transistors, as much as the gain devices themselves. Beyond circuit design, there are other differences, such as the differing electronic characteristics of [[triode]], [[tetrode]], and [[pentode]] vacuum tubes, along with their solid-state counterparts such as [[bipolar transistor]], [[FET]], [[MOSFET]], [[IGBT]], etc. These can be further divided into differences among various models of the said device type (e.g. EL34 vs. 6L6 tetrodes). In many cases circuit topologies need to account for these differences to either homogenize their widely varying characteristics or to establish a certain operating point required by the device.

The low frequency roll-off can be explained by many tube amplifiers having high output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] compared to transistor designs. The roll-off is due to higher device impedance and reduced feedback margins. (More feedback results in lower output impedance.) Some tube amplifier designs use minimal feedback while others use quite a bit more of it. How much feedback is optimal for tube amplifiers remains a matter of debate.

==Harmonic content and distortion==
Triodes (and [[MOSFET]]s) produce a monotonically decaying harmonic distortion spectrum.{{Clarify|date=June 2010|reason=Explain how they differ from other vacuum tubes and transistors, if there is relevance to the article}} Even-order harmonics and odd-order harmonics are both [[natural number]] multiples of the input frequency.

A psychoacoustic analysis tells us that high-order harmonics are more offensive than low. For this reason, distortion measurements should weight audible high-order harmonics more than low. The importance of high-order harmonics suggests that distortion should be regarded in terms of the complete series or of the composite wave-form that this series represents. It has been shown that weighting the harmonics by the square of the order correlates well with subjective listening tests. Weighting the distortion wave-form proportionally to the square of the frequency gives a measure of the reciprocal of the radius of curvature of the wave-form, and is therefore related to the sharpness of any corners on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter |first=D. E. L. | date=April 1950 |title=The Influence of High-Order Products in Non-Linear Distortion |journal=Electronic Engineering |volume=22 |issue=266 |pages=152–153 |publisher= |location=London, UK |issn= |quote=That high-order harmonics are more offensive than low has long been recognised... |ref=shorter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on said discovery, highly sophisticated methods of weighting of distortion harmonics have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hephaestusaudio.com/media/2008/11/distortion_aes_ii.pdf |title=Auditory Perception of Nonlinear Distortion |last1=Geddes |first1=Earl R. |authorlink1= |last2=Lee |first2=Lidia W. |authorlink2= | date=October 2003 |conference=AES 115th Convention |conferenceurl=http://www.aes.org/events/115/ |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |location=New York, New York |pages= |format=PDF |accessdate= |quote= |ref=gedlee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they concentrate in the origins of the distortion, they are mostly useful for the engineers who develop and design audio amplifiers, but on the other hand they may be difficult to use for the reviewers who only measure the output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard |first=Keith | date=September 2005 |title=Weighting up |journal=Multi Media Manufacturer |pages=7–11 |publisher=Audio Amateur |location=Peterborough, New Hampshire |issn= |url=http://www.gedlee.com/downloads/THD_.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221135133/http://www.gedlee.com/downloads/THD_.pdf|archivedate=2005-12-21|accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= |dead-url=yes |ref=howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A huge issue is that measurements of objective nature (for example, those indicating magnitude of scientifically quantifiable variables such as current, voltage, power, THD, dB, and so on) fail to address subjective preferences. Especially in case of designing or reviewing instrument amplifiers this is a considerable issue because design goals of such differ widely from design goals of likes of HiFi amplifiers. HiFi design largely concentrates on improving performance of objectively measurable variables. Instrument amplifier design largely concentrates on subjective issues, such as "pleasantness" of certain type of tone. Fine examples are cases of distortion or frequency response: HiFi design tries to minimize distortion and focuses on eliminating "offensive" harmonics. It also aims for ideally flat response. Musical instrument amplifier design deliberately introduces distortion and great non-linearities in frequency response. Former "offensiveness" of certain types of harmonics becomes a highly subjective topic, along with preferences towards certain types of frequency responses (whether flat or un-flat).

Push–pull amplifiers use two nominally identical gain devices in tandem. One consequence of this is that all even-order harmonic products cancel, allowing only odd-order distortion.&lt;ref&gt;A First Course in Electronics, pg 414-416. Anwar A. Khan and Kanchan K. Dey&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a push–pull amplifier has a symmetric ([[even and odd functions|odd symmetry]]) [[transfer characteristic]]. Power amplifiers are of the push-pull type to avoid the inefficiency of [[Power amplifier classes#Class A|Class A amplifiers]]. 

A single-ended amplifier will generally produce even as well as odd harmonics.&lt;ref name="ask the doctors"&gt;[http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2005/october/content/content2.html Ask the Doctors: Tube vs. Solid-State Harmonics]—Universal Audio Webzine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volume cranked up"&gt;[http://www.trueaudio.com/at_eetjlm.htm Volume cranked up in amp debate]—Electronic Engineering Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvtiega"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A particularly famous research about "tube sound" compared a selection of single-ended tube microphone preamplifiers to a selection of push-pull transistorized microphone preamplifiers.&lt;ref name="hamm1973" /&gt; The difference in harmonic patterns of these two topologies has henceforth been often incorrectly attributed as difference of tube and solid-state devices (or even the amplifier class). Push–pull tube amplifiers can be run in class A (rarely), AB, or B. Also, a [[Power amplifier classes#Class B|class-B amplifier]] may have crossover distortion that will be typically high order and thus sonically very undesirable indeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meusburger |first=Walter |title=A Novel Power Acmplifier Topology Without Crossover Distortion |url=http://www.moehrenbude.de/Moehre/images2/download/No_Crossoveramp_W.Meusberger.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120125122/http://www.moehrenbude.de/Moehre/images2/download/No_Crossoveramp_W.Meusberger.pdf|archivedate=2007-11-20|format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-18 |type=D.Tech. thesis | date=October 1999 |publisher=Graz University of Technology |location=Graz, Austria |page=27 |chapter=4 Crossover Distortion in Class B |dead-url=yes |quote=Crossover distortion generates unpleasant high order harmonics with the potential to increase in percentage as signal level falls and is much more objectionable to the listener than distortion resulting from a smoothly curved characteristic, even if they have the same THD. Therefore it is desirable to reduce crossover distortion to a minimum amount.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distortion content of class-A circuits (SE or PP) typically monotonically reduces as the signal level is reduced, asymptotic to zero during quiet passages of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.passdiy.com/project/articles/audio-distortion-and-feedback |title=Audio, Distortion and Feedback |last=Pass |first=Nelson |authorlink=Nelson Pass |date= |month= |year=2008 |website=PassDiy |at= Harmonic Distortion and Sound  |accessdate=12 October 2013 |quote=The smooth transfer curves of Class A amplifiers have a characteristic which is monotonic, that is to say the distortion goes down as the output declines. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason class-A amplifiers are especially desired for classical and acoustic music since the distortion ''relative to signal'' decreases as the music gets quieter. Class-A amplifiers measure best at low power. Class-AB and B amplifiers measure best just below max rated power.

Loudspeakers present a reactive load to an amplifier ([[capacitance]], [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]). This impedance may vary in value with signal frequency and amplitude. This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) and because the phase of the speaker load can change the stability margin of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers. The reason is that tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various "OTL" (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milbert.com/tubes_vs_transformers Tubes vs Transformers: An esoteric exploration of tubes, transformers, tone and transcendence]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, many solid-state amplifiers, designed specifically to amplify electric instruments such as guitars or bass guitars, employ current feedback circuitry. This circuitry increases the amplifier's output impedance, resulting in response similar to that of tube amplifiers.

The design of speaker crossover networks and other electro-mechanical properties may result in a speaker with a very uneven impedance curve, for a nominal 8&amp;nbsp;Ω speaker, being as low as 6&amp;nbsp;Ω at some places and as high as 30–50&amp;nbsp;Ω elsewhere in the curve. An amplifier with little or no negative feedback will always perform poorly when faced with a speaker where little attention was paid to the impedance curve.

==Design comparison==
There has been considerable debate over the characteristics of tubes versus [[bipolar junction transistor]]s. Triodes and [[MOSFET]]s have certain similarities in their transfer characteristics. Later forms of the tube, the [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]], have quite different characteristics that are in some ways similar to the bipolar transistor. Yet MOSFET amplifier circuits typically do not reproduce tube sound any more than typical bipolar designs. The reason is ''circuit differences'' between a typical tube design and a typical MOSFET design. But there are exceptions, for example designs such as the Zen series by [[Nelson Pass]].

===Input impedance===
A characteristic feature of most tube amplifier designs is the high input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically 100&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm|k&amp;Omega;]] or more) in modern designs and as much as 1&amp;nbsp;MΩ in classic designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mullard Tube Circuits for Audio Amplifiers |author1=R.

Even for some modern music reproduction devices the recommended load impedance is over 50&amp;nbsp;kΩ.&lt;ref&gt;Sony Corporation 1999. Sony compact disc player CDP-XB930 Operating Instructions.

Specifications, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CDP-XB930/XB930E service manual |url=http://www.qrz.ru/schemes/redirect.phtml?id=14227 |format=PDF |accessdate= |year=1999 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Sony Corporation |location=Japan |isbn= |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the input of an average tube amplifier is a problem-free load for music signal sources. By contrast, some transistor amplifiers for home use have lower input impedances, as low as 15&amp;nbsp;kΩ.&lt;ref&gt;Rotel stereo integrated amplifier RA-935BX owners manual. MN10002975-A. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is possible to use high output impedance devices due to the high input impedance, other factors may need to be accounted for, such as cable capacitance and microphonics.

===Output impedance===
Loudspeakers usually load audio amplifiers. In audio history, nearly all loudspeakers have been electrodynamic loudspeakers. There exists also a minority of electrostatic loudspeakers and some other more exotic loudspeakers. Electrodynamic loudspeakers transform electric current to force and force to acceleration of the diaphragm which causes sound pressure. Due to the principle of an electrodynamic speaker, most loudspeaker drivers ought to be driven by an electric current signal. The current signal drives the electrodynamic speaker more accurately, causing less distortion than a voltage signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Paul G. L. |last2=Hawksford |first2=M. O.

The output impedance of transistor amplifiers is typically less than 0.1 &amp;Omega;, which denotes pure voltage feed for the speaker. In tube amplifiers, instead, the output impedance varies rather widely; from tenths of an ohm to even more than five ohms (with 8 &amp;Omega; loading). A source impedance of even a couple of ohms is able to weaken the speaker's EMF currents so that the effects are observable; and as the value exceeds 5 &amp;Omega;, the speaker may function at some frequencies even halfly current-driven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecp.cc/CagedFrog.html |title=The Caged Frog -- A Pentode Based Transconductance Amplifier for Headphones |date=22 August 2010 |publisher=ecp.cc |accessdate=14 October 2012 |quote=But, as I was about to disassemble it and put the parts away, I wondered what the circuit would sound like without any feedback.

Turns out, I had built a transconductance amp more or less by accident.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an ideal [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|current or transconductance amplifier]] the output impedance approaches infinity. Practically all commercial audio amplifiers are voltage amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Self |first=Douglas |title=Audio Power Amplifier Design Handbook |edition=3rd |year=2002 |origyear=First published 1996 |publisher=Newnes |isbn=0-7506-56360 |page=25 |chapter=Damping factor |quote=Audio amplifiers, with a few very special exceptions, approximate to perfect voltage sources; i.e., they aspire to a zero output impedance across the audio band. |ref=self}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jipihorn.free.fr/Documents/Divers%20Blog/Cordellinterview.pdf |title=The Amplifier Guru speaks: Bob Cordell |last=Smith |first=Peter Jay |last2=Cordell |first2=Bob |year=2005 |publisher=Jipihorn |at=Without giving the standard weakest link answer, how important is the amp as a component? |format=PDF |accessdate=11 October 2013 |quote=The job of the amplifier is very simple. It must multiply the incoming signal voltage by a factor of about 20, and deliver a perfect replica of the signal to the speaker, independent of the impedance that the speaker presents to it. |ref=cordell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their output impedances have been intentionally developed to approach zero. Due to the nature of vacuum tubes and audio transformers, the output impedance of an average tube amplifier is usually considerably higher than the modern audio amplifiers produced completely without vacuum tubes or audio transformers. Most tube amplifiers with their higher output impedance are less ideal voltage amplifiers than the solid state voltage amplifiers with their smaller output impedance.

===Soft clipping===
Soft clipping is a very important aspect of tube sound especially for [[guitar amplifier]]s. A [[High fidelity|hi-fi]] amplifier should not normally ever be driven into clipping. The [[harmonics]] added to the signal are of lower energy with soft clipping than hard clipping. However, soft clipping is not exclusive to tubes. It can be simulated in transistor circuits (below the point that real hard clipping would occur). (See [[#Intentional distortion|"Intentional distortion"]] section.)

Large amounts of global negative feedback are not available in tube circuits, due to phase shift in the output transformer, and lack of sufficient gain without large numbers of tubes. With lower feedback, distortion is higher and predominantly of low order. The onset of clipping is also gradual. Large amounts of feedback, allowed by transformerless circuits with many active devices, leads to numerically lower distortion but with more high harmonics, and harder transition to clipping. As input increases, the feedback uses the extra gain to ensure that the output follows it accurately until the amplifier has no more gain to give and the output saturates.

However, phase shift is largely an issue only with global feedback loops. Design architectures with local feedback can be used to compensate the lack of global negative feedback magnitude. Design "selectivism" is again a trend to observe: designers of sound producing devices may find the lack of feedback and resulting higher distortion beneficial, designers of sound reproducing devices with low distortion have often employed local feedback loops.

Soft clipping is also not a product of lack of feedback alone: Tubes have different characteristic curves. Factors such as bias affect the load line and clipping characteristics. Fixed and cathode-biased amplifiers behave and clip differently under overdrive. The type of phase inverter circuitry can also affect greatly on softness (or lack of it) of clipping: long-tailed pair circuit, for example, has softer transition to clipping than a cathodyne. The coupling of the phase inverter and power tubes is also important, since certain types of coupling arrangements (e.g. transformer coupling) can drive power tubes to class AB2, while some other types can't.

In the recording industry and especially with microphone amplifiers it has been shown that amplifiers are often overloaded by signal transients. Russell O. Hamm, an engineer working for [[Walter Sear]] at Sear Sound Studios, wrote in 1973 that there is a major difference between the harmonic distortion components of a signal with greater than 10% distortion that had been amplified with three methods: tubes, transistors, or operational amplifiers.&lt;ref name="hamm1973"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamm |first=Russell O. | date=May 1973 |day= |title=Tubes Versus Transistors –Is There an Audible Difference? |journal=J Audio Eng Soc |volume=21 |series= |issue=4 |pages=267–273 |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |location=New York |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1980 |laysource=AES |laydate= |quote=This paper, however, points out that amplifiers are often severely overloaded by signal transients ([[Total harmonic distortion|THD]] 30%). Under this condition there is a major difference in the harmonic distortion components of the amplified signal, and operational amplifiers separating into distinct groups.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Russell O. |last=Hamm |title=Tubes Versus Transistors –Is There an Audible Difference? |url=http://www.milbert.com/tstxt.htm |work= |publisher=Milbert Amplifiers |location= |doi= |date= |month= |year= |quote= |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastering engineer R. Steven Mintz wrote a rebuttal to Hamm's paper, saying that the circuit design was of paramount importance, more than tubes vs solid state components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comments on 'Tubes Versus Transistors – Is There an Audible Difference?' |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1937 |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |last=Mintz |first=R. Steven | date=October 1973 |volume=21 |number=8 |page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamm's paper was also countered by Dwight O. Monteith Jr and Richard R. Flowers in their article "Transistors Sound Better Than Tubes", which presented transistor mic preamplifier design that actually reacted to transient overloading similarly as the limited selection of tube preamplifiers tested by Hamm.&lt;ref name=MonteithFlowers&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Audio Eng Soc |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |first=Dwight O. |last=Monteith |title=Transistors Can Sound Better Than Tubes |url=http://radio.feld.cvut.cz/~vlk/dynamics/monteight.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monteith and Flowers said: "In conclusion, the high voltage transistor preamplifier presented here supports the viewpoint of Mintz: 'In the field analysis, the characteristics of a typical system using transistors depends on the design, as is the case in tube circuits. A particular 'sound' may be incurred or avoided at the designer's pleasure no matter what active devices he uses.'"&lt;ref name=MonteithFlowers/&gt;

In other words, soft clipping is not exclusive to vacuum tubes or even an inherent property of them. In practice the clipping characteristics are largely dictated by the entire circuitry and as so they can range from very soft to very hard, depending on circuitry. Same applies to both vacuum tube and solid-state -based circuitry. For example, solid-state circuitry such as operational transconductance amplifiers operated open loop, or MOSFET cascades of CMOS inverters, are frequently used in commercial applications to generate softer clipping than what is provided by generic triode gain stages. In fact, the generic triode gain stages can be observed to clip rather "hard" if their output is scrutinized with an oscilloscope.

===Bandwidth===
Early tube amplifiers often had limited response [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], in part due to the characteristics of the inexpensive [[Passivity (engineering)|passive components]] then available. In power amplifiers most limitations come from the output transformer; low frequencies are limited by primary inductance and high frequencies by leakage inductance and capacitance. Another limitation is in the combination of high output impedance, decoupling capacitor and grid resistor, which acts as a [[high-pass filter]]. If interconnections are made from long cables (for example guitar to amp input), a high source impedance with high cable capacitance will act as a [[low-pass filter]].

Modern premium components make it easy to produce amplifiers that are essentially flat over the audio band, with less than 3&amp;nbsp;dB attenuation at 6&amp;nbsp;Hz and 70&amp;nbsp;kHz, well outside the audible range.

===Negative feedback===
Typical (non-OTL) tube power amplifiers could not use as much [[negative feedback]] (NFB) as transistor amplifiers due to the large phase shifts caused by the output transformers and their lower stage gains.  While the absence of NFB greatly increases harmonic distortion, it avoids instability, as well as [[slew rate]] and bandwidth limitations imposed by dominant-pole compensation in transistor amplifiers. However, the effects of using low feedback principally apply only to circuits where significant phase shifts are an issue (e.g. power amplifiers). In preamplifier stages, high amounts of negative feedback can easily be employed. Such designs are commonly found from many tube-based applications aiming to higher fidelity.

On the other hand, the dominant pole compensation in transistor amplifiers is precisely controlled: exactly as much of it can be applied as needed to strike a good compromise for the given application.

The effect of dominant pole compensation is that gain is reduced at higher frequencies. There is increasingly less NFB at high frequencies due to the reduced loop gain.

In audio amplifiers, the bandwidth limitations introduced by compensation are still far beyond the audio frequency range, and the slew rate limitations can be configured such that full amplitude 20&amp;nbsp;kHz signal can be reproduced without the signal encountering slew rate distortion, which is not even necessary for reproducing actual audio material.

===Power supplies===

Early tube amplifiers had power supplies based on rectifier tubes. These supplies were unregulated,  a practice which continues to this day in transistor amplifier designs. The typical [[anode]] supply was a [[rectifier]], perhaps half-wave, a choke ([[inductor]]) and a [[Rectifier#Rectifier output smoothing|filter capacitor]]. When the tube amplifier was operated at high volume, due to the high impedance of the rectifier tubes, the power supply voltage would dip as the amplifier drew more current (assuming class AB), reducing power output and causing signal modulation.  The  dipping effect is known as "sag." Sag may be desirable effect for some electric guitarists when compared with hard clipping. As the amplifier load or output increases this [[voltage drop]] will increase distortion of the output signal. Sometimes this sag effect is desirable for guitar amplification.

[[File:Blackheart Single ended Class AAmp chassis with the GZ34 rectifier valve installed.jpg|thumb|right|Blackheart 5&amp;nbsp;W single-ended class-A guitar amplifier chassis, with additional GZ34 valve rectifier installed]]

Some instrument tube amplifier designs use a vacuum tube [[rectifier]] instead of silicon diodes, and some designs offer the choice of both rectifiers via a switch. Such an amplifier was introduced in 1989 by Mesa/Boogie, called "Dual Rectifier", and the rectifier switching is the subject of a patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5168438.html U.S. Patent 5168438: Selectable dual rectifier power supply for musical amplifier]&lt;/ref&gt;

With added resistance in series with the high-voltage supply, silicon rectifiers can emulate the voltage sag of a tube rectifier. The resistance can be switched in when required.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~fredholz/Justin-Holton/The%20Tube%20Rectifier%20Sag%20Mod.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric guitar amplifiers often use a class-AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; amplifier. In a class-A stage the average current drawn from the supply is constant with signal level, consequently it does not cause supply line sag until the clipping point is reached. Other audible effects due to using a tube [[rectifier]] with this amplifier class are unlikely.

Unlike their solid-state equivalents, tube rectifiers require time to warm up before they can supply B+/HT voltages. This delay can protect rectifier-supplied vacuum tubes from cathode damage due to application of B+/HT voltages before the tubes have reached their correct operating temperature by the tube's built-in heater.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith, F. Radiotron Designer's Handbook 4th Edition. 1952, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class A===
The benefit of all [[class-A amplifier]]s is the absence of [[crossover distortion]]. This crossover distortion was found especially annoying after the first silicon-transistor [[Electronic amplifier#Class B and AB|class-B and class-AB]] transistor amplifiers arrived on the consumer market. Earlier germanium-based designs with the much lower turn-on voltage of this technology and the non-linear response curves of the devices had not shown large amounts of cross-over distortion. Although crossover distortion is very fatiguing to the ear and perceptible in listening tests, it is also almost invisible (until looked for) in the traditional [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD) measurements of that epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Langford-Smith |first1=F. |title=[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]] |chapter-url=http://www.pmillett.com/Books/RDH4.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |edition=4th |year=1952 |publisher=Wireless Press |location=Sydney, Australia |page=610 |chapter=14 Fidelity and distortion |quote=One interference which may reasonably be drawn is that any sharp kinks in the linearity curve, as usually occur in any class-AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amplifier, have a far more serious subjective effect than is indicated by any of the standard methods of measuring distortion –whether total harmonic distortion, conventional weighted distortion factor or the standard form of intermodulation testing. |ref=crossover}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out that this reference is somewhat ironic given its publication date of 1952. As such, it most certainly refers to "ear fatigue" distortion commonly found in existing tube-type designs; the world's first prototype transistorized hi-fi amplifier did not appear until 1955 &lt;ref&gt;http://ethw.org/First-Hand:The_World%27s_First_Transistor_Hi-Fi_System&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Push–pull amplifiers===
A class-A [[Push–pull output|push–pull]] amplifier produces low distortion for any given level of applied [[feedback]], and also cancels the [[flux]] in the [[transformer]] cores, so this topology is often seen by HIFI-audio enthusiasts and do-it-yourself builders as the ultimate engineering approach to the tube [[High fidelity|Hi-fi]] amplifier for use with normal [[loudspeaker|speakers]]. Output power of as high as 15 watts can be achieved even with classic tubes such as the 2A3&lt;ref&gt;Pete Millett's DIY Audio pages. Tube data. [http://www.pmillett.com/tubedata/HB-3/Receiving_Tubes_Part_1/2A3.PDF ''RCA 2A3 Power Triode.'']&lt;/ref&gt; or 18 watts from the type 45. Classic pentodes such as the EL34 and KT88 can output as much as 60 and 100 watts respectively. Special types such as the V1505 can be used in designs rated at up to 1100 watts. See "An Approach to Audio Frequency Amplifier Design", a collection of reference designs originally published by G.E.C.

===Single-ended triode (SET) amplifiers===
SET amplifiers show poor measurements for distortion with a resistive load, have low output power, are inefficient, have poor [[damping factor]]s and high measured harmonic distortion. But they perform somewhat better in dynamic and impulse response.

The triode, despite being the oldest signal amplification device, also can (depending on the device in question) have a more linear no-feedback transfer characteristic than more advanced devices such as beam tetrodes and pentodes.

All amplifiers, regardless of class, components, or topology, have some measure of distortion. This mainly [[harmonic]] distortion is a unique pattern of simple and monotonically decaying series of harmonics, dominated by modest levels of second harmonic. The result is like adding the same tone one [[octave]] higher in the case of second-order harmonics, and one octave plus one fifth higher for third-order harmonics. The added harmonic tone is lower in amplitude, at about 1–5% or less in a no feedback amp at full power and rapidly decreasing at lower output levels. Hypothetically, a single-ended power amplifier's second harmonic distortion might reduce similar harmonic distortion in a single driver loudspeaker, if their harmonic distortions were equal and amplifier was connected to the speaker so that the distortions would neutralize each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audiopax.com/papers_part1.htm |title=Why single-ended tube amplifiers?

SETs usually only produce about 2&amp;nbsp;[[watt]] (W) for a 2A3 tube amp to 8&amp;nbsp;W for a 300B up to the practical maximum of 40&amp;nbsp;W for an 805 tube amp. The resulting [[sound pressure level]] depends on the sensitivity of the loudspeaker and the size and acoustics of the room as well as amplifier power output. Their low power also makes them ideal for use as [[preamp]]s. SET amps have a power consumption of a minimum of 8 times the stated stereo power. For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;W stereo SET uses a minimum of 80&amp;nbsp;W, and typically 100&amp;nbsp;W.

===Single-ended pentode and tetrode amplifiers===
The special feature among tetrodes and pentodes is the possibility to obtain [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] or distributed load operation with an appropriate output transformer. In practice, in addition to loading the plate terminal, distributed loading (of which ultra linear circuit is a specific form) distributes the load also to cathode and screen terminals of the tube. An Ultra-linear connection and distributed loading are both in essence negative feedback methods, which enable less harmonic distortion along with other characteristics associated with negative feedback. Ultra-linear topology has mostly been associated with amplifier circuits based on research by D. Hafler and H. Keroes of Dynaco fame. Distributed loading (in general and in various forms) has been employed by the likes of McIntosh and Audio Research.

===Class AB===
The majority of modern commercial [[High fidelity|Hi-fi]] amplifier designs have until recently used [[class-AB]] topology (with more or less pure low-level class-A capability depending on the standing bias current used), in order to deliver greater [[Electric power|power]] and [[electrical efficiency|efficiency]], typically 12–25 watts and higher. Contemporary designs normally include at least some [[Negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]].  However, class-D topology (which is vastly more efficient than class B) is more and more frequently applied where traditional design would use class AB because of its advantages in both weight and efficiency.

Class-AB push–pull topology is nearly universally used in tube amps for electric guitar applications that produce power of more than about 10 watts. While audiophile amps are primarily concerned with avoiding distortion, a guitar amp embraces it. When driven to their respective limits, tubes and transistors distort quite differently. Tubes produce distortion differently from transistors, usually in a "softer" fashion (that is, fewer odd-order harmonics are produced). This allows for higher levels of distortion (which is sometimes desired by the guitarist) while still being able to distinguish the harmonies of a chord. The softer profile of the tube amplifier's distortion means that the [[intermodulation product]]s of the distortion closely relate to the chord harmonies. It is the consensus in the audio world that valve guitar amplifiers offer a useful additional type of sound to the palette of guitarists. There are also solid-state designs that are respected by broad consensus, so they also are seen as offering a useful sound signature option.

==Intentional distortion==

=== Tube sound from transistor amplifiers ===
Some individual characteristics of the tube sound, such as the [[Distortion synthesis|waveshaping]] on overdrive, are straightforward to produce in a transistor circuit or [[digital filter]]. For more complete simulations, engineers have been successful in developing transistor amplifiers that produce a sound quality very similar to the tube sound. Usually this involves using a circuit topology similar to that used in tube amplifiers.

In 1982, [[Tom Scholz]], a graduate of [[MIT]] and a member of ''[[Boston (band)|Boston]]'', introduced the [[Rockman (music)|Rockman]], which used JFET/BJT-based operational amplifiers and diode-based clipping circuits, but achieved a distorted sound adopted by many well known musicians. Advanced [[digital signal processing]] offers the possibility to simulate tube sound.

Using modern [[passive component]]s, and modern sources, whether digital or analogue, and wide band [[loudspeaker]]s, it is possible to have tube amplifiers with the characteristic wide bandwidth and "fast" sound of modern transistor amplifiers, including using push–pull circuits, class AB, and feedback. Some enthusiasts, such as [[Nelson Pass]], have built amplifiers using transistors and MOSFETs that operate in class A, including single ended, and these often have the "tube sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enjoythemusic.com/magazine/equipment/0701/volksamp.htm |title=The Volksamp Aleph 30 SE Power Amplifier (product review) |author=Olsher, Dick | date=July 2001 |work=Enjoy the Music.com |at=5th paragraph |accessdate= |quote=It effectively bridges the gap between solid-state and tube sound, blending tube and transistor virtues into a musically satisfying whole. |ref=aleph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid amplifiers===
Tubes are often used to impart  characteristics that many people find audibly pleasant to solid state amplifiers, such as [[Musical Fidelity]]'s use of [[Nuvistor]]s, tiny triode tubes, to control large bi-polar transistors in their [[NuVista]] 300 power amp. In America, Moscode and Studio Electric use this method, but use MOSFET transistors for power, rather than bi-polar. Pathos, an Italian company, has developed an entire line of hybrid amplifiers.

To demonstrate one aspect of this effect, one may use a light bulb in the feedback loop of an infinite gain multiple feedback (IGMF) circuit. The slow response of the light bulb's resistance (which varies according to temperature) can thus be used to moderate the sound and attain a tube-like "soft limiting" of the output, though other aspects of the "tube sound" would not be duplicated in this exercise.

== Tube Amp Simulation ==
=== Smartphones ===
Samsung added a ''Tube Amp Effect'' to their Galaxy line of phones beginning with the Galaxy s5 within the Samsung Music app. This feature distorts music coming from attached headphones with the slight presence of hollowness. This is all done with software built into the Samsung Music App.

A '''volcano tectonic earthquake''' is an [[earthquake]] induced by the movement (injection or withdrawal) of [[magma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jclahr.com/alaska/aeic/redoubt/JVGR1994.pdf |first=J.

Other types of seismic activity related to [[volcanoes]] and their eruptions are long period [[seismic wave]]s, which are from sudden sporadic movement of magma, which is blocked from moving due to a blockage.  Another is a [[harmonic tremor]], which is steady movement of magma, deep in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].
