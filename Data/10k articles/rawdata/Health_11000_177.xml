The 2010 '''Haitian cholera outbreak''' was the first modern large-scale outbreak of [[cholera]] – a disease once considered beaten back largely due to the invention of modern sanitation. Since its reintroduction to Haiti in October 2010, cholera has spread across the country and has become endemic, causing high levels of both morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piarroux|first=Renaud|date=July 2011|title=Understanding the Cholera Epidemic, Haiti|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1161–1168|doi=10.3201/eid1707.110059|issn=1080-6040|pmc=3381400|pmid=21762567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its reintroduction to Haiti following the 2010 Haitian earthquake, nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera, and more than 9,000 have died, according to the United Nations (UN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/Haiti_UN_System_Cholera.pdf|title=New UN System Approach to Cholera in Haiti|last=|first=|date=December 2016|website=UN.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera transmission in Haiti today is largely a function of eradication efforts including WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), education, and oral vaccination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelting|first=Richard|last2=Handzel|first2=Thomas|last3=Lockhart|first3=Gabriella|last4=Bliss|first4=Katherine|last5=Patrick|first5=Molly|date=2013-10-09|title=Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Haiti: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=89|issue=4|pages=665–670|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.13-0217|issn=0002-9637|pmc=3795096|pmid=24106193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aibana|first=Omowunmi|last2=Franke|first2=Molly|last3=Teng|first3=Jessica|last4=Hilaire|first4=Johanne|last5=Raymond|first5=Max|last6=Ivers|first6=Louise C.|date=2013-11-21|title=Cholera Vaccination Campaign Contributes to Improved Knowledge Regarding Cholera and Improved Practice Relevant to Waterborne Disease in Rural Haiti|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e2576|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002576|issn=1935-2735|pmc=3837010|pmid=24278498}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate variability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jutla|first=Antarpreet|last2=Whitcombe|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Hasan|first3=Nur|last4=Haley|first4=Bradd|last5=Akanda|first5=Ali|last6=Huq|first6=Anwar|last7=Alam|first7=Munir|last8=Sack|first8=R.

==Background==
[[File:Artibonite River in Haiti (2010).jpg|thumb|Haiti's [[Artibonite River]], the first place the outbreak spread]]In January 2010, a 7.0 magnitude [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] hit Haiti, killing over 100,000 people and further disrupting healthcare and sanitation infrastructure in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two years later, Haitian earthquake death toll in dispute |publisher=Columbia Journalism Review |author=Maura R.

Before the outbreak, no cases of cholera had been identified in Haiti for more than a century, and the Caribbean region as a whole had not been affected by the cholera outbreak originating in Peru in 1991.&lt;ref name="Barzilay 599–609"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barzilay|first=Ezra J.|last2=Schaad|first2=Nicolas|last3=Magloire|first3=Roc|last4=Mung|first4=Kam S.|last5=Boncy|first5=Jacques|last6=Dahourou|first6=Georges A.|last7=Mintz|first7=Eric D.|last8=Steenland|first8=Maria W.|last9=Vertefeuille|first9=John F.|date=2013-02-14|title=Cholera Surveillance during the Haiti Epidemic — The First 2 Years|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=368|issue=7|pages=599–609|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1204927|pmid=23301694|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The population's lack of prior exposure and acquired immunity contributed to the severity of the outbreak.&lt;ref name="Barzilay 599–609"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jenson D|author2=Szabo V|author3=Duke FHI Haiti Humanities Laboratory Student Research Team|date=November 2011|title=Cholera in Haiti and Other Caribbean Regions, 19th Century|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/11/11-0958_article.htm|deadurl=no|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=17|issue=11|pages=2130–5|doi=10.3201/eid1711.110958|pmid=22099117|pmc=3310590|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131020449/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/11/11-0958_article.htm|archivedate=31 January 2014|accessdate=12 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak ==
Cholera is caused by the bacterium [[vibrio cholerae]] that when ingested can cause diarrhea and vomiting within several hours to 2–3 days. Without proper treatment including oral rehydration, cholera can be fatal. The suspected source of vibrio cholerae in Haiti was the [[Artibonite River]], from which most of the affected people had consumed the water.&lt;ref name="msnbc_23oct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39787756/ns/health-infectious_diseases/|title=Cholera cases found in Haiti capital|date=23 October 2010|publisher=MSNBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026025449/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39787756/ns/health-infectious_diseases/|archivedate=26 October 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=9 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, tens of thousands of Haitians bathe, wash their clothes and dishes, obtain drinking water, and recreate in this river, therefore resulting in high rates of exposure to vibrio cholerae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/05/374052-un-set-taskforce-wake-report-source-haitian-cholera-outbreak|title=UN to set up taskforce in wake of report into source of Haitian cholera outbreak|date=2011-05-04|work=UN News|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cholera outbreak began ten months after the January 2010 earthquake, leading some observers to wrongly suspect it was a result of the natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/10/in-the-time-of-cholera/|title=In the Time of Cholera|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Big Truck That Went By|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|publisher=St Martins Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1137278975|location=|pages=219–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haitians grew immediately suspicious of a UN peacekeeper base, home to Nepalese peacekeepers, positioned on a [[tributary]] of the Artibonite River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosurveillance.typepad.com/haiti_operational_biosurv/2010/10/community-outcry-blaming-nepalese-minustah-deployment-in-mirebalais-for-cholera-epidemic-haiti.html|title=UPDATE: Community Outcry Blaming Nepalese MINUSTAH Deployment in Mirebalais|date=26 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230355/http://biosurveillance.typepad.com/haiti_operational_biosurv/2010/10/community-outcry-blaming-nepalese-minustah-deployment-in-mirebalais-for-cholera-epidemic-haiti.html |archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighboring farmers reported an undeniable stench of human feces coming from the base, to the extent that local Haitians began getting their drinking water upstream from the base.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106092446/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40280944/ns/health/t/un-worries-its-troops-caused-cholera-haiti/|title=UN worries its troops caused cholera in Haiti - Health {{!}} NBC News|date=2013-01-06|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ([[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]]) officials issued a press statement denying the possibility that the base could have caused the epidemic, citing stringent sanitation standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/health/news/article_1594269.php/MINUSTAH-denies-rumour-that-it-spread-cholera-in-Haiti|title=MINUSTAH denies rumour that it spread cholera in Haiti|date=26 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002519/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/health/news/article_1594269.php/MINUSTAH-denies-rumour-that-it-spread-cholera-in-Haiti|archivedate=3 December 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 27 October 2010, [[Jonathan Myerson Katz|Jonathan M. Katz]], an [[Associated Press]] correspondent, visited the base and found gross inconsistencies between the statement and the base's actual conditions. Katz also happened upon UN [[military police]] taking samples of ground water to test for cholera, despite UN assertions that it was not concerned about a possible link between its peacekeepers and the disease. Neighbors told the reporter that waste from the base often spilled into the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/27/un-probes-base-as-source-of-haiti-cholera-outbreak/|title=UN probes base as source of Haiti cholera outbreak|date=27 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207015923/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/27/un-probes-base-as-source-of-haiti-cholera-outbreak/|archivedate=7 December 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=11 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, a crew from [[Al Jazeera English]], including reporter [[Sebastian Walker]], filmed the soldiers trying to excavate a leaking pipe; the video was posted online the following day and, citing the AP report, drew increased awareness to the base.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera English 28 October 2010 {{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/10/2010102841412141967.html|title=UN investigates Haiti outbreak &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; al Jazeera|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411201938/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/10/2010102841412141967.html|archivedate=11 April 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-08-21|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; MINUSTAH spokesmen later contended that the samples taken from the base proved negative for cholera. However, an AP investigation showed that the tests were improperly done at a laboratory in the [[Dominican Republic]], which had no prior experience of testing for cholera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40280944/ns/health/t/un-worries-its-troops-caused-cholera-haiti/|title=UN worries its troops caused cholera in Haiti|date=19 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106092446/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40280944/ns/health/t/un-worries-its-troops-caused-cholera-haiti/|archivedate=6 January 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=11 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For three months, UN officials, the CDC, and others argued against investigating the source of the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was "not important". Hartl said,"Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [if there will be]. It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39996103/ns/health-infectious_diseases|title=Experts ask: Did U.N. troops infect Haiti?|last=Katz|first=Jonathan M.|author2=Associated Press|date=3 November 2010|publisher=MSNBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107120818/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39996103/ns/health-infectious_diseases|archivedate=7 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Tappero, the lead [[epidemiologist]] at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for the source of the bacteria and that "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/11/201011245450543862.html|title=Haiti's cholera 'from South Asia'|date=2 November 2010|publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109045612/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/11/201011245450543862.html|archivedate=9 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, it may be possible to identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

[[Paul Farmer]], co-founder of the medical organization [[Partners In Health]], and a UN official himself who served [[Bill Clinton]]'s deputy at the [[Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti]], told the AP's Katz on 3 November 2010 that there was no reason to wait. Farmer stated, "The idea that we'd never know is not very likely. There's got to be a way to know the truth without pointing fingers."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; A cholera expert, John Mekalanos, supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a "novel, virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

Some US professors have disagreed with the contention that [[Nepalese soldiers]] caused the outbreak.

However, a study unveiled in December and conducted by French [[epidemiologist]] [[Renaud Piarroux]] contended that UN troops from Nepal, rather than environmental factors, had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River.&lt;ref name="bbc7dec"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11943902|title=Haiti cholera: UN peacekeepers to blame, report says|date=7 December 2010|newspaper=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208043656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11943902|archivedate=8 December 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study published in December in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' presented DNA sequence data for the Haitian cholera isolate, finding that it was most closely related to a cholera strain found in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008. It was more distantly related to existing South American strains of cholera, the authors reported, adding that "the Haitian epidemic is probably the result of the introduction, through human activity, of a V. cholerae strain from a distant geographic source."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chin|first1=C.

Under intense pressure, the UN relented, and said it would appoint a panel to investigate the source of the cholera strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2013703115_apununhaiti.html|title=UN panel to investigate Haiti cholera outbreak.|date=17 December 2010|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728162239/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2013703115_apununhaiti.html|archivedate=28 July 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=20 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That panel's report, issued in May 2011, confirmed substantial evidence that the Nepalese troops had brought the disease to Haiti. The [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) utilized [[DNA fingerprinting]] to tests various samples of cholera from Haitian patients to pinpoint the specific strand of cholera found in Haiti. During an epidemiological outbreak investigation, DNA fingerprinting of bacteria can be extremely helpful in identifying the source of an outbreak. The results of the CDC tests showed that the specific strain of cholera found in samples taken from Haitian patients was vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, a strain found in South Asia.&lt;ref name="UNReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|title=Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti|accessdate=9 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915215109/http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|deadurl=no|agency=WHO|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specific strain of cholera is endemic in Nepal, therefore supporting the Haitian suspicion that Nepalese peacekeepers were the source of the outbreak.

[[Rita Colwell]], former director of the [[National Science Foundation]] and climate change expert, still contends that climate changes were an important factor in cholera's spread, stating in an interview with UNEARTH News in August 2013 that the outbreak was "triggered by a complicated set of factors. The precipitation and temperatures were above average during 2010 and that, in conjunction with a destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, can be considered to have contributed to this major disease outbreak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://unearthnews.org/un-peacekeepers-or-climate-change-the-complex-factors-contributing-to-haitis-cholera-crisis/|title=UN peacekeepers or climate change?

At the beginning of the outbreak, widespread panic regarding the virulence of the disease and the UN's denial of the blame caused increased tension between the UN and the Haitian community.

==Vulnerabilities ==

=== Infrastructure ===
Before the outbreak, Haiti suffered from relatively poor public health and sanitation infrastructure. In 2002, Haiti was ranked 147th out of 147 countries for water security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-12-18|title=Five complementary interventions to slow cholera: Haiti|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361062243X|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9758|pages=2048–2051|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62243-X|pmid=21146206|issn=0140-6736|last1=Ivers|first1=Louise C.|last2=Farmer|first2=Paul|last3=Almazor|first3=Charles Patrick|last4=Léandre|first4=Fernet}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, 37% of Haiti's population lacked access to adequate drinking water, and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9789241563956/en/|title=Progress on sanitation and drinking water: Joint Monitoring Programme 2010 update|author1=World Health Organization|author2=United Nation Children's Fund|date=2010|page=43|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806074735/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9789241563956/en/|archivedate=6 August 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=1 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, families often obtain their water from natural sources, such as rivers, that may be contaminated with ''V. cholerae.'' Poor sanitation infrastructure allows cholera bacterium to enter these waterways. Persons are subsequently infected via the fecal-oral route when the water is used for drinking and cooking, and poor hygiene often contributes to the spread of cholera through the household or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Eric J.|last2=Harris|first2=Jason B.|last3=Morris|first3=J.

Minson. 2010. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science]. handle.dtic.mil. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient water and sanitation infrastructure, coupled with a massive earthquake in 2010, made Haiti particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of waterborne disease.

=== Physiological ===
Malnutrition of the population, another pre-existing condition that was exacerbated by the earthquake, may have also contributed to the severity of the outbreak.&lt;ref name="Barzilay 599–609"/&gt; Research from previous outbreaks shows that duration of diarrhea can be prolonged by up to 70% in individuals suffering from severe malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=DL, et al|date=July 1976|title=Nutritional status: a determinant of severity of diarrhea in patients with cholera|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=134|issue=1|pages=8–14|jstor=30107125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Haitians had no biological immunity to the strain of cholera introduced since they had no previous exposure to it. Therefore, physiological factors including malnutrition and lack of immunity may have allowed cholera to spread rapidly throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Information ===
Lack of information and limited access to some rural areas can also be a barrier to care. Some aid agencies have reported that mortality and morbidity tolls may be higher than the official figures because the government does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center.&lt;ref name="uscatholic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2010/11/haiti-cholera-toll-rises-medical-supplies-are-rushed-victims|title=Haiti cholera toll rises as medical supplies are rushed to victims|publisher=US Catholic|accessdate=17 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121093817/http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2010/11/haiti-cholera-toll-rises-medical-supplies-are-rushed-victims|archivedate=21 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations in the data from Haiti stem from a lack of pre-outbreak lack of surveillance infrastructure and laboratories to properly test samples and diagnose cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitter|first=David L.|last2=Lowrance|first2=David|last3=Schaad|first3=Angela Wood|last4=Gelting|first4=Richard|last5=Moffett|first5=Daphne B.|last6=Delson|first6=Daphnée Benoit|last7=Poncelet|first7=Jean-Luc|last8=Guillaume|first8=Florence D.|date=2017-10-18|title=Applying a New Framework for Public Health Systems Recovery following Emergencies and Disasters: The Example of Haiti following a Major Earthquake and Cholera Outbreak|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=97|issue=4_Suppl|pages=4–11|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.16-0862|issn=0002-9637|pmc=5676637|pmid=29064359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti was tasked with developing surveillance systems and laboratories after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak which caused difficulties tracking the progression and scale of the outbreak.  Because of the lack of established surveillance, much of the case report data is anecdotal and potentially underestimated.  Also, because of lack of laboratory confirmation for the vast majority of cases of cholera, it is possible that other diarrheal diseases were being falsely classified as cholera.&lt;ref name="Barzilay 599–609"/&gt;

=== Climate Change and Environmental Conditions ===
Rainy seasons and hurricanes continue to cause a temporary spike in incident cases and deaths. Moreover, as a result of global warming and climate change, Haiti is at an increased risk of cholera transmission. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advances that global warming between 1.5-2 degrees Celsius will very likely lead to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/pr_181008_P48_spm.shtml|title=IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|website=www.ipcc.ch|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resource-poor countries are poised to be affected more so than more developed and economically secure countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Environmental factors such as temperature increases, severe weather events, and natural disasters have a two-fold impact on the transmission potential of cholera in Haiti: 1) they present conditions favorable to the persistence and growth of ''V. cholerae'' in the environment, and 2) they devastate a country’s infrastructure and strain public health and health care resources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An exhaustive study into environmental factors influencing the spread of cholera in Haiti cites above average air temperatures following the earthquake, “anomalously high rainfall” from September to October 2010, and damage to the limited water and sanitation infrastructure as likely converging to create conditions favorable to a cholera outbreak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges and Solutions to Eradication ==
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been dedicated towards eradicating cholera in Haiti since its introduction in 2010, yet unsanitary conditions and climate-driven forces allow cholera transmission to continue. While the number of new cases of cholera has drastically decreased from 2010, and is currently the lowest it has been since the outbreak began, the incidence remains at 25.5 per 100,000 population as of October 2018''.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over time, there has been significant progress in the reduction of caseloads and overall number of deaths. According to one PAHO/WHO report, “the cumulative case-fatality rate (CFR) has remained around 1% since 2011.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These achievements can be contributed to intensified international and local medical efforts and an increased emphasis on preventative measures, including improved sanitation, such as latrines, and changes in Haitian behaviors such as treating water, thoroughly cooking food, and rigorous hand-washing.  Despite these progresses, cholera remains endemic in Haiti, and further resources are needed to fully eradicate it.

After former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon accepted UN responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti in December 2016, Moon projected a necessary $400 million in funding over two years in order to fully eradicate cholera in Haiti.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/articles/2016-12-05/righting-wrong-haiti|title=Righting a wrong in Haiti {{!}} United Nations Secretary-General|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government of Haiti has dedicated itself to the complete eradication of cholera from Haiti by 2022 as presented in the Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, successor to Ban Ki Moon, took up Moon’s commitment to assist Haiti in the eradication of cholera when he took office in 31 December 2016, as demonstrated by strategic objective 2 of the 2017- 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan. Strategic objective 2 reads, “Save lives from epidemics – Reduce mortality and morbidity due to cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases through the reduction of vulnerability, strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and ensuring of rapid and effective response.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ht.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/haiti/docs/HRP%202018/2018_Haiti_HRP_Final.pdf|title=2017 - 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan|last=United Nations|date=2017|website=UN.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan identifies 1.9 million people in need of assistance for the protection from cholera, of which, 1.5 million people are targeted through programming totaling $21.7 million USD.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Currently, the UN and Government of Haiti are on target to reach the 2016 – 2018 midterm goal to reduce the incidence of cholera to less than 0.1% by the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, any disruption in funding of support services may result in a spike in transmission and the interruption of the downward trend.

=== Challenges ===

==== Protracted Crises: Hurricane Matthew 2016 ====
The first challenge to the eradication of cholera in Haiti is the countries vulnerability to disasters, putting it in a state of protracted crises. The climax of cholera incidence in Haiti was in 2011 with 352,000 new cases following the introduction of cholera in Haiti in late 2010.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Incidence rates gradually declined until 2016 when there was another spike in the transmission and incidence of cholera following Hurricane Matthew’s destruction in Haiti from October 2–5, 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There was a rise in cholera incidence from 32,000 new cases in 2015 to 42,000 new cases in 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By re-damaging Haiti’s fragile water and sanitation infrastructure, Hurricane Matthew allowed cholera to rear its head. These figures demonstrate that the fight against cholera in Haiti, while improving, is on unstable ground. This indicates that while eradication efforts have largely been focused on vaccination and community education to prevent transmission, and oral rehydration to reduce mortality, the underlying vulnerabilities that perpetuate the disaster remain, particularly insufficient and unequal access to improved water and sanitation.

==== Funding ====
While the Government of Haiti’s Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022 and the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti (see solutions below for more information) lay out plans for the elimination of cholera in Haiti by 2022, these are entirely dependent on funding. In former Secretary General Moon’s December 5, 2016 remarks he says, “Without political will and financial support from the membership of the United Nations, we have only good intentions and words. Words are powerful — but they cannot replace action and material support.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Due to the infectious nature of cholera, any lapse in funding for programming will likely result in setbacks in elimination.

As of 2017, funding for cholera is at risk due to increasing food insecurity and shelter needs for Haitian refugees returning from the Dominican Republic. In the 2017 – 2018 Revised Haiti Humanitarian Plan, funding requirements for cholera programming is the third largest at $21.7 million, behind $76.6 million for food security and $103.8 million for shelter/NFI needs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Solutions ===

==== Vaccination Campaigns ====
In 2013, the Government of Haiti launched an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in two regions: Cerca Caravajal and Petite Anse. These regions were chosen because of particularly high attack rates, sanitation infrastructure, and access to healthcare. This vaccination effort was slightly controversial because the WHO guidelines at the time did not encourage mass vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks had already occurred.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=World Health Organization|date=7 June 2018|title=Cholera vaccine: WHO position paper, August 2017 - Recommendations|journal=Vaccine|volume=36|issue=24|pages=3418–3420|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.09.034|issn=1873-2518|pmid=29555219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2010 outbreak in Haiti, vaccination campaigns were thought to detract from more important prevention measures like water treatment and good hygiene.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Lana|last2=Etheart|first2=Melissa|last3=Juin|first3=Stanley|last4=François|first4=Jeannot|last5=Wright|first5=Tracie|last6=Choudhury|first6=Alina|last7=Adrien|first7=Paul|last8=Wannemuehler|first8=Kathleen|last9=Tohme|first9=Rania A.|date=2016-12-07|title=Evaluation of Knowledge and Practices Regarding Cholera, Water Treatment, Hygiene, and Sanitation Before and After an Oral Cholera Vaccination Campaign—Haiti, 2013–2014|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=95|issue=6|pages=1305–1313|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.16-0555|pmid=27799642|pmc=5154444|issn=0002-9637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative success rates (up to 65% or higher protective effectiveness 5 years after vaccination&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;) in recent vaccination campaigns in Haiti and other countries affected by cholera has led to more widespread use of oral cholera vaccine programs and a change in the WHO guidelines to encourage use of vaccines in addition to other prevention and treatment strategies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti ====
At the end of 2016, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon presented the “New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This two-track approach marked the UN’s acceptance of responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti and demonstrated its commitment to the eradication of the disease in Haiti. Since the 2016 admission of guilt, there has been increased coordination and goodwill between the Government of Haiti and UN, resulting in great strides towards the elimination of cholera. 2017 was a hallmark year in the elimination of cholera from Haiti. The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan reports, “As of 31 December 2017, 13,682 suspected cholera cases and 150 deaths had been registered in the country in 2017 compared to 41,955 cases and 451 deaths for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 67% in both cases.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Newly developed rapid response teams are largely to credit for the reduction in disease incidence.

The ability for the humanitarian sector to act quickly and bounce back following Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as to maintain the downward trend during the heavy rain season, demonstrates progress in the eradication of cholera in Haiti.

Track 1 of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti aims to “intensify efforts to respond to and reduce the incidence of cholera in Haiti” through three main projects.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/Haiti_UN_System_Cholera.pdf|title=New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti|last=United Nations|date=December 2016|website=UN.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first is strengthening and supporting the rapid response framework developed by the Haitian Government which deploys to communities where cholera is suspected within 48-hours. There are currently 13 government led rapid response teams, and 60 mobile teams of humanitarian actors that support the rapid response teams.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The goal of rapid response teams is to cut the transmission of cholera by first setting up a perimeter called a ‘cordon sanitaire’ and investigating the source of the outbreak at the household level. This investigation is coupled with education and awareness raising on cholera prevention, administering oral prophylaxis and distribution of WASH kits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  If an outbreak is confirmed, temporary chlorination points are installed on community water sources. People treated for cholera by the rapid response teams are then recruited to Community Engagement &amp; Hygiene Awareness (CEHA) teams. The CEHA teams return to their communities to conduct outreach and sensitization on how to cut transmission and assist the government in monitoring water sources. This rapid response design with the assistance of the CEHA teams is responsible for a major decline in disease incidence in the Ouest department in 2017.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As long as funding continues to support rapid response, a continued decline in disease incidence can be suspected.  

The second project of track 1 is the continued support of oral cholera vaccination campaigns as a preventative measure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In 2018, the oral cholera vaccine campaign will focus on departments with the highest incidence of disease, particularly Artibonite and Centre departments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The final aim of track 1 is to “more effectively address… the medium/longer term issues of water, sanitation and health systems.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera outbreak/epidemic exposed to the international community how vulnerable the Haitian water, sanitation, and health infrastructure was. Cholera and other water-borne diseases will continue to circulate in Haiti as long as large sections of their population do not have access to improved water and sanitation facilities. As part of the UN’s “New Way of Working” which aims to bridge the development and humanitarian gap, the UN will be working with major development actors including the World Bank and the International Development Bank to address infrastructure vulnerabilities that put Haiti at risk of protracted crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/NWOW%20Booklet%20low%20res.002_0.pdf|title=New Way of Working|last=UNOCHA|date=2016|website=UNOCHA.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “New Way of Working” aims to draw from funding sources on both sides of the spectrum, both development and humanitarian, to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  No joint funded projects have been reported in Haiti yet.

===== Track 2 =====
The second track of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti proposes to provide material assistance to individuals and families who were most affected by cholera.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The material assistance package is the UN’s attempt at reparations after accepting responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti. The UN reports, “nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera since 2010 [as of 2016] and more than 9,000 have died.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  First, consultations will be conducted with the community to identify what materials will be of greatest impact.

The discovery of amylomaize occurred as a [[mutation]] in a normal inbred line; from that one mutation an entire new kind of [[maize]] (corn) was developed.

Principal uses of amylomaize [[starch]] are in making [[biodegradable plastic]]s (or [[bioplastic]]s). It is also used in coatings that are edible and digestible.  The food that the first American [[astronaut]]s used on [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] flights from 1969 to 1972 were coated with amylomaize film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=It's a Race to the Moon |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/86870407/ |work=Decatur Herald |location=Decatur, Illinois |date=July 20, 1969 |access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so that no crumbs would float around in the space capsule.

Several years earlier Robert P. Bear had discovered and reported that [[waxy corn]] (100% [[amylopectin]] starch) also occurred as a mutation.  Once discovered and reported, waxy mutations were found in the order of once every 30,000 observations.

The '''CRAFFT Screening Test'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is a short clinical assessment tool designed to screen for substance-related risks and problems in adolescents. '''CRAFFT''' stands for the key words of the 6 items in the second section of the assessment - '''C'''ar, '''R'''elax, '''A'''lone, '''F'''orget, '''F'''riends, '''T'''rouble. As of 2016, an updated version of the CRAFFT known as the “CRAFFT 2.0” has been released.

The older version of the questionnaire contains 9 items in total, answered in a "yes" or "no" format. The first three items (Part A) evaluate alcohol and drug use over the past year and the other six (Part B) ask about situations in which the respondent used drugs or alcohol and any consequences of the usage. The CRAFFT 2.0 screening tool begins with past-12-month frequency items (Part A), rather than the previous “yes/no” question for any use over the past year and the other six (Part B) ask about situations in which the respondent used drugs or alcohol and any consequences of usage.

The CRAFFT can function as a self-report questionnaire or an interview to be administered by a clinician.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both employ a skip pattern: those whose Part A score is "0" (no use) answer the '''C'''ar question only of Part B, while those who report any use in Part A also answer Part B's five '''CRAFFT''' questions. Each "yes" answer is scored as "1" point and a CRAFFT total score of two or higher identifies "high risk" for a substance use disorder and warrants further assessment.

== Development and history ==
The '''CRAFFT Screening Test''' was developed by John R Knight, MD and colleagues at the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) at Boston Children's Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their goal was to develop a screening tool that - like the [[CAGE questionnaire]] used for adults - was brief and easy to administer and score.&lt;ref name="DhallaEtAl2011" /&gt; Unlike the CAGE, the CRAFFT was designed to be developmentally appropriate for adolescents and screen conjointly for both alcohol and drug use. Because alcohol- and drug-related motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among adolescents, the CRAFFT includes a single risk item to evaluate this. It has been established as [[Validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] for identifying youth who need further assessment and therapeutic intervention &lt;ref name="MitchellEtAl2014" /&gt; The CRAFFT was originally designed to screen adolescents at high risk of [[substance use disorders]] in primary medical care offices. However, the necessity for an adolescent screening measure was made apparent by research findings suggesting that half of high school students drink, a third binge drink, and a fourth use marijuana.&lt;ref name="KnightEtAl2002" /&gt; For drug use specifically, studies show that more than half of high school seniors have used an illegal drug of any kind and a fourth have used illegal drugs other than [[marijuana]].&lt;sup&gt;[7][8]&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, more than two-thirds of high school seniors, half of sophomores, and a third of eighth graders have used alcohol in the past year.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt; These findings also contributed to the identification of a need for a tool like the CRAFFT to be developed.

== Version 2.0 ==
This revised version of the CRAFFT screening tool incorporates changes that enhance the sensitivity of the system in terms of identifying adolescents with substance use, and presents new recommended clinician talking points, informed by the latest science and clinician feedback, to guide a brief discussion about substance use with adolescents. The CRAFFT 2.0 provides an updated and revised version of this well-validated and widely utilized adolescent substance use screening protocol. Although the previous version of the CRAFFT will still be available, CeASAR recommends that clinicians transition to using version 2.0.

The CRAFFT 2.0 screening tool begins with past-12-month frequency items, rather than the previous “yes/no” question for any use over the past year. A recent study examining these opening yes/no questions found that they had relatively low sensitivity in identifying youth with any past-12-month alcohol or marijuana use (62% and 72%, respectively).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Sion K, et al.|date=2015|title=Adolescent substance use screening in primary care:  validity of computer self-administered vs. clinician-administered screening|journal=Subst Abus|edition=37|volume=1|pages=197–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also has suggested that yes/no questions may contribute to lower sensitivity on certain measures by inhibiting disclosure of less socially desirable behaviors; i.e., they may be more prone to social desirability bias.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Couper|first=M., et. al.|date=2012|title=The design of grids in web surveys|journal=Soc. Sci. Comput Rev.|edition=31|volume=3|pages=322–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, questions that ask “how many” or “how often” implicitly imply an expectation of the behavior, and may thus mitigate discomfort around disclosure. The instruction, “Say ‘0’ if none” follows each question to convey that non-use is also normative. The CRAFFT 2.0 now begins with past-12-month frequency items; i.e., “During the past 12 months, on how many days did you … [drink/use substance name]?”

This new set of frequency questions was tested in a recent study of 708 adolescent primary care patients ages 12–18 that found a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 81% for detecting past-12-month use of any substance, suggesting better performance in identifying substance use compared to that of the “yes/no” questions found in the prior study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Harris SK, Sherritt L, Copelas S, Knight JR. Reliability and validity of past-12-month use frequency items as opening questions for the updated CRAFFT adolescent substance use screening system. International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Drugs Annual Meeting, 2016. Lausanne, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; These data support the rationale to change the opening questions in the CRAFFT 2.0.

The CRAFFT 2.0 will be translated into the following languages: Chinese, Creole, French, German Hebrew, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Laotian, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Spain and Latin America), Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

Research has shown that CRAFFT has relatively high [[sensitivity and specificity]], [[internal consistency]], and [[test-retest reliability]] as a screener for alcohol and substance misuse.&lt;ref name=DhallaEtAl2011/&gt; The CRAFFT questionnaire has been validated against the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-5]]) and demonstrates good ability to distinguish between those with and without clinical levels of any DSM-5 [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=MitchellEtAl2014/&gt; It is supported by many studies as a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] and [[validity (statistics)|valid]] assessment of substance abuse in adolescents&lt;ref name="KnightEtAl2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KnightEtAl2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A review of the psychometric properties of the CRAFFT instrument: 1999–2010|journal = Current Drug Abuse Reviews|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 1874-4745|pmid = 21466499|pages = 57–64|volume = 4|issue = 1|first = Shayesta|last = Dhalla|first2 = Bruno D.|last2 = Zumbo|first3 = Gary|last3 = Poole|doi=10.2174/1874473711104010057}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered an effective tool for assessing whether further assessment is warranted.&lt;ref name="KnightEtAl2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NeinsteinEtal2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CeASARreCRAFFT" /&gt; It has been well-validated against criterion standard psychological tests and structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new brief screen for adolescent substance abuse|journal = Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date = 1999-06-01|issn = 1072-4710|pmid = 10357299|pages = 591–596|volume = 153|issue = 6|first = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19933">Disability is an issue that directly affects a significant proportion of the population of the [[United Kingdom]]. Section6(1) of the [[Equality Act 2010]] defines disability as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A person has a disability for the purposes of the Act if he or she has a physical or mental impairment and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/odi_definition%20of%20disability%20equality_act_guidance_may.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815033221/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/odi_definition%20of%20disability%20equality_act_guidance_may.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In 2014 more than 11 million British people (excluding Northern Ireland) were reported to have a long term impairment or disability. The incidence rises with age; about 6% of children, 16% of working age adults and 45% of pensioners are reported as having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-facts-and-figures/disability-facts-and-figures |title=Disability facts and figures |publisher=Department for Work and Pensions - Office for Disability Issues |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation and government policy ==
Under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)]] (1995, extended in 2005), it is unlawful for organisations to discriminate (treat a disabled person less favourably, for reasons related to the person's disability, without justification) in employment; access to goods, facilities, services; managing, buying or renting land or property; education. Businesses must make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, to avoid indirect discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drc-gb.org/the_law/legislation__codes__regulation/dda_and_related_statutes.aspx |title=DDA and related statutes |publisher=Disability Rights Commission |accessdate=April 7, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024816/http://www.drc-gb.org/the_law/legislation__codes__regulation/dda_and_related_statutes.aspx |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010 the Disability Discrimination Act has been replaced with the [[Equality Act 2010]]. This act still protects disabled people against discrimination but also encompasses a number of other  characteristics including age, gender reassignment, marriage, pregnancy, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Independent Living Guide to Equality Act 2010 and How to Deal with Discrimination |url=http://www.independentliving.co.uk/equality-legislation.html |publisher=Independentliving.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies and legislation in [[Disability in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] differs significantly from the rest of the UK.

===NHS===
Medical treatment in the United Kingdom is generally free under the [[NHS]].  [[Social Care]] is subject to a [[means test]]. Some services required by disabled people do not fall clearly into either category, and are subject to local rationing decisions.  It has been suggested that the safeguards in respect of waiting times provided by the [[NHS Constitution for England]] are often not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS delays leave thousands facing long wait for wheelchairs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/21/nhs-delays-disabled-people-wait-wheelchair|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wigs and trusses====
Provision of NHS [[Hair prosthesis|wigs]] and [[Truss (medicine)|fabric supports]], i.e. spinal or abdominal supports or surgical brassieres supplied through a hospital are covered by the [[NHS Low Income Scheme]].

====Wheelchairs====
[[Wheelchair]]s both manual and electric are supplied and maintained free of charge for disabled people whose need for such a chair is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disability Rights handbook|date=2012|publisher=Disability Rights UK|location=London|isbn=9781903335567|edition=37|url=160|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific criteria of eligibility are decided locally by [[clinical commissioning group]]s in England and health boards in Wales. Applicants must be referred by a clinician. Assessment and provision is in the hands of NHS wheelchair services, some of which offer a voucher scheme which permit a disabled person to add their own funds to the value of the chair which they are assessed as needing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choosing mobility equipment, wheelchairs and scooters|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/mobility-equipment-wheelchairs-scooters.aspx|website=NHS Choices|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 there were about 1.2 million wheelchair users in the UK, of whom about two thirds were regular users.  According to [[NHS England]] there were widespread delays in getting chairs, and about half the users develop a [[pressure ulcer]] at some point caused, in part, by ill-fitting or ill-equipped chairs. Proposals to improve the commissioning and provision of wheelchair services were formulated in 2015 with the help of the National Wheelchair Leadership Alliance, set up by [[Tanni Grey Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Improving wheelchair services|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/pe/wheelchair-services/#|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=NHS England}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vouchers will be replaced by personal wheelchair budgets, based on an assessment of individual needs and goals.  The [[British Medical Association]]’s annual meeting in 2107 unanimously passed a motion calling for wheelchair users to have “timely access to chairs suitable for their individual conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Need a wheelchair? Pay for it yourself|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/19/wheelchair-pay-yourself-disabled-people-crowdfunding?CMP=share_btn_tw|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are particular problems with the supply of electric wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harpenden disabled man’s wheelchair campaign after NHS refusal|url=http://www.hertsad.co.uk/news/harpenden-disabled-man-s-wheelchair-campaign-after-nhs-refusal-1-4966315|accessdate=20 July 2017|publisher=Herts Advertiser|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 more than 5,100 children, about 18%, had to wait more than four months from the time of their referral to their chair being delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Alarming' figures show thousands still waiting too long for wheelchairs |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioners/alarming-figures-show-thousands-still-waiting-too-long-for-wheelchairs/7023132.article |accessdate=15 August 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dame [[Tanni Grey-Thompson]] said, “If a child doesn’t have the right chair it means they cannot go to school, it means children are harder to handle for parents, it means potentially more respite care.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/14/disabled-children-waiting-too-long-for-nhs-wheelchairs Disabled children waiting too long for NHS wheelchairs] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hearing aids====
Hearing aids have been targeted for cutbacks in the NHS as pressure grows on budgets. North Staffordshire [[Clinical commissioning group]] decided that from October 2015 they would no longer pay for hearing aids for people with mild hearing loss or some people with moderate hearing loss.  This will save around £200,000 a year.  The decision was accepted by [[Staffordshire County Council]]'s health scrutiny committee in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearing aids cut for North Staffordshire backed at Stafford meeting|url=http://www.staffordshirenewsletter.co.uk/Hearing-aids-cut-backed-Stafford/story-26663612-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 July 2015|publisher=Staffordshire Newsletter|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is expected that the other CCGs in the county will adopt a similar policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to begin denying people hearing aids for first time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/01/nhs-to-begin-denying-people-hearing-aids-for-first-time|accessdate=3 October 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 Milton Keynes [[clinical commissioning group]]  was reported to be considering rationing the supply of hearing aids to one per person, and none for people with mild hearing loss or moderate hearing loss unless they could show they were “suffering a significant negative impact”. [[Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust]], which runs community services in the area, complained that these proposals were “incredibly damaging”, contrary to national policy, robust evidence, and professional opinion..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trust warns CCG over 'incredibly damaging' rationing proposals|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/7018413.article|accessdate=5 June 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Disability rights has a long and varied history in the UK, ranging from the establishment of a pioneering organisation in the 1970s to more recent cutbacks of social security benefits and consequent protests. The UK was an early adopter of anti-discrimination legislation in 1995 and ratified the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] in   2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organised disability rights movement in the UK can trace its roots back to the establishment of the [[Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation]] in the early 1970s.

Disabled people disputing benefit claims are usually denied legal aid forcing them to deal with complex and distressing cases without help.  The numbers disputing when benefits are denied have fallen drastically and it is feared the most vulnerable are losing out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/14/disabled-people-lose-legal-aid-99-per-cent-benefits-disputes Disabled people lose legal aid in 99% of benefits disputes] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of disabled people was an issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017]]. The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] both produced separate disability manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Election manifestos 2017|url=https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2017/may/general-election-manifestos-2017|accessdate=5 June 2017|publisher=Disability Rights|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Green Party document was launched by their candidate in Putney, Ben Fletcher, who is deafblind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Party announce first Deafblind parliamentary candidate with launch of disability manifesto|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/green-party-announce-first-deafblind-parliamentary-candidate-launch-disability-manifesto/|accessdate=5 June 2017|publisher=Inews|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many UK disabled people cannot afford proper food or cannot afford to keep their homes warm due to benefit cuts.  Research by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability]] shows struggling families.  Also 27% of working age disabled adults have less than £50 spending money per week after paying income tax, council tax and housing costs.  54% of those without social care or with inadequate care feel isolated and lonely.  53% felt lack of help worsened their mental health.  The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] reported disabled people were disproportionately harmed by [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|tax and welfare changes since 2010]], and disabled families lost up to £10,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/18/disabled-people-struggle-to-afford-food-and-heating-study-says Disabled people struggle to afford food and heating, study says] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Disability Forum (BDF), formerly the Employers' Forum on Disability, is a membership organisation of [[UK]] businesses.&lt;ref name="Businessdisabilityforum.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/ |title=Welcome to Business Disability Forum |publisher=Businessdisabilityforum.org.uk |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of the DDA the membership of BDF recognised the need for a tool with which they could measure their performance on disability year on year.

In 2005 eighty organisations took part in the [[Disability Standard]] benchmark providing the first statistics highlighting the [[UK]]'s performance as a nation of [[employers]].

Following the success of the first [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] Disability Standard 2007 saw the introduction of the Chief Executives' Diamond Awards for outstanding performance and 116 organisations taking the opportunity to compare trends across a large group of UK employers and monitor the progress they had made on disability.

2009 saw the introduction of the third benchmark, Disability Standard 2009.&lt;ref name="Businessdisabilityforum.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitystandard.com |title=Business Disability Forum |publisher=Disability Standard |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the BDF had a number of initiatives to assist businesses in meeting and including the needs of disabled customers and employees. These consisted of The Technology Taskforce (a Business Disability Forum partner initiative which brings together some of the world's largest procurers and suppliers of ICT); Accessible Technology Charter (launched in November 2011) in which the 'Accessibility Maturity Model' (AMM) is a self-assessment tool to enable businesses to identify and plan key policies for accessible and usable technologies.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

However, a report by the Social Market Foundation and Trust for London found that disabled people are not being supported into work enough in London. It found that there are 370,000 unemployed disabled Londoners, and a disability employment gap of 38.5%. This is still lower than national average disability employment gap of 41.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supporting disabled people into work |url=https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/publications/supporting-disabled-people-into-work/ |website=Trust for London |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social services ==
A number of financial and care support services, commonly referred to as [[disability benefits]] are available, including [[Incapacity Benefit]] and [[Disability Living Allowance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabled People: Financial support |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/fs/en |work=Directgov |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720042734/http://www.direct.gov.uk/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/fs/en |archivedate=July 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security benefit claimants with disabilities are 53% more likely to have their benefits sanctioned than claimant without disabilities.  Disabled people complain about job centre staff not understanding their disability.  Mark Atkinson of disability charity [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] said, “Punitive sanctions can be extremely harmful to disabled people, who already face the financial penalty of higher living costs. There is no clear evidence that cutting disabled people’s benefits supports them to get into and stay in work.  Sanctions are likely to cause unnecessary stress, pushing the very people that the government aims to support into work further away from the jobs market.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/18/disabled-people-million-benefit-sanctions-since-2010 More than a million benefits sanctions imposed on disabled people since 2010] ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:140822-A-OI229-008 (14845207828).jpg|thumb|A [[sei whale]] carcass being removed from a Virginia beach by the authorities]]

A '''drift whale''' is a [[whale|cetacean mammal]] that has died at sea and floated into shore. This is in contrast to a [[Cetacean stranding|beached or stranded whale]], which reaches land alive and may die there or regain safety in the ocean. Most [[cetacea]]ns that die, from natural causes or predators, do not wind up on land; most die far offshore and sink deep to become novel ecological zones known as [[whale fall]]. Some species that wash ashore are scientifically dolphins, i.e. members of the [[Oceanic dolphin|Delphinidae family]], but for ease of use, this article treats them all as "drift whales". For example, one species notorious for mass strandings is the [[pilot whale]], also known as "blackfish", which is taxonomically a dolphin.

[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holländischen Küste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|A sperm whale stranded on 3 February 1598 on the Dutch sea-coast. For more than 200 years, this image was the best-known representation of the species.]]
In historical sources, it is not always clear whether a given cetacean washed up alive or dead, but the term "drift whale" focuses on the benefits of its carcass – meat, blubber, fat, and other products – to the people who claimed it.&lt;ref name=Alan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMillan|first1=Alan |title=Whales and whalers in Nuu-Chah-Nulth Archaeology |journal=[[BC Studies]] |date=Autumn 2015 |issue=187 |pages=229–261 |url=http://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/viewFile/186163/185688 |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, when a dead whale washes up on a beach, often the authorities are required to dispose of it as a potential hazard to human health, so the resource implications go the other way: a drift whale is no longer a benefit to a community, but an expensive disadvantage.{{sfnp|''Whaling Masters''|1938|p=10}}

===Species===

Many cetacean species have been documented as drift whales, but some are more common than others. In New England, for example, the carcasses of [[fin whale|fin]], [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], [[right whale|right]], and [[pilot whale]]s, as well as dolphins, are most likely to drift ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why black whales are called “right whales”|url=https://whalingmuseumblog.org/2016/09/13/why-black-whales-are-called-right-whales/|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum Blog|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species have a naturally high buoyancy, and float when they are dead, aided by the gases of putrefaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Scientists Drag Dead Whales to the Bottom of the Sea|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/whale-fall-carcass|publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]]|accessdate=11 May 2018|language=en|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales that live in the [[pelagic zone|pelagic ocean]], far from the [[continental shelf]], are less likely to wash up ashore than coastal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignace|first1=Dianne|last2=Beach|first2=Katie|title=Sperm whale drifts on Hesquiaht Beach|url=http://www.tofinotime.com/articles/A-T805-26frm.htm|website=www.tofinotime.com|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these deep-sea animals do find themselves in shallower waters, however, they may run into difficulties, as the gradual shelving of the shoreline is thought to play a role in confusing [[Animal_echolocation#Toothed_whales|their sense of echolocation]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Why|first1=Who, What|title=Why do sperm whales wash up on beaches?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35399483|accessdate=11 May 2018|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of sperm whale strandings|Sperm whale strandings]] are known to have occurred in the [[North Sea]] for centuries, and the incidents may be increasing with louder [[Noise and vibration on maritime vessels|ship noise]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Certain beaches are well known as likely spots for whales, and other gifts from the sea, to wash up: [[drift seed]]s, [[driftwood]], and latterly [[sea glass]] and even [[message in a bottle|messages in bottles]].

A whale's massive carcass would provide a coastal community with considerable amounts of meat and fat, without the danger and effort of venturing onto the open ocean to harpoon a living leviathan.&lt;ref name="bridge1"/&gt; (An additional resource, in the treeless Arctic, was the long bones, useful for construction.) [[Whale meat]] is still valued in some countries; [[blubber]] can be eaten (especially welcome in very cold climates) or processed into [[whale oil]],&lt;ref name=Alan/&gt; once a widely used fuel.

The bounty and good fortune inherent in this find are recognised in etymology: "The meaning of the word 'drift-whale' in Icelandic, 'hvalreki,' has the same meaning as 'wind-fall' – an unexpected good incurred at no cost", according to [[Sigrún Davíðsdóttir]], London correspondent of the Icelandic national broadcaster [[RÚV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davíðsdóttir |first1=Sigrún |title=Icelandic whaling is a relic of a past some (but ever fewer) Icelanders cannot let go of |website=Sigrún Davíðsdóttir's Icelog |url=http://uti.is/2013/06/icelandic-whaling-is-a-relic-of-a-past-some-but-ever-fewer-icelanders-cannot-let-go-of/ |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two anthropologists, Thomas Talbot Waterman and [[Alfred Louis Kroeber]], who worked with [[Yurok]] informants in California, classified drift whales as [[Hunter-gatherer|a gathered resource]], rather than a product of hunting, as those beneficiaries ran no risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yurok Marriages, Volume 35 |date=1943 |author1=Thomas Talbot Waterman |author2=Alfred Louis Kroeber |publisher=University of California Press |page=84 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WKsSAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22discovery%20of%20a%20dead%20whale%20was%20a%20momentous%20event%22 |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-contact aboriginal===
{{See also|Aboriginal whaling}}
Coastal people around the world came up with a technique called [[dolphin drive hunting]], which exploits the animals' tendency to beach themselves. This sort of hunt, which depends on substantial community co-operation, still continues in a few places, as far apart as the North Atlantic ([[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]]), the South Pacific ([[Malaita dolphin drive hunt]]), and Japan ([[Taiji dolphin drive hunt]]). 

It is harder to find evidence, archaeological or ethnographic, of North American [[aboriginal whaling|indigenous people hunting large whales]] before cultural contact with Europeans, according to scholars of the Atlantic&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bolster |first1=W.

The skills learned from processing drift whales, such as [[flensing]] (stripping the [[blubber]]), may have led to seeking out live ones. For example, the [[Makah]] of Washington State have been hunting [[grey whale]]s for at least 1500 years, but were harvesting stranded whales for many centuries before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Renker|first1=Ann M.|title=Whale Hunting and the Makah Tribe: A Need Assessment |date=March 2002 |website=NOAA Fisheries Service {{!}} West Coast Region |publisher=[[NOAA]] |page=1 |url=http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/protected_species/marine_mammals/cetaceans/gray_whales/appendixa.pdf |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of North America, drift whale scavenging on the [[Outer Banks]] of North Carolina led to organised hunts, documented at the [[Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum {{!}} Where Were the Whalers?

[[File:Black Fish driven ashore at South Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Mass., about 1500 in the school, sold for fifteen thousand dollars, which was divided among 300 inhabitants (68237).jpg|left|thumb|1500 pilot whales driven ashore at [[Cape Cod]] in 1885, and sold for a considerable sum for their oil]]
March 1644, in [[Southampton, New York|Southhampton, Long Island]], saw the first recorded attempt of the New England colonists "to organize community efforts to hunt drift whales.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/overview-of-north-american-whaling/american-whaling |title=Yankee Whaling |publisher=[[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] |accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans had developed the technique of herding pilot whales onto the shelving beaches for slaughter; the colonists observed this, practised flensing the carcasses and [[Try pot|rendering the blubber]], improved on their weapons and boats, and then progressed to hunting on the ocean.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This early drift whaling at Southampton led gradually to the nearby [[Sag Harbor]] whaling fleet becoming the biggest in New York State, according to a curator at [[Sag Harbor Whaling Museum|the local whaling museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Sag Harbor Whaling Fleet |publisher=Southampton Historical Museum |url=http://www.southamptonhistoricalmuseum.org/event/a-brief-history-of-the-sag-harbor-whaling-fleet |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribes in Nantucket guarded and traded as sachem their ownership of drift whales assiduously. They were able to use their ownership and early treaties as a way to avoid royal taxes on the products.&lt;ref name="Chilton"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rc7vTJuXgoC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=Nantucket and Other Native Places: The Legacy of Elizabeth Alden Little |editor-first1=Elizabeth S. |editor-last1=Chilton |editor-first2=Mary Lynne |editor-last2=Rainey |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |location=Albany, New York |pages=68-71 |date=29 February 2012 |isbn=9781438432557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Both scavenging and hunting===
Some communities both hunted and scavenged. [[William Barr (Arctic historian)|William Barr]], the Arctic historian, gives two examples of the late eighteenth century: [[Labrador#Early_history|the Moravian missions on Labrador]], and possibly the Inuit of [[Hudson Strait]], who had a trading relationship with the supply ships of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. However, Barr assumes that the drift whales were ones that the Inuit hunters (or possibly the European [[whaling ship]]s) had harpooned and wounded, and the carcasses had come ashore some time later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barr |first1=William |title=The Eighteenth Century Trade between the Ships of the Hudson’s Bay Company and the Hudson Strait Inuit |journal=ARCTIC |date=September 1994 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=236–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==
[[File:Baleia morta na Praia de camburi ,Vitória , E.S. 10,2014.jpg|left|thumb|A dead whale, belly up, distended with gas]]
[[File:DeadHumpback.jpg|thumb|A dead humpback, showing the extrusion of the penis]]
Wrapped in a thick blanket of blubber, the carcass retains its mammalian heat, and the process of decomposition takes place relatively quickly; once ashore, there is a risk of the swollen [[exploding whale|whale exploding]]. That is a rare event, but more commonly, the build-up of pressure inside the abdominal cavity can lead to the extrusion of [[Penis#Cetaceans|the whale's penis]] through the [[genital slit]]. A similar phenomenon, [[Coffin birth#In animals|postmortem fetal extrusion]], can occur to the carcass of a pregnant whale: [[Tim Flannery]] wrote that "A rotting whale could fill with gas to bursting, ejecting a fetus the size of a motor vehicle with sufficient force to kill a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/feb/09/minds-whales/?pagination=false  |title=On the Minds of the Whales |first1=Tim |last1=Flannery |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=9 February 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of drift whale carcasses, particularly if they have been dead for a long time, carries risks of [[food poisoning]] or worse. In 2002, fourteen residents of a [[Bering Sea]] fishing village ate ''[[muktuk]]'' (skin and blubber) from a [[beluga whale]] which they "estimated had been dead for at least several weeks", resulting in eight of them developing [[botulism]], with two of the affected requiring [[mechanical ventilation]]. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] recommended boiling [[Yup'ik cuisine|Alaska Native dishes]] to rid them of the botulism toxin.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mythology and ritual==
[[Image:Maquinna.gif|thumb|upright|[[Maquinna]], chief of the [[Mowachaht]] people of [[Yuquot]].]]
Drift whales are a feature of fables and mythology.  For example, William of [[Barkley Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]] recounted tales to  [[Edward Sapir]], which were re-told by Kathryn Anne Bridge in a compendium about the [[Huu-ay-aht First Nations]].&lt;ref name="bridge2b"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridge |first1=Kathryn |title=Extraordinary accounts of Native life on the West Coast: words from Huu-ay-aht ancestors |date=2004 |publisher=Altitude Pub. Canada |location=Canmore, Alta. |isbn=1551537915 |pages=92-94 |quote=Chief Si'xpa'tskwin of Cape Beale was always trying to better himself as a whaler. … [seeing a] drift whale … floating on the sea. … They manoevered the canoe close … [and] were extremely tired and stopped paddling. … How would they ever have the strength to drag the carcass to shore?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chiefs of certain West Coast peoples built private sacred places, called whalers' washing houses, where they could [[Ritual purification|ritually purify]] themselves. The spiritual preparation that they undertook was not only for skill in the chase of living whales, but also to attract drift whales to their beach. The good fortune of the chief was understood to be tied to the spirit world, and the remains of human ancestors - especially the skulls - were used to ask for "whaling magic". The best known of these is the [[Yuquot Whalers Shrine]], associated with the great [[Mowachaht]] chief [[Maquinna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aldona Jonaitis |others=Research contributions by Richard Inglis |title=The Yuquot whalers' shrine |date=1999 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |location=Seattle |isbn=9780295978284 |oclc=247081771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbouring [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] and [[Makah]] peoples used similar shrines to pull drift whales to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charlotte Coté |others=Foreword by Micah McCarty |title=Spirits of our whaling ancestors : revitalizing Makah and Nuu-chah-nulth traditions |date=2010 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |isbn=9780295990460 |edition=1st |oclc=1012176487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food resource==
[[File:Maktaaq 2 2002-08-10.jpg|left|thumb|Two women enjoying ''[[muktuk]]'' outside their summer tent, 2002]]

{{Ill|R. Lee Lyman|de}} proposed that drift whales might have formed a considerable summer food resource for people living on the coast of what is now Oregon, before contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name="bridge1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridge |first1=Kathryn |last2=Neary |first2=Kevin |title=Voices of the elders: Huu-ay-aht histories and legends |location=Victoria Vancouver Calgary |publisher=Heritage |date=2013 |isbn=1927051940 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.

==Rights==
[[File:Dividing a whale, from a manuscript from the 16th century.jpg|thumb|Icelanders dividing a whale, from a manuscript from the 16th century]]
Peoples that value [[whale meat]] and [[blubber]] have kept an eye out for drift whales, and traded the rights to them, for example bartering access to inland fishing rivers.&lt;ref name="bridge1"/&gt; Specific people may have hereditary rights to drift whales and a particular locale.&lt;ref name="bridge2b"/&gt;

It is widely believed that ‘Practices cannot survive on their own – they have to look at ways of making themselves stronger.’  15 sites were selected in December 2015 to test new enhanced primary care models serving populations of 30,000 to 50,000 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GPs in 15 areas to pilot 50,000-patient 'primary care home' model|url=http://www.gponline.com/gps-15-areas-pilot-50000-patient-primary-care-home-model/article/1377461|accessdate=24 May 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, but by no means all, [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s have given financial support to encourage the formation of federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Practices given tens of millions of pounds to support them in federating|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/general-practice-forward-view/practices-given-tens-of-millions-of-pounds-to-support-them-in-federating/20032378.article|accessdate=24 May 2017|publisher=Pulse|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[British Medical Association]] explains there are many names and many organisational forms: federations, networks, collaborations, joint ventures, alliances. By 2017 it appeared that GP Federations were the commonest titles for collaborative arrangements which fall short of full merger or partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GP networks and federations|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/gp-practices/gps-and-staff/gp-networks/gp-networks|website=BMA|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the BMA and the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]] were keen to support such developments, the RCGP having encouraged them since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primay Care Federations feedback from the consultation|url=http://www.rcgp.org.uk/policy/rcgp-policy-areas/primay-care-federations-feedback-from-the-consultation.aspx|website=RCGP|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Greek cancer cure''' was a putative cancer cure invented and promoted by [[microbiologist]] Hariton-Tzannis Alivizatos (died 1991). It consisted of intravenous injections of a fluid for which Aliviatos would not reveal the formula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/greek.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical claims and criticism==
In 1983, Dr. Alivizatos announced that he had developed a serum that had a 60 percent success rate in arresting most types of cancer, with the exception of extremely advanced cases.  He claimed that the serum could attack a protein-like substance that surrounds cancer cells and weaken the body's ability to keep the disease from spreading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/us/cancer-victims-seek-cure-on-trips-to-athens.html|title=CANCER VICTIMS SEEK CURE ON TRIPS TO ATHENS|last=Times|first=Robert Lindsey and Special To the New York|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek health officials ridiculed Dr. Alivizatos's assertions, while the [[American Cancer Society]] warned his current patients that there was no evidence that the diagnostic procedures and treatment for cancer proposed had resulted in any benefits for the treatment of cancer in human beings.  They concluded that, "there is no evidence that any aspect of the diagnostic test nor the treatment... are effective in the treatment of cancer."  In addition they state "Nor is there any evidence that.. the intravenous injections are safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unproven methods of cancer management: Greek cancer cure|journal=[[CA (journal)|CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians]]|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=368–371|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.40.6.368/pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6407">==Prevalence==
With only 0.2 [[percent]] of the adult population estimated to be [[HIV]]-positive, [[Nicaragua]] has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates in [[Central America]]. HIV was first detected in Nicaragua in 1987, after concentrated [[epidemic]]s had been reported in other Central American nations. The onset of the epidemic was likely delayed by Nicaragua’s 10-year civil war and the U.S.-led economic blockade, both of which left the country isolated for several years. Relative control over commercial sex work, low infection rates among injecting drug users, and a ban on the commercial sale of blood also slowed HIV transmission. However, the country is at risk of a broader epidemic because of social conditions such as multiple sex partners, gender inequality, and widespread poverty. Many people are unaware of their HIV status and could unwittingly spread the disease. [[UNAIDS]] estimates Nicaragua has 7,300 HIV-positive people, nearly half of whom were identified over the past three years.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

Sexual activity is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Nicaragua. Unprotected [[heterosexual]] intercourse is reported to account for 72 percent of HIV infections, and unprotected sex between men is estimated to account for 26 percent, according to UNAIDS. However, it is likely that the former is over-reported and the latter under-reported because of stigma and discrimination (S&amp;D) against [[homosexuals]]. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men ([[Men who have sex with men|MSM]]) is significantly higher (7.6 percent) than among sex workers or the general population. A 2002 study reported by UNAIDS demonstrated that infection levels among MSM were 38 times higher than among the general population. The latest study on HIV among commercial sex workers reported by UNAIDS demonstrated a prevalence of only 0.2 percent in that group. As of September 2005, more than half of reported HIV cases occurred among 20- to 39-year-olds, according to Nicaragua’s 2006 [[United Nations General Assembly Special Session]] on HIV report.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

Factors that put Nicaraguans at risk include early sexual debut; social pressures for males to have multiple sexual partners and take sexual risks; widespread poverty; women’s and girls’ inability to negotiate when and under what circumstances to have sex or use [[condoms]]; gender-based violence; and sexual abuse of women and girls. Compounding these factors, access to HIV/[[AIDS]] services and information is limited in much of the country due to budgetary priorities and limitations. Moreover, conservative religious and social values make it difficult to talk about sex and ways to protect oneself from disease or unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="usaid"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/nicaragua_profile.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090421234455/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/nicaragua_profile.pdf |archive-date= 17 August 2008 |title= Health Profile: Nicaragua |last= |first= |date= June 2008 |website= [[United States Agency for International Development]] |publisher= |access-date= 7 September 2008 |quote= }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
Traditionally, HIV/AIDS prevention has not been a national priority in Nicaragua because HIV prevalence is low. The [[National Program for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections]] was not established until 1998. Before that, the [[Government of Nicaragua]] enacted the Law for the Promotion, Protection and Defense of [[Human Rights]] of People Living With HIV/AIDS (Law 238) in 1996, but the law did not go into effect until 1999. Law 238 created the [[Nicaraguan AIDS Commission]] (CONISIDA) in 2000, which is charged with enforcing the law and guiding the national response to HIV/AIDS. However, CONISIDA lacks the organizational and technical capacity to effectively fulfill its role in supporting government and civil society efforts to assist people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and prevent the spread of HIV. Of particular concern is CONISIDA’s failure to adequately ensure the rights of PLWHA. The Country Coordinating Mechanism, formed in 2000, has a variety of prominent members, including representatives from government; multilateral, nongovernmental, and educational organizations; the private sector; religious groups; and representatives of PLWHA. It oversees the HIV/AIDS grant from the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. The Global Fund grant is for more than $10.1 million from 2004 to 2009. The purpose of the grant is to build on the existing national strategic plan for HIV/AIDS and other [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) by strengthening prevention, care, and support activities; by ensuring comprehensive care for PLWHA; and by documenting all AIDS cases within the national surveillance system.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

In 2006, the government approved a new national strategic plan for 2005 to 2009 and a new national AIDS policy. Current efforts focus on increasing the response capacity of the health sector and ensuring the sustainability of measures and actions taken. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has integrated its HIV/AIDS and [[tuberculosis]] programs and adopted protocols for treating co-infected patients; however, it has not been able to achieve efficient coordination of the two programs in practice. Nicaragua is also strengthening primary care and implementing awareness, prevention, and protection efforts.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

Nicaragua is a partner in the [[Brazil+7]] initiative, a [[UNICEF]]-, [[UNAIDS]]-, and [[Brazil]]ian-led effort dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for pregnant women and young people; to offering universal access to [[antiretroviral]] medication for PLWHA; and to ensuring universal access to services for preventing mother-to-child transmission. The other partner countries are [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[East Timor]].&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

'''Gingivostomatitis''' (also known as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis or orolabial herpes) is a combination of [[gingivitis]] and [[stomatitis]], or an inflammation of the [[oral mucosa]] and [[gingiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000044457| Gingivostomatitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpetic gingivostomatitis is often the initial presentation during the first ("primary") [[herpes simplex]] infection. It is of greater severity than [[herpes labialis]] (cold sores) which is often the subsequent presentations. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the most common viral infection of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Oral Complications of Cancer and Its Management".  By Andrew Davies, Joel Epstein. Oxford University Press, 2010. p195&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) represents the clinically apparent pattern of primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, since the vast majority of other primary infections are symptomless. PHGS is caused predominantly by HSV-1 and affects mainly children. Prodromal symptoms, such as [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[irritability]], [[malaise]] and [[headache]], may occur in advance of disease. The disease presents as numerous pin-head vesicles, which rupture rapidly to form painful irregular ulcerations covered by yellow–grey membranes. Sub-mandibular lymphadenitis, [[halitosis]] and refusal to drink are usual concomitant findings.&lt;ref&gt;"Herpes simplex virus infection, with particular reference to the progression and complications of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis",     A. Kolokotronis,    S. Doumas, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 12, Issue 3, pages 202–211, March 2006. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2005.01336.x/full&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
[[File:Herpes Gingivalis.tiff|thumb|Herpes lesions on the gingiva.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman, J. [http://www.nycdentist.com/dental-photo-detail/771/108/Herpes-1-labialis-oral-cold-sores-fever-blisters-sun-blister-mouth-lip The Center for Special Dentistry].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:
* Not able to chew or swallow
* Sores on the inside of the cheeks or gums
* [[Fever]]
* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling
* Very sore mouth with no desire to eat
* [[Halitosis]] (bad breath)
==Diagnosis==
===Differential Diagnosis===
Gingivostomatitis symptoms in infants may wrongly be dismissed as [[teething]]. "Coincidentally,  primary  tooth  eruption begins  at  about the  time that  infants  are  losing  maternal antibody protection  against  the  herpes  virus. Also, reports  on  teething  difficulties  have  recorded  symptoms  which  are  remarkably  consistent  with  primary oral  herpetic  infection  such as  fever,  irritability,  sleeplessness,  and difficulty  with eating."&lt;ref&gt;"Herpetic  gingivostomatitis  and teething  difficulty in  infants". David  L.  King,  William  Steinhauer,  Franklin  Garcfa-Godoy,  Cassandra  J.  Elkins. PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY MARCH/APRIL, 1992 VOLUME 14, NUMBER 2. p83&lt;/ref&gt; "Younger infants  with  higher residual  levels  of  antibodies  would experience  milder infections  and  these  would be  more likely  to  go unrecognized  or  be  dismissed  as  teething  difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;"Herpetic  gingivostomatitis  and teething  difficulty in  infants". David  L.  King,  William  Steinhauer,  Franklin  Garcfa-Godoy,  Cassandra  J.  Elkins. PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY MARCH/APRIL, 1992 VOLUME 14, NUMBER 2. p84&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingivostomatitis must also be differentiated from [[herpangina]], another disease that also commonly causes ulcers in the oral cavity of children, but is caused by the Coxsackie A virus rather than a herpes virus.&lt;ref name=Parrott&gt;{{cite journal|last=PARROTT|first=RH |author2=WOLF, SI |author3=NUDELMAN, J |author4=NAIDEN, E |author5=HUEBNER, RJ |author6=RICE, EC |author7=McCULLOUGH, NB|title=Clinical and laboratory differentiation between herpangina and infectious (herpetic) gingivostomatitis.|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 1954|volume=14|issue=2|pages=122–9|pmid=13185685}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In herpangina, ulcers are usually isolated to the soft palate and anterior pillar of the mouth.&lt;ref name=Parrott /&gt; In herpetic gingivostomatitis, lesions can be found in these locations, but they are almost always accompanied by ulcerations on the gums, lips, tongue or buccal mucosa and/or by hyperemia, hypertrophy or hemorrhage of the gums.&lt;ref name=Parrott /&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment includes fluid intake, good [[oral hygiene]] and gentle [[debridement]] of the mouth, as well as oral [[acyclovir]]. In healthy individuals the lesions heal spontaneously in 7–14 days without scarring.

March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Japanese Government established the Noguchi Prize in July 2006 as a new international medical research and services award.  Release of news about the planned prize was timed to mark the official visit to by Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] to Africa in May 2006.  The announcement of this new international prize also marked the 80th anniversary of Dr. Noguchi’s death.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Science and Technology Agency: [http://sciencelinks.jp/content/blogcategory/30/246/  " Commemorative Lecture: The First Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428152905/http://sciencelinks.jp/content/blogcategory/30/246/ |date=2008-04-28 }} Science Links Japan web site.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prize aims to honor individuals with outstanding achievements in combating various infectious diseases in Africa or in establishing innovative medical service systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rockefeller Foundation: [http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/news/2006/072506noguchi.shtml Noguchi Prize, history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523172141/http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/news/2006/072506noguchi.shtml |date=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As preliminary discussions about the award were disclosed, Koizumi explained that he hoped that many countries in the world would take an interest in this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060727b3.html  "Koizumi unveils Africa medical research award,"] ''Japan Times.'' July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The awarding of the Noguchi Prize is planned to be a keynote event at the [[Tokyo International Conference on African Development]] (TICAD).  TICAD is a policy forum which Japan initiated in 1993. Other co-organizers are the [[United Nations]] [[Office of the Special Advisor on Africa]] (OSSA), the [[United Nations Development Program]] and the [[World Bank]]. Over time, the TICAD meetings have evolved into a major global framework to facilitate the implementation of initiatives for promoting African development under the dual principle of African "ownership" and international "partnership".&lt;ref name="x27"&gt;Du Guodong. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/27/content_8263457.htm  "Backgrounder: Tokyo Int'l Conference on African Development (TICAD),"] ''China View'' (Xinhua). May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the first conference (TICAD-I), African countries and their development partners determined to do their utmost for African stability and prosperity.&lt;ref name="x27"/&gt;
* At TICAD-II, African countries and their development partners agreed on the "Tokyo Agenda for Action" (TAA), the strategic and action oriented guideline, with poverty reduction in Africa and its integration into the global economy as two fundamental goals.&lt;ref name="x27"/&gt;
* TICAD-III brought together some 1,000 delegates, including 23 heads of state and the Chairperson of the [[African Union Commission]]. African countries and their development partners reviewed the achievements of the ten year TICAD process, discussed the future direction it should take in light of the latest developments on the African continent and in the international arena, and declared the "TICAD Tenth Anniversary Declaration".&lt;ref name="x27"/&gt;
* TICAD-IV aimed to mobilizes knowledge and resources of the international community in the core areas of boosting economic growth, ensuring human security and addressing environment and climate change issues. TICAD IV is scheduled to conclude with the adoption of the "Yokohama Declaration", outlining guiding principles and approaches to African development among TICAD stakeholders, as well as the "Yokohama Action Plan" and the "Yokohama Follow-up Mechanism", laying out a road map for action-oriented initiatives with measurable targets.&lt;ref name="x27"/&gt;

==Hideyo Noguchi==
[[File:Statue of Hideyo Noguchi.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of [[Hideyo Noguchi]] in [[Ueno Park]], in [[Tokyo]].]]
[[Hideyo Noguchi]] was a prominent Japanese [[bacteriologist]] who discovered the agent of [[syphilis]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Julius H. and A. Levinson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bjgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=hideyo+noguchi&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a  "Clinic of Drs. Julius H. Hess and A. Levinson; The Luetin Test," ''International Clinics: A Quarterly.'' Vol.3, No. 28 (1918), p. 89]-95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noguchi's work would later attract the scrutiny of the committee evaluating nominations for the Nobel Prize in Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Government Internet TV: [http://nettv.gov-online.go.jp/eng/prg/prg1143.html  "Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize," streaming video 2007/04/26]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nobel Foundation archives have been only recently opened for public inspection; and what was once only speculation is now confirmed.  In 1914, for example, Dr. Ikutaro Hirai of Kyoto nominated Noguchi for the Nobel Prize in Medicine because of his bacteriological and biological works.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel Prize in Medicine: [http://nobelprize.org/nomination/medicine/nomination.php?action=show&amp;showid=3058  nomination, 1914.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Noguchi traveled extensively in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] to do research for a [[vaccine]] for [[yellow fever]].  He traveled to [[Africa]] to try to confirm his findings; and he wanted to test the hypothesis that yellow fever was caused by [[spirochaete]] [[bacteria]] instead of a [[virus]]. While working in [[Accra]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (modern-day [[Ghana]]), he was himself struck down by the yellow fever virus.&lt;ref&gt;National Diet Library: [http://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/312.html?c=26 Noguchi bio and image]&lt;/ref&gt; His last words were reported to have been, ''"I don't understand."''&lt;ref&gt;BBC/H2g2: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1132138  Yellow Fever blurb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Noguchi's body was returned to the United States; but the Noguchi Prize is arguably poised to become a more meaningful memorial than his modest grave marker in New York City's [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D71E31F932A3575AC0A961958260&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=hideyo+noguchi&amp;st=nyt  " A Place for All Eternity In Their Adopted Land,"] ''New York Times.'' September 1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaugural award in 2008==
The first laureates of the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, like Noguchi himself, are both medical doctors with a career-long interest in epidemiology and public health. They are Dr. [[Brian Greenwood]] and Dr. [[Miriam Were]].&lt;ref name="cao-jp1"/&gt;  For the honorees, the Prize represents both an acknowledgment of their past accomplishments and an investment in their prospective contributions in the years ahead.

Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] made the actual award presentation; and the Emperor and Empress were present at the 2008 ceremony along with a large number of African heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzimafoundation.org/main/2008/05/29/mama-miriam-receives-the-hideyo-noguchi-prize/  "Mama Miriam receives the Hideyo Noguchi Prize,"] UZIMA Foundation News. May 29, 2008; [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irVga8h6hn421DTP4i63b5ejJzFw  "Japan awards Kenyan, Briton new Africa health prize"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520135629/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irVga8h6hn421DTP4i63b5ejJzFw |date=2011-05-20 }} (Agence France Press). May 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The presentation ceremony and laureate lectures coincided with TICAD-IV, which was held in [[Yokohama]] in late May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Cabinet Office: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/english/keii/keii.html  Noguchi Prize, chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;  This year's conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named.  In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Hideyo Noguchi Memorial Museum: [http://www.town.inawashiro.fukushima.jp/eng/main_eng_noguchi.html  Noguchi, life events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071844/http://www.town.inawashiro.fukushima.jp/eng/main_eng_noguchi.html |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Greenwood, the Manson Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] ([[LSHTM]]), was honored in the Medical Research category; and his laureate lecture topic was "Malaria elimination – Is it possible?"&lt;ref name="cao-jp1"/&gt;

Prof. Were, chairperson of Kenya's National AIDS Control Council (NACC), chairperson of the [[African Medical and Research Foundation]] ([[AMREF]]) and formerly Professor of Community Health at the [[University of Nairobi]] School of Medicine, was honored in the Medical Services category; and her laureate lecture was "Potential for Improvement in Africa's Health Through Evidence and Persistence in the Spirit of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi."&lt;ref name="cao-jp1"/&gt;

With significantly large money prizes attending this award, the Noguchi Prize already rivals the major established scientific awards.&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Cabinet Office: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/makgoba-comment-e.pdf  Noguchi Prize, analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;  From the outset, the 2008 Noguchi Prizes—consisting of a citation, a medal and an honorarium of 100 million yen (US$843,668) -- were only intended to be the first in a continuing series; and subsequent prizes are expected to be awarded every five years.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.afro.who.int/press/2007/pr20070430.html  Noguchi Prize, WHO/AFRO involved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130024613/http://www.afro.who.int/press/2007/pr20070430.html |date=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize has been made possible through a combination of government funding and private donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080330TDY03103.htm  "Noguchi Africa Prize short by 70% of fund target,"] ''Yomiuri Shimbun'' (Tokyo). March 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of laureates==
The Japanese government has commemorated Dr. Noguchi's life by printing his portrait on Japanese 1000 [[yen]] [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen|banknotes]] since 2004;&lt;ref&gt;Bank of Japan: [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/list/yuko/data/money01.pdf Valid Bank of Japan Notes, as of August 2004;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325223705/http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/list/yuko/data/money01.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }} Brook, James.

November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and this new initiative intends to do more than honoring the man himself.  The Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize is expected to draw attention to those whose own work mirrors what Dr. Noguchi strove to achieve.

The '''Hillel Yaffe Medical Center''' ({{lang-he|מרכז רפואי הלל יפה}}) is a major [[hospital]] on the western edge of [[Hadera]], [[Israel]]. It serves a population of about 380,000 residents in an area ranging from [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] in the north to [[Netanya]] in the south, from the [[Mediterranean]] coast in the west to [[Umm el-Fahm]] and the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] in the east. The center is named after [[Hillel Yaffe]], a pioneering Israeli doctor who worked in nearby Jewish settlements in the land of Palestine during the [[First Aliyah]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://hy.health.gov.il/english/about.php?did=66 "About us" on the HYMC website. Access date: 10 March 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414192352/http://hy.health.gov.il/english/about.php?did=66 |date=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* 1957 – The hospital was founded in a number of small wooden shacks that were erected on the sand dunes to the west of Hadera.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;
* 1967 – The academic school named after [[Pat Matthews]] was founded.
* 1970–1975 – The hospital was the national center for [[organ transplant]]s, under the leadership of Dr. [[Erwin Ya'akov]], the manager of the surgery division.
* 1980 – The modern building for patients was populated.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; It continues to serve the majority of units at the hospital.

==Buildings==
As of 2006 the operations of the hospital are centralized in two main buildings:
* The main building was designed by the architect [[Ilya Belzitzman]] and was dedicated in 1980. North of this building, facing the entrance to the [[emergency department]], stands a statue of the professor and doctor [[Rafi Karso]], who was the manager of the neurology division, the institute for alternative medicine, and the institute for alleviating [[pain]].
* The "building of the institutes" was designed by the architect [[Alex Shohet]].

There is also a new multipurpose building, which was designed by the office of the architect [[Uzi Gordon]].

==Diverse population and staff==
A diverse group of doctors and nurses works at the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center: Arabs and Jews, natives and immigrants. The patients also reflect the diversity of the region's population: urban people alongside rural farmers, natives and immigrants, Jews and [[Arab]]s. The hospital thus serves as an example of peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Jews, and of absorbing immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Ethiopia]] and other lands.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

'''John Bachar''' (March 23, 1957 – July 5, 2009) was an American [[rock climber]].  Noted for his skill at [[free soloing]], he died during a free solo climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rob |last=Robinson |title=John Bachar Southeast Tour - November 2008 |publisher=climbing.com |url=http://www.climbing.com/community/events/john_bachar_southeast_tour_-_november_2008/ |accessdate=7 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709085911/http://www.climbing.com/community/events/john_bachar_southeast_tour_-_november_2008/ |archivedate= 9 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fitness fanatic, he was the creator of the climbing training device known as the [[Bachar ladder]].
==Early life and education==

Bachar was born in 1957. He grew up in [[Los Angeles, California]] and started climbing at the [[bouldering]] hot spot of [[Stoney Point (California)|Stoney Point]] in the northern [[San Fernando Valley]]. After attending [[Westchester High School (Los Angeles)|Westchester High School]], graduating in 1974, he attended [[UCLA]], where his father was a math professor, but dropped out to climb full-time. Obsessed with the sport, he immersed himself in books on physical training and nutrition, and soon was able to outperform his fellow climbers. Fellow students at his high school remember him scaling the exterior high school gym walls on many occasions.
==Climbing career==
[[John Long (climber)|John Long]], John Yablonski, [[Ron Kauk]] and Mike Graham, whom Bachar met in the early 1970s, all free soloed with him, starting with the classic [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree]] route ''Double Cross'' (5.7). He also put up notorious bouldering problems in Joshua Tree such as ''Planet X'' ([[Grade (bouldering)#The Hueco scale|V6]]) and ''So High'' (V5). The committing crux move of the latter problem is {{Convert|25|ft|m}} off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Miramontes, ''A Complete Bouldering Guide To Joshua Tree National Park'', K. Daniels and Associates, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachar was first noted for his climbs in [[Yosemite]] with his unroped ascents of ''New Dimensions'' (5.11a) and ''The Nabisco Wall'', a three-pitch affair (''Waverly Wafer'' (5.10c), either ''Wheat Thin'' (5.10c) or ''Butterballs'' (5.11c R), and ''Butterfingers'' (5.11a) as the final pitch).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kroese, ''Fifty Favorite Climbs: The Ultimate North American Tick List'', The Mountaineers Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for his physical fitness, his campsite at [[Camp 4 (Yosemite)|Camp 4]] was filled with exercise equipment, including the hanging ladders since associated with his name.  At his peak he was able to perform a two-finger pull-up with {{Convert|12.5|lbs}} of weight in his other hand, and two-arm pull-up with over {{Convert|100|lbs}} of weight strapped around his waist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Reardon, ''Bachar: One Man, One Myth, One Legend'', Jumprunner Productions, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While attempting the [[bouldering]] problem [[Midnight Lightning (bouldering)|Midnight Lightning]] with Kauk and Yablonski in 1978, Bachar drew the iconic [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]] in chalk.&lt;ref name=nobolt&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetmountain.com/english/News/shownews1.lasso?l=2&amp;keyid=40853 |title=Midnight Lightning bolt, the icon of free climbing in Yosemite disappears for a day |publisher=planetmountain.com |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Ron Kauk and John Long, Bachar was part of the team that free-climbed the East face of Washington Column, ushering in a new age of free climbing with their first free ascent of ''Astroman''.  This route, containing numerous pitches of 5.10 and 5.11 difficulty, set a new standard for long and continuously difficult free climbs.  He played a key role in making the first free ascent of the technical and difficult "boulder problem" pitch low on the route.

Bachar posted a note in 1981 promising a "$10,000 reward for anyone who can follow me for one full day." No one took the challenge. That same year he put up ''Bachar-Yerian'' (5.11c R/X) in [[Tuolumne Meadows]] with Dave Yerian. A heady testpiece, the {{Convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical-to-gently-overhanging route is protected by 13 [[bolt (climbing)|bolts]] (including [[anchor bolt]]s), each one placed either from a stance (9) or while hanging from a hook (4). Bachar was a vocal critic of climbing tactics such as bolting on [[rappel]], which came into vogue during the 1980s. However, at the time of the first ascent, there were critics of his decision to place certain bolts from hooks, rather than drilling and placing each bolt from a stance.

In 1986, Bachar and [[Peter Croft (climber)|Peter Croft]] made a [[enchainment|link up]] of [[El Capitan]] and [[Half Dome]], climbing a vertical mile in under 14 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Huber and Heinz Zak, ''Yosemite: Half a Century of Dynamic Rock Climbing'', Menasha Ridge Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Bachar free soloed ''Enterprise'' (5.12b) in the [[Owens River Gorge]] and ''The Gift'' (5.12c) at [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rocks]] for the ''Masters of Stone'' video series.  He was featured in the documentary ''Bachar: One Man, One Myth, One Legend'' (2005) by Michael Reardon.
==Personal life==
Bachar lived in [[Mammoth Lakes, California]] and was Director of Design of [[Acopa International LLC]], a company which manufactures rock climbing shoes.

On December 3, 1996 Bachar became a father when his only child Tyrus was born to Valerie Vosburg.

On August 13, 2006, Bachar was involved in a serious car accident while traveling home from the Outdoor Retailer Trade Show in [[Salt Lake City]]. He suffered multiple fractured vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Ed | last = Douglas| title = John Bachar | date = 10 July 2009 | publisher = The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/john-bacher-rock-climber|accessdate=10 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalman Samuels''' (born Kerry, September 7, 1951) is the founder of Shalva, the Israel Association for the Care and Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities. Non-denominational and free of charge, Shalva offers services to individuals with disabilities from infancy to adulthood and their families.  Shalva provides a range of therapies, inclusive educational frameworks, recreational activities, vocational training as well as respite and family support.  Shalva advocates for the inclusion of persons with disabilities through employment programs, community initiatives, and research. 
== Early life ==
[[File:Kalman High School Grad.jpg|thumb|Kalman Samuels High School Yearbook picture]]

Kalman was raised in a non-observant [[Jewish]] home in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada where he attended Sir Winston Churchill High School. Upon his graduation in 1969 he was given academic and basketball scholarships to the [[University of British Columbia]]. After his first year studying philosophy he traveled Europe with plans to undergo coursework in France. However his mother requested that he stop in [[Israel]] to visit relatives. Enamored with [[Jewish culture]] and heritage, he cancelled the trip to France and enrolled in several [[yeshivot]], and in 1977 he received his [[rabbinical ordination]].

== Marriage and birth of Yossi ==

In 1973 Samuels married Malki Klein and the couple took up residence in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1977, their second son, [[Yossi Samuels]], at the time 11 months old, was injured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shefa|first1=Sheri|title='Never stop dreaming,' says dad of child with special needs |url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/%E2%80%98never-stop-dreaming%E2%80%99-says-dad-child-special-needs|website=The Canadian Jewish News|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a faulty [[DPT vaccine|DPT vaccination]] and was rendered blind, deaf and acutely hyperactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klass Mauer|first1=Naomi|title=Kalman Samuels Proves Dreams Really Can Come True|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/kalman-samuels-proves-dreams-really-can-come-true/2015/02/18/0/|accessdate=June 7, 2015|publisher=The Jewish Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 7 years with no communication, Shoshana Weinstock, Yossi's [[special education]] teacher, achieved a break through by relaying [[sign language]] into the palm of his hand, teaching Yossi his first word, 'Shulchan' ([[Hebrew]], שֻׁולְחָן), meaning table.  Malki vowed that if Yossi could be helped, she would dedicate herself to helping other children with disabilities and their families.

== Founding and expansion of Shalva ==

Due to their challenges raising Yossi without adequate support, Malki and Kalman established an afternoon playgroup for children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linde|first1=Steve|title=Editor's Notes: Realizing a challenging dream|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Editors-Notes-Realizing-a-challenging-dream|publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the program expanded to meet the needs of a broader spectrum of disabilities, from birth through adulthood. Today, [[Shalva]] offers a constellation of therapeutic interventions, family support, inclusive educational frameworks, social and recreational programs and vocational training to individuals with disabilities.
In recognition of Shalva's accomplishments and an ongoing need to expand the availability of special needs services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozenbaum|first1=Kochava|title=SHALVA – A Magnet for Special Needs Children|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/170849#.VXWfUM9VhBc|website=Israel National News|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jerusalem Municipality]] provided the organization with a seven acre property adjacent to the planned Route 16 highway and the [[Shaarei tzedek|Shaarei Tzedek Medical Center]] in the [[Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem|Beit HaKerem]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]]. 
In September 2016, Shalva opened the Shalva National Center in Jerusalem and has since become an international leader in the field of disability care; housing some of Israel's largest and most advanced facilities for persons with disabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">Male Initiation  of the Basotho Men is known as '''Lebollo la banna''' in [[Sesotho]].

Lebollo is a cultural and traditional practice that the [[basotho]] society follows to construct the manhood identity. It is a [[rite of passage]] in a sense that boys or ‘bashemane’ pass the puberty stage and enter the adulthood stage to become men or ‘monna’.  Part of the rite of the rite of passage includes a traditional [[circumcision]] which is the removal of the foreskin covering the glans of the penis. This practice is commonly found within the Basotho men in the [[Free State]] Province of [[South Africa]] as well as [[Lesotho]]. The prevalence of traditional male circumcision  among the [[Sotho people]], who mostly reside in the Free State, is at 57,3%.

Despite much criticism directed towards ''Lebollo'', there is an increase in the number of boys attending traditional initiation schools in post-[[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. This is argued to be due to the resurgence of young men's respect for traditional authority as well as governments support of research reporting a reduced risk of [[HIV infection]] when circumcised. There are many government based organisations who provide clinical circumcision however, many Basotho still opt for circumcision at traditional initiation schools due to the cultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Malisha, L., Maharaj, P. &amp; Rogan, M. 2008. Rites of passage to adulthood: Traditional initiation schools in the context of HIV/AIDS in the Limpopo province, South Africa. Journal on Health, Risk &amp; Society, 10(6), 585-598. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698570802533713. Accessed 8 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sotho man.jpg|thumb|right|A Sotho man wearing a blanket showing proof that he has reached the manhood stage]]

==Description==
Traditional initiation schools of the Basotho are conducted over a period of time (varying from a few weeks to 6 months) in secluded areas away from settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Sello M. B. Mohlaloka, Lynette Jacobs &amp; Corene de Wet (2016) The Influence of Traditional Male Initiation (Lebollo) on School Discipline: Educators’ Perspectives, Deviant Behavior, 37:6, 709-721, DOI: 10.1080/01639625.2015.1071132 Accessed 8 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
These areas are often referred to as 'the bush' or 'the mountain’. The traditional initiation teachers, known as ''basuwe'' in Sesotho, are commonly elderly men with substantial economic, political and social standing within Basotho communities. The 'initiators' (basuwe) perform rituals and also teach the initiates about cultural and health issues. A “monga lebollo” is the one who establishes lebollo in a particular area and owns the particular initiation school. The ‘monga lebollo’ of an area is sometimes given a position in formal education school governing bodies in order to assist and advise schools on the behaviours and needs of the new initiates.

== History of Lebollo==
Initiation rites among the South Sotho had by the 19th century become central to both the homestead and the [[chieftainship]]. It was the chief who periodically called upon all boys of a certain age (usually those between 16 and 20 years of age) to undergo this ritual.

With basotho societies being colonised by the settlers in the 1800s, the new colonial government set laws to regulate and restrict the time and location of the practice. The government also sent dispatches to different basotho chiefs from 1944 and 1945 to evaluate whether the laws were obeyed by the basotho communities. Basotho Chiefs such as Kgama, Sebele, Lentswe and Bathoeng were praised for having been loyal to the laws of the colonial governments administrative High Commissioner on Initiation. Chief Lentshwe had been successfully practicing male initiation since his reign began in 1874, and was able to name eight mophato (regiments). Eighteen years later, Chief Lentshwe was converted to Western Christianity which prohibited him from supporting traditional Sotho practices such as Lebolla. He declared that there would be no initiation practice by his people however, people continued to prepare themselves for initiation.

In 1902 Chief Lentshwe authorised an initiation school after much persuasion from his people. The Basotho Initiation ritual did not occur again until 1975 when other chiefs took over and reintroduced the practice. Before 1975, parents who took their children to the ‘bush school’, were excommunicated from the [[Christian]] church community, along with their children. In order to be accepted back into the community, the rebellious families had to undergo church rituals of repentance and cleansing. Currently, not all community members practice initiation. However certain families uphold this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sello Martin Blase Mohlaloka , Lynette Jacobs and Nita Corene De Wet.Perspectives in Education - Insights from traditional initiation teachers (Basuwe) on the influence of male traditional initiation (lebollo) on the behaviour of schoolboys. https://dx.doi.org/10.18820/2519593X/pie.v34i2.2 Accessed 4 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age and Time==
The age of initiation has changed as initiators did not initiate school learners in the past, or any child under the age of 24 years. Males who were over the age of 24 were referred to as ‘Batlankana’ as they had passed their adolescent stage and were ready to uphold their family social responsibilities as per customs and traditions. Currently, most of the initiates from the Free State and Lesotho attend initiation between the ages of 12 and 15 with only a few initiated above the age of 15. The boys usually attend the initiation school during the holiday break between primary school and high school. Changes to the age of initiates is influenced by migration patterns of adult males leaving their homestead to work in cities or mines, and South African laws  which require children to attend school. Generally speaking, an initiation school is open to young pubescent males, but in some cases adults, married or unmarried, with or without children, can also attend such a school in cases where the particular individual could not attend such a school while still young.

==Phases of Lebollo==
The initiate practice can be classified into 3 stages namely the Separation Stage, the Transitional Stage and the Incorporation Stage. The Psychosocial Theory by [[Erik Erikson]] provides a basic tool of analysis to examine the phases of initiation for the basotho boys.

===The Separation Stage===
During the Separation Stage,  the boys are separated from all social activities and kept in a secluded place where their transition from adolescence into adulthood or from boyhood into manhood takes place.
[[File:Initiation house.jpg|thumb|right|This small house is used by the boys to sleep in during their time in initiation school]]

===The Transitional Stage===
During the Transitional Stage the initiates are educated on the social concepts of their identities. After the physical circumcision, the boys’ open wound is dressed with a special plant which aids healing. For about 8 days after the [[surgical]] procedure, a traditional nurse or “ikhankatha” provides nursing care and performs daily dressing of wounds and takes care of the young men. Traditional bandages are used for dressing the wounds of the initiates. The initiates are housed in lodges called “mophato”.

The initiates rise early each day to perform a variety of tasks, and thereafter undergo a harsh physical regimen. Skills, such as warfare and cattle-raiding are taught and improved. Initiates are also taught to compose praises and songs to their chiefs and to themselves, the proper expression or articulation of which constitutes the important adult (male) quality of eloquence or “bokheleke. The initiates are tutored on the knowledge of family life, including sexuality which is dealt with extensively. The texts of [[praise poems]] (lithoko) refer to a wide range of phenomena, including historical occurrences where former basotho chiefs featured, and significant experiences in the life of the initiates. Initiates often receive beatings when they fail to grasp these skills with ease.

After completion of the training period, the initiates leave all their clothing behind in the lodge, which is then set alight by the instructors. The young men then run ahead without looking back at their childhood, which has symbolically ended with the burning of the lodge.
The initiates arrive at their villages smeared with red ochre and covered in their traditional basotho blankets while surrounded by men and elders, where they are given a new set of clothes. A large feast commences shortly thereafter and each new initiate is given an opportunity to verbalise his own self-composed praise.

===The Incorporation Stage===
The Incorporation Stage occurs when the newly initiated Basotho men are incorporated into society. They are given new names, which are selected for each individual and confirms the 'man’s existence,' as well as blankets to wear as a proof that they have reached the manhood stage. Sometimes the names given after initiation become more popular than the names given at birth. One well known example of this is that of Lepoqo, who later became Letlama after initiation and later still [[Moshoeshoe I|Moshoeshoe]], the founder of the South Sotho nation.

Initiates are then allowed to participate in social and economic activities. It is considered taboo for newly initiated men to share details of Lebollo with females and males who have not been to initiation school. Men who are working, married and initiated see those that are not circumcised, as inferior. The un-initiated are often ridiculed for not practicing their cultures, and are sometimes seen as “weak” men.

==Effects on behavior==
There are varying opinions on whether traditional initiation schools make a positive or negative contribution to the behaviour of initiated basotho boys and men. Proponents of ''lebolla'' believe that ''lebolla'' produces good moral values in boys and men and contributes to society by creating responsible law abiding citizens.  The newly initiated, who are seen as 'men' by the larger traditional society, are still seen as ''boys'' by the formal education system which means that the 'manhood status' granted by the ritual is situational.

Opponents of the initiation schools believe that ''lebolla'' has little effect to the actions and behaviour of the initiated boys and men. Many formal school teachers struggle to deal with boys returning from initiation schools due to deviant behaviour such as a refusal to participate in class, acting with disdain towards female teachers and uninitiated male teachers as well as involvement in gangster activities.

The traditional responsibilities after initiation include taking care of their fathers’ homesteads, working hard to support themselves and their families, upholding their clan name and being present at all family and ritual ceremony gatherings. Additionally the initiate is expected to be brave, prove to be a responsible male adult, respect other people, have self-respect and self-disciple and be independent, as well as law abiding. However, the responsibilities of an initiate have changed throughout time to meet modern societal needs including not abusing alcohol, avoiding imprisonment or criminal activities, avoiding multiple sexual partners, avoiding contracting [[HIV]]/AIDS and attaining an education in order to become a financial provider. Privileges after initiation include receiving respect from women and those who have not yet attended initiation schools, sitting and eating with initiated men during [[rituals]] and [[ceremonies]], as well as gaining general respect from all members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Ntsofa Clasper Monyela.THE EXPERIENCES OF NEWLY INITIATED BASOTHO MEN IN SELECTED BOTSHABELO HIGH SCHOOLS, FREE-STATE PROVINCE. full-dissertation for Masters Degree.

==Complications==
According to the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities in South Africa, approximately 251 male youths died between 2014 and 2016 while attending  initiation schools throughout South Africa. During a period of 36 weeks between 2014 and 2016 about 10 deaths occurred due to complications of traditional circumcision.  There was a  total of 22 documented deaths related to circumcision between June 2012 to January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;N K Momoti, Law and culture in the new constitutional dispensation with reference to the custom of circumcision as practiced in the Eastern Cape (MA Thesis, Rhodes University, 2004), p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications arise in the traditional initiation schools when the traditional surgeons use blunt and unsterilized instruments which causes infection and sepsis. Further negative effects occur when the physical punishment for lapses, such as forgetting the words of a chant, becomes so severe that they result in some initiates being beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;V.Abraham.

==Laws==
The National House of Traditional Leaders, which has national authority over traditional initiations in South Africa, believes that it would be better able to control initiation rites if it was given real power to make laws. The traditional leaders of the national house rejected a proposal by the government suggesting boys being circumcised in hospitals instead of ‘the bush’. The House argued that the attendance of an initiation school is not only about the physical removal of the foreskin, but also about the promotion of cultural activities, although they acknowledge that beating the initiates is not a cultural activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.enca.com/south-africa/the-act-and-a-national-policy-in-development Accessed 11 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Traditional leaders accept that no initiation schools should run concurrently with academic schools. The Free State Initiation Schools Health Act of 2004 was promulgated with the specific purpose to provide for the adherence to health standards in traditional initiation schools as well as to provide for the granting of permission for the performance of circumcision operations. The act also makes provisions for the approval process by which initiation schools are to be established.&lt;ref&gt;Chitja Twala.

[[Stuttering]] (''alalia syllabaris''), also known as stammering (''alalia literalis'' or ''anarthria literalis''), is a [[speech disorder]] in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD-10 F95.8 – Stuttering|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf90.htm+f985|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact [[etiology]] of stuttering is unknown; both [[genetics]] and [[neurophysiology]] are thought to contribute.&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278–281 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many treatments and [[speech-language pathology]] techniques available that may help increase [[fluency]] in some stutterers to the point where an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prasse|first1=Jane E.|last2=Kikano|first2=George E. |title=Stuttering: An Overview |journal=American Family Physician|volume=77|issue=9|pages=1271–1276 |year=2008|ref=harv}} Retrieved from Academic Research Library database, (Document ID: 1468009541).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAw87&gt;{{cite web|title=Therapy Outcomes|url=http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.aspx?tabid=87|publisher=Stuttering Foundation|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Life9enero.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Life'' magazine (1/24/1964).]]
'''Martyrs' Day''' ({{lang-es|Día de los Mártires}}) is a [[Panama]]nian day of national mourning which commemorates the January 9, 1964 [[anti-American]] riots over [[sovereignty]] of the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. The riot started after a [[Flag of Panama|Panamanian flag]] was torn and Panamanian students were killed during a conflict with Canal Zone Police officers and Canal Zone residents. It is also known as the '''Flag Incident''' or '''Flag Protests'''.

U.S. Army units became involved in suppressing the violence after Canal Zone police were overwhelmed, and after three days of fighting, about 22 Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers were killed. The incident is considered to be a significant factor in the U.S. decision to transfer control of the Canal Zone to Panama through the 1977 [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]].

==Background==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
After [[Panama]] gained independence from [[Colombia]] in 1903, with the assistance of the U.S., there was resentment amongst some Panamanians as a result of the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]], which ceded control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to the U.S. "in perpetuity" in exchange for a 10 million dollar initial payment and yearly 250 thousand dollar payments thereafter.  In addition, the United States Government purchased title to all the lands in the Canal Zone from the private owners.  The Canal Zone, primarily consisting of the [[Panama Canal]], was a strip of land running from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean and had its own police, schools, ports and post offices.  The Canal Zone became U.S. territory ([[de facto]] if not [[de jure]]).

In January 1963, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] agreed to fly Panama's flag alongside the U.S. flag at all non-military sites in the Canal Zone where the U.S. flag was flown. However, Kennedy was assassinated before his orders were carried out. One month after Kennedy's death, [[Governor of Panama Canal Zone|Panama Canal Zone Governor]] [[Robert John Fleming|Robert J. Fleming, Jr.]] issued a decree limiting Kennedy's order. The U.S. flag would no longer be flown outside Canal Zone schools, police stations, post offices or other civilian locations where it had been flown, but Panama's flag would not be flown either. The governor's order infuriated many [[Zonian]]s, who interpreted it as a U.S. renunciation of sovereignty over the Canal Zone.&lt;ref name="blythe.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060206021144/http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/99ca/Panama_Canal_Zone%3A_Beginning_of_the_End-part1_] &lt;/ref&gt;

In response, outraged Zonians began flying the U.S. flag anywhere they could. After the first U.S. flag to be raised at [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High School]] (a public high school in the Canal Zone) was taken down by school officials, the students walked out of class, raised another flag, and posted guards to prevent its removal. Most Zonian adults sympathized with the student demonstrators.

In what was to prove a miscalculation of the volatility of the situation, Governor Fleming departed for a meeting in Washington, D.C. on the afternoon of January 9, 1964. For him and many others, the U.S.-Panama relationship was at its peak. The exploding situation caught up with the Governor while he was still en route to the U.S. over the Caribbean.

==The Flag Pole Incident==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
While a Panamanian response to the flag raisings by the Zonians was expected, the crisis took most Americans by surprise. Several years later, Lyndon B. Johnson wrote in his memoirs that: "When I heard about the students' action, I was certain we were in for trouble."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The news of the actions of the [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High School]] reached the students at the Instituto Nacional, Panama's top public high school. Led by 17-year-old Guillermo Guevara Paz, 150 to 200 demonstrating students from the institute, crossed the street into the Canal Zone and marched through the neighborhoods to Balboa High School, carrying their school's Panamanian flag and a sign proclaiming their country's sovereignty over the U.S. Canal Zone. They had first informed their school principal and the Canal Zone authorities of their plans before setting out on their march. Their intention was to raise the Panamanian flag on the Balboa High School flagpole and remove the U.S. flag.&lt;ref name="blythe.org"/&gt;

At [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High]], the Panamanian students were met by Canal Zone police and a crowd of Zonian students and adults. After negotiations between the Panamanian students and the police, a small group was allowed to approach the flagpole, while police kept the main group back.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A half-dozen Panamanian students, carrying their flag, approached the flagpole. In response, the Zonians surrounded the flagpole, sang the ''Star Spangled Banner'', and rejected the deal between the police and the Panamanian students. Scuffling broke out. The Panamanians were driven back by the Zonian civilians and police. In the course of the scuffle, Panama's flag was torn.

The flag in question had historical significance. In 1947, students from the Instituto Nacional had carried it in demonstrations opposing the Filos-Hines Treaty and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases. Independent investigators of the events of January 9, 1964 later noted that the flag was made of flimsy [[silk]], this is not historical fact though.&lt;ref name="blythe.org"/&gt;

There are conflicting claims about how the flag was torn. Canal Zone Police Captain Gaddis Wall, who was in charge of the police at the scene, denies any American culpability. He claims that the Panamanian students stumbled and accidentally tore their own flag. David M. White, an apprentice telephone technician with the Panama Canal Company, stated that "the police gripped the students, who were four or five abreast, under the shoulders in the armpits and edged them forward. One of the students fell or tripped and I believe when he went down the old flag was torn." However we must take into account that this is all hearsay.

One of the Panamanian flag bearers, Eligio Carranza, said that "they started shoving us and trying to wrest the flag from us, all the while insulting us. A policeman wielded his club which ripped our flag. The captain tried to take us where the others Panamanian students were. On the way through the mob,  pulled and tore our flag."

To this day, the issue remains highly contentious, with both sides saying the other instigated the conflict.

==Violence breaks out==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}

As word of the [[flag desecration]] incident spread, angry Panamanian crowds formed along and across the border between [[Panama City]] and the Canal Zone. At several points demonstrators stormed into the zone, planting Panamanian flags. Canal Zone police tear gassed them. Rocks were thrown, causing injuries to several of the police officers. The police responded by opening fire.

Canal Zone authorities asked the Guardia Nacional (Panama's Armed Forces) to suppress the disturbances. The Guardia stayed absent.
Meanwhile, demonstrators began to tear down the "[[Panama Canal fence|Fence of Shame]]" located in the Canal Zone, a safety feature alongside a busy highway. Panamanians were tear gassed, and then several were shot.  One of the most famous photographs of what Panamanians know as Martyrs' Day shows two demonstrators, one bearing a Panamanian flag, climbing over Fence of Shame at Ancon. The opinion of most Panamanians, and most Latin Americans generally, about the fence in question was expressed a few days later by [[Colombia]]'s ambassador to the [[Organization of American States]]: "In Panama there exists today another [[Berlin Wall]]."

The Panamanian crowds grew as nightfall came, and by 8 p.m. the Canal Zone Police Department was overwhelmed. Some 80 to 85 police faced a hostile crowd of at least 5,000, and estimated by some sources to be 30,000 or more, all along and across the border between Panama City and the Canal Zone. When the lieutenant governor came to survey the scene, the protestors stoned his car.

At the request of Lieutenant Governor Parkers, General [[Andrew P. O'Meara]], commander of the [[U.S. Southern Command]], assumed authority over the Canal Zone. The U.S. Army's [[193rd Infantry Brigade (United States)|193rd Infantry Brigade]] was deployed at about 8:35&amp;nbsp;p.m.

American-owned businesses in Panama City were set afire. The recently dedicated [[Pan American Airlines|Pan Am]] building (which, despite housing an American corporation, was Panamanian-owned) was completely gutted. The next morning, the bodies of six Panamanians were found in the wreckage.

Some reporters alleged one giant communist plot, with Christian Democrats, Socialists, student government leaders and a host of others controlled by the hand of Fidel Castro. However, it seems that Panama's communists were caught by surprise by the outbreak of violence and commanded the allegiance of only a small minority of those who rioted on the Day of the Martyrs. A good indication of the relative communist strength came two weeks after the confrontations, when the Catholic Church sponsored a memorial rally for the fallen, which was attended by some 40,000 people. A rival communist commemoration on the same day drew only 300 participants.

The United States Embassy was ordered to burn all sensitive documents.  A number of U.S. citizen residents of Panama City, particularly military personnel and their families who were unable to get housing on base, were forced to flee their homes. There were many instances in which Panamanians gave refuge to Americans who were endangered in Panama City and elsewhere. 
 
The confrontation was not contained in the Panama City area. Word of the fighting quickly spread all over Panama by radio, television and private telephone calls. The incomplete censorship had the side effect of contributing to wild rumors on all sides. One popular but inaccurate Zonian rumor, fueled in part by references to the "American Canal Zone" in U.S. news media, that the Panama Canal Zone had been renamed "United States Canal Zone" and would henceforth be an outright possession of the United States.

News and rumor instantly traveled the 49 miles from Panama's south coast to its north coast. The country's second city, [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], which abuts the city of Cristóbal, then part of the Canal Zone, erupted within a few hours after the start of hostilities on the Pacific side. Intense fighting continued for the next two days. 
Unlike in Panama City, Panamanian authorities in Colón had made early attempts to separate the combatants. Some incidents also happened in other cities all over Panama.

==Death toll==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
As the angry Panamanian mob turned their wrath against targets in Panama City, a number of people were shot to death under controversial circumstances.  The final death toll was 28 people.

[[Ascanio Arosemena]], a 19-year-old student, was shot from behind, through the shoulder and thorax. He became the first of Panama's "martyrs," as those who fell on January 9, 1964, and the following few days were to become known. Witnesses say that Arosemena died while helping to evacuate wounded protesters from the danger zone. The witnesses appear to be corroborated by a photograph of Arosemena supporting an injured man, said to have been taken shortly before he was shot.  The building where it all started, the former Balboa High School today bears his name, and is one of the buildings of the [[Panama Canal Authority]], the Panamanian Government Agency created to run the Canal starting from mid-day December 31, 1999.

A six-month-old girl, Maritza Ávila Alabarca, died with respiratory problems while her neighborhood was gassed by the U.S. Army with [[CS gas|CS tear gas]].  The U.S. denied that the infant's death was linked to the use of CS tear gas, in keeping with its claim that it is not a lethal agent.

Various U.S. accounts claim that all Panamanians who were shot to death were either rioters or else shot by other Panamanians.

Various Panamanian versions blame all Panamanian deaths on U.S. forces, though those who died in the Pan American Airlines building fire can not reasonably be said to have died at the hands of American forces. Some Panamanians may have been hit by bullets fired by Panamanians but intended for American targets. A definitive accounting of all deaths in the events of January 1964 has yet to be published, and may never be published.

The official Canal Zone Police version is that the police did not shoot directly at anybody, but only fired over the heads or at the feet of rioters. The police version was disputed by independent investigators, who found that the police fired directly into the crowds and killed Arosemena and a number of other Panamanians. DENI ballistics experts claim that six Panamanians were killed by .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson police revolvers fired by the Canal Zone Police.

The list of Panama's martyrs can be found at the martyrs Memorial in the former Balboa High School in Panama City. The 21 as listed there include: Maritza Ávila Alabarca, Ascanio Arosemena, Rodolfo Sánchez Benítez, Luis Bonilla, Alberto Constance, Gonzalo Crance,  Teofilo De La Torre,  José Del Cid, Victor Garibaldo, José Gil, Ezequiel González, Victor Iglesias, Rosa Landecho, Carlos Lara, Gustavo Lara, Ricardo Murgas, Estanislao Orobio, Jacinto Palacios, Ovidio Saldaña, Alberto Tejada and Celestino Villarreta.

Most U.S. accounts put the number of Americans killed in these events at four, though others put the death toll at three or five. Those who died on the American side include Staff Sergeant Luis Jimenez Cruz, Private David Haupt and First Sergeant Gerald  Aubin who were all killed by sniper fire on the 9th and 10th in Colon and Specialist Michael W. Rowland, whose death was caused by an accidental fall into a ravine on the evening of the 10th. Another 30 U.S. military personnel were wounded in operations to separate the Panamanian and Canal Zone protesters. Most of the 17 injuries suffered by U.S. civilians resulted from thrown rocks or bottles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311004357/http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/99ca/Panama_Canal_Zone%3A_Beginning_of_the_End-part_2] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_01/opinion_01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126150849/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_01/opinion_01.html |archivedate=2007-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fighting was over, DENI investigators found over 600 bullets embedded in the [[Legislative Assembly of Panama|Legislative Palace]]. [[Hospital Santo Tomas|Santo Tomas Hospital]] reported that it had treated 324 injuries and recorded 18 deaths from the fighting. Panama City's Social Security Hospital treated at least 16 others who were wounded on the first night of the fighting. Most of those killed and wounded had suffered gunshot wounds. Some of the more seriously injured were left with severe permanent brain damage or paralyzing spinal injuries from their bullet wounds.

After the fighting, American investigators found over 400 bullets embedded in the Tivoli Hotel. Years after the events of January 1964, a number of U.S. Army historical documents were declassified, including Southcom's figures for ammunition expended. The official account has it that the U.S. Army fired 450 .30 caliber rifle rounds, five .45 caliber pistol bullets, 953 shells of birdshot and 7,193 grenades or projectiles containing tear gas. Also, the army claims to have used 340 pounds of bulk CN-1 chemical (weak tear gas) and 120 pounds of CS-1 chemical (strong tear gas). The same account said that the Canal Zone police fired 1,850 .38 caliber pistol bullets and 600 shotgun shells in the fighting, while using only 132 tear gas grenades.  According to the Panamanian DENI, out of the 1,850 .38 caliber bullets that the Canal Zone Police allegedly fired directly into the crowd, only six Panamanians were fatally wounded. Of the remaining 2,008 bullets, shells and rounds, the 7,193 tear gas grenades or projectiles, the additional 460 pounds of tear gas, only 15 Panamanians were fatally wounded.

==International reactions and aftermath==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
International reaction was largely unfavorable against the United States. The British and French, who had been criticized by U.S. administrations for their colonial policies, accused the U.S. of hypocrisy and argued that their Zonian citizens were as obnoxious as any other group of colonial settlers.

[[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdul Nasser|Nasser]] suggested that Panama nationalize the Panama Canal as they had nationalized the [[Suez Canal]]. The People's Republic of China, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] denounced the U.S. in very strong terms. From the other end of the ideological spectrum, Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]]'s right-wing Falangist Party accused the United States of aggression against Panama, contradicting the fact that the U.S. aggressors had not entered into the Republic of Panama, but rather the inverse had happened.

Significantly, other governments in the western hemisphere which had long backed U.S. policies declined to back the American position. [[Venezuela]] led a chorus of Latin American criticism of the United States. The [[Organization of American States]], on [[Brazil]]'s motion, took jurisdiction over the dispute from the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The OAS in turn put the matter before its Inter-American Peace Committee. The committee held a week-long investigation in [[Panama]] which was greeted by a unanimous 15-minute Panamanian work stoppage to demonstrate Panama's united opinion. No action was taken on Panama's motion to brand the United States guilty of aggression, but the committee did accuse the Americans of using unnecessary force.

The President of Panama at the time, [[Roberto Francisco Chiari Remón|Roberto Chiari]], broke diplomatic relations with the United States on January 10.  On January 15, President Chiari declared that Panama would not re-establish diplomatic ties with the U.S. until it agreed to open negotiations on a new treaty. The first steps in that direction were taken shortly thereafter on April 3, 1964, when both countries agreed to an immediate resumption of diplomatic relations and the United States agreed to adopt procedures for the "elimination of the causes of conflict between the two countries". A few weeks later, [[Robert B. Anderson]], President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s special representative, flew to [[Panama]] to pave the way for future talks.  For these actions [[Roberto Francisco Chiari Remón|President Chiari]]  is regarded as "the president of dignity".  The role played by the Panamanian ambassador to the UN, Miguel Moreno is also worth mentioning.  Mr. Moreno is remembered for his strong speech against the United States at the UN General Assembly.

This incident is considered to be the catalyst for the eventual U.S. abolition of the "in perpetuity" control of the Canal Zone and divestiture of its title to property there, with the 1977 signing of the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]], which dissolved the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] in 1979, set a timetable for the closing of U.S. Armed Forces Bases and transferred full control of the [[Panama Canal]] to the Panamanian Government at noon, December 31, 1999.

==Monuments==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
Two monuments have been built in [[Panama City]] to commemorate these events.  One was built where the flagpole incident happened, the former Balboa High School, today a [[Panama Canal Authority]] building that bears the name of Ascanio Arosemena, known as the first "martyr" and maybe the most famous one.  It was built by the Panama Canal Authority and consists on a covered entryway containing the memorial, which has a name of a "martyr" on each column, and an eternal fire (not unlike the eternal fire for U.S. President John F. Kennedy) in the middle, and the Panamanian flag afterwards, in a sort of open-to-the-sky (i.e. no roof) "square", on a flagpole.

Another monument, built in front of the Legislative Assembly, on the former Panama City-Canal Zone limits consists on a life-sized monument in the form of a lamppost, with three figures climbing it to raise their flag. The monument reflects the photograph that was on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', in which three students scaled the 12 foot high safety fence and climbed a lamppost and the one in the top had a Panamanian flag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704044344/http://ediciones.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2004/01/09/hoy/pdf/Portada.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Mastitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[breast]] or [[udder]], usually associated with [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=Ob2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berens PD | title = Breast Pain: Engorgement, Nipple Pain, and Mastitis | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 902–14 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26512442 | doi = 10.1097/GRF.0000000000000153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = The Worldwatch Institute |title=State of the World 2006: Special Focus: China and India|date=2015|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610916332|page=36|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=24TCBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Stephen D.|title=Family Medicine Obstetrics|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323043062|page=634|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oHkHP3JLArIC&amp;pg=PA634|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms typically include local pain and redness.&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; There is often an associated [[fever]] and general soreness.&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; Onset is typically fairly rapid and usually occurs within the first few months of delivery.&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; Complications can include [[abscess]] formation.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Risk factors include poor [[latch (breastfeeding)|latch]], [[cracked nipples]], use of a [[breast pump]], and [[weaning]].&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; The bacteria most commonly involved are [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococci]].&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt; [[Ultrasound]] may be useful for detecting a potential abscess.&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention, treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Prevention is by frequently and properly breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt; When infection is present, [[antibiotics]] such as [[cephalexin]] may be recommended.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt; Breastfeeding should typically be continued, as emptying the breast is important for healing.&lt;ref name=AFP2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; Tentative evidence supports benefits from [[probiotics]].&lt;ref name=Ob2016/&gt; About 10% of breastfeeding women are affected.&lt;ref name=AFP2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer JP | title = Management of mastitis in breastfeeding women | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 727–31 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18819238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Lactation mastitis usually affects only one breast and the symptoms can develop quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mastitis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx| title=Symptoms of mastitis|access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signs and symptoms usually appear suddenly and they include:
* [[Breast tenderness]] or warmth to the touch
* General malaise or feeling ill
* [[Swelling (medical)|Swelling]] of the breast
* [[Pain]] or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding
* Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern
* [[Fever]] of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mastitis/DS00678/DSECTION=symptoms|title=Symptoms|access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The affected breast can then start to appear lumpy and red.
Some women may also experience [[Influenza|flu]]-like symptoms such as:
* [[Pain|Aches]]
* [[Shivering]] and [[chills]]
* Feeling [[anxious]] or stressed
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/breast_infection/page3_em.htm#Breast%20Infection%20Symptoms| title=Breast Infection Symptoms|access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact should be made with a health care provider with special breastfeeding competence as soon as the patient recognizes the combination of signs and symptoms. Most of the women first experience the flu-like symptoms and just after they may notice a sore red area on the breast. Also, women should seek medical care if they notice any abnormal discharge from the [[nipples]], if  breast pain is making it difficult to function each day, or they have prolonged, unexplained breast pain.

===Breast abscess===
A breast [[abscess]] is a collection of [[pus]] that develops into the breast with different causes.&lt;ref name="Segura15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Segura-Sampedro JJ, Jiménez-Rodríguez R, Camacho-Marente V, Pareja-Ciuró F, Padillo-Ruiz J | title = Breast abscess and sepsis arising from oral infection | journal = Cirugia Espanola | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 308–9 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26148851 | doi = 10.1016/j.ciresp.2015.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During lactation, breast abscess develops only rarely, most sources cite about 0.4–0.5% of breastfeeding women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michie C, Lockie F, Lynn W | title = The challenge of mastitis | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 88 | issue = 9 | pages = 818–21 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12937109 | pmc = 1719627 | doi = 10.1136/adc.88.9.818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known risk factors are age over 30, primiparous and late delivery. No correlation was found with smoking status however this may be in part because much fewer smoking women choose to breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cusack L, Brennan M | title = Lactational mastitis and breast abscess - diagnosis and management in general practice | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 976–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22146325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics were not shown effective in prevention of lactation abscess but are useful to treat a secondary infection (see the section on the [[#Breast abscess 2|treatment of breast abscess]] in this article).

Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts may play a similar{{clarify|date=October 2014}} role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal [[subareolar abscess]].

==Causes==
Since the 1980s mastitis has often been divided into non-infectious and infectious sub-groups. However, recent research &lt;ref name="pmid18394188"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kvist LJ, Larsson BW, Hall-Lord ML, Steen A, Schalén C | title = The role of bacteria in lactational mastitis and some considerations of the use of antibiotic treatment | journal = International Breastfeeding Journal | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18394188 | pmc = 2322959 | doi = 10.1186/1746-4358-3-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that it may not be feasible to make divisions in this way. It has been shown that types and amounts of potentially pathogenic bacteria in breast milk are not correlated to the severity of symptoms. Moreover, although only 15% of women with mastitis in Kvist et al.'s study were given antibiotics, all recovered and few had recurring symptoms. Many healthy breastfeeding women wishing to donate breast milk have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their milk but have no symptoms of mastitis.

===Risk factors===
Mastitis typically develops when the [[milk]] is not properly removed from the breast. Milk stasis can lead to the milk ducts in the breasts becoming blocked, as the breast milk is not being properly and regularly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mastitis/Pages/Causes.aspx| title=Non-infectious mastitis and milk stasis |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that blocked milk ducts can occur as a result of pressure on the breast, such as tight-fitting [[clothing]] or an over-restrictive bra, although there is sparse evidence for this supposition.
Mastitis may  occur when the baby is not appropriately attached to the breast while feeding, when the baby has infrequent feeds or has problems suckling the milk out of the breast.

The presence of cracks or sores on the nipples increases the likelihood of infection. Tight clothing or ill-fitting bras may also cause problems as they compress the breasts.  There is a possibility that infants carrying infectious pathogens in their noses can infect their mothers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amir LH, Garland SM, Lumley J | title = A case-control study of mastitis: nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus | journal = BMC Family Practice | volume = 7 | pages = 57 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17032458 | pmc = 1630426 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2296-7-57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the clinical significance of this finding is still unknown.

Mastitis, as well as breast abscess, can also be caused by direct [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the breast. Such injury can occur for example during sports activities&lt;ref name="PatelGreydanus2010"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Dilip R. | last1 = Patel | first2 = Donald E. | last2 = Greydanus | name-list-format = vanc |title=Adolescents and Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUri6XR1fk0C&amp;pg=PA711|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1-4377-2006-4|pages=711}}&lt;/ref&gt; or due to [[seat belt]] injury.

Mastitis can also develop due to contamination of a breast implant or any other foreign body, for example after nipple [[piercing]]. In such cases, the removal of the foreign body is indicated.&lt;ref name="bmj-best-practice-2014-09-05"&gt;[http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1084/treatment/step-by-step.html Mastitis and breast abscess], [[BMJ]] Best Practice (last updated 5 September 2014) (subscription-limited access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who are breastfeeding are at risk for developing mastitis especially if they have sore or [[cracked nipple]]s or have had mastitis before while breastfeeding another baby. Also, the chances of getting mastitis increases if women use only one position to breastfeed or wear a tight-fitting bra, which may restrict milk flow &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mastitis/DS00678/DSECTION=risk-factors |title=Risk factors |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in getting a nursing infant to [[latch (breastfeeding)|latch on]] to the breast can also increase the risk for mastitis.&lt;ref name = whgov2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/common-questions-about-breastfeeding-pain.html|title=Common questions about breastfeeding and pain | publisher = womenshealth.gov|access-date=4 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with [[diabetes]], [[chronic illness]], [[AIDS]], or an impaired immune system may be more susceptible to the development of mastitis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Infection===
Some women (approximately 15%)&lt;ref name="pmid18394188" /&gt; will require antibiotic treatment for infection which is usually caused by bacteria from the [[skin]] or the baby's [[mouth]] that entering the milk ducts through skin lesions of the nipple or through the opening of the nipple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breastfeedingmastitis.com/| title=Breastfeeding Mastitis Causes and Symptoms |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection is usually caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/breast_infection/page5_em.htm#Exams%20and%20Tests| title=Exams and Tests |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious pathogens commonly associated with mastitis are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'' spp., and [[Gram-negative]] bacilli such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.

Recent research suggests that infectious pathogens play a much smaller role in the pathogenesis than was commonly assumed only a few years ago. Most detected pathogens are very common species that are natural part of the breast fauna and simple detection of their presence is not sufficient to prove a causative role. Furthermore, there are indications that treatment with antibiotics may have minimal impact,&lt;ref name="Peters15112132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters J | title = [Mastitis puerperalis - causes and therapy] | language = German | journal = Zentralblatt Fur Gynakologie | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–6 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15112132 | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-44880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbosa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbosa-Cesnik C, Schwartz K, Foxman B | title = Lactation mastitis | journal = Jama | volume = 289 | issue = 13 | pages = 1609–12 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12672715 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.13.1609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over-all there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for treating lactational mastitis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013480/ Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women].

==Types==
When it occurs in breastfeeding mothers, it is known as puerperal mastitis, lactation mastitis, or lactational mastitis. When it occurs in non breastfeeding women it is known as non-puerperal or nonlactational. Mastitis can, in rare cases, occur in men. [[Inflammatory breast cancer]] has symptoms very similar to mastitis and must be ruled out.

The symptoms are similar for puerperal and nonpuerperal mastitis but predisposing factors and treatment can be very different.

===Pregnancy related===

[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 115254 1204420 cr.png|thumb|An ultrasound image of puerperal mastitis]]

Puerperal mastitis is the inflammation of the breast in connection with pregnancy, [[breastfeeding]] or weaning. Since one of the most prominent symptoms is tension and engorgement of the breast, it is thought to be caused by blocked [[Lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] or milk excess. It is relatively common; estimates range depending on methodology between 5–33%. However, only about 0.4–0.5% of breastfeeding mothers develop an abscess.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some predisposing factors are known but their predictive value is minimal. It appears that proper breastfeeding technique, frequent breastfeeding and avoidance of stress are the most important factors that can be influenced.

Light cases of mastitis are often called [[breast engorgement]]; the distinction is overlapping and possibly arbitrary or subject to regional variations.

===Non pregnancy related===
{{Main|Nonpuerperal mastitis}}
The term nonpuerperal mastitis describes inflammatory lesions of the breast occurring unrelated to pregnancy and breastfeeding. This article includes description of mastitis as well as various kinds of mammary abscesses. Skin related conditions like dermatitis and foliculitis are a separate entity.

Names for non-puerperal mastitis are not used very consistently and include mastitis, subareolar abscess, duct ectasia, periductal inflammation, [[Zuska's disease]] and others.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of mastitis and breast abscess can usually be made based on a [[physical examination]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The doctor will also take into account the signs and symptoms of the condition.

However, if the doctor is not sure whether the mass is an abscess or a [[tumor]], a [[breast ultrasound]] may be performed. The ultrasound provides a clear image of the breast tissue and may be helpful in distinguishing between simple mastitis and abscess or in diagnosing an abscess deep in the breast. The test consists of placing an ultrasound probe over the breast.

In cases of infectious mastitis, cultures may be needed in order to determine what type of organism is causing the infection. Cultures are helpful in deciding the specific type of [[antibiotics]] that will be used in curing the disease. These cultures may be taken either from the breast milk or of the material aspirated from an abscess.

[[Mammograms]] or [[Breast biopsy|breast biopsies]] are normally performed on women who do not respond to treatment or on non-breastfeeding women. This type of tests is sometimes ordered to exclude the possibility of a rare type of breast cancer which causes symptoms similar to those of mastitis.

===Differential diagnosis===
Breast cancer may coincide with or mimic symptoms of mastitis. Only full resolution of symptoms and careful examination are sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of breast cancer.

Lifetime risk for [[breast cancer]] is significantly reduced for women who were pregnant and breastfeeding. Mastitis episodes do not appear to influence lifetime risk of breast cancer.

Mastitis does however cause great difficulties in diagnosis of breast cancer and delayed diagnosis and treatment can result in worse outcome.

Breast cancer may coincide with mastitis or develop shortly afterwards. All suspicious symptoms that do not completely disappear within 5 weeks must be investigated.

Breast cancer incidence during pregnancy and lactation is assumed to be the same as in controls. Course and prognosis are also very similar to age matched controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Middleton LP, Amin M, Gwyn K, Theriault R, Sahin A | title = Breast carcinoma in pregnant women: assessment of clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features | journal = Cancer | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1055–60 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12942575 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.11614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10888783"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shousha S | title = Breast carcinoma presenting during or shortly after pregnancy and lactation | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 124 | issue = 7 | pages = 1053–60 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10888783 | doi = 10.1043/0003-9985(2000)124&lt;1053:BCPDOS&gt;2.0.CO;2 | doi-broken-date = 2018-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However diagnosis during lactation is particularly problematic, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Some data suggest that noninflammatory breast cancer incidence is increased within a year following episodes of nonpuerperal mastitis and special care is required for follow-up cancer prevention screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters F, Kiesslich A, Pahnke V | title = Coincidence of nonpuerperal mastitis and noninflammatory breast cancer | journal = European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–63 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12270566 | doi = 10.1016/S0301-2115(02)00109-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far only data from short term observation is available and total risk increase can not be judged. Because of the very short time between presentation of mastitis and breast cancer in this study it is considered very unlikely that the inflammation had any substantial role in carcinogenesis, rather it would appear that some precancerous lesions may increase the risk of inflammation ([[hyperplasia]] causing duct obstruction, hypersensitivity to cytokines or hormones) or the lesions may have common predisposing factors.

A very serious type of breast cancer called [[inflammatory breast cancer]] presents with similar symptoms as mastitis (both puerperal and nonpuerperal). It is the most aggressive type of breast cancer with the highest mortality rate. The inflammatory [[phenotype]] of IBC is thought to be mostly caused by invasion and blocking of dermal lymphatics, however it was recently shown that [[NF-κB]] target genes activation may significantly contribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Case reports show that inflammatory breast cancer symptoms can flare up following injury or inflammation making it even more likely to be mistaken for mastitis. Symptoms are also known to partially respond to progesterone and antibiotics, reaction to other common medications can not be ruled out at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kusama M, Koyanagi Y, Sekine M, Serizawa H, Ebihara Y, Hirota T, Nakamura Y, Matsunaga T | title = [A case of inflammatory breast cancer successfully treated with 5'-DFUR and MPA] | language = Japanese | journal = Gan to Kagaku Ryoho.

==Treatment==

In lactation mastitis, frequent emptying of both breasts by breastfeeding is essential. Also essential is adequate fluid supply for the mother and baby. 

For breastfeeding women with light mastitis, massage and application of heat prior to feeding can help as this may aid unblocking the ducts. However, in more severe cases of mastitis heat or massage could make the symptoms worse and cold compresses are better suited to contain the inflammation.

Nonpuerperal mastitis is treated by medication and possibly aspiration or drainage (see in particular [[Subareolar abscess#Treatment|treatment of subareolar abscess]] and [[Granulomatous mastitis#Treatment|treatment of granulomatous mastitis]]). According to a [[BMJ]] best practice report, antibiotics are generally to be used in all nonpuerperal mastitis cases, with replacement of the antibiotics by an antifungal agent such as [[fluconazole]] in cases of deep fungal infections, and corticosteroids are to be used in case of granulomatous mastitis (with differential diagnosis to tuberculosis infection of the breast).&lt;ref name="bmj-best-practice-2014-09-05"/&gt;

===Antibiotics===
In lactation mastitis, [[antibiotics]] are not needed in the overwhelming majority of cases and should be used only for bacterial infections.&lt;ref name="Peters15112132"/&gt; [[Dicloxacillin]] or [[cephalexin]] are sometimes recommended.&lt;ref name="pmid18819238"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer JP | title = Management of mastitis in breastfeeding women | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 727–31 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18819238 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=18819238 | type = review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of antibiotics has not been well studied as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jahanfar S, Ng CJ, Teng CL | title = Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005458 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23450563 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005458.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast abscess ===
An abscess (or suspected abscess) in the breast may be treated by [[Breast ultrasound|ultrasound]]-guided [[fine-needle aspiration]] (percutaneous aspiration) or by surgical [[incision and drainage]]; each of these approaches is performed under antibiotic coverage. In case of puerperal breast abscess, breastfeeding from the affected breast should be continued where possible.&lt;ref name="Peters15112132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2011-p1684"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, p.&amp;nbsp;1684&lt;/ref&gt;

For small breast abscesses, [[Breast ultrasound|ultrasound]]-guided [[fine needle aspiration]] such as to completely drain the abscess is widely recognized as a preferred initial management.&lt;ref name="SilbermanSilberman2012"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Howard | last1 = Silberman | first2 = Allan W. | last2 = Silberman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles and Practice of Surgical Oncology: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Difficult Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqeoirBWOmYC&amp;pg=PA301|date=28 March 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4511-5323-1|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recommended treatment includes antibiotics, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an [[Needle gauge comparison chart|18 gauge]] [[Hypodermic needle|needle]], under [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] [[Therapeutic irrigation|lavage]] until clear.&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2013-fig9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, Fig. 9 on p. 1696&lt;/ref&gt; The exudate is then sent for microbiological analysis for identification of the pathogen and determination of its [[antibiotic sensitivity]] profile,&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2011-p1691"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, p.&amp;nbsp;1691&lt;/ref&gt; which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics. At follow-up, a [[mammography]] is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and microbiological analysis is repeated.&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2013-p1692-1693"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, p.&amp;nbsp;1692–1693&lt;/ref&gt; If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling [[catheter]] is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, [[breast surgery|surgical resection]] of the inflamed [[lactiferous duct]]s (preferably performed after the acute episode is over).&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2011-p1694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, p.&amp;nbsp;1694&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent [[relapse|recurrence]].&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2011-p1694"/&gt;

Nonpuerperal breast abscesses have a higher rate of recurrence compared to puerperal breast abscesses.&lt;ref name="trop-etal-2013-abstract"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trop I, Dugas A, David J, El Khoury M, Boileau JF, Larouche N, Lalonde L | title = Breast abscesses: evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis, management, and follow-up | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1683–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21997989 | doi = 10.1148/rg.316115521 | type = review }}, abstract&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high statistical correlation of nonpuerperal breast abscess with [[diabetes mellitus]] (DM). On this basis, it has recently been suggested that diabetes screening should be performed on patients with such abscess.&lt;ref name="pmid20349659"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizzo M, Gabram S, Staley C, Peng L, Frisch A, Jurado M, Umpierrez G | title = Management of breast abscesses in nonlactating women | journal = The American Surgeon | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 292–5 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20349659 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22395343"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verghese BG, Ravikanth R | title = Breast abscess, an early indicator for diabetes mellitus in non-lactating women: a retrospective study from rural India | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 1195–8 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22395343 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-012-1502-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are a number of recommendations regarding the treatment of breast abscesses, a 2015 review found not enough evidence regarding if needle aspiration is comparable to incision and drainage, or if antibiotics should generally be given to women undergoing incision and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irusen H, Rohwer AC, Steyn DW, Young T | title = Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = CD010490 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26279276 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010490.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Temperature and severity of symptoms at presentation do not predict outcome; women with sore or damaged nipples may need special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kvist LJ, Hall-Lord ML, Larsson BW | title = A descriptive study of Swedish women with symptoms of breast inflammation during lactation and their perceptions of the quality of care given at a breastfeeding clinic | journal = International Breastfeeding Journal | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages = 2 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17244353 | pmc = 1784075 | doi = 10.1186/1746-4358-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kvist LJ, Hall-Lord ML, Rydhstroem H, Larsson BW | title = A randomised-controlled trial in Sweden of acupuncture and care interventions for the relief of inflammatory symptoms of the breast during lactation | journal = Midwifery | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 184–95 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17052823 | doi = 10.1016/j.midw.2006.02.003 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0266-6138(06)00027-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Mastitis is quite common among breastfeeding women. The WHO estimates that although incidences vary between 2.6% and 33%, the prevalence globally is approximately 10% of breastfeeding women. Most mothers who develop mastitis  usually do so within the first few weeks after delivery. Most breast infections occur within the first or second month after delivery or at the time of [[weaning]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/breast_infection/page2_em.htm#Breast%20Infection%20Causes |title=Breast Infection Causes |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in rare cases it affects women who are not breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mastitis/Pages/Causes.aspx |title=Causes of mastitis |publisher=NHS |access-date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Popular usage of the term ''mastitis'' varies by geographic region. Outside the US it is commonly used for [[puerperal]] and nonpuerperal cases, in the US the term nonpuerperal mastitis is rarely used and alternative names such as duct ectasia, subareolar abscess and plasma cell mastitis are more frequently used.

[[Chronic cystic mastitis]] is an older name for fibrocystic disease.

American usage: mastitis usually refers to puerperal (occurring to breastfeeding mothers) mastitis with symptoms of systemic infection. Lighter cases of puerperal mastitis are often called breast engorgement.

In this Wikipedia article, "mastitis" is used in the original sense of the definition as [[inflammation]] of the breast with additional qualifiers where appropriate.

==Other animals==
{{See also|Mastitis in dairy cattle}}
Mastitis occurs in other animals as in humans, and is especially a concern in [[livestock]], since milk from the affected [[udder]]s of livestock may enter the food supply and pose a health risk.

It is a major condition in some species, like [[dairy cattle|dairy cows]]. It is the cause of much unwanted [[suffering]] for the dairy cows. It is of tremendous economic importance for the [[dairy]] industry, and it is also of concern for [[public health]]. The same considerations apply to mastitis in [[sheep]] and [[goats]] and other milk producing females. It is also of economic importance in the [[pig|sow]], but, in this species, it is not related to public health. In other domestic females ([[cat|queen]], [[horse|mare]],  etc.), it is more an individual illness dealt with by [[Veterinary physician|veterinary practitioners]].

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''mastitis'' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|s|t|ˈ|aɪ|t|ᵻ|s}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:mast-#Etymology 2|mast-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-itis#Suffix|-itis]]''. The word ''mammitis'' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|m|ˈ|aɪ|t|ᵻ|s}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:mammo-#Etymology 2|mamm-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-itis#Suffix|-itis]]''. They are [[synonym]]ous in modern usage, and ''mastitis'' is the more commonly used synonym.

'''''Mens rea''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|z|_|ˈ|r|iː|ə}}; [[Law Latin]] for "'''guilty mind'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Elizabeth A.  Martin |title=Oxford Dictionary of Law |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-860756-3 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 889 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 289 (2d ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the mental element of a person's intention to commit a crime; or knowledge that one's action or lack of action would cause a crime to be committed. It is a [[Necessity and sufficiency#Necessity|necessary]] [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of many [[crime]]s.

The standard [[common law]] test of criminal [[legal liability|liability]] is expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea'', i.e. "the act is not [[Culpability|culpable]] unless the mind is guilty". In [[jurisdiction]]s with [[due process]], there must be both ''[[actus reus]]'' ("guilty act") and ''mens rea'' for a defendant to be guilty of a crime (see [[concurrence]]). As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in [[criminal law]]. Exceptions are known as [[strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]] crimes.

In [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for [[breach of contract]] or [[tort]], for example. But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the [[proximate cause|scope of liability]] and the [[damages]] payable to the [[plaintiff]].

In some jurisdictions, the terms ''mens rea'' and ''actus reus'' have been replaced by alternative terminology. In Australia, ''mens rea'' is now called "fault elements" or "mental elements" and ''actus reus'' is now called "physical elements" or "external elements". The point of the changes was to replace Latin with plain English.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Fisse, "Howard's Criminal Law" (1990) 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|43|1997|litigants=Meyers v R |courtname=auto}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levels of ''mens rea'' ==

Under the traditional common law, the guilt or innocence of a person relied upon whether he had committed the crime (''[[actus reus]]''), and whether he intended to commit the crime (''mens rea''). However, many modern penal codes have created levels of ''mens rea'' called modes of culpability, which depend on the surrounding elements of the crime: the conduct, the circumstances, and the result, or what the Model Penal Code calls CAR (conduct, [[attendant circumstance]]s, result). The definition of a crime is thus constructed using only these elements rather than the colorful language of ''mens rea'':{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=46}}

{{quote|Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.|18 U.S.C. §1111 (traditional common law)}}

{{quote|A person commits an offense if he:                                        &lt;br&gt;(1)  intentionally or [[knowingly]] causes the death of an
individual|''portion of'' [[Texas Penal Code]] §19.02 (modern offense element)}}

The traditional common law definitions and the modern definitions approach the crime from different angles.

In the traditional common law approach, the definition includes:

#''actus reus'': unlawful killing of a human being;
#''mens rea'': malice aforethought.

Modern law approaches the analysis somewhat differently. Homicide is a "results" crime in that it forbids ''any'' "intentional" or "knowing" conduct that ''results'' in the death of another human being. "Intentional" in this sense means the actor possessed a "purpose" or "desire" that his or her objective (i.e. death of another human being) be achieved. "Knowing" means that the actor was aware or practically certain that the death would result. Thus, the ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' of homicide in a modern criminal statute can be considered as follows:

#''actus reus'': any conduct resulting in the death of another individual;
#''mens rea'': intent or knowledge that the conduct would result in the death.

In the modern approach, the attendant circumstances tend to replace the traditional ''mens rea'', indicating the level of culpability as well as other circumstances. For example, the crime of ''theft of government property'' would include as an attendant circumstance that the property belong to the government.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=46}}

== Modes of culpability ==

The levels of ''mens rea'' and the distinction between them vary between jurisdictions. Although common law originated from England, the common law of each jurisdiction with regard to culpability varies as precedents and statutes vary.

===England and Wales===
*''Direct intention'': the actor has a clear foresight of the consequences of his actions, and desires those consequences to occur. It's his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence (death).
*''Oblique intention'': the result is a virtually certain consequence or a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[R v Nedrick]] [1986] 1 WLR 1025&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R v Woollin]] [1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Matthews &amp; Alleyne [2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Knowingly'': the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur.
*''Recklessness'': the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.&lt;ref&gt;R v Cunningham [1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v G &amp; R [2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Caldwell [1982]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Criminal negligence'': the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a [[reasonable person]], in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences.

===Scotland===
*''Intention'': the accused willingly committed a criminal act entirely aware of his actions and their consequences. Necessary for murder and for assault.
*''Recklessness'': the accused was aware the criminal act could be potentially dangerous but did not give a second thought to its consequences, for example, involuntary [[culpable homicide]].

===United States===

====State criminal law====
The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the [[U.S. state|component states]] in accordance with the laws of the state in question. Historically, the states (with the partial exception of [[civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] [[Louisiana]]) applied common law rules of ''mens rea'' similar to those extant in England, but over time American understandings of common law ''mens rea'' terms diverged from those of English law and from each other. By the late 1950s to early 1960s, the common law of ''mens rea'' was widely acknowledged to be a slippery, vague, and confused mess.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|pages=60-80}} This was one of several factors that led to the development of the Model Penal Code.

=====Model Penal Code=====
Since its publication in 1957, the formulation of ''mens rea'' set forth in the [[Model Penal Code]] has been highly influential throughout the US in clarifying the discussion of the different modes of culpability.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|pages=60-80}}  The following levels of ''mens rea'' are found in the MPC:

*''[[Strict liability]]'': the actor engaged in conduct and his mental state is irrelevant. Under Model Penal Code Section 2.05, this ''mens rea'' may only be applied where the forbidden conduct is a mere violation, i.e. a [[civil infraction]].
*''[[Criminal negligence|Negligently]]'': a "reasonable person" would be aware of a "substantial and unjustifiable risk" that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, will lead to a prohibited result, and/or is under prohibited attendant circumstances, and the actor was not so aware but should have been.
*''[[Recklessness (law)|Recklessly]]'': the actor consciously disregards a "substantial and unjustifiable risk" that his conduct will lead to a prohibited result and/or is of a prohibited nature.
*''Knowingly'': the actor is practically certain that his conduct will lead to the result, or is aware to a high probability that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, or is aware to a high probability that the attendant circumstances exist.
*''Purposefully'': the actor has the "conscious object" of engaging in conduct and believes or hopes that the attendant circumstances exist.

Except for strict liability, these classes of ''mens rea'' are defined in Section 2.02(2) of the MPC.

====Federal criminal law====
Since the federal government of the United States does not have a generalized [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] like that of the states, the scope of its criminal statutes is necessarily circumscribed.  Ordinary prosecutions are the province of the states, and only crimes of special federal import are pursued by the federal government. Consequently, Title 18 of the [[United States Code]] does not use the aforementioned culpability scheme but relies instead on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law. For example, ''malice aforethought'' is used as a requirement for committing capital murder.{{sfn|Dubber (2002)|p=55}}

=== Canada ===

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has found that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees a minimum requirement for the mental state of various crimes. For example, the crime of murder must include a mental requirement of at least subjective foresight of death. For crimes where imprisonment is a sanction, there is a requirement of at least a defence of due diligence.

=== Australia ===

Mens rea needs to be proved by prosecution from offence to offence. If it is a common law offence, mens rea is found out by relevant precedent (''DPP v Morgan'' [1976] AC 182). Where the offence is in legislation, the requisite mens rea is found by interpreting the intention of the legislation.&lt;ref name="Teh HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|43|1985|litigants=[[He Kaw Teh v R]] |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 523 |courtname=auto |date=11 July 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|2008|litigants=CTM v R |parallelcite=(2008) 236 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 440 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They must intend to commit the full offence.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|56|1992|litigants=Knight v R |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 495 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Mens Rea in the [[Indian Penal Code]] 1860 sets out the definition of offences, the general conditions of liability, the conditions of exemptions from liability and punishments for the respective offences. Legislatures had not used the common law doctrine of mens rea in defining these crimes. However, they preferred to import it by using different terms indicating the required evil intent or mens rea as an essence of a particular offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcrhrdi.gov.in/drugs/week2/Iindian%20Penal%20Code.pdf|title=INDIAN PENAL CODE|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Resource Development Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt in respect to almost all offences created under the IPC is fastened either on the ground of intention, knowledge or reason to believe. Almost all the offences under the IPC are qualified by one or other words such as ‘wrongful gain or loss’, ‘[[dishonesty]]’, ‘[[Fraudulent|fraudulently]]’, ‘reason to believe’, ‘criminal knowledge or intention’, ‘intentional cooperation’, ‘voluntarily’, ‘malignantly’, ‘wantonly’, ‘maliciously’. All these words indicate the blameworthy mental condition required at the time of commission of the offence, nowhere found in the IPC, its essence is reflected in almost all the provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Every offence created under the IPC virtually imports the idea of criminal intent or mens rea in some form or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/34296/12/12_chapter%20v.pdf|title=12_CHAPTER v|last=|first=|date=|website=Shodhganga : a reservoir of Indian theses @ INFLIBNET|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ignorance of the law and ''mens rea'' ==

The general rule under common law is that "ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek v. United States'', {{ussc|498|192|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, courts have held if knowledge of a law, or the intent to break a law, is a material element of an offense a defendant may use ignorance as a defense to willfulness if his misunderstanding is in good faith:

{{quote|The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [T]he Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term "willfully" as used in federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule."&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crimes like tax evasion are specific intent crimes and require intent to violate the law as an element of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 194&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R. v. Klundert'', for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found as follows:

:"[55] Section 239(1)(d) is part of an Act which is necessarily and notoriously complex. It is subject to ongoing revision. No lay person is expected to know all the complexities of the tax laws. It is accepted that people will act on the advice of professionals and that the advice will often turn on the meanings to be given to provisions in the Act that are open to various interpretations. Furthermore, it is accepted that one may legitimately structure one’s affairs so as to minimize tax liability. Considered in this legislative context, I have no difficulty in holding that a mistake or ignorance as to one’s liability to pay tax under the Act may negate the fault requirement in the provision, regardless of whether it is a factual mistake, a legal mistake, or a combination of both."

Not all offenses require specific intent, and a misreading, even in good faith, may not excuse the criminal conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Marrero'', {{West|NE|507|2|1068|N.Y.|1987|}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good-faith belief that a law is unjust or unconstitutional is no excuse,&lt;ref&gt;''Cheek'', at 205-7&lt;/ref&gt; but "reasonable compliance upon an official statement of law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous" does not constitute a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Godwin'', {{West|SE|31||221|N.C.|1898|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a law must be worded as such, that it affords that a reasonable person who is not an attorney is able to comprehend the specific acts that the law prohibits. Otherwise, the statute may be struck down as unconstitutional pursuant to the [[Vagueness doctrine]].

== Subjective and objective tests ==

The test for the existence of ''mens rea'' may be:
:(a) subjective, where the court must be satisfied that the accused actually had the requisite mental element present in his or her mind at the relevant time (for purposely, knowingly, recklessly etc) (see [[concurrence]]);
:(b) objective, where the requisite ''mens rea'' element is [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the accused, on the basis that a reasonable person would have had the mental element in the same circumstances (for negligence); or
:(c) hybrid, where the test is both subjective and objective.

The [[court]] will have little difficulty in establishing ''mens rea'' if there is actual [[evidence (law)|evidence]]{{spaced ndash}}for instance, if the accused made an admissible [[admission (law)|admission]]. This would satisfy a ''subjective'' test. But a significant proportion of those accused of crimes make no such admissions. Hence, some degree of objectivity must be brought to bear as the basis upon which to impute the necessary component(s). It is always reasonable to assume that people of ordinary intelligence are aware of their physical surroundings and of the ordinary laws of cause and effect (see [[causation (law)|causation]]). Thus, when a person plans what to do and what not to do, he will understand the range of likely outcomes from given behaviour on a sliding scale from "inevitable" to "probable" to "possible" to "improbable". The more an outcome shades towards the "inevitable" end of the scale, the more likely it is that the accused both foresaw and desired it, and, therefore, the safer it is to impute intention. If there is clear subjective evidence that the accused did ''not'' have foresight, but a reasonable person would have, the hybrid test may find criminal negligence. In terms of the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], the requirement is that a [[jury]] must have a high degree of certainty before convicting, defined as "beyond a reasonable doubt" in the United States and "sure" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Winship'', {{ussc|397|358|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Majid'' [2009] EWCA Crim 2563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crown Bench Book: Directing the Jury|year=2010|publisher=Judicial Studies Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this reasoning that justifies the defenses of [[defense of infancy|infancy]], and of lack of mental capacity under the [[M'Naghten Rules]], an alternate common law rule (e.g., ''Durham'' test), and one of various statutes defining [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|mental illness]] as an [[excuse]]. Moreover, if there is an [[irrebuttable presumption]] of ''[[doli incapax]]''  - that is, that the accused did not have sufficient understanding of the nature and quality of his actions{{spaced ndash}}then the requisite ''mens rea'' is absent no matter what degree of probability might otherwise have been present.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Devon T.'', {{West|A|584|2|1287|Md. Court App.|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these purposes, therefore, where the relevant statutes are silent and it is for the common law to form the basis of potential liability, the reasonable person must be endowed with the same intellectual and physical qualities as the accused, and the test must be whether an accused with these specific attributes would have had the requisite foresight and desire.

In [[English law]], s8 Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides a statutory framework within which ''mens rea'' is assessed. It states:&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice Act 1967 (c.80)&lt;/ref&gt;
:A court or jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offense,
::(a) shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reasons only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions; but
::(b) shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.
Under s8(b) therefore, the jury is allowed a wide latitude in applying a hybrid test to impute intention or foresight (for the purposes of recklessness) on the basis of all the evidence.

== Relevance of motive ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

One of the mental components often raised in issue is that of [[Motive (law)|motive]]. If the accused admits to having a motive consistent with the elements of foresight and desire, this will add to the level of probability that the actual outcome was intended (it makes the prosecution case more [[credibility|credible]]). But if there is clear evidence that the accused had a different motive, this may decrease the probability that he or she desired the actual outcome. In such a situation, the motive may become subjective evidence that the accused did not intend, but was reckless or willfully blind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Motive cannot be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;Hessick, Carrisa (2006). "Motive's Role in Criminal Punishment". Southern California Law Review. Retrieved October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, a person breaks into a laboratory used for the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals, the question of guilt is determined by the presence of an ''actus reus'', i.e. entry without consent and damage to property, and a ''mens rea'', i.e. intention to enter and cause the damage. That the person might have had a clearly articulated political motive to protest such testing does not affect liability. If motive has any relevance, this may be addressed in the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] part of the trial, when the court considers what [[punishment]], if any, is appropriate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

== Intention ==
{{main|Intention (criminal law)}}

== Recklessness (United States: "willful blindness") ==
{{main|Recklessness (law)|Willful blindness}}

In such cases, there is clear subjective evidence that the accused foresaw but did not desire the particular outcome.  When the accused failed to stop the given behavior, he took the risk of causing the given loss or damage.  There is always some degree of intention subsumed within recklessness.  During the course of the conduct, the accused foresees that he may be putting another at risk of injury:  A choice must be made at that point in time.  By deciding to proceed, the accused actually intends the other to be exposed to the risk of that injury.  The greater the probability of that risk maturing into the foreseen injury, the greater the degree of recklessness and, subsequently, sentence rendered.  For example, at common law, an unlawful homicide committed recklessly would ordinarily constitute the crime of [[voluntary manslaughter]].  One committed with ''"extreme"'' or ''"gross"'' recklessness as to human life would constitute murder, sometimes defined as ''"depraved heart"'' or ''"abandoned and malignant heart"'' murder.&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code §§ 188-199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal negligence ==
{{main|Criminal negligence}}

Here, the test is both subjective and objective. There is credible subjective evidence that the particular accused neither foresaw nor desired the particular outcome, thus potentially excluding both intention and recklessness. But a [[reasonable person]] with the same abilities and skills as the accused would have foreseen and taken precautions to prevent the loss and damage being sustained. Only a small percentage of offences are defined with this ''mens rea'' requirement. Most [[legislature]]s prefer to base liability on either intention or recklessness and, faced with the need to establish recklessness as the default ''mens rea'' for guilt, those practising in most legal systems rely heavily on objective tests to establish the minimum requirement of foresight for recklessness.

Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programmes at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) level also play a part.
As of December 2017, the college is allowed to admit 80 students annually permitting 50% seats for foreigners.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:National Support Teams - Engage Recommend Facilitate.jpg|thumb|]]
The [[public health]] '''National Support Teams''' or NSTs&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407164946/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/NationalSupportTeams/index.htm UK Government website]&lt;/ref&gt; constituted a consultancy-style [[organisational development]] and [[change management]] service provided by the UK Government [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].

==History and role==
Established in 2006, they provided consultancy-style support and assistance to local health economies across England (the UK's [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved administrations]] - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland generally having their own arrangements).  Each team had access to national-level [[expertise]] on specific public health specialisms, including:

* [[Sexual health]]
* [[Tobacco control]]
* [[Health inequalities]]
* [[Teenage pregnancy]]
* [[Childhood obesity]]
* [[Harm reduction#Alcohol-related programs|Alcohol Harm Reduction]]
* [[Infant mortality]]
* Response to [[Sexual violence]]
* [[Vaccination]] and [[Immunisation]]
* Children and Young Peoples' [[Emotional well-being]] and [[Mental health]]

[[Management consultancy|Consultancy]] and support services were provided free of charge to [[public-sector]] clients including local authorities and [[National Health Service]] Trusts.  The feedback reports generated as a result of these activities were not published by the Department of Health, although some clients choose to post reports (usually in PowerPoint or PDF format) on their own websites.

Each National Support Team also shared observations with central Government [[public policy|policy]] advisors on the real-world public health challenges it identified through this work.

== Activity ==
The primary activity of each Team was to carry out visiting inputs to local areas across [[England]], more than 450 of which were undertaken during the existence of the NSTs.  These visits lasted between two days and one week, using a mix of in-house NST experts and externally sourced advisors where appropriate.   Subsequent [[change management]] support was offered as appropriate to the changes recommended, often around strengthening strategic coherence, enhancing [[Project commissioning|commissioning]] capabilities to respond to public health challenges, or improving operational effectiveness of treatment and/or behaviour change services.

==Approach==
The overall style of the National Support Teams was planned to be in line with [[Peter Block]]'s 'Flawless Consulting' approach.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Peter (1999). ''Flawless Consulting: A Guide to Getting Your Expertise Used'' (1999), {{ISBN|978-0-7879-4803-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic model employed was broadly influenced by [[Appreciative Inquiry]], due to its tested relevance to healthcare environments and the emphasis upon positive potential to enhance organisational function (rather than a [[performance management]] approach, which initial client feedback suggested would be perceive as judgemental).  Recommendations for change were presented at closing plenary sessions to both senior leadership and operational managers with sufficient detail to trigger follow-up action and a delivery style reported by audiences as more memorable than was initially expected of an organisational development input.

== Publications ==
NSTs created and published a range of practical guides to achieve public health improvements (several titled as 'high impact changes' guides) as well as summaries of applied learning from their reviews and support work in localities across England.  Several of these remain available on the Department of Health website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/NationalSupportTeams/DH_126388&lt;/ref&gt; and a wider range is available from the digital legacy site hosted by the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407164946/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/NationalSupportTeams/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback from NSTs to central Government policy teams also informed (and in some cases instigated) the publication of other policy documents including 'white papers' outlining proposed strategic improvements to overall action on public health.

== Reception ==
As outlined in the NSTs' own end-of-project report (available at the Department for Health website &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_125789&lt;/ref&gt;) the NSTs achieved significant results in strengthening the performance of a diverse range of NHS and local government public health interventions, resulting in high approval levels on the part of Chief Executives and Directors of Public Health who considered this to have been one of the most useful services which the Department of Health had made available.

== Closure ==
All Teams closed in March 2011 as a result of the funding cuts affecting several areas of the public sector in the UK, following a perceived need to reduce public expenditure in the context of the international [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] and related [[Great Recession#In the United Kingdom|recession]].  Internal communications to NST staff explained the closure as the result of a decision to abolish all posts not covered by a traditional civil service employment contract; as this included almost all NST employees, the service was to close as a consequence - it was stressed that closure was not intended to imply a comment on the success or usefulness of the NST approach.

==Subsequent reputation==
Specialist medical magazine 'GP' reported the regret voiced by public health leaders following the closure of the NSTs in August 2011.  Their stories &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Robinson | first=Stephen | url=http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1083107/how-gps-face-health-inequalities-struggle-doh-axes-taskforce/ | title=How GPs face health inequalities struggle as DoH axes taskforce | publisher=GPonline | date=3 August 2011 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Robinson | first=Stephen | url=http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1082943/exclusive-doh-scraps-health-inequalities-taskforce-cost-cutting-drive/ | title=DoH scraps health inequalities taskforce in cost-cutting drive | publisher=GPonline | date=3 August 2011 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently picked up by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Adams | first=Stephen | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8677457/Health-inequality-teams-scrapped.html | title=Health inequality teams scrapped | newspaper=The Telegraph | date=3 August 2011 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC News]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Triggle | first=Nick | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14378344 | title=NHS healthy lifestyle push 'blow' | publisher=BBC News | date=3 August 2011 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained how the services of NSTs had been received and questioned the rationale for disbanding them.  In response, an unidentified Department of Health spokesperson suggested that the teams were no longer required as they had worked to targets discarded by the incoming new national administration in May 2010, although the teams had continued to provide services used by localities and intelligence brought back into central Government for the rest of that financial year; the spokesperson did not suggest a new means by which continuing aspirations to address public health challenges could now be supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12285">A '''peak experience''' is a moment accompanied by a euphoric mental state often achieved by [[self-actualizing]] individuals.&lt;ref name=Corsini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corsini|first1=Raymond J.|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=1998|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was originally developed by [[Abraham Maslow]] in 1964, who describes peak experiences as "rare, exciting, oceanic, deeply moving, exhilarating, elevating experiences that generate an advanced form of perceiving reality, and are even mystic and magical in their effect upon the experimenter."&lt;ref name=Corsini/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Maslow, A.H. 1964"&gt;Maslow, A.H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak experiences. ''London: Penguin Books Limited.''&lt;/ref&gt; There are several unique characteristics of a peak experience, but each element is perceived together in a holistic manner that creates the moment of reaching one's full potential.&lt;ref name="Psych of Being"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maslow|first1=Abraham|title=Toward a Psychology of Being|date=1968|publisher=Van Nostrand-Reinhold|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak experiences can range from simple activities to intense events;&lt;ref name=Polyson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polyson|first=J.|title=Student's peak experiences: A written exercise.|date=1985|journal=Teaching of Psychology, 12|pages=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Capon|first1=John|title=Flow and Peak Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is not necessarily about what the activity is, but the ecstatic, blissful feeling that is being experienced during it.&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maslow|first1=A. H.|title=Toward a psychology of being|date=1962|publisher=Van Nostrand-Reinhold|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peak experiences were originally described by [[psychologist]] [[Abraham Maslow]] as "moments of highest happiness and fulfillment" in his 1964 work ''[[Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences]]''.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A.H. 1964"/&gt; To some extent the term represents Maslow's attempt to denominate those experiences which have generally been identified as [[religious experience|''religious'' experiences]] and whose origins have, by implication, been thought of as supernatural. Maslow (1970) believed the origin, core and essence of every known "high religion" was "the private, lonely, personal illumination, revelation, or ecstasy of some acutely sensitive prophet or seer" (p.&amp;nbsp;19).

Maslow's assertions about peak experience, along with his famous  [[hierarchy of needs]], were widely celebrated due to the theories' focus on the psychology of healthy people, which stood out in a time where the bulk of psychology research focused on psychological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Boniface, M.R. (2007). Towards an understanding of flow and other positive experience phenomena within outdoor and adventurous activities. '' Journal of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning, 1,'' 55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In original peak experience research, Maslow utilized interviews and questionnaires to gather participants' testimonies of peak experience. These early studies suggested common triggers for peak experience included art, nature, sex, creative work, music, scientific knowledge, and introspection.&lt;ref name="privette"&gt;Privette, G. (1983). Peak experience, peak performance and flow: A comparative analysis of positive human experiences. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, ''1361-1368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, peak experience is associated with the psychological phenomenon [[flow (psychology)|flow]]. Peak experience is differentiated from flow due to a number of factors including subjective level of experience intensity: while peak experience denotes a high level of stimulation or euphoria, flow is not associated with an increased level of stimulation.&lt;ref name="privette" /&gt; For further differentiation, see "Peak Experiences in Self-Actualization" below.

== Characteristics ==
An individual in a peak experience will perceive the following simultaneously:
* loss of judgment to time and space&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* the feeling of being one whole and harmonious self, free of dissociation or inner conflict&lt;ref name="Psych of Being"/&gt;
* the feeling of using all capacities and capabilities at their highest potential, or being "fully functioning"&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* functioning effortlessly and easily without strain or struggle&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* feeling completely responsible for perceptions and behavior. Use of self-determination to becoming stronger, more single-minded, and fully volitional&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* being without inhibition, fear, doubt, and self-criticism&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* spontaneity, expressiveness, and naturally flowing behavior that is not constrained by conformity&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* a free mind that is flexible and open to creative thoughts and ideas&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* complete mindfulness of the present moment without influence of past or expected future experiences&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt;
* a physical feeling of warmth, along with a sensation of pleasant vibrations emanating from the heart area outward into the limbs.

==Self-actualization==
Self-actualization is a concept developed by Abraham Maslow that is characterized by one becoming all they want to be, and can be, by maximizing their potential.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=R. J.|last2=Buss|first2=D. M.|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of knowledge about human nature third edition|date=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common phenomenon that many self-actualized people experience is called [[flow (psychology)|flow]], proposed by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]].&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt; Flow has been described as a state of mind when one is using their full potential, completely immersed in their current activity, and are therefore not conscious of time, or anything else for that matter.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

Self-actualized people often experience flow, as well as peak experiences.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt; Although flow and peak experiences are often thought of as the same thing, they are different occurrences. While flow is a subjective conscious process that happens internally, peak experiences are describing an event that has occurred to someone who was functioning at optimal levels.&lt;ref name=Capon/&gt; Peak experiences are the actual outcome of an external occurrence, while flow is an internal mental process that may or may not precede a peak experience.&lt;ref name=Capon/&gt; Due to the nature and characteristics of self-actualized individuals, peak experiences often occur in their lives with their ability to perceive, accept, understand, and enjoy the journey of life.&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cherry|first1=Kendra|title=Characteristics of Self-Actualized People|publisher=psychology.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Polyson (1985):&lt;br /&gt;
"Most of the peak experiences had occurred during athletic, artistic, religious, or nature experiences, or during intimate moments with a friend or family member."&lt;ref name=Polyson/&gt;

Maslow (1962):&lt;br /&gt;
"Think of the most wonderful experience of your life: the happiest moments, ecstatic moments, moments of rapture, perhaps from being in love, or from listening to music or suddenly 'being hit' by a book or painting, or from some creative moment."&lt;ref name=Maslow/&gt;

Specific examples of when peak experiences often occur:
*Scientific discoveries; seeing or discovering some phenomenon for the first time&lt;ref name=Charlton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charlton|first1=Bruce|title= Peak experiences, creativity and the Colonel Flastratus phenomenon."Abraxas vol. 14"|pages=10–19|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Extreme sports]] activities – [[mountain biking]], [[motorcycling]], mountain/[[rock climbing]], [[sky diving]], [[snowboarding]]&lt;ref name=Capon/&gt;
*Musical talents – while playing an instrument alone, or with a group&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whaley|first1=John|last2=Sloboda|first2=John|last3=Gabrielsson|first3=Alf|title=Peak experiences in music|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
[[Abraham Maslow]] considers the peak experience to be one of the most important goals of life, as it is an indication of self-actualization.&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt; This moment of feeling wholly and completely the true self makes the peak experience an essential component of identity.&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt; The aftereffects of the peak experience leave the individual to see himself and the world in a new way. He views himself more positively, he views life as worthwhile and meaningful, and most importantly, he seeks to repeat the experience.&lt;ref name=Maslow /&gt; The peak experience is an exhibition of Maslow’s emphasis on the quest for positive growth maximizing potential as the true goal of human existence.

== Plateau experience ==
Maslow also recognized a related but distinct phenomenon of ''plateau experience''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippner, Stanley (1972). 
[https://www.academia.edu/27103672 The plateau experience: A. H. Maslow and others]. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 4(2), 107–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruel, Nicole (2015). [http://atpweb.org/jtparchive/trps-47-15-01-44.pdf The plateau experience: an exploration of its origins, characteristics, and potential]. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 47(1), 44−63.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is serene and calm rather than a poignantly emotional, climactic, autonomic response to the miraculous, the awesome, the sacralized, the Unitive, the B-values. So far as I can now tell, the high plateau-experience ''always'' has a noetic and cognitive element, which is not always true for peak experiences, which can be purely and exclusively emotional. It is far more voluntary than peak experiences are. One can learn to see in this Unitive way almost at will. It then becomes a witnessing, an appreciating, what one might call a serene, cognitive blissfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. ''Religion, values, and peak experiences''. Viking, 1970; (Preface).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Maslow's death, investigation into the nature of plateau experience ''per se'' "largely fizzled into obscurity."&lt;ref&gt;Gruel(2015), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  However research into the related phenomenon of [[Self-transcendence]]&lt;ref&gt;Messerly, John G. (2017). [https://reasonandmeaning.com/2017/01/18/summary-of-maslow-on-self-transcendence/ Summary of Maslow on self-transcendence] Reason and Meaning (web; accessed 5 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; is potentially increasing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30483">A '''pharmacy technician''' is a [[health care provider]] who performs [[pharmacy]]-related functions, generally working under the direct supervision of a licensed [[pharmacist]]. Pharmacy technicians work in a variety of locations (usually in community, retail, and [[hospital]] pharmacies), but can also work for long-term care facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, third-party [[health insurance|insurance]] companies, computer software companies, or in government or teaching. Job duties include dispensing [[prescription drug]]s and other [[medical device]]s to [[patients]] and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with [[doctor's office]]s and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.

In recent times, pharmacy technicians also speak directly with the patients on the phone to aid in the awareness of taking medications on time.&lt;ref name=CVS&gt;PCI Calls.[http://www.cvs.com "CVS.com"], as of Oct, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoLS&gt;US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Practical training, such as completing an [[internship]] in a pharmacy, is also often required as part of training for employment as a pharmacy technician.&lt;ref name="Humber"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Health Service. [http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=894 Entry requirements and training for pharmacy technicians], ''NHS Careers in Detail'', accessed July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers favor pharmacy technicians to be certified with a national or local pharmacy board, such as by passing a standard exam and/or paying a fee. In the [[United States]], voluntary certification is available through many private organizations.&lt;ref name="BoLS"/&gt; Elsewhere, such as in [[Tanzania]] and the [[United Kingdom]], pharmacy technicians are required to be registered with the national regulatory council.

==Training and practice==
In the United States, there is no mandated regulatory agency governing the training of Pharmacy Technicians.  Each state has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the licensure of Pharmacy Technicians in their state.&lt;ref&gt;http://pharmtechtraining.net/state-requirements.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Licensure requirements vary widely by state. Some states require training from board-approved schools, PTCB certification, on-the-job training or no requirements at all. There are two National Examinations for the certification of Pharmacy Technicians (PTCE @ www.ptcb.org) (ExCpT @ www.nhanow.com/pharmacy-technician.aspx).

The PTCB, Pharmacy Technician Certification Board, has enacted a plan to require an ASHP (American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists) certified Pharmacy Technician education program by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacp.org/governance/COMMITTEES/professionalaffairs/Docs/ptcb-certification-program-changes{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a hotly debated issue, as training schools have come under great scrutiny regarding the issuance of Title IV loans.&lt;ref&gt;http://therxtechexam.blogspot.com/2013/07/lawsuits-career-colleges-deceive.html&lt;/ref&gt;  According to RxTechExam.com, all that is required to become a Nationally Certified Pharmacy Technician is:
# a demonstrated ability of the material necessary to pass the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam&lt;ref name="RxTechExam.com"&gt;https://RxTechExam.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# achievement 18 years of age or older&lt;ref name="RxTechExam.com"/&gt;
# no disqualifying conditions such as a felony conviction or drug related misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="RxTechExam.com"/&gt;

In Canada, according to a 2007 profile of the pharmacy technician workforce, 43% of technicians work in hospitals and other related facilities, 37% in
chain or franchise community pharmacies, and 16% in independent community pharmacies.&lt;ref name="CPA"&gt;Canadian Pharmacists Association. [http://blueprintforpharmacy.ca/docs/default-document-library/2011/04/19/Moving_Forward_Pharmacy_Technician_Results_-_Exec_Sum.pdf?Status=Master ''The Pharmacy Technician Workforce in Canada: Roles, Demographics and Attitudes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327015354/http://blueprintforpharmacy.ca/docs/default-document-library/2011/04/19/Moving_Forward_Pharmacy_Technician_Results_-_Exec_Sum.pdf?Status=Master |date=2012-03-27 }}, accessed 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most (62%) obtained pharmacy technician training from a career college or community college, some (16%) had only a high school education and no formal pharmacy training, while about 20% had  some university education. A very small proportion (2%) had trained and worked abroad as either pharmacists or pharmacy technicians. The wide range of technical training and educational attainment likely reflects in part the variety of training programs for pharmacy technicians currently available in the different provinces and territories of the country.&lt;ref name="CPA"/&gt; Accredited Pharmacy Technician diploma, certificate and college programs are offered in the Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian-universities.net. [http://www.canadian-universities.net/Community-Colleges/Programs/Pharmacy_Technician.html Pharmacy Technician College Programs and Courses in Canada], accessed 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 908

In provinces and jurisdictions where pharmacy technician is a regulated health profession, [[professional liability insurance]] is required in order to practice.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Association of Pharmacy Technicians.

== National variations ==
=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, Pharmacy Technicians are known as Pharmacy Regency Technologists, erroneously called Pharmacy Regents. They graduate of several universities after three years of training. This occupation appeared due to the lack of pharmacists in Colombia, that is why they are commonly confused with pharmacists. The Pharmacy Regency Technicians in Colombia are regulated and monitored by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.

=== Germany ===
According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt, 66.867 pharmacy technicians are working in Germany (status: 2011). About 90% are working as employees in community pharmacies. Their salary (approx. 1.837 - 2.400 Euros) is part of agreements between employers associations and [[Adexa]].

=== Saudi Arabia ===

In Saudi Arabia, Pharmacy Technicians are known as Assistant Pharmacist. They graduate of several universities after three and half years of education And training. This occupation appeared due to the lack of pharmacists in Saudi Arabia in 1990, that is why they are commonly confused with pharmacists. The Pharmacy Regency Technicians in Saudi Arabia are regulated and monitored by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS).

According to the MOH Statistics, there is about 8.471 of pharmacy technicians work in MOH Saudi Arabia 2015.

In 2010, the Minister of Health, Abdullah Al-Rabiah, issued a decision to stop the teaching of Pharmacy Technicians immediately.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the National Apprentices and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) has developed National Competency Standards (NCS)  leading to the award of NVQ Level 4 certification as Pharmacy Technician for the Pharmacy Employees who are with above 5 years of Experience. The NCS is approved by the Tertiary And Vocational Education Commission in 2016 and presently it is being implemented. There are over 10,000 expereinced employees allover the Island will benefit.

The one (1) year training will consists of subject areas in Compounding, Dispensing,stock management,House Keeping Practices and Customer care development  

=== Ghana ===
In [[Ghana]], a 2009 assessment of pharmaceutical human resources identified a total of 1,637 practicing pharmacists (1 per 14,400 population), 918 practising pharmacy Technicians/Technologists (1 per 25,600), and 1,642 medicine counter assistants (1 per 14,300). Nearly half (45%) of pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers across the country reported having one or more vacancies for pharmaceutical personnel, including 82% of public sector facilities.&lt;ref name="Ghana"&gt;Ghana Pharmacy Council, Ghana Ministry of Health, and World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/coordination/hrpharma/en/ ''Assessment of Human Resources for Pharmaceutical Services in Ghana''], Accra, 2009. Accessed 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of training, the assessment identified only one pharmacy technologists training school in the country (enrolling 70 students in the Higher National Diploma program).&lt;ref name="Ghana"/&gt;

=== India ===
In India, Medical Colleges CPR  Also known as Mccpr provides full training on pharmacy technician. The basic eligibility in India to enroll in this course is 10+2 or diploma. There are two batches a year that intakes approximately 40 students per batch.

=== Nigeria ===
Pharmacy technicians in Nigeria make up 75% of pharmaceutical work force and are looking for their council (pharmacy technician and technologist council of Nigeria) reason being the pharmacist council of Nigeria (PCN) refuses to allocate responsibilities that will give them right to practice at community level interdependently. The case was in court and the court ruled against PCN on 12/3/2008.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Nigerian pharmacy technicians in collaboration with NBTE are currently saving Nigerian Economy and Nigerians from the professional monopoly played by pharmacist Council of Nigeria (PCN) which led to abundant fake drugs due lack of manpower. This exposed Nigerian to a lot of problems which lead reduction in productivity leading to sustainable poverty. 
Nigerian Pharmacy technicians in collaboration with NBTE are able to achieve these by introducing ND/HND in pharmaceutical technology. PCN is doing everything possible to stop this training in order to sustain its monopoly, demanding Federal ministry of education to direct NBTE to stop accrediting the polytechnics while these course are offered in Ghana, Sudan and other countries. The meeting called at the instance of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) on 25th May 2016 where the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN), representative of the Honourable Minister of Health, Federal Ministry of Education, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) and National Association of Pharmaceutical Technologists and Pharmacy Technicians of Nigeria were in attendance; certain issues bothering on the nomenclature Pharmaceutical Technologists, the curriculum and the accrediting body for polytechnic graduates of pharmaceutical Technology were raised. There it was made clear that the nomenclature (Pharmaceutical Technologist) is not new in Nigeria as the training of people bearing the name were trained at the former School of Pharmaceutical Technologists between 19811 and 1985. The premises of the school is being used as the liaison office of the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) today. It was also established that National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) is saddled with the accreditation of courses offered by Polytechnics and Monotechnics in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As for the curriculum findings revealed that NBTE is in line with the legal instrument that established the Board. Meanwhile, it was unanimously agreed that all relevant bodies should come together to review the complaints of the PCN.National Board for Technical Education (NBTE)

=== Tanzania ===
Tanzania has two Pharmaceutical Technician schools: one is a public sector institution under the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]] and accredited by [[Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences]], and the other is affiliated with a faith based organization located in Kilimanjaro which offers diploma training. The practice of pharmaceutical technicians is regulated by Tanzania Pharmacy Council, which enrols and enlists them. The country has 0.11 registered pharmacy technicians per 10,000 population.&lt;ref name="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. [http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s17397e/s17397e.pdf ''Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework''], Dar es Salaam, 2010. Accessed 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main job duties of pharmaceutical technicians include dispensing, stock management, compounding, quantification of pharmaceutical formulations, and laboratory work. In some areas of the country facing acute [[physician shortage|shortage of physicians]] and other clinicians, pharmacy technicians have also been found prescribing.&lt;ref name="Tanzania"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], a Pharmacy Technician now must complete a recognised accredited training program with vocational training to [[Scottish Vocational Qualification|SVQ]]/[[NVQ]] level 3 in Pharmacy Services as well as an academic underpinning knowledge program such as BTEC or [[National Certificate]] (NC) [[Pharmacy Services]]. In addition a minimum period of time of working as a trainee Pharmacy Technician is needed before final qualification and compulsory registration is required before commencing work as a Pharmacy Technician. Pharmacy Technicians may counsel patients on their medication (under the supervision or direction of a pharmacist, though counselling is not one of the learning outcomes for pharmacy technician training)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/sites/default/files/Standards%20for%20the%20initial%20education%20and%20training%20of%20pharmacy%20technicians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as general dispensing of prescriptions. In community pharmacy, it has been recognised that the role is difficult to distinguish from that of a dispensing assistant with an NVQ2 qualification. Additional training is available to qualified Pharmacy Technicians and can include accuracy checking of dispensed prescriptions (though there is no legal requirement that a person be qualified as a pharmacy technician before undertaking an accuracy checking course), Medicines Management (Hospital or PCT), participation in the running of hospital clinics such as [[anticoagulant]] clinics, dosing [[Warfarin]] patients under dose banding guidance,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} or other higher duties traditionally done by Pharmacists.

In the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) Pharmacy Technicians work under the direct supervision of a Senior/ Specialist Pharmacy Technician and is accountable to the Chief Pharmacy Technician/ Lead Pharmacist even if not in a dispensary and work mainly in one of two areas, [[pharmacy#Hospital pharmacy|hospital pharmacy]] and [[pharmacy#Community pharmacy|community pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;National Health Service.  [http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=258 "Pharmacy technician"], ''NHS Careers in Detail'', accessed July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also work in Doctors' general practices and in [[NHS primary care trust|primary care trusts]].

In England, Scotland and Wales, since 1 July 2011, qualified Pharmacy Technicians have to be registered with the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (formerly the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) to practise and call themselves a Pharmacy Technician. The title 'Pharmacy Technician' is a protected title and requires the user to register with the General Pharmaceutical Council. A Pharmacy Dispenser cannot call themselves or work as a Pharmacy Technician or register with the General Pharmaceutical Council.

Pharmacy Technicians in hospitals are graded on the same [[Agenda for Change]] banding as nurses and other health care professionals. They start on a set percentage of a Band 4 (usually 75% - an average annual wage of £20,698&lt;ref name="pharmacistsalaryguide.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pharmacistsalaryguide.com/pharmacist-salary/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529002515/http://pharmacistsalaryguide.com/pharmacist-salary/ |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a trainee moving on to Band 4 when newly qualified PhT and can work their way to a Band 8b in charge of a department/area. A Band 8b is the equivalent of a [[Nurse Lead]]/[[Senior Nurse Manager]] in nursing or other [[Head of Department]] in the NHS.  Although Band 8b is possible, a successful pharmacy technician can reasonably expect to reach Band 7a in the latter stage of their career, earning an average of £35,898.&lt;ref name="pharmacistsalaryguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/working-in-the-nhs/pay-and-benefits/agenda-for-change-pay-rates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Registered Pharmacy Technicians in the NHS are responsible for the training and development of Pharmacy Support Workers; Senior Pharmacy Support Workers and Pre-Registration Trainee Pharmacy Technicians. Further training and qualifications after initial registration as a RPhT enable them to perform this mentoring role. Pharmacy Technicians in the UK (as with other countries e.g. Canada) are now referred to by some as professionals, although Registered Pharmacists are obviously considered experts in the Pharmaceutical field and RPhTs are subordinate to Pharmacists. The reference to pharmacy technicians as professionals has been subject to challenge.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-pda.org/wp-content/uploads/gphc_standards_response_201606.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], about 75% of pharmacy technicians in the U.S. work in a retail setting,&lt;ref name="BoLS"/&gt; such as an independently owned [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], a mass retailer chain, or a mail-order or [[online pharmacy]]. An additional 16% of pharmacy technician jobs were in hospitals,&lt;ref name=BoLS/&gt; while others worked for nursing homes, pharmaceutical [[wholesaler]]s, or the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]]. To work in any of these settings, certain requirements must be met. Requirements vary by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmacy Technician Requirements|url=http://www.careerstep.com/docs/pharmacy-technician-requirements.pdf |publisher=Career Step|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2016}}, the nationwide average hourly pay for pharmacy technicians working in retail or independent pharmacies is $12.26&lt;ref&gt;http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Pharmacy_Technician/Hourly_Rate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Independent-Pharmacy-Pharmacy-Technician-Hourly-Pay-E383410_D_KO21,40.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and for pharmacy technicians working in hospital setting is $14.57.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Hospital_Pharmacy_Technician/Hourly_Rate&lt;/ref&gt;

====CPhT====
CPhT is the abbreviation for Certified Pharmacy Technician. The CPhT works directly under a pharmacist, R.Ph or a PharmD. (An R.Ph is a Registered [[Pharmacist]], who is a licensed pharmacist in that state and may have either a bachelor's degree in pharmacy or a [[Pharm.D]].) The profession has different educational and certification requirements in different locales, set by each state's Board of Pharmacy.  For example, in order to remain licensed, all Illinois pharmacy technicians hired on Jan 1, 2008 (and after) will need to be certified within 2 years of registration with the Division of Professional Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Division of Professional Regulation — State Board of Pharmacy.  [http://www.nhanow.com/pharmacy-technician/requirements/illinois.aspx "National Healthcare Association"], ''Illinois Pharmacy Technician Certification Requirements'', accessed September 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining technical school education, an [[associate degree]], or work training, the technician may take a certification exam. Exam preparation may also be provided by some employers. Examinations are offered by two certifying bodies.

There are many scopes of the workplace for the Certified Pharmacy Technician. In a retail setting, a CPhT works under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who dispenses prescription medication (tablets, capsules, gels, ointment, creams, suspensions, [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s, and inhalation medications), and must be familiar with over-the-counter areas as well as third party insurance billing processes. In an [[inpatient]] setting, the CPhT works throughout the [[hospital]], packing and dispensing [[medication]]s in satellite pharmacies and to the various nursing units; compounding intravenous medication while using aseptic technique; narcotic medication dispensing and inventorial procedures; as well as documenting patients' weight, height, drug allergies and other needed information in medication records.

====State of Arizona Pharmacy Technician requirements====
To practice as a Pharmacy Technician in [[Arizona]], one must acquire a license from the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy.  There are two levels of licenses: the Trainee License and the Full License.

The Trainee License is required for our students to practice during their externships. To obtain a Trainee License, students apply at the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy with their U.S. birth certificate and [[high school diploma]] or [[GED]].

In order to obtain a Full License, graduates must be certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. While going through this process, some graduates may work under a Trainee License.

In order to receive a Full License from the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy, one must first pass the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE). The Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) administers this exam and the issuing of certifications. When applying for a Certified License, you will be required to show proof of your PTCB certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://pharmacy.az.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Certified License and PTCB certification must be renewed every 2 years. This requires that the applicant successfully complete 20 hours of continuing education before renewing their certification and applying for a renewed license.

====State of California Pharmacy Technician requirements====
The [[California]] State Board of Pharmacy is managed by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. It was established in 1891 in order to regulate the practice of pharmacy and sale of poisons in the State of California. As of 2009, the Board consisted of seven pharmacists and six public members, for a total of thirteen members. All seven pharmacists and four public members were appointed by the governor of the state. The remaining two were appointed by the Assembly Speaker and Senate Rules Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Archive of California|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org |publisher=California Digital Library|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board issues licenses/registration for pharmacists, intern pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians, as well as site permits for pharmacies or other establishments that dispense prescription drugs in the state. All registration, license, and permit renewals are handled by the Board as well as complaints and enforcement actions.

To be eligible to become licensed as a pharmacy technician in California, one must have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) certificate AND qualify under any one of the following conditions:
# possession of associate degree in Pharmacy Technology OR Any other course that provides a minimum of 240 hours of instruction as specified in Title 16 California Code of Regulation section 1793.6(c) OR A training course accredited by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) OR Graduation from a school of pharmacy accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE);

'''Procrastination''' is defined as the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen K. Kirst-Ashman|author2=Grafton H. Hull, Jr.|title=Empowerment Series: Generalist Practice with Organizations and Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvK6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-94329-2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be further stated as a habitual/intentional [[Delayed gratification|delay]] of starting or finishing a task despite its negative consequences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrari|first=Joseph|date=June 2018|title=Delaying Disposing: Examining the Relationship between Procrastination and Clutter across Generations|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12144-017-9679-4.pdf|journal=Current Psychology|volume=(New Brunswick, N.J.)

It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Although typically perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1146738 |title= Procrastination, Self-Esteem, Academic Performance, and Well-Being: A Moderated Mediation Model |author1= Duru, Erdinç |author2= Balkis, Murat |date= June 2017 |origyear=31 May 2017 |via= ed.gov |journal= International Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages= 97–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; , it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Gods: The remarkable story of risk|last=Bernstein|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of procrastination (such as academic/non academic or behavioural/ indecisive) have their own underlying causes and effects. The most prominent explanation in present literature draws upon "Intemporal discounting, task averseness and certain personality traits such as indecisiveness and distractibility" as the common causes of procrastination.

A study of behavioural patterns of pigeons through delayed reward suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans, but can also be observed in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=James|date=1998|title=Procrastination by Pigeons with Fixed-Interval Response Requirements|journal=Experimental Analysis Behav|volume=69|pages=|via=|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284653/pdf/9540230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Latin: ''procrastinare'', ''pro-'', 'forward', with ''-crastinus'', 'till next day' from "''cras''", 'tomorrow'

== Prevalence ==
In a study of academic procrastination from the [[University of Vermont]], published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they "always" or "nearly always" procrastinate writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"&gt;{{cite web |author= Solomon, LJ |author2=Rothblum |url= http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|date=1984|title=Academic Procrastination: Frequency and Cognitive-Behavioural Correlates|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729211829/http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study showed that "52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=Robert P. |last2=Golin |first2=Anne |last3=Kelleher |first3=Kathleen |journal=Journal of College Student Development |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=301–10|date=1992 |title=The Personal, Career, and Learning Skills Needs of College Students|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-03494-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 80–95% of college students engage in procrastination, and approximately 75% consider themselves procrastinators.

In a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater on tasks that were perceived as [[unpleasant]] or as impositions than on tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norman A. Milgram |author2=Barry Sroloff |author3=Michael Rosenbaum |title=The Procrastination of Everyday Life|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=22|number=2|date=June 1988|pages=197–212|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral criteria of academic procrastination ==
Gregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.1.12 |title=Doing the Things We Do: A Grounded Theory of Academic Procrastination |year=2007 |last1=Schraw |first1=Gregory |last2=Wadkins |first2=Theresa |last3=Olafson |first3=Lori |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=99 |pages=12–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is "to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay."&lt;ref name="Steel2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65 |url=http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |title=The Nature of Procrastination: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self-Regulatory Failure |year=2007 |last1=Steel |first1=Piers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |pages=65–94 |pmid=17201571 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401132716/http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabini &amp; Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay.

An approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the [[temporal motivation theory]]. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

== Psychological perspective==
The [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pychyl, T.|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012|title=The real reasons you procrastinate — and how to stop|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/why-you-cant-help-read-this-article-about-procrastination-instead-of-doing-your-job/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[psychologist]]s cite such behavior as a [[coping mechanism|mechanism for coping]] with the [[anxiety]] associated with starting or completing any task or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Penguin Group| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5| last = Fiore| first = Neil A| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be [[impulsiveness]]. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.&lt;ref name=Steel2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Steel |first=Piers |title=The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done |year=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-170361-4}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping responses ===
Negative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and [[cognitive dissonance]]) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00127.x |title=Self-Deception As Pretense |year=2007 |last1=Gendler |first1=Tamar Szabó |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=21 |pages=231–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosling|first=J.|title=Weakness of the Will|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian [[defense mechanisms]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping styles]] and [[self-handicapping]].  
 
Coping responses of procrastinators include the following.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

*[[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]]: Avoiding the location or situation where the task takes place (e.g. a graduate student avoiding driving into the university).
*[[Denial]] and [[trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]]: Pretending that procrastinatory behavior is not actually procrastinating, but rather a task which is more important than the avoided one, or that the essential task that should be done is not of immediate importance.
*[[Distraction]]: Engaging or immersing in other behaviors or actions to prevent awareness of the task (e.g. [[Cyberslacking|intensive video game playing or web browsing]]). The subject is very sensitive to instant gratification and becomes absorbed in coping behaviors beyond self-restraint.
* Descending [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactuality]]: Comparing consequences of one's procrastinatory behavior with others' worse situations (e.g. "Yes, I procrastinated and got a B− in the course, but I didn't fail like one other student did.")
*Valorisation: Pointing in satisfaction to what one achieved in the meantime while one should have been doing something else.
* Blaming: Delusional attributions to external factors, such as rationalizing that the procrastination is due to external forces beyond one's control (e.g. "I'm not procrastinating, but this assignment is tough.")
* Mocking: Using [[humor]] to validate one's procrastination. The person uses [[slapstick]] or slipshod methods to criticize and ridicule others' striving towards the goal.

Task- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator's outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one's behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.

In 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.010 |title=A Closer Look at the Relationships Among Trait Procrastination, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness |year=2006 |last1=Lee |first1=Dong-gwi |last2=Kelly |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Edwards |first3=Jodie K. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=40 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. "Putting things off even until the last moment isn't procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment".&lt;ref name="Sabini &amp; Silver."&gt;Sabini, J. &amp; Silver, M. (1982) Moralities of everyday life, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Steel ''et al.'' explained in 2001, "actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning".&lt;ref name="Steel2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steel | first1 = P. | last2 = Brothen | first2 = T. | last3 = Wambach | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Procrastination and Personality, Performance and Mood | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000131 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 30| issue = | pages = 95–106| doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health perspective ==
To a certain degree it is [[normality (behavior)|normal]] to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlina|first=Steve|title=How to Fall in Love with Procrastination|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055057/http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, [[stress (medicine)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Tice1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tice | first1 = DM | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = RF | year = 1997 | title = Longitudinal Study of Procrastination, Performance, Stress, and Health: The Costs and Benefits of Dawdling | jstor = 40063233 | journal = Psychological Science| volume = 8| issue = 6| page = | pages=454–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00460.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.461.1149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anxiety]], sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[crisis]] as well as loss of personal [[productivity]] and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost [[chronic condition|chronic]]. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also [[social stigma]] and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of [[Self discipline|willpower]] or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying [[mental illness|psychological disorder]], but not necessarily.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

Research on the [[physiological]] roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="Evans2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James R.|title=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-3360-4|page=293|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601195833/http://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|archivedate=1 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area of the brain that is responsible for [[executive functions|executive brain functions]] such as [[impulse control]], [[attention]] and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a [[Executive dysfunction|lack thereof]]. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one's ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in [[ADHD|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], where it is commonly underactivated.&lt;ref name="strub"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2775008 |year=1989 |last1=Strub |first1=RL |title=Frontal Lobe Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Globus Pallidus Lesions |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1024–27 |journal=Archives of Neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520450096027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in [[twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal-]] and [[twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] pairs, both traits were found to be "moderately heritable". The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (r&lt;sub&gt;genetic&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found.&lt;ref name="gustav"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustavson|first=Daniel E|author2=Miyake A|author3=Hewitt JK|author4=Friedman NP|title=Genetic Relations Among Procrastination, Impulsivity, and Goal-Management Ability Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Procrastination|journal=Psychological Science|date=4 April 2014|volume=25|doi= 10.1177/0956797614526260|pmid=24705635|issue=6|pages=1178–88|pmc=4185275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: "(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation."&lt;ref name="gustav" /&gt;

== Management ==
[[Psychologist]] William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis and Knaus, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education (college dropouts).

Perfectionism is a prime cause for procrastination&lt;ref&gt;Hillary Rettig (2011). ''The 7 Secrets of the Prolific: The Definitive Guide to Overcoming Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Writer's Block''&lt;/ref&gt; because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy [[self-esteem]] and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning,&lt;ref&gt;James Prochaska, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Principles of ACT|date=October 2015}} to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.

Behaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:{{citation needed|reason=post the paraphrased guideline/Rx protocol|date=October 2015}}

* Awareness of habits and thoughts that lead to procrastinating.
* Seeking help for self-defeating problems such as fear, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, poor time management, indecisiveness, and perfectionism.
* Fair evaluation of personal goals, strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.
* Realistic goals and personal positive links between the tasks and the concrete, meaningful goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese Hoff|date=1994|title=Time management: Test of a process model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=79|issue=3|pages=381–391|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.3.381|issn=0021-9010|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.4283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structuring and organization of daily activities. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Modification of one's environment for that newly gained perspective: the elimination or minimization of noise or distraction; investing effort into relevant matters; and ceasing day-dreaming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disciplining oneself to set priorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Motivation with enjoyable activities, socializing and constructive hobbies.
* Approaching issues in small blocks of time, instead of attempting whole problems at once and risking intimidation.
* To prevent relapse, reinforce pre-set goals based on needs and allow yourself to be rewarded in a balanced way for accomplished tasks.
 
Making a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.&lt;ref&gt;Burka &amp; Yuen (1990). ''Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It''&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers Steel suggests&lt;ref&gt;The Procrastination Equation, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that better [[time management]] is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one's "power hours" (being a "morning person" or "night owl"). A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal [[circadian rhythms]] that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the "small successes". Brian O'Leary supports that "finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive", suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one's efficiency at handling tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/work-life-is-productivity-in-the-balance|title=Work-Life: Is Productivity in the Balance?|date=2004-07-05|work=HBS Working Knowledge|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] authored an essay entitled "Structured Procrastination",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he proposes a "cheat" method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a [[pyramid scheme]] to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with a mental note that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.

== Severe and negative impact ==
For some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], irrational behaviour, low [[self-esteem]], [[anxiety]] and neurological disorders such as [[ADHD]]. Others have found relationships with [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Pychyl2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pychyl | first1 = TA | last2 = Lee | first2 = JM | last3 = Thibodeau | first3 = R | last4 = Blunt | first4 = A | year = 2000 | title = Five Days of Emotion: An Experience Sampling Study of Undergraduate Student Procrastination (special issue) | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2002-10572-019 | journal = Journal of Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 239–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress.&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained [[psychotherapy|therapist]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schouwenburg|first=H.C.|year=1993|title=Trait procrastination, time management, and academic behavior|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21344492853&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=8922AD549640D5B2BACA406E901F44B5.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1|journal=Trait Procrastination, Time Management, and Academic Behavior|volume=8|pages=647–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits,&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.

== Correlates ==
Procrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[Behavior|behavioral]] relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and [[anxiety]] to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Solomon1984" /&gt; A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.&lt;ref name="Jackson2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = T. | last2 = Fritch | first2 = A. | last3 = Nagasaka | first3 = T. | last4 = Pope | first4 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Procrastination and Perceptions of Past, Present, and Future | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2004-15383-003 | journal = Individual Differences Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 17–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between procrastination and [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|eveningness]] was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate{{Fact|date=August 2018}}. It has been shown that [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|Morningness]] increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;,&lt;ref name="Duffy2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = JF | last2 = Czeisler | first2 = CA | year = 2002 | title = Age-Related Change in the Relationship Between Circadian Period, Circadian Phase, and Diurnal Preference in Humans | url =https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394001024272 | journal = | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Perfectionism ===
{{Main|Perfectionism (psychology)}}
Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and "[[workaholic|workaholism]]". However, adaptive perfectionists—[[egosyntonic]] perfectionism—were ''less'' likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—[[egodystonic]] perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.&lt;ref name="McGarvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|title=The Almost Perfect Definition|author=McGarvey, Jason A.|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313153133/http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with "the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling".&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

=== Academic ===
According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient [[time management]] skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odaci|first1=Hatice|title=Academic Self-Efficacy and Academic Procrastination as Predictors of Problematic Internet Use in University Students|date=August 1, 2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=5624d9855cd9e38cd78b456e&amp;assetKey=AS%3A286236704034819%401445255556988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Student syndrome]]" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task [[duration (project management)|duration]] [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]]. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Ariely|first=Dan|author-link=Dan Ariely|last2=Wertenbroch|first2=Klaus|year=2002|title=Procrastination, Deadlines, and Performance: Self-Control by Precommitment|journal=Psychological Science|volume=13|issue=3|pages=219–224|url=http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Papers/deadlines.pdf|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00441|pmid=12009041|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131540/http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Papers/deadlines.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt;

Other reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |title=Procrastination |publisher=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill |website=writingcenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318150005/http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckman1991"&gt;Tuckman, BW (1991). The Development and Concurrent Validity of the Procrastination Scale [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1991-32090-001]&lt;/ref&gt; were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.&lt;ref name="Howell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = AJ | last2 = Watson | first2 = DC | last3 = Powell | first3 = RA | last4 = Buro | first4 = K | year = 2006 | title = Academic Procrastination: The Pattern and Correlates of Behavioral Postponement | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000055 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 40| issue = 8| pages = 1519–30| doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]]'' intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis &amp; Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsin Chun Chu|first=Angela|last2=Nam Choi|first2=Jin|title=Rethinking Procrastination: Positive Effects of "Active" Procrastination Behavior on Attitudes and Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=145|issue=3|pages=245–64|doi=10.3200/socp.145.3.245-264|pmid=15959999|year=2005|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.2444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s "irrational" and "postponement" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt; During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed."

Procrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201307/getting-around-procrastination|title=Getting Around to Procrastination|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = 40| issue = 6| pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.

The use of real ear measurement to assess the performance of hearing aids is covered in the [[ANSI]] specification Methods of Measurement of Real-Ear Performance Characteristics of Hearing Aids, ANSI S3.46-2013 (a revision of ANSI S3.46-1997).&lt;ref name=ANSI&gt;ANSI/ASA Standard S3.46-2013 "Methods of Measurement of Real-Ear Performance Characteristics of Hearing Aids," Acoustical Society of America, Melville, New York, http://acousticalsociety.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first commercially produced real ear measurement available was made by Rastronics.&lt;ref name="Venema CHR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venema|first1=Theodore|title=Real Ear Measures Today: Do We Truly Follow Fitting Methods?|journal=Canadian Hearing Report|date=2014|volume=9|issue=4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Help soon arrived. In the early 1980s, the first computerized probe-tube microphone
system, the Rastronics CCI-10 (developed in Denmark by Steen Rasmussen), entered the
U.S. market (Nielsen and Rasmussen, 1984). This system had a silicone tube attached to the
microphone (the transmission of sound through this tube was part of the calibration process),
which eliminated the need to place the microphone itself in the ear canal. By early 1985,
three or four different manufactures had introduced this new type of computerized probemicrophone
equipment, and this hearing aid verification procedure became part of the
standard protocol for many audiology clinics.

== Method ==

[[File:RealEarProbeTubes.png|thumb|alt=Probe tubes used in real ear measurement. |Silicone probe tubes used for real ear measurement.]]
First, the clinician will examine the ear canal with the use of an [[otoscope]] to ensure no wax or other debris will interfere with the positioning of the probe tube. The probe tube is placed with the tip approximately 6&amp;nbsp;mm (1/4 inch) from the [[tympanic membrane]]. Next the hearing aid is put in place. The REM system will typically produce a test stimulus from a loudspeaker situated {{convert|12|-|15|in|cm}} from the patient's head and simultaneously measure the output in the ear canal to determine how much amplification the hearing aid is providing.&lt;ref name=strategies2&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Michael|title=Strategies for Selecting and Verifying Hearing Aid Fittings|date=1994|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|location=NY|isbn=0-86577-500-1|pages=93–95|author2=John E. Tecca|chapter=5. Use of Real-Ear Measurements To Verify Hearing Aid Fittings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insertion gain ==

The traditional method of real ear measurement is known as [[insertion gain]], which is the difference between the sound pressure level measured near the ear drum with a hearing aid in place, and the sound pressure level measured in the unaided ear. First a measurement is made with the probe tube in the open ear (Real Ear Unaided Response, or REUR), then a second one is made using the same test signal with the hearing aid in place and turned on (Real Ear Aided Response, or REAR).  The difference between these two results is the insertion gain. This gain can be matched to targets produced by various prescriptive formula based on the patient's [[audiogram]] or individual hearing loss.&lt;ref name=strategies3&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Michael|title=Strategies for Selecting and Verifying Hearing Aid Fittings|date=1994|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|location=NY|isbn=0-86577-500-1|page=277|author2=George A. Gates|chapter=13. Aural Rehabilitation for Individuals with Severe and Profound Hearing Impairment: Hearing Aids, Cochlear Implants, Counseling, and Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech mapping ==

Speech mapping (also known as output-based measures) involves testing with a speech or speech-like signal. The hearing aid is adjusted so that the speech is amplified to the approximate middle of the patient's residual auditory area (the amplitude range between the patient's hearing threshold and upper limit of comfort) while observing a [[spectrum analyzer|real-time spectrum display]] of the speech in the patient's ear canal. Many multi-channel hearing aids allow each [[frequency]] channel to be adjusted separately. The aim is to find a good compromise between intelligibility and loudness discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Brian C.J.|title=Speech mapping is a valuable tool for fitting and counseling patients|journal=Hearing Journal|date=August 2006|volume= 59|issue=8|pages=26, 28, 30|doi=10.1097/01.HJ.0000286371.07550.5b|url=http://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/Fulltext/2006/08000/Speech_mapping_is_a_valuable_tool_for_fitting_and.5.aspx|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to hearing aid testing is implemented in most current real ear systems and there has been a significant increase in audiologists selecting to verify using the output method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Clinical Audiology|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Baltimore MD|isbn=978-0-7817-8106-0|page=859|edition=6th|author=Jack Katz |author2=Larry Medwetsky|author3= Robert Burkard|author4= Linda Hood|chapter=Chapter 38, Hearing Aid Fitting for Adults: Selection, Fitting, Verification, and Validation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a real speech signal to test a hearing aid has the advantage that features that may need to be disabled in other test approaches can be left active, and the effects of these features in normal use are included in the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Mark|title=Evaluating the Performance of a Hearing Aid in the Real-Ear|url=http://www.hearingresearch.org/ross/hearing_aids/evaluating_the_performance_of_a_hearing_aid_in_the_real-ear.php|work=Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Hearing Enhancement|accessdate=6 February 2014|location=Gallaudet University|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Brown ''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society of London|FLS]] [[Member of the Wernerian Society|MWS]] (21 December 1773 &amp;ndash; 10 June 1858) was a Scottish botanist and [[palaeobotanist]] who made important contributions to botany largely through his pioneering use of the microscope. His contributions include one of the earliest detailed descriptions of the [[cell nucleus]] and [[cytoplasmic streaming]]; the observation of [[Brownian motion]]; early work on plant [[pollination]] and [[fertilisation]], including being the first to recognise the fundamental difference between [[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperms]]; and some of the earliest studies in [[palynology]]. He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy, including the erection of a number of plant families that are still accepted today; and numerous [[Australia]]n plant genera and species, the fruit of his exploration of that continent with [[Matthew Flinders]].

==Early life==
Brown was born in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] on 21 December 1773. He was the son of [[James Brown (Scottish clergyman)|James Brown]], a minister in the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] with [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] convictions so strong that in 1788 he defied his church's decision to give allegiance to [[George III]]. His mother was Helen Brown ''née'' Taylor, the daughter of a [[Presbyterian]] minister. As a child Brown attended the local Grammar School (now called [[Montrose Academy]]), then [[Marischal College]] at [[Aberdeen]], but withdrew in his fourth year when the family moved to [[Edinburgh]] in 1790. His father died late the following year.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p15–18"&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Mabberley | year = 1985 | title = Jupiter botanicus: Robert Brown of the British Museum | publisher = British Museum (Natural History) | isbn = 3-7682-1408-7 | pages = 15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown enrolled to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], but developed an interest in [[botany]], and ended up spending more of his time on the latter than the former. He attended the lectures of [[John Walker (naturalist)|John Walker]]; made botanical expeditions into the [[Scottish Highlands]], alone or with nurserymen such as [[George Don]]; and wrote out meticulous botanical descriptions of the plants he collected. He also began corresponding with and collecting for [[William Withering]], one of the foremost British botanists of his day. Highlights for Brown during this period include his discovery of a new species of grass, ''[[Alopecurus alpinus]]''; and his first botanical paper, "[[wikisource:The botanical history of Angus|The botanical history of Angus]]", read to the Edinburgh Natural History Society in January 1792, but not published in print in Brown's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p18–28"&gt;Mabberley (1985) ''pp.'' 18–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Brown (young - larousse).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Brown as a young man]]
Brown dropped out of his medical course in 1793. Late in 1794, he enlisted in the [[Fifeshire Fencibles]], and his regiment was posted to Ireland shortly after. In June 1795 he was appointed [[Surgeon's Mate]]. His regiment saw very little action, however, he had a good deal of leisure time, almost all of which he spent on botany. He was frustrated by his itinerant lifestyle, which prevented him from building his personal library and specimen collection as he would have liked, and cut him off from the most important herbaria and libraries.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p28–60"&gt;Mabberley (1985) ''p.'' 28–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Brown was especially interested in [[cryptogam]]s, and these would be the subject of Brown's first, albeit unattributed, publication. Brown began a correspondence with [[James Dickson (botanist)|James Dickson]], and by 1796 was sending him specimens and descriptions of mosses. Dickson incorporated Brown's descriptions into his ''Fasciculi plantarum cryptogamicarum britanniae'', with Brown's permission but without any attribution.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p28–60"/&gt;

By 1800, Brown was firmly established amongst Irish botanists, and was corresponding with a number of British and foreign botanists, including Withering, Dickson, [[James Edward Smith]] and [[José Correia da Serra]]. He had been nominated to the [[Linnean Society of London]]; had contributed to Dickson's ''Fasciculi''; was acknowledged in a number of other works; and had had a species of [[algae]], ''Conferva brownii'' (now ''[[Aegagropila linnaei]]'') named after him by [[Lewis Weston Dillwyn]]. He had also begun experimenting with [[microscopy]]. However, as an army surgeon stationed in Ireland there seemed little prospect of him attracting the notice of those who could offer him a career in botany.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p28–60"/&gt;

==To Australia on the ''Investigator''==
In 1798, Brown heard that [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] had withdrawn from a proposed expedition into the interior of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (now [[Australia]]), leaving a vacancy for a [[Natural history|naturalist]]. At Brown's request, Correia wrote to [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: {{quote|Science is the gainer in this change of man; Mr Brown being a professed naturalist. He is a Scotchman, fit to pursue an object with constance and cold mind.}} He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though [[George Caley]] was sent to [[New South Wales]] as a botanical collector for Banks. In 1800, however, [[Matthew Flinders]] put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders' proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p59–63"&gt;Mabberley (1985), ''pp.'' 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparations===
Brown was told to expect to sail at the end of 1800, only a few weeks after being offered the position. A succession of delays meant the voyage did not get under way until July 1801. Brown spent much of the meantime preparing for the voyage by studying Banks' Australian plant specimens and copying out notes and descriptions for use on the voyage.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p66-72"&gt;Mabberley (1985), ''pp.'' 66–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Brown's brief was collect scientific specimens of all sorts, he was told to give priority to plants, insects, and birds, and to treat other fields, such as [[geology]], as secondary pursuits. In addition to Brown, the scientific staff comprised the renowned [[botanical illustrator]] [[Ferdinand Bauer]]; the gardener [[Peter Good]], whose task was to collect live plants and viable seed for the use of [[Kew Gardens]]; the [[miner]] [[John Allen (miner)|John Allen]], appointed as [[mineralogist]]; the [[landscape artist]] [[William Westall]]; and the [[astronomer]] [[John Crosley]], who would fall ill on the voyage out and leave the ship at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], being belatedly replaced at Sydney by [[James Inman]]. Brown was given authority over Bauer and Good, both of whom were instructed to give any specimens they might collect to Brown, rather than forming separate collections. Both men would provide enthusiastic and hard-working companions for Brown, and thus Brown's specimen collections contain material collected by all three men.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p66-72"/&gt;

===Desertas, Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope===
''Investigator'' sailed from London on 18 July. They made brief landfalls at [[Bugio Island]] ([[Desertas Islands]]) and [[Madeira]], but Brown was disappointed to collect almost nothing of note from either site. They arrived at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 16 October, staying a little over two weeks, during which time Brown made extensive botanical expeditions, and climbed [[Table Mountain]] at least twice. Many years later he would write to [[William Henry Harvey]], who was considering emigrating there, that "some of the pleasantest botanizing he ever had was on [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Mountain]], near [[Cape Town]], and he thought I could not pitch on a more delightful field of study."&lt;ref name="Harvey 1869"&gt;{{cite book | author = Harvey, William Henry | year = 1869 | title = Memoirs of W. H. Harvey, M.D., F.R.S., etc., etc., late professor of botany, Trinity College, Dublin. | page = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the plants collected at the Cape were two new species of ''[[Serruria]]'' ([[Proteaceae]]), ''[[Serruria foeniculacea|S.&amp;nbsp;foeniculacea]]'' and ''[[Serruria flagellaris|S.&amp;nbsp;flagellaris]]''.&lt;ref name="Mabberley 1985 p73–79"&gt;Mabberley (1985), ''pp.'' 73–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{HMS|Investigator|1801|2}} arrived in [[King George Sound]] in what is now [[Western Australia]] in December 1801. For three and a half years Brown did intensive botanic research in Australia, collecting about 3400 species, of which about 2000 were previously unknown.  A large part of this collection was lost when {{HMS|Porpoise|1799|2}} was wrecked ''en route'' to England.

Brown remained in Australia until May 1805.  He then returned to Britain where he spent the next five years working on the material he had gathered.  He published numerous species descriptions; in Western Australia alone he is the author of nearly 1200 species. The list of major Australian genera that he named includes: [[Livistona]], [[Triodia (plant)|Triodia]], [[Eriachne]], [[Caladenia]], [[Isolepis]], [[Prasophyllum]], [[Pterostylis]], [[Patersonia]], [[Conostylis]], [[Thysanotus]], [[Pityrodia]], [[Hemigenia]], [[Lechenaultia]], [[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]], [[Logania]], [[Dryandra]], [[Isopogon]], [[Grevillea]], [[Petrophile]], [[Waratah|Telopea]], [[Leptomeria]], [[Jacksonia (plant)|Jacksonia]], [[Leucopogon]], [[Stenopetalum]], [[Ptilotus]], [[Sclerolaena]] and [[Rhagodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Keighery, G. and Gibson, N., ‘The influence of Robert Brown on Western Australian botany’, ''Australian Garden History'', 14 (3), 2002, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==
{{Distinguished men of science of Great Britain 1806-7}}
In early 1809 he read his paper called ''[[On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae]]'' to the [[Linnean Society of London]]. This was subsequently published in March 1810 as ''On the Proteaceae of Jussieu''. It is significant for its contribution to the [[systematics]] of Proteaceae, and to the [[floristics]] of [[Australia]], and also for its application of [[palynology]] to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury]], who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in [[Joseph Knight (horticulturist)|Joseph Knight's]] 1809 publication ''[[On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae]]''.

In 1810, he published the results of his collecting in his famous ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', the first systematic account of the Australian flora.  That year, he succeeded [[Jonas C. Dryander]] as Sir [[Joseph Banks]]' librarian, and on Banks' death in 1820 Brown inherited his [[library]] and [[herbarium]]. This was transferred to the [[British Museum]] in 1827, and Brown was appointed [[Keeper of Botany, Natural History Museum|Keeper of the Banksian Botanical Collection]].

In 1818 he published ''[[Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo]]''. In 1822, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Linnean Society]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1827 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, three years later he became associated member. When the institute became the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1851 Brown joined as foreign member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004412 |title=R. Brown (1773 - 1858) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper read to the Linnean society in 1831 and published in 1833, Brown named the [[cell nucleus]]. The nucleus had been observed before, perhaps as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist [[Leeuwenhoek]], and [[Franz Bauer]] had noted and drawn it as a regular feature of plant cells in 1802, but it was Brown who gave it the name it bears to this day (while giving credit to Bauer's drawings). Neither Bauer nor Brown thought the nucleus to be universal, and Brown thought it to be primarily confined to [[Monocotyledons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harris, Henry | title = The Birth of the Cell | year = 1999 | publisher = Yale University Press | pages = 76&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first [[Keeper of Botany, Natural History Museum|Keeper of the Botanical Department]], remaining so until his death. He was succeeded by [[John Joseph Bennett]].

He served as President of the [[Linnean Society]] from 1849 to 1853.

Brown died at 17 Dean Street, [[Soho Square]] in [[London]], on 10 June 1858.&lt;ref name=spectator&gt;{{cite news | title = Deaths | date = 19 June 1858 | url = http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-june-1858/20/deaths | work = [[The Spectator]] | pages = 20 | accessdate = 19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41059 |title=Soho Square Area: Portland Estate: Nos. 31-32 Soho Square: Twentieth Century House |author=F.

Brown's name is commemorated in the Australia [[herb]] [[genus]] ''[[Brunonia]]'' as well as numerous Australian species such as ''[[Eucalyptus brownii]]'', ''[[Banksia brownii]]'' and the moss [[Tetrodontium brownianum|Brown's Tetrodontium Moss]] (''Tetrodontium brownianum''), a species which he discovered growing at [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] near [[Edinburgh]] whilst still a student. The plant can still be found at the site of its discovery.&lt;ref name=RBGE&gt;[http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/cryptogamic-plants-and-fungi/bryology "Bryology (mosses, liverworts and hornworts)"] Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

Passing through the suburb of Kingston, south of Hobart, Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, is [[Browns River (Tasmania)|Brown's River]], named in his honor, upon the banks of which, he collected botanical samples. In South Australia, Mount Brown and Point Brown (near [[Smoky Bay, South Australia|Smoky Bay]]) were named for him by Flinders during the ''Investigator'' expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Flinders| first = Matthew| authorlink = Matthew Flinders| title  = A Voyage to Terra Australis : undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802, and 1803 in His Majesty's ship the Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland Schooner; with an account of the shipwreck of the Porpoise, arrival of the Cumberland at Mauritius, and imprisonment of the commander during six years and a half in that island.| url= http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=229&amp;fk_files=1486723

== Brownian motion ==
In 1827, while examining grains of pollen of the plant ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]''  suspended in water under a [[microscope]], Brown observed minute particles, now known to be amyloplasts (starch organelles) and spherosomes (lipid organelles), ejected from the pollen grains, executing a continuous jittery motion.  He then observed the same motion in particles of inorganic matter, enabling him to rule out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related.  Although Brown did not provide a theory to explain the motion, and [[Jan Ingenhousz]] already had reported a similar effect using charcoal particles, in German and French publications of 1784 and 1785,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = van der Pas, Peter W. | title = The Discovery of Brownian motion | journal = Scientiarum Historia | year = 1971 | volume = 13 | pages = 17 | url = http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/BM-History.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenon is now known as [[Brownian motion]].

In recent years controversy arose over whether Brown's microscopes were insufficient to reveal phenomena of this order. Brown's re-discoveries were denied in a brief paper in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Deutsch, D. H. | title = Did Robert Brown Observe Brownian Motion: Probably Not | journal = Scientific American | year = 1991 | volume = 265 | pages = 20}}- See also Bulletin of the American Physical Society, 36 (4): 1374, April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, in an illustrated presentation, British microscopist [[Brian J. Ford]] presented to Inter Micro 1991 in Chicago a reprise of the demonstration using Brown's original microscope. His video sequences substantiated Brown's observations, suggesting Brown's microscope was sufficient to allow him to see motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ford, Brian J. | title = Robert Brown, Brownian Movement, and Teethmarks on the Hatbrim | journal = The Microscope | year = 1991 | volume = 39 | pages = 161&amp;ndash;171 }}- See also [http://www.brianjford.com/wbbrowna.htm this site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicist Phil Pearle and colleagues presented a detailed discussion of Brown's original observations of particles from pollen of ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]'' undergoing Brownian motion, including the relevant history, botany, microscopy, and physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pearle, P., Collett, B., Bart, K., Bilderback, D., Newman, D., and Samuels, S.

'''Robert Halliday Gunning''' [[FRSE]] [[Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh|PRPSE]] FSA [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] (12 December 1818–22 March 1900) was a Scottish surgeon, entrepreneur and philanthropist. He did much to improve social conditions in [[Brazil]] and also became rich there. He endowed numerous prizes and awards including the '''Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prizes'''. The [[University of Edinburgh]] provides scholarships under the title of '''Gunning Victoria Jubilee Bursaries'''. He was a close friend of both [[Thomas Chalmers]] and [[Robert Christison]].

==Life==
[[File:The grave of Robert Halliday Gunning, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of Robert Halliday Gunning, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
He was born Richard Halliday Gunnion on 12 December 1818 at Wood House in [[Ruthwell]] on the southern coast of [[Dumfriesshire]]. He was the eighth of ten children of Elizabeth Affleck McWilliam and James Gunnion. In 1822 the family moved to [[Kirkbean]] on the opposite side of the [[River Nith]] and later to [[New Abbey]] before settling in [[Dumfries]]. He was educated at the local school in Ruthwell then [[Dumfries Academy]].

He studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from around 1832. From 1835 he worked on the staff of Dumfries &amp; Galloway Royal Infirmary. In 1839, aged 20, he was licensed to practice as a surgeon by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]. In 1840 he went to [[Marischal College]] in [[Aberdeen]] to act as Demonstrator to Professor Allan Thomson (a demonstrator performs surgery on [[Cadaver|cadavers]] whilst the professor lectures). In 1841 both Thomson and Gunning went to the [[University of Edinburgh]], Thomson to take over as Professor of Physiology, Gunning to oversee the anatomy rooms under [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Professor Alexander Monro]]. Gunning was skilled, and in one of the world’s most prestigious centres for the training of doctors in the mid-19th century. His pupils included [[William Tennant Gairdner]], [[William Overend Priestley]] and [[Henry Duncan Littlejohn]]. The University granted him his doctorate (MD) in 1846.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baillie|first=T.W.|date=2003|title=Robert Halliday Gunning and the Victoria Jubilee Prizes|url=https://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/research_awards/prizes/prize_lists/gunning_victoria_history.pdf|journal=Scottish Medical Journal|publisher=Longman Group|publication-place=Edinburgh|volume=48|issue=2|pages=54-57|doi=10.1177/003693300304800209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, as a religious man, Gunning’s world was rocked by the [[Disruption of 1843|Disruption]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] which caused a split in the church, and in the allegiance of congregations. Gunning was an admirer of Rev Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]] who had led the split, and admired his vision of free schools, church missions etc. Gunning joined Chalmer’s church in the [[West Port, Edinburgh]] rising to be a [[Elder (Christianity)|church elder]]. Gunning gave large sums to the church throughout his later life, including the full cost of a model lodging house attached to the church for housing the poor of the parish. In 1882 he laid the foundation stone to the replacement church on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street: The Chalmers Territorial Free Church, seating over 900 persons, and paid for almost entirely by Gunning. At this same period, also through the influence of Chalmers and [[Robert Christison]], he persuaded the University of Edinburgh to add the requirement for the study of at least one natural science into its theology degree, the University thereafter being one of the first universities to combine these two apparently diametrically opposed fields. In this, all felt that new discoveries in a science in no way undermined religion, and indeed science should be used as a means to back religious ideologies. Gunning paid for these extra lectures at his own expense, making it hard for the University to refuse.

From 1846 to 1848 he served as President of the [[Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh]]. During this period he lived at 12 Argyll Square, close to the University,&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1846-7&lt;/ref&gt; and following his marriage in 1847 he moved to a larger house at 43 George Square.

Following in the footsteps of [[Robert Mortimer Glover]], the more recognised [[James Young Simpson]], and the overtly practical [[Francis Brodie Imlach]], Gunning undertook experiments on the use and safety of [[chloroform]] during 1847/8. Gunning was firmly in the Glover camp: that chloroform was too dangerous for use on humans for full anaesthesia (Imlach used only partial anaesthesia, for dental extractions, perhaps the most logical use). In May 1848 he presented his findings to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh and was critical of Simpson’s advocacy of human use. Simpson (there present) defended his beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, public opinion, including a knighthood for Simpson and widespread media coverage, dominated the feelings of the general public. Medical truth was therefore suppressed and the use of chloroform spread widely, much to the delight of [[James Duncan (surgeon)|Dr James Duncan]] of Duncan &amp; Flockhart of Edinburgh, who held the British licence for production. Gunning’s experiments confirmed those of Glover (who had already left Britain in his disgust of Simpson’s plagiarism of his own work, Simpson being the official reader of Glover’s university thesis on the subject). Gunning also established that Simpson had undertaken no systematic experimentation whatsoever.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gunning equally became disillusioned at his own profession.

As a combination of these factors, and apparent health problems, he and his new wife left Britain and emigrated to [[Brazil]] for a different life. He kept in regular written contact with his friend [[Robert Christison]], and sent him supplies of [[Ipecacuanha]] from Brazil, this being the basis of a drug used to treat [[dysentery]]. The two hatched a scheme to grow the plant in [[India]] to treat many cases there without need for such transport distances.

Gunning set up home, and a medical practice, in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He also began investing in various ventures including gold mines and creating a railway system across Brazil (mainly on the coast-line). He also created the first street-car (tram) system in Rio. In 1872 he moved to [[Palmeiras, Bahia|Palmeiras]] to be closer to his mining interests. Here he was visited by notable persons such as [[Louis Agassiz]] who sought (and gained) funding for his projects. Gunning’s investments proved lucrative. His already great wealth grew. Emperor [[Dom Pedro II]] of Brazil created him a Grand Dignitary of the Empire of Brazil and awarded him the Order of the Rose, for his work in improving the lives of the poor of Brazil. Dom Pedro wrote to [[Queen Victoria]] asking that this be recognised in Britain and this was agreed. He was afterwards entitled to the title "His Excellency Robert Gunning". His wife died in 1877 and is buried in Edinburgh. He returned to Britain in 1882 as a millionaire.

In 1882 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Alison]], [[John Hutton Balfour]], Rev John Duns, [[Andrew Douglas Maclagan]] and [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]]. He donated a large sum to the Society to fund the Gunning [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] Jubilee Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went blind around 1890. He died at 12 Addison Crescent in [[Kensington]], [[London]] on 22 March 1900. His body was taken to Edinburgh for burial in the [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] with his first wife, Eliza, following a memorial service at West Port Church. The grave is in the south-east corner against the eastern boundary wall.

==Family==

He was married twice: firstly in 1847 to Eliza Meikle (died 1877) of Springfield House, [[Govan]]; secondly, in old age in 1890, to Lady Mary Agnes Winwood Hughes, 30 years his junior. She was the daughter of Sir William Smith, 3rd Baronet&lt;ref name="thepeerage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p48171.htm#i481708|title=Robert Halliday Gunning|last=Lundy|first=Darryl|date=|website=thepeerage.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and widow of Sir Thomas Collingwood Hughes, 8th Baronet.&lt;ref name="thepeerage2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p56635.htm#i566342|title=Mary Agnes Winwood Smith|last=Lundy|first=Darryl|date=|website=thepeerage.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had no children by either marriage.

==Prizes Funded by Gunning==

Over and above the [[Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize]]s, awarded by both the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], Gunning funded 13 ongoing bursaries jointly known as the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Bursaries but each having their own name (concealing the Gunning connection). These are often erroneously assumed to be founded by the persons after whom they are named, but all are founded by Gunning:

*The Alison Prize for Community Medicine (named after [[William Alison]])
*The Bell Prize for Physiology (named after the brothers Charles and John Bell)
*The Joseph Black Prize for Chemistry (named after [[Joseph Black]])
*The Christison Prize for Pharmacology (named after his best friend [[Robert Christison]])
*The Edward Forbes Prize for Zoology (named after [[Edward Forbes]])
*The Gregory Prize for the Practice of Physic (Medicine) (named after [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]])
*The Hutton Balfour Prize for Botany (named after [[John Hutton Balfour]])
*The Lister Prize for Surgery (named after [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister]])
*The Maclagan Prize for Forensic Medicine (named after [[Andrew Douglas Maclagan]])
*The Monro Prize for Anatomy (named after his mentor and friend [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Dr Alexander Monro]])
*The Thomson Prize for Pathology (named after his mentor Prof James Thomson)
*The Simpson Prize for Obstetrics (named after [[James Young Simpson]])... this latter prize clearly has an irony given his conflict with Simpson, it perhaps was intended to convey (within the closed medical world) that he saw Simpson’s contribution as extending no further than the field of Obstetrics.
*The Cullen Victoria Jubilee Prize (a very large bursary named after Prof [[William Cullen]])

==Other Philanthropic Works==

Gunning paid for various works in [[St Giles Cathedral]] in Edinburgh including the plaque to [[Jenny Geddes]] in 1886 and the magnificent faux-medieval tomb to the Marquess of Argyll (erected 1895).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1886, Gunning paid for the bulk of the cost of the Covenanters Memorial at [[Deerness]].&lt;ref name="ayrshirehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrshirehistory.org.uk/Shorts/deerness.htm|title=Deerness Covenanter Memorial|last=Close|first=Rob|date=|website=ayrshirehistory.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sesamoiditis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[sesamoid bone]]s.

==Humans==
[[Image:Sesamoid-skeletalfront.gif|thumb|human sesamoid bones]]
Sesamoiditis occurs on the bottom of the foot, just behind the [[big toe]]. There are normally two sesamoid bones on each foot; sometimes sesamoids can be [[wikt:bipartite|bipartite]], which means they each comprise two separate pieces. The sesamoids are roughly the size of [[jelly bean]]s.  The sesamoid bones act as a fulcrum for the [[flexor]] [[tendon]]s, the tendons which bend the big toe downward.

Symptoms include inflammation and pain.

Sometimes a sesamoid bone is fractured. This can be difficult to pick up on [[X-ray]], so a [[bone scan]] or [[MRI]] is a better alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ms700pduhpQC&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=Sesamoiditis+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j3A_VO7mAtDLsASqyYLYCg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sesamoiditis%20baseball&amp;f=false|title=Sports Medicine of Baseball|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who are susceptible to the malady are dancers, catchers and pitchers in baseball, soccer players, and football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBF2nt5wddcC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=Sesamoiditis+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j3A_VO7mAtDLsASqyYLYCg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sesamoiditis%20baseball&amp;f=false|title=The Anatomy of Sports Injuries|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_65DCRDPyQC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Sesamoiditis+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j3A_VO7mAtDLsASqyYLYCg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sesamoiditis%20baseball&amp;f=false|title=Tarascon Sports Medicine Pocketbook|publisher=|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horses==
[[Image:Equine-dist-forelimb-bones.png|thumb|right|300px|Location of the sesamoid bones, behind the fetlock.]]
In the horse it occurs at the horse's [[fetlock]]. The sesamoid bones lie behind the bones of the fetlock, at the back of the joint, and help to keep the tendons and [[ligament]]s that run between them correctly functioning.

Usually [[periostitis]] (new bone growth) occurs along with sesamoiditis, and the [[suspensory ligament]] may also be affected. Sesamoiditis results in inflammation, pain, and eventually bone growth.

==Causes==

In humans, excessive forces caused by sudden bending upwards of the big toe, [[high heels]], or a stumble can contribute to sesamoiditis. Once the sesamoid bone is injured it can be very difficult to cure, because every time you walk you put additional pressure on the sesamoid bone.  Treatment in humans consists of [[anti-inflammatory medication]], [[cortisone]] injections, strapping to immobilize the big toe, and [[orthotics]] with special accommodations to keep pressure off the affected bone.

In horses, sesamoiditis is generally caused by excess stress on the fetlock joint. Conformation that promotes sesamoiditis include long [[pastern]]s, or horses with long toes and low heels.

A '''shoulder presentation''' refers to a [[Presentation (obstetrics)|malpresentation]] at [[childbirth]] where the baby is in a transverse lie (its vertebral column is perpendicular to that of the mother), thus the leading part (the part that enters first the birth canal) is an [[arm]], [[shoulder]], or the trunk. While a baby can be delivered vaginally when either the head or the feet/buttocks are the leading part, it usually cannot be expected to be delivered successfully with a shoulder presentation unless a [[cesarean section]] (C/S) is performed.

==Frequency and causes==
Shoulder presentations are uncommon (about 0.5% of births)&lt;!--this reference is out of date per [[WP:MEDRS]]--&gt;&lt;ref name=hellman&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Hellman LM, Pritchard JA |title=Williams Obstetrics, 14th Edition | publisher=Appleton Century Crofts | year=1971 | page=872ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; as usually towards the end of [[gestation]] either the head or the buttocks start to enter the upper part of the pelvis anchoring the fetus in a longitudinal lie. It is not known in all cases of shoulder presentation why the longitudinal lie is not reached, but possible causes include bony abnormalities of the pelvis, uterine abnormalities such as malformations or tumors (fibroids), and other tumors in the pelvis or abdomen can also lead to a shoulder presentation. Other factors are a lax abdominal musculature, uterine overdistension (i.e. [[polyhydramnios]]), [[multiple gestation]], [[placenta previa]], a small fetus, or a fetus with some abnormality. Further, if the amniotic fluid sac ruptures the shoulder or arm may become wedged as a shoulder presentation.

==Diagnosis==
Inspection of the abdomen may already give a clue as it is wide from side to side. Usually performing the [[Leopold's maneuvers]] will demonstrate the transverse lie of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lydon-Rochelle |first1=Mona |last2=Albers |first2=Leah |last3=Gotwocia |first3=Julie |last4=Craig |first4=Ellen |last5=Qualls |first5=Clifford |title=Accuracy of Leopold Maneuvers in Screening for Malpresentation: A Prospective Study |journal=[[Birth (journal)|Birth]] |date=September 1993 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=132–135 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1993.tb00437.x |pmid=8240620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultrasound examination delivers the diagnosis and may indicate possible causes such as multiple gestation or a tumor. On vaginal examination, the absence of a head or feet/breech is apparent.

Shoulder presentations are classified into four types, based on the location of the scapula:
*Left scapula-anterior (LSA)
*Right scapula-anterior (RSA)
*Left scapula-posterior (LSP)
*Right scapula-posterior (RSP)

==Management==
While a transverse lie prior to labor can be manually versed to a longitudinal lie, once the uterus [[childbirth|starts contracting]] the uterus normally will not allow any version procedure. A shoulder presentation is an indication for a [[caesarean section]]. Generally, as it is diagnosed early, the baby is not damaged by the time of delivery. With the rupture of the membranes, there is an increased risk of a [[cord prolapse]] as the shoulder may not completely block the birth canal. Thus the [[caesarean section]] is ideally performed before the membranes break.

===Delivery of the second twin===
The delivery of the second twin in a transverse lie with a shoulder presentation represents a special situation that may be amenable to a vaginal delivery. As the first twin has just been delivered and the cervix is fully dilated the obstetrician may perform an internal version, that is inserting one hand into the uterus, find the baby’s feet, and then bring the baby into a breech position and deliver the baby as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabinovici J, Barkai G, Reichman B, Serr DM, Mashiach S | title=Internal podalic version with unruptured membranes for the second twin in transverse lie. |journal=Obstet. Gynecol. | date=March 1988 |pmid=3347429 |volume=71 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=428–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impaction===
During labor the shoulder will be wedged into the pelvis and the head lie in one iliac fossa, the breech in the other. With further uterine contractions the baby suffocates.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt; The uterus continues to try to expel the impacted fetus and as its retraction ring rises, the musculature in the lower segments thins out leading eventually to a uterine rupture and the death of the mother.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Diab AE  |title=Uterine ruptures in Yemen  |journal=Saudi Medical journal |year=2005 | pmid=15770303 | volume=26 | issue=2 | pages=264–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impacted shoulder presentations contribute to [[maternal mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Chamiso B |title=Rupture of pregnant uterus in Shashemene Hospital, south Shoa, Ethiopia (a three year study of 57 cases)| journal=[[Ethiopian Medical Journal|Ethiop. Med. J.]] |date=October 1995|pmid=8674491 |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 251–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously a cesarean section should be performed before the baby has died, but even when the baby has died or impaction has occurred, C/S is the method of choice of delivery, as alternative methods of delivery are potentially too traumatic for the mother. If the baby is [[preterm labour|preterm]] or macerated and very small a spontaneous delivery has been observed.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt;

==History==
[[File:1690 Handgriff der Justine Siegemundin.jpg|right|thumb|Internal version according to Siegemundin, 1690]]
Prior to the arrival of C/S the fetus usually died during protracted labor and the mother's life was at risk as well due to infection, uterine rupture and bleeding. On occasion, if the baby was macerated and small, it collapsed sufficiently to be delivered. The shoulder presentation was a feared obstetrical complication.

In 1690 [[Justine Siegemundin]], a German [[midwife]], published ''Die Kgl. Preußische und Chur-Brandenburgische Hof-Wehemutter''. This treatise for midwives demonstrated abnormal [[presentation (obstetrics)|presentation]]s at birth and their management. She was the first to describe a two-handed method of performing an internal rotation of the baby to extract it as a breech (a variation of which is performed today on the second twin, see above) using a sling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Speert H| title=Iconographia Gyniatrica |publisher=F. A. Davis|year=1973 |ISBN=0-8036-8070-8| page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was useful provided the fetus was not impacted. Once the uterus had contracted around the baby tightly, destructive interventions were used to save the life of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mann RM  |title=Case of Arm and Shoulder Presentation in Which Evisceration was Performed. | journal=Association Medical Journal |date=1856-04-14  |pmc=2439677 |page=308 |volume=4 |issue=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==
Shoulder presentation is a malpresentation that is not to be confused with [[shoulder dystocia]], a complication during the birth of a baby in a [[vertex presentation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7549">'''Sigma Sigma Phi''' ('''ΣΣΦ''' or '''SSP'''), is the national [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]] honors fraternity for medical students training to be [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.). The National Osteopathic Medicine Honors Fraternity is a group united in the interest of preserving the highest class of medical scholastic excellence and includes community service.

Sigma Sigma Phi was founded in 1921, and the fraternity's goal is to directly impact the student bodies by encouraging the highest class of academic excellence. Criteria for membership into Sigma Sigma Phi include scholastic achievement, such as class rank and dedication to community service and the highest class of academic excellence.

==History==
Sigma Sigma Phi was founded by seven students representing the fraternal organizations and the student body in October 1921 in [[Kirksville, Missouri]] at what is currently [[A.T. Still University]] (originally named American School of Osteopathy). These seven students constituted the original charter members, one from each fraternity and one from the nonfraternal body, and drew up the organization's constitution and by-laws. The fraternity was officially chartered on May 16, 1925, at [[Des Moines University]] College of Osteopathic Medicine by three men. Thus, there were ten charter members. Over the years, most osteopathic medical schools have added a local chapter. Currently, there are 22 active chapters at 24 osteopathic medical school campuses in the United States.&lt;ref name="sigmasigmaphi.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmasigmaphi.org/ |title=Sigma Sigma Phi National |author= |date=2011 |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Association |accessdate=29 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraternity objectives==

* To further the science of Osteopathic Medicine and its standards of practice.&lt;ref name="sigmasigmaphi.org"/&gt;
* To preserve the meaning of and encourage scholastic excellence.
* To continue a high degree of fellowship among its students.
* To cultivate relationships and understanding between the student bodies and officials, such as Faculty members of our Colleges.
* To foster allegiance to the [[American Osteopathic Association]].
* To perpetuate Sigma Sigma Phi by preserving the principles and objectives of the organization.

==Criteria for admission==

# Student chapter membership shall not exceed 25% of the total of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th year classes.&lt;ref name="sigmasigmaphi.org"/&gt;
# Must be an osteopathic medical student (a D.O. student).
# Must have successfully completed at least one semester of classroom work with high standards.
# Must believe in a high degree of scholarship and service to college and/or profession.

'''Sleep studies''' are tests that record the body activity during sleep. They are helpful in identification of [[sleep disorder]]s.  [[Polysomnography]], a type of sleep study, is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] to rule out [[obstructive sleep apnea]].  If a home study does not find obstructive sleep apnea, but the patient still complains of unrefreshing sleep and daytime sleepiness, an in-lab polysomnogram may be necessary to find other possible disorders.&lt;ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Sharon M.|title=Polysomnography vs. the home sleep study: Which is better?|url=http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/polysomnography-vs-the-home-sleep-study-which-is-better/article/226158/#http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/polysomnography-vs-the-home-sleep-study-which-is-better/article/226158|publisher=Clinical Advisor|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utility==
Sleep studies can help diagnose or rule out:
* Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as [[sleep apnea]]&lt;ref name=nhlbi&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are Sleep Studies?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/slpst/|publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;
* Sleep-related [[seizure disorders]]&lt;ref name=nhlbi/&gt;
* Sleep-related movement disorders, such as periodic limb movement disorder, which is repeated muscle [[Myoclonus|twitching]] of the [[foot|feet]], [[Human leg|legs]], or [[arm]]s during sleep.&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhlbi/&gt; Sleep studies may be used to diagnose or rule out [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS). However, RLS usually is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, medical history, and a physical exam.&lt;ref name=nhlbi/&gt;
* Problems sleeping at night ([[insomnia]]) : caused by [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], depression, hunger, physical discomfort, or other problem&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;
* Sleep disorders that cause extreme daytime tiredness, such as [[narcolepsy]]&lt;ref name=nhlbi/&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt; or [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]s.
* Problems with nighttime behaviours, such as [[sleepwalking]], [[night terrors]], or [[bed-wetting]]&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;
* [[Bruxism]] or grinding of the teeth during sleep&lt;ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study/&gt;
* Problems sleeping during the day because of working at night or rotating shift work. This sleep problem is called [[shift work sleep disorder]].&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt; 
* Sleep studies can also determine problems with [[Sleep|stages of sleep]]. The two primary categories of sleep are [[non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) and [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM). Normally,  four to five series of NREM and REM make up a night's sleep. A change in this cycle may make it hard to sleep soundly.&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;

==Types==
The most common sleep studies are:

===Simple sleep study===
A simple sleep study is done in the home.&lt;ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study/&gt;

===Polysomnogram===
Polysomnography records several body functions during sleep, including brain activity, eye movement, oxygen and carbon dioxide blood levels, heart rate and rhythm, breathing rate and rhythm, the flow of air through the mouth and nose, snoring, body muscle movements, and chest and belly movement.&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleep Studies|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-studies|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)===
The [[Multiple sleep latency test|MSLT]] measures, by several nap opportunities in one day, how long it takes a person to fall asleep. It also determines whether REM sleep appears upon falling asleep.&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=medicaid&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicaid and Health Choice and Clinical Coverage Policy No.: 1A-20|url=http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dma/mp/1A20.pdf|publisher=NC Division of Medical Assistance Sleep Studies Polysomnography Services|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is usually performed immediately after an overnight study.

===Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)===
This test measures whether a person can stay awake during a time when she or he is normally awake.&lt;ref name=WebMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=medicaid/&gt; Like the MSLT, the MWT is performed in a sleep diagnostic center over 4 - 5 nap periods. A mean sleep onset latency of less than 10 minutes is suggestive of excessive daytime sleepiness.

===Home Sleep Test (HST)===
The Home Sleep Test also called an Out of Sleep Center Test (OCST) is used exclusively for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. Portable equipment is sent home with the patient. The channels are usually limited to airflow, respiratory effort, and oximetry.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''The Alliance for Safe Children''' ('''TASC''') is a [[non-profit]] organization formed in 2002 to address the issue of child injury in the developing world.&lt;ref name = "TASCinfo"&gt;[http://www.ilsf.org/node/322 TASC info page] hosted on [[International Life Saving Federation]] web site. (retrieved Oct. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The founder is [[Pete Peterson]], former [[United States Ambassador to Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite news|title=Children from developing world dying of preventable injuries: UN|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200210/s694479.htm|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=6 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Linnon is the technical director.&lt;ref name="ethirajan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ethirajan|first=Anbarasan|title=Drowning: Bangladesh's invisible epidemic|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11439029|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TASC works in cooperation with other organizations, such as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former US Ambassador wants to assist Vietnamese children |url=http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Former-US-Ambassador-wants-to-assist-Vietnamese-children/20064/35432.vov|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=VOV News|date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEFfatal"/&gt;
Its aims include raising awareness of child injury; promoting injury prevention programmes; conducting and supporting research;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giashuddin|first=Sheikh M|author2=Aminur Rahman |author3=Fazlur Rahman |author4=Saidur Rahman Mashreky |author5=Salim Mahmud Chowdhury |author6=Michael Linnan |author7=Shumona Shafinaz |title=Socioeconomic inequality in child injury in Bangladesh – implication for developing countries|journal=International Journal for Equity in Health|year=2009|volume=8|issue=7|url=http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/8/1/7|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
raising funds and creating alliances with [[NGOs]], international organisations and governments so that the number of child injuries can be reduced.&lt;ref name = "TASCinfo"/&gt;
TASC's objectives are driven in part by studies suggesting that far more children die from preventable injury than from infectious disease - according to UNICEF about one million children die of preventible injuries each year.&lt;ref name="children"/&gt; A common specific cause of death is drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lynn P.|title=Who's got the power?: transforming health systems for women and children|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=978-1-84407-224-8|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLFxoq25GnwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Walton Patey''' (20 February 1932 – 25 May 1970) was a Scottish [[climbing|climber]], [[mountaineer]], doctor and writer. He was a leading Scottish climber of his day, particularly excelling on winter routes. He died in a climbing accident at the age of 38. He was probably best known for his humorous songs and prose about climbing, many of which were published posthumously in the collection ''One Man's Mountains''.

==Early life==
He was born on 20 February 1932 at [[Ellon, Scotland]].&lt;ref name="BMJ obituary"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary:T. W. Patey |journal=British Medical Journal |date=27 June 1970 |volume=2 |issue=5712 |page=800 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5712.799}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Ellon Academy]] and [[Robert Gordon's College]] in Aberdeen. He studied medicine at the [[University of Aberdeen]], graduating in 1955 with a [[MB ChB]].&lt;ref name="BMJ obituary"/&gt;

==Medical career==
Patey worked for ten years as a [[general practitioner]] (GP) in [[Ullapool]], in the far north-west of Scotland.&lt;ref name="Herald death"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lpVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1983%2C5075731 |title=Noted Scots Climber dies in fall |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=26 May 2017 |page=1 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served for four years as Surgeon Lieutenant in the Royal Marines at the [[42 Commando]] School at [[Bickleigh Barracks|Bickleigh]].&lt;ref name="BMJ obituary"/&gt;

==Climbing==
He first became interested in climbing while he was in the [[The Scout Association|Scouts]], but it was at University in Aberdeen, that he first revealed his full talent as an exploratory climber, captaining the [[The Lairig Club|Lairig Club]]. Much of his early exploratory routes were on [[Lochnagar]] and neighboring [[Cairngorms]]. A dedicated climber, he often dropped all other commitments for the prospect of a good climb. Patey's preference of travelling light extended to leaving his gloves behind on some ice climbs and he had a disrespect for [[climbing ropes]] unless they were necessary.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} While he was at Bickleigh, he would regularly open up new climbs on the Devon Tors. He cared little about recording these climbing details, since that way, if routes were left unblemished and apparently virgin, those following could have a similar excitement in their experience. This generosity of spirit, along with his exuberance and irrepressive energy, left a lasting memory with his companions. His irreverent climbing songs would often be accompanied at a piano by incessant humming through a comb and paper.

He climbed extensively in Scotland, (making the first winter traverse of the [[Cuillin]] ridge with [[Hamish MacInnes]], David Crabbe and Brian Robertson in 1965), as well as achieving notable ascents in the [[Alps]] and the [[Karakoram]] including the first ascent of the [[Muztagh Tower]] (7273 metres) with John Hartog, [[Joe Brown (climber)|Joe Brown]] and [[Ian McNaught-Davis]] in 1956 and [[Rakaposhi]] (7788 m) in 1958 with [[Mike Banks (mountaineer)|Mike Banks]]. In 1968, he and [[Ian Clough]] were the first to climb [[Am Buachaille]], a [[sea stack]] off the coast of [[Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/sutherland/sandwood-bay.shtml Sandwood Bay] on walkhighlands.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He, Rusty Baillie and [[Chris Bonington]] pioneered the route up the [[Old Man of Hoy]] which was repeated with others on a live televised [[BBC]] [[outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] on 8–9 July 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EGtAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bKMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2960%2C1146247 |title=Camera Conquest of Hoy |first=Hamish |last=McInnes |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=7 July 1967 |page=22 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he received a [[Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct]], after assisting in an incident where two climbers were killed after a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/44138/supplement/10981/data.pdf |title=Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct |work=Supplenment to the London Gazette |date=11 October 1966 |page=10981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 1970 he fell and died while [[abseiling]] from The Maiden, a sea stack off Whiten Head on the Sutherland coast.&lt;ref name="Herald death"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Toroku arsenic disease'''|土呂久砒素公害|Toroku hiso kōgai}} was a disease resulting from air and water pollution from a refinery at a mine at Toroku, located in [[Takachiho, Miyazaki|Takachiho]], [[Nishiusuki District, Miyazaki|Nishiusuki District]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]], [[Japan]].

It emitted [[arsenic]]-containing air, resulting in patients with chronic [[arsenic poisoning]] producing skin changes, [[skin cancer]]s and sometimes [[lung cancer]]. The Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd., which bought the right of mining was sued by the patients for health damage, but 15 years later, the lawsuit ended with a compromise.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==History==
The pollution at Toroku dates back to 1690 according to [[A Table of Public Hazards of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Chronological Table of Public Hazards and Occupational Disease(1977), edited by Iijima N. Kouga  Taisaku  Gijutu Douyuukai, Tokyo {{full|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Between 1920 and 1941, and between 1955 and 1962, arsenic production was conducted at a refinery which produced smoke staying deep in V-shaped valleys. Workers and inhabitants developed chronic arsenic poisoning, and 5 died in a family of 7 in succession.
*In 1925, horses and cows died possibly due to pollution, recorded a veterinary doctor.
*In 1967, the right of mining went from a small factory to Sumitomo Metal Mining Company.
*On December 8, 1970, Tsurue Sato sought advice at a branch of the  Legal Affairs Bureau.
*On November 13, 1971, elementary school teacher Masa Saito published the presence of health damage by the refinery after meeting Tsurue Sato.
*The response of Miyazaki Prefecture was quick; however, the response at first tried to underestimate the damage.
*This case was brought to court against the Sumitomo Mining Company and the trial started in 1975.  It ended in 1990 with a compromise.

==Medical examinations==
Seven patients were examined extensively at [[Kumamoto University]], and they were diagnosed as having chronic arsenic poisoning due to pollution, in a report published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura I et al. "Chronic arsenic poisoning, Cases around Toroku mine".(1973) Report 1 and Report 2. ''J Kumamoto Med Soc''. 47,486-515,516-530.&lt;/ref&gt; The same team increased the number of patients to 48 in 1976, while Hotta and his co-workers made extensive studies of the pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Hotta et al. "Clinical studies on Toroku pollution disease." (1979) ''Taishitsu Igaku enkyusho Houkoku''  29,199-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms of patients in Toroku pollution==

===Skin and otorhinolaryngological symptoms===
Nakamura et al. characterized the condition by pigmentation which is either macular or diffuse, appearing both in covered and exposed areas. Punctate depigmentation appears in raindrop shapes, and hard keratoses are either localized or diffuse. Malignant changes may occur. They pointed out [[nasal septum]] defects. The environmental agency first indicated the skin and ENT findings of nasal scar or septum defect as necessary symptoms for the Toroku Pollution.

===Other symptoms===
In addition to the skin and ENT findings, neuritis was added as a criterion of chronic arsenic poisoning. [[Bowen's disease]], [[Lung cancer]], and cancer of the urinary organ were added as appearing following chronic arsenic poisoning.

==Arsenic pollution in other areas of Japan==

*[[Namikata, Ehime]], discovered in 1933, called the black baby incident. The cause remains unknown.
*[[Nishikawa, Niigata]], discovered in 1955, Pollution due to disposal of agricultural drugs
*[[Nakajo, Niigata]], discovered in 1959, Caused by 75 year pollution of waste of a factory, Resulting in lung cancers &lt;ref&gt;Hotta, N. Chigaku kyoiku to Kagaku Undo. "Geographical Conditions of Arsenic Pollution." (1997), ''Tokubetsugo'', 14-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VistA Imaging''' is an FDA-listed Image Management system used in the [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities nationwide]]. It is one of the most widely used image management systems in routine healthcare use, and is used to manage many different varieties of images associated with a patient's medical record.

== Hardware requirements ==

The VistA Imaging System uses hardware components to provide short- and long-term storage. It takes advantage of network servers for storage. It uses a [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine|DICOM]] gateway system to communicate with commercial [[Picture archiving and communication system|Picture Archiving and Communication Systems]] (PACS) and modalities such as CT, MR, and Computed Radiography (x-ray) devices for image capture. It utilizes a background processor for moving the images to the proper storage device and for managing storage space.

== Types of data managed ==

The system not only manages radiologic images, but also is able to capture and manage [[Electrocardiogram|EKGs]], [[pathology]] images, [[Endoscopy|gastroenterology (endoscopic)]] images, [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] images, scanned paperwork, or essentially any type of health care image.

== Integration with Electronic Health Record systems ==

VistA Imaging is currently integrated into the [[VistA EMR]] (electronic medical record) system used nationwide in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. This integration is able to provide increased efficiency of retrieval of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Imaging Economics, Skokie, IL (USA)|date=December 2002|url=http://www.imagingeconomics.com/issues/articles/2002-12_01.asp|title=PACS Lessons Learned at the Baltimore VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a separate software package and can be used with [[Electronic health record|EHRs]] other than VistA.

VistA Imaging now connects to a nationwide backbone that allows clinicians to access the 350 million images stored in the VA system via Remote Image View software.&lt;ref name="HealthIT"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Government Health IT (USA) |date=October 9, 2006 |url=http://govhealthit.com/article96354-10-09-06-Print |title=VistA's horizons |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231711/http://govhealthit.com/article96354-10-09-06-Print |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VA has developed interfaces for more than 250 medical devices in VistA Imaging, the images from which can be accessed through the desktop VistA Imaging Viewer. The Department of Defense will use the VistA Imaging Viewer to enhance its own EHR.&lt;ref name="HealthIT"/&gt;

== Usage in a National Network of Healthcare Records ==
As part of the US national mandate to co-ordinate care between Department of Defense and the VA, VistA Imaging is forming a cornerstone of the effort to exchange medical imagery between the two systems. “When soldiers come back from Iraq and Afghanistan and eventually enter the VA system, images will be able to move from DOD to VA seamlessly." Eventually, DOD and VA should be able to share all image file types from all sites. Additional enhancements to VistA Imaging include development of a central archive for all VA images (whether acquired through VistA or a commercial system) and new indexing and search capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VistA Imaging upgrades will enhance exchanges with DOD|date=November 2008|url=http://govhealthit.com/articles/2008/11/vista-imaging-upgrades-will-enhance-exchanges-with-dod_633662645039172840.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==

The software for VistA Imaging has been made available through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] so that it is in the public domain. Due to its designation as a medical device, however, it can not be designated as free open source software and therefore can not be altered or implemented without FDA approval.

Although it can be used in healthcare facilities that are outside the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], this is possible only if the proprietary modules that have been integrated into it are also licensed and implementation is registered with the FDA. This has effectively limited its use to government institutions who have licensed the proprietary modules.

The source code can be downloaded from [http://code.osehra.org/gitweb/?p=VistA-M.git;a=tree;f=Packages/Imaging the OSEHRA VistA-M.git tree].

== Proprietary modules required ==

VistA Imaging uses proprietary modules not in the public domain. This makes its public domain use limited.

== Information retrieval after a natural disaster ==

The VistA Imaging system was robust enough to be restored after Hurricane Katrina damaged the data facility at the New Orleans VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Orleans VA medical center restores data lost to Katrina|url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/pacsweb/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180100058|publisher=Diagnostic Imaging:PACSWeb (Feb. 11, 2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of backup proved superior to a paper record system.

The warming up is a preparation for physical exertion or a performance by exercising or practising gently beforehand.

'''Warming up''' is performed before a performance or practice. Athletes, singers, actors and others warm up before stressing their muscles. It prepares the muscles for vigorous actions.

==Exercise==

A warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a "pulse raiser"), joint mobility exercise, and [[stretching]], followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, the athlete might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.  In a meta-study of 32 high quality studies, about 4/5 ths of the studies showed improvements in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fradkin AJ, Zazryn TR, Smoliga JM |title=Effects of warming-up on physical performance: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=140–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19996770 |doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181c643a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warm-up programs can improve the strength of the knee muscle, which, in turn, may decrease injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daneshjoo A, Mokhtar AH, Rahnama N, Yusof A |title=The effects of injury preventive warm-up programs on knee strength ratio in young male professional soccer players |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e50979 |year=2012 |pmid=23226553 |pmc=3513304 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050979 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750979D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://helsify.com/workouts/gym-workout-tips| publisher = Helsify | title = How to work out at the gym: workout tips for beginners}}&lt;/ref&gt;


A comprehensive warm-up program did not significantly decrease injuries in football compared to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Soligard T, Myklebust G, Steffen K, etal |title=Comprehensive warm-up programme to prevent injuries in young female footballers: cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a2469 |year=2008 |pmid=19066253 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a2469 |url= |pmc=2600961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In baseball, warm up swings using a standard weight bat are effective in increasing batting speed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCrary|first=J Matt|date=February 2015|title=A systematic review of the effects of upper body warm-up on performance and injury|url=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/02/18/bjsports-2014-094228|journal=BMJ|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stretching==

Stretching is part of some warm up routines, although a study in 2013 indicates that it weakens muscles in that situation.&lt;ref name = "NatPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/04/05/stretching-before-workouts-may-weaken-muscles-impair-athletic-performance-studies/ |title=Stretching before workout may weaken muscles, impair athletes: studies &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; Life &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Life.nationalpost.com |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 3 types of stretches: [[ballistic stretching]], dynamic, and static stretching:

* Ballistic Stretches involve bouncing or jerking. It is purported to help extend limbs during exercise, promoting agility and flexibility.  However, this type of stretching may also cause injury and is not generally recommended.
* Static Stretches involve flexing the muscles. This may help prevent injury and permit greater flexibility and agility.  Note that static stretching for too long may weaken the muscles.&lt;ref name="NatPost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/sports/playmagazine/112pewarm.html?_r=6&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic Stretching involves moving the body part in the desired way until reaching the full range of motion, to improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rössler|first1=Roland|last2=Junge|first2=Astrid|last3=Bizzini|first3=Mario|last4=Verhagen|first4=Evert|last5=Chomiak|first5=Jiri|last6=aus der Fünten|first6=Karen|last7=Meyer|first7=Tim|last8=Dvorak|first8=Jiri|last9=Lichtenstein|first9=Eric|last10=Beaudouin|first10=Florian|last11=Faude|first11=Oliver|title=A Multinational Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial to Assess the Efficacy of ‘11+ Kids’: A Warm-Up Programme to Prevent Injuries in Children’s Football|journal=Sports Medicine|date=22 December 2017|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warming up in other countries==
In Germany, Switzerland and Austria they use this noun in a second context: psychologists and similar professionals are working with "warming ups" in therapeutical or learning sessions before starting or after a break; those warming ups are various interaction games, role playing, moving in the class room and so on.
