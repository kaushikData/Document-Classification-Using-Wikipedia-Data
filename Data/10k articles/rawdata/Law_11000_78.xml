The '''1923 Municipal Manager Law''' was the last type of reformed municipal government the State of [[New Jersey]] introduced in the [[progressive era]]. The law introduced to New Jersey the [[council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government first developed in [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]], [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egenton|first=Michael A.|title=Modern Forms of Municipal Government|year=1992|publisher=New Jersey State Commission on County and Municipal Government.|location=Trenton, NJ|url=http://www.njstatelib.org/NJ_Information/Digital_Collections/MFMG/MFMGCH3.PDF|accessdate=February 15, 2011|page=41|chapter=III: The 1923 Municipal Manager Form of Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The council is [[nonpartisan]] and elected at-large for four-year terms. The terms may be either concurrent or staggered, and there is an option for run-off elections. Presently, only Lodi Borough uses run-offs and staggered terms, with half of the council being elected for four-year terms every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of New Jersey Municipal Government|url=http://www.njslom.org/types.html#MunicipalManager|work=njslom.org|publisher=[[New Jersey State League of Municipalities]]|accessdate=February 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114163158/http://www.njslom.org/types.html#MunicipalManager|archivedate=2011-01-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[mayor]], elected by the council from its own numbers, has no executive responsibility beyond appointing representatives of commissions and boards, and presiding over council meetings. The mayor is elected for a four-year term in municipalities with concurrent terms or serves for a two-year term in Lodi Borough which has staggered terms.

The members of the council are subject to [[recall election]]s.

An '''administrative law judge''' ('''ALJ''') in the [[United States]] is a [[judge]] and [[trier of fact]] who both presides over [[trial (law)|trials]] and adjudicates the claims or disputes (in other words, ALJ-controlled proceedings are [[bench trial]]s) involving [[administrative law]].

ALJs can administer [[oath]]s, take [[testimony]], rule on questions of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], and make factual and legal determinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=1916351342+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 5 U.S.C. § 556]&lt;/ref&gt; And depending upon the agency's jurisdiction, proceedings may have complex multi-party adjudication, as is the case with the  [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], or simplified and less formal procedures, as is the case with the [[Social Security Administration]].

== Federal appointment and tenure ==
The [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act of 1946]] (APA) requires that federal ALJs be appointed based on scores achieved in a comprehensive testing procedure, including a four-hour written examination and an oral examination before a panel that includes an [[United States Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]] representative, an [[American Bar Association]] representative, and a sitting federal ALJ. Federal ALJs are the only merit-based judicial corps in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Administrative Law Judge|url=http://www.jandils.com/title-keyword-administrative-law-judge/|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=jandils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[administrative law]], ALJs are Article I judges under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. As such, they do not exercise full judicial power, essentially, the power over life, liberty, and property. However, Article I judges and courts are not constrained to rendering opinions for only a "case or controversy" before them, and may render advisory opinions on a purely prospective basis, such as, ''e.g.'', Congressional reference cases assigned to the [[United States Court of Federal Claims|Court of Federal Claims]]. Agency ALJs do not have the power to offer such advisory opinions, as it would be in violation of the power afforded them under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §557. Unlike the agency, ALJs are not policy or rule makers.

ALJs are generally considered to be part of the executive branch, not the judicial branch, but the APA is designed to guarantee the decisional independence of ALJs. They have [[absolute immunity]] from liability for their judicial acts and are triers of fact "insulated from political influence".{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Federal administrative law judges are not responsible to, or subject to, the supervision or direction of employees or agents of the federal agency engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecution functions for the agency. ''Ex parte'' communications are prohibited. ALJs are exempt from performance ratings, evaluation, and bonuses. 5 CFR 930.206. Agency officials may not interfere with their decision making, and administrative law judges may be discharged only for good cause based upon a complaint filed by the agency with the [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] established and determined after an APA hearing on the record before an MSPB ALJ.&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;''[[Butz v. Economou]]'', 438 U.S. 478, 514 [1978]&lt;/ref&gt; Only ALJs receive these statutory protections; "hearing officers" or "trial examiners", with delegated hearing functions, are not similarly protected by the APA.

In ''[[Lucia v. SEC]]'', decided in June 2018, the United States Supreme Court held that ALJs are Inferior Officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="ap decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/apxsupreme-court-sides-with-buckets-of-money-financier/ | title = Supreme Court sides with ‘Buckets of Money’ financier | date=  June 21, 2018 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attorney Advisors ===
ALJs usually hire Attorney Advisors, who serve a role similar to [[Law clerk#United States|judicial law clerks]] of [[Article III judges]]. For example, Attorney Advisors assist the ALJs with research, writing, drafting of opinions and orders, and assisting with the administration of hearings and other trial-like adjudications. Furthermore, Attorney Advisors usually have practiced as lawyers in the particular field which the ALJ possesses expertise in.

== Authority and review of federal ALJs ==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] has recognized that the role of a federal administrative law judge is "functionally comparable" to that of an Article III judge. An ALJ's powers are often, if not generally, comparable to those of a trial judge: The ALJ may issue subpoenas, rule on proffers of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing, and make or recommend decisions. ALJs are limited as they have no power to sanction unless a statute provides such a power. Instead, the ALJ may refer a matter to an Article III Court to seek enforcement or sanctions. The process of agency adjudication is currently structured so as to assure that ALJs exercise independent judgment on the evidence before them, free from pressures by the parties or other officials within the agency.&lt;ref name=Butz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Maritime Commission v. S.C. State Ports Authority'', 535 U.S. 743, 756 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure for reviewing an ALJ's decision varies depending upon the agency. Agencies generally have an internal appellate body, with some agencies having a [[Cabinet Secretary#United States|Cabinet secretary]] decide the final internal appeals. Moreover, after the internal agency appeals have been exhausted, a party may have the right to file an appeal in the state or federal courts. Relevant statutes usually require a party to exhaust all administrative appeals before they are allowed to sue an agency in court.

== Central panels ==
Administrative law judges may be employed by a "central panel" organization, which provides the judges with independence from agencies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Hoberg,|date=1994|title=Administrative Hearings: State Central Panels in the 1990s|url=https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/naalj/vol14/iss1/5/|journal=Journal of the National Association of Administrative Law Judiciary|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|issn=0735-0821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[California Administrative Procedure Act]] created an early central panel in 1945, and it served as a model for other states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2015, over half of states had created such panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judges.org/alj-central-panels-how-is-it-going-out-there/|title=ALJ Central Panels: How is it Going Out There? {{!}} The National Judicial College|last=|first=|date=|website=www.judges.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030134405/https://www.judges.org/alj-central-panels-how-is-it-going-out-there/|archive-date=2018-11-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State ALJs ==
Most [[U.S. state]]s have a [[statute]] modeled after the APA or somewhat similar to it.  In some states, such as [[New Jersey]], the state law is also known as the Administrative Procedure Act.

Unlike federal ALJs, whose powers are guaranteed by federal statute, state ALJs have widely varying power and prestige. In some state law contexts, ALJs have almost no power; their decisions are accorded practically no deference and become, in effect, recommendations. In some cities, ALJs are at-will employees of the agency, making their decisional independence potentially questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Ackman, Dan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/opinion/nyregionopinions/12CIackman.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FC%2FCharter%20Revision%20Commission "The Price of Justice"]. ''New York Times'', Feb. 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In some agencies, ALJs dress like [[lawyer]]s in [[Suit (clothing)|business suits]], share offices, and hold hearings in ordinary conference rooms. In other agencies (particularly the Division of Workers' Compensation of the [[California Department of Industrial Relations]]), ALJs wear robes like Article III [[judge]]s, are referred to as "Honorable" and "Your Honor", work in private chambers, hold hearings in special "hearing rooms" that look like small [[courtroom]]s, and have court clerks who swear in witnesses.

== Professional organizations ==
Professional organizations that represent federal ALJs include the Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faljc.org Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; the Association of Administrative Law Judges, which represents only Social Security ALJs, and the Forum of United States Administrative Law judges. Professional organizations that include both state and federal ALJs include the [[National Association of Administrative Law Judiciary]], the [[ABA National Conference of Administrative Law Judiciary]], and the [[National Association of Hearing Officials]].

== International comparisons ==
Unlike the United States, in the United Kingdom the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] recognises legally qualified members of the national system of administrative law tribunals as members of the [[judiciary of the United Kingdom]] who are guaranteed [[judicial independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, s.1, [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], s.3&lt;/ref&gt;

ALJs cannot be recognized as members of the judicial branch of government (without first completely ejecting them from their home agencies in the executive branch), because to do so would violate the bedrock principle of [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers as embodied in the U.S. Constitution]].  In a 2013 majority opinion signed by Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], the U.S. Supreme Court explained:

{{quote|The dissent overstates when it claims that agencies exercise "legislative power" and "judicial power" ... The former is vested exclusively in Congress ... the latter in the "one supreme Court" and "such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish" ... Agencies make rules ... and conduct adjudications ... and have done so since the beginning of the Republic. These activities take "legislative" and "judicial" forms, but they are exercises of—indeed, under our constitutional structure they ''must be'' exercises of—the "executive Power."&lt;ref&gt;''City of Arlington v. FCC'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8614546201508695232 569 U.S. __, __, n.4] (2013) (slip op. at 13) (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== List of U.S. federal agencies with ALJs ==
Most of the agencies below have only a few dozen ALJs.{{weasel inline|date=May 2016}} In 2013, the Social Security Administration had by far the largest number of ALJs at over 1,400, who adjudicate over 700,000 cases each year. The average SSA hearing process occurs over a period of 373 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Stephen | last=Ohlemacher | title=Judges sue Social Security over 'quotas' | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/judges-social-security_n_3115363.html| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 3A | date=April 20, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft copy source does not agree with hard copy source but is the same article---&gt;

== List of state departments and agencies with ALJs ==
Some states, such as [[California]], follow the federal model of having a separate corps of ALJs attached to each agency that uses them.  Others, such as New Jersey, have consolidated all ALJs together into a single agency that holds hearings on behalf of all other state agencies. This type of state adjudicatory agency is called a "[[central panel agency]]".  Many states have a central panel agency, but the agency does not handle all the hearings for every state agency.

[[File:ICOM IC-A200 aéro.jpg|thumb|A typical aircraft VHF radio. The display shows an active frequency of 123.5 MHz and a standby frequency of 121.5 MHz. The two are exchanged using the button marked with a double-headed arrow. The tuning control on the right only affects the standby frequency.]]
'''Airband''' or '''aircraft band''' is the name for a group of [[frequency|frequencies]] in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[radio spectrum]] allocated to radio communication in civil [[aviation]], sometimes also referred to as ''VHF'', or phonetically as ''"Victor"''. Different sections of the band are used for [[radio navigation|radionavigational aid]]s and [[air traffic control]].&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Westman (ed), ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers Fifth Edition'', Howard W. Sams and Co, 1968, page 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/COM-AIM-2013-1_ENG-3.pdf |title=Com - 5.0 radio communications |accessdate=27 April 2013 |last=[[Transport Canada]] |authorlink= |date=April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516002417/http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/COM-AIM-2013-1_ENG-3.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smeter.net/spectrum/aviation.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212142911/http://www.smeter.net/spectrum/aviation.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 February 2004 |title=Aviation Radio Bands and Frequencies |publisher=Smeter network 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries a license to operate airband equipment is required and the operator is tested on competency in procedures, language and the use of the [[Spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]].&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldgliding.co.uk/members/sites/default/files/radio_training.pdf|title=Radio Telephony Training Syllabus|publisher=Cotswold Gliding Club - date undisclosed|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectrum usage==
[[Image:COMstationEHAM.jpg|thumb|right|Antenna array at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]
The VHF airband uses the frequencies between 108 and 137&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]. The lowest 10&amp;nbsp;MHz of the band, from 108–117.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, is split into 200 narrow-band channels of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz. These are reserved for navigational aids such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] [[beacon]]s, and precision approach systems such as [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] localizers.&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freq"/&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, most countries divide the upper 19&amp;nbsp;MHz into 760 channels for [[amplitude modulation]] voice transmissions, on frequencies from 118–136.975&amp;nbsp;MHz, in steps of 25&amp;nbsp;kHz. In Europe, it is becoming common to further divide those channels into three (8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing), potentially permitting 2,280 channels. Some channels between 123.100 and 135.950 are available in the US to other users such as government agencies, commercial company advisory, [[search and rescue]], military aircraft, glider and ballooning air-to-ground, flight test and national aviation authority use. A typical transmission range of an aircraft flying at cruise altitude ({{convert|35000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}), is about {{convert|200|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} in good weather conditions.&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="freq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC90"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC90-50D.pdf |title=Requirements for 760 channel VHF radio for Aeronautical operations |publisher=Federal aviation agency 1992 |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faatest.com/books/ifrh/7-1.htm |title=VII. ELECTRONIC AIDS TO INSTRUMENT FLYING |publisher=FAA test company - date undisclosed |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bands===
Aeronautical voice communication is also conducted in other frequency bands, including satellite voice on [[Inmarsat]] or [[Iridium Communications|Iridium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/info/all_infos/media/2015/InFO15008.pdf |title=Iridium Satellite Voice (SATVOICE) with Safety Services| accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[high frequency]] voice. Usually these other frequency bands are only used in oceanic and remote areas, though they work over wider areas or even globally. Military aircraft also use a dedicated UHF-AM band from 225.0–399.95&amp;nbsp;MHz for air-to-air and air-to-ground, including air traffic control communication. This band has a designated emergency and guard channel of 243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;DAOT 5: ''C-12-118-000/MB-000 Operating Instructions CH118 Helicopter'' (unclassified), Change 2, 23 April 1987, Page 1-51. Department of National Defence&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio aeronautical navigation aids ([[Navigational aid|navaids]]) use other frequencies. [[Non-directional beacon]]s (NDB)s operate on [[low frequency]] and [[medium frequency]] bands between 190–415&amp;nbsp;kHz and 510–535&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) glide path operates in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequency range of 329.3–335.0&amp;nbsp;MHz with [[marker beacon]]s at 75 MHZ. [[Distance Measuring Equipment|Distance measuring equipment]] (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;

===Channel spacing===
Channel spacing for voice communication on the airband was originally 200&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] until 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roger-wilco.net/8-33-khz-channel-spacing-%E2%80%93-what-is-this/ |title=8.33 kHz Channel spacing – what is this? |publisher=Roger-Wilco |date=2010-04-03 |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing 70 channels from 118 to 132&amp;nbsp;MHz. Some radios of that time provided receive-only coverage below 118&amp;nbsp;MHz for a total of 90 channels. From 1947–1958 the spacing became 100&amp;nbsp;kHz; from 1954 split once again to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz and the upper limit extended to 135.95&amp;nbsp;MHz (360 channels), and then to 25&amp;nbsp;kHz in 1972 to provide 720 usable channels. On 1 January 1990 the frequencies between 136.000 and 136.975&amp;nbsp;MHz were added, resulting in 760 channels.&lt;ref name="AC90" /&gt;

Increasing air traffic congestion has led to further subdivision into narrow-band 8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz channels in the [[ICAO]] European region; all aircraft flying are required to have communication equipment for this channel spacing.&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/dossier/aicfrancea/AIC_A_2013_09_FR.pdf Mise en oeuvre de l’espacement « à 8.33 kHz » au-dessous du FL 195] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806174237/https://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/dossier/aicfrancea/AIC_A_2013_09_FR.pdf |date=6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garfnet.org.uk/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=112:aircraft-frequencies-uk-a-europe&amp;catid=3:radio-frequencies&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Aircraft frequencies for UK and Europe|publisher=Garfnet organisation 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurocontrol-833"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/vhf833/public/subsite_homepage/homepage.html |title=8.33kHz Programme |accessdate=2007-12-24 |publisher=[[European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation|Eurocontrol]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019002549/http://www.eurocontrol.int/vhf833/public/subsite_homepage/homepage.html |archivedate=19 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Europe, 8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz channels are permitted in many countries but not widely used as of 2012.

The emergency communication channel [[aircraft emergency frequency|121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz]] is the only channel that retains 100&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing in the US; there are no channel allocations between 121.4 and 121.5 or between 121.5 and 121.6&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|87.173|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modulation===
Aircraft communications radio operations worldwide use [[amplitude modulation]], predominantly [[A3E]] double sideband with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and [[J3E]] single sideband with suppressed carrier on HF. Besides being simple, power-efficient and compatible with legacy equipment, AM and SSB permit stronger stations to override weaker or interfering stations. Additionally, this method does not suffer from the [[capture effect]] found in FM. Even if a pilot is transmitting, a control tower can "talk over" that transmission and other aircraft will hear a somewhat garbled mixture of both transmissions, rather than just one or the other. Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a [[heterodyne]] will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.&lt;ref&gt;EECE 252 Project Report,
[https://masi.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/images/7/74/Spring2012_group3.pdf Amplitude Modulated Radio Applications in Aviation] 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative analog modulation schemes are under discussion, such as the "CLIMAX"&lt;ref&gt;EuroControl, [http://www.icao.int/safety/acp/ACPWGF/ACP-WG-T-1/ACP-WGT-1-WP19-Climax%20leaflet%20V1R0_4.pdf CLIMAX/8.33: To extend 8.33 kHz benefits], ICAO, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; multi-carrier system and offset carrier techniques to permit more efficient utilization of spectrum.

===Audio properties===
The [[audio signal|audio]] quality in the airband is limited by the [[radio frequency|RF]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] used. In the newer channel spacing scheme, the largest bandwidth of an airband channel is limited to 8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz, so the highest possible [[audio frequency]] is 4.166&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="am-bandwidth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/am-amplitude-modulation/spectrum-bandwidth.php |title=Amplitude Modulation, AM Spectrum &amp; Bandwidth |first=Ian |last=Poole |publisher=Radio-Electronics.com |accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 25&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing scheme, an upper audio frequency of 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz would be theoretically possible.&lt;ref name="am-bandwidth" /&gt; However, most airband voice transmissions never actually reach these limits. Usually, the whole transmission is contained within a 6&amp;nbsp;kHz to 8&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth, corresponding to an upper audio frequency of 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="am-bandwidth" /&gt; This frequency, while low compared to the top of the human hearing range, is sufficient to convey [[speech]]. Different aircraft, control towers and other users transmit with different bandwidths and audio characteristics.

===Digital radio===
A switch to [[digital radio]]s has been contemplated, as this would greatly increase [[channel capacity|capacity]] by reducing the bandwidth required to transmit speech. Other benefits from digital coding of voice transmissions include decreased susceptibility to electrical interference and jamming. The change-over to digital radio has yet to happen, partly because the mobility of aircraft necessitates complete international cooperation to move to a new system and also the time implementation for subsequent changeover.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:OviVUcKRA_IJ:www.virtualacquisitionshowcase.com/document/1191/briefing+digital+voice+transmission+over+radio&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgbs97f0gJ8VAdVkcYnvxcr_AVm72VxDIbdslnMaAIKlfcOrtLKQrHPBZlkx3qtyrR4rNsKxt5Os1afDJoXaACZvkogEVgc4C-Uqf2cJg_IzSxI5hPgI-H4oKRFkZthDsNOII2a&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ18RbvNhWCI8QuiaeMiHW-iH0ZAA |title=Affordable real-time digital voice transmission using Voip technology |publisher=Command NAVAIR 2 January 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:03RdjJriOk8J:www.sita.aero/file/530/Aircraft_centric_digital_cns_position_paper.pdf+%22proposed+digital+channels+for+aircraft+communications%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiFqWV6y--edA7Zfwwtbh5vEiiy4_yoNsEVqmSEHgSIbzIyOwWz2HakvklROWBOvJW0S76oxyTg76UqLokZwUUaS6jGE4eWLedUYvjF_ol7rHVUYf8juoPcb9a8JBcUzv9CH2pT&amp;sig=AHIEtbSLp5k4urC-TLVC7K5IM4UdpoAauA |title=Aircraft centric digital CNS |publisher=CITA 2010 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor delaying the move to any digital mode is the need to retain the ability for one station to override another in an emergency.

==Unauthorised use==
It is illegal in most countries to transmit on the Airband frequencies without a suitable license, although an individual license may not be required, for instance in the US where aircraft stations are "licensed by rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|87.18|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries' regulations also restrict communications in the airband. For instance, in [[Canada]], airband communications are limited to those required for "the safety and navigation of an aircraft; the general operation of the aircraft; and the exchange of messages on behalf of the public. In addition, a person may operate radio apparatus only to transmit a non-superfluous signal or a signal containing non-profane or non-obscene radiocommunications."&lt;ref name="TCAIMCOM50" /&gt;

Listening to airband frequencies without a license is also an offense in some countries.  However, in certain countries, such as the UK, it is permissible to listen to as it is covered under navigational and weather related transmissions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/89037/Guidance-on-Receive-Only-Radio-Scanners.pdf Guidance on Receive-Only Radio Scanners] Ofcom&lt;/ref&gt;. Such activity has been the subject of international situations between governments when tourists bring airband equipment into countries which ban the possession and use of such equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algarveresident.com/story.asp?ID=5776 |title=Greek drama in capital |publisher=Algarve resident 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1950198.stm "Plane-spotters 'ignored warnings'."] ''BBC News'', 25 April 2002.

The '''Benham Rise''', also known as the '''Philippine Rise''', is a [[seismic]]ally active undersea region and [[extinct volcano|extinct volcanic ridge]] located in the [[Philippine Sea]] approximately {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the northern coastline of [[Dinapigue, Isabela]]. The Rise has been known to the people of [[Catanduanes]] as '''Kalipung-awan''' since pre-colonial times, which literally means 'loneliness from an isolated place'.&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2017/08/22/untranslatable-words.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/898607/duterte-renames-benham-rise-philippine-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Philippine Sea lie a number of basins including the [[West Philippine Sea Basin]], inside of which is located the [[Central Basin Fault]] (CBF).&lt;ref name="2001AGUFM.T41C0893H"&gt;{{Cite journal|date= |title = Isotopic Characteristics of Basalts From the Central Basin Fault, West Philippine Basin |format= |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|author1=Hickey-Vargas, R. |author2=Sato, H. |author3=Machida, S. |author4=Ishii, T. |author5=Hirano, N. |author6=Yumul, G. |author7=Fujioka, K. |quote=Fall Meeting 2001|bibcode= 2001AGUFM.T41C0893H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Benham Plateau is located in the CBF and its basement probably is a micro-continent.&lt;ref name="Gupta.14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Avijit Gupta| title = The physical geography of Southeast Asia|edition= 2005|page= 14| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| isbn= 0-19-924802-8}} - Total pages: 440&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scientific surveys have been made on the feature to study its nature and its impact on [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] [[subduction]], including one about its effects on the [[1990 Luzon earthquake]]. The Philippines claimed this feature as part of its [[continental shelf]] in a claim filed with the [[United Nations]] Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on April 8, 2009, and which was approved under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) in 2012.&lt;ref name="BR Claim"&gt;{{cite web | title = UN approves PH territorial claim to Benham Rise |url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/183779/un-approves-ph-territorial-claim-to-benham-rise |publisher = | accessdate = April 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is designated as a "protected food supply exclusive zone" by the Philippine government in May 2017. Mining and oil exploration is banned in the Benham Plateau as a protected area. On May 16, 2017, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed [[Executive order (Philippines)|Executive Order]] No. 25 renaming the feature to “Philippine Rise”,&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/22/1702503/duterte-renames-benham-rise-philippine-rise |title=Duterte renames ‘Benham Rise’ to ‘Philippine Rise’ |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E.O. 25 s. 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2017/05/16/executive-order-no-25-s-2017/|title=Executive Order No. 25, s. 2017|work=www.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later allowed international vessels to conduct research on the Rise.

==Geology==
[[File:Philippine Sea plate.JPG|thumb|180px|The map shows the features of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].]]

Benham Rise is a submerged [[extinct volcano|extinct volcanic ridge]] located at 16 degrees 30 minutes N, 124 degrees 45 minutes E off the coast of [[Luzon]], with the size of about 250&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and rises over 2,000 meters (2&amp;nbsp;km.) above the sea floor, from below 5,000 meters (5&amp;nbsp;km.) below sea level to above 3,000 meters (3&amp;nbsp;km.) below sea level. Its area is close to the Benham Seamount, located at 15 degrees 48 minutes N, 124 degrees 15 minutes E. The precise location is somewhere near the east of the [[Philippine Trench]] and near the south of the [[East Luzon Trench]], both of which absorb the subducting force of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] under the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]],&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto, M, ed., (1981) ''Accretion Tectonics in the Circum-Pacific Regions'', {{ISBN|90-277-1561-0}} p299&lt;/ref&gt; a collage of large blocks of that crust that amalgamated prior to the collision of the Philippine Sea Plate with the [[Eurasian Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Rangin and Pubellier (1990) in ''Tectonics of Circum-Pacific Continental Margins'' {{ISBN|90-6764-132-4}} p149&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the landform, along with the nearby Urdaneta Plateau (a remnant of a [[mantle plume]]), is identified in one study as at least five sequences of propagating [[rift]]s, probably triggered by [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] flowing away from the mantle thermal anomaly.&lt;ref name="Ryuichie "&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1002-0705(08)60038-2 |last=Ryuichie |first= Shinjo |authorlink= |author2=Ni Xianglonga|author3=Wu Shiguoc |date=2008|title=Tectonics in the Northwestern West Philippine Basin |trans-title= |journal= Journal of China University of Geosciences|volume=  19|issue= 3 |pages=191–199 |id= |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002070508600382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence of the landform disrupts the continuity of this region (known as the Philippine-East Luzon Trench) by continuously colliding with the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountain range]] of eastern portion of the island of [[Luzon]]. Though it is generally thought that the Philippine Sea Plate is being subducted under the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]], under the rules of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] [[subduction]], there appears to be a resistance to this because of the presence of the landform, and instead, the plate is being displaced into the northern portion of Luzon to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Rangin and Pubellier (1990) in ''Tectonics of Circum-Pacific Continental Margins'' {{ISBN|90-6764-132-4}}, p149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deschamps and Lallemand (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'' {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p165&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Benham Bank]] is the shallowest point of the Benham Rise.

==History==
===Survey by Admiral Benham===
The landform was presumably named after [[Andrew E.K. Benham|Admiral Andrew Ellicot Kennedy Benham]] (1832–1905) by [[United States|American]] surveyors who were the probable discoverers of the geological feature. He was a [[United States Navy]] officer, who served with both the South Atlantic and West Gulf Blockading Squadrons during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="one-name.org"&gt;{{cite web |date= 8 Mar 2008|url = http://www.one-name.org/profiles/benham.html|title = Benham One-Name Study|publisher = Guild of One-Name Studies| accessdate = September 27, 2009 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies following the 1990 Luzon earthquake===
There has been speculation in the scientific community about the nature of the landform. Following the major 16 July [[1990 Luzon earthquake]], scientists reconsidered their fault models and decided it likely that Benham Plateau has similarly displaced the [[Philippine Fault System]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet and Stephan (1989) in ''Tectonics of Circum-Pacific Continental Margins'' {{ISBN|90-6764-132-4}} p.179&lt;/ref&gt; After analysing older models such as that of Pinet and Stephan (1989), scientists reconsidered their fault models. They thought that it is highly likely that the Benham Plateau is still displacing [[Central Luzon]] and the [[Philippine Fault System]] to the west, which may have had an impact in causing such a catastrophic earthquake. The 20 second to 50 second wave in the 1990 quake that developed a new east-west sub-fault was so strong that it terminated disastrously at the city of [[Baguio]] in [[Benguet]], [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera]]. Several scientific surveys, conducted between 2004 and 2008, collected hydrographic data that determined the morphology of the seabed in the region. Additional data from international bathymetric surveys and an analysis of international research projects were collected to support the findings.&lt;ref name="verafiles.org"&gt;{{cite web|date=12 April 2009 |url=http://www.verafiles.org/index.php/focus/211-rp-files-claim-over-benham-rise-with-un |title=RP files claim over Benham Rise with UN |format= |publisher=verafiles.org |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |last=Tessa Jamandre |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426082054/http://verafiles.org/index.php/focus/211-rp-files-claim-over-benham-rise-with-un |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine formal claim and 2012 UN recognition of claim===
[[File:Benham Rise (Philippine Rise) NAMRIA layout 2 May 24 2017.jpg|500px|thumb|Map of Luzon and the Benham Rise.]]
Despite its proximity to the archipelago, the plateau was previously not included in the territory of the Philippines. On April 8, 2009, the Republic of the [[Philippines]] lodged a partial [[territorial waters]] claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in relation to the continental shelf in the region of Benham Rise.&lt;ref name="CLCS submissions"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_phl_22_2009.htm |title=Submissions, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, pursuant to article 76, paragraph 8, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 |publisher=United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was submitted as part of petition expanding the archipelago's baselines and [[exclusive economic zone]] through a law that also included other claims involving disputed territories of the Kalayaan Islands ([[Spratly Islands]]) and [[Scarborough Shoal]]. Although the landform, in  itself, is not disputed, the petition still received some criticism from China.&lt;ref name="ellentordesillas"&gt;{{cite web |date= March 25, 2008|url = http://www.ellentordesillas.com/?p=2317|title = RP in last minute scramble to beat UN deadline|format = |publisher = ellentordesillas.com| accessdate = September 27, 2009 | last=Ellen Tordesillas |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's claim, based on a set of guidelines by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the area satisfies the 350-mile constraint line since the outer limits of the continental shelf are located landward of the constraint line, which is located 350 miles from the baselines where the measurement of the breadth of the territorial sea begins.&lt;ref name="verafiles.org"/&gt;

The [[Congress of the Philippines]] enacted the bill of senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], now known as Republic Act No. 9522 or the Archipelagic Baselines Law, which is the basis of the claim. According to the document the region is bounded by the Philippine Basin on the north and east, and by Luzon on the west and south. It asserted that, according to scientific data based on seismic, magnetic, other geological features, the Benham Rise is an extension of the Philippines’ continental shelf. In summary, the baselines, the basis used for delineating the maritime territorial and jurisdictional zones (including the continental shelf), conform with the requirements of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).&lt;ref name="verafiles.org"/&gt; The claim is only a partial claim since the law that allows the Philippines to expand its territorial boundaries also includes islands in the [[South China Sea]].

The Philippines filed its claim for Benham Rise in 2008 in compliance with the requirements of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas. The UN officially approved the claim in April 2012, the first claim of the Philippines approved by an international body since the colonial era.&lt;ref name="BR Claim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Decision"&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/716909/un-decide-phl-claim-13-m-hectare-benham-rise UN to decide on Phl claim on 13-M hectare Benham Rise], August 16, 2011, Philippine Star.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Approval"&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/183779/un-approves-ph-territorial-claim-to-benham-rise UN approves PH territorial claim to Benham Rise], April 28, 2012, Philippine Daily Inquirer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOE to assess resource potential of Benham Rise:http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/06/09/1332626/doe-assess-resource-potential-benham-rise&lt;/ref&gt; China released a statement saying that they do not recognize the ruling and that China seeks to claim the Benham Rise in the near future as it is part of a so-called 'Chinese second-chain islands'. However, there are no existing islands within the Benham Rise.

After [[China|Chinese]] survey ships were spotted in the region in 2017, Philippine president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] suggested that the plateau be renamed to emphasize the Philippine's sovereignty over the area. Soon after, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] announced plans to come up with a new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filipinotimes.ae/news/2017/04/02/phl-plans-to-rename-benham-rise/|title=Duterte wants to rename Benham Rise|author=Staff|publisher=Filipino Times|date=April 2, 2017|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the Philippine government officially adopted the name "Philippine Rise" for the feature&lt;ref name="E.O. 25 s. 2017" /&gt; and designated the area as a "protected food supply exclusive zone" and prohibited mining and oil exploration in the Benham Plateau, angering China in the process. China maintained that the Philippines has no sovereign rights or sovereignty over the Benham Rise despite a UN-backed international ruling in 2012 that says otherwise.&lt;ref name="cnnphilrise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Eimor|title=Benham Rise is now Philippine Rise, and a protected food supply zone – Piñol|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/12/Benham-Rise-Philippine-Rise-protected-food-supply-zone-Pi%C3%B1ol.html|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=CNN Philippines|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese research and naming of features in 2018===
{{OSM Location map
| title=In January 2018, the Chinese Institute of Oceanology of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] conducted research in the Philippine territory of [[Benham Rise]], with approval from foreign affairs secretary [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] and president Duterte. Despite the nature of the agreement, no document was signed by both parties. Additionally, the research was only made public via an opposition lawmaker. The research was never meant to be made public by Duterte. In February 12, 2018, after China submitted their research to UNESCO, the International Hydrographic Organization declared China's naming rights over five features in the Rise, sparking nationwide outrage. In February 18, it was revealed that China intends to name a total of 142 more features within the Rise.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/18/1788981/china-wants-name-142-ocean-features&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/08/1785645/china-seeks-name-sea-features-philippine-rise&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.abs-cbn.com"&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/02/12/18/china-named-5-undersea-features-at-ph-rise-says-expert&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Filipino Congressman Gary Alejano revealed that Secretary [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] had approved the Chinese Institute of Oceanology of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] to perform a scientific survey of the Rise, with the approval of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]].&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/article/china-eyes-philippines-strategic-eastern-shores/ |publisher=''[[Asia Times]]'' |title=China eyes Philippines’ strategic eastern shores |first=George |last=Amurao |date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte's spokesperson, [[Harry Roque]], later confirmed Alejano's revelation, and said that Filipinos have no capability to research the Rise. Backlash surged as numerous Filipino research proofs from university professors and researchers were leaked. In February, Duterte's agriculture secretary told media that Duterte has now ordered the halting of all foreign researches in the Philippines Rise, however, the research being conducted by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] was already finished two days before the halt order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/642291/duterte-orders-no-more-foreign-explorations-in-benham-rise-pinol/story/&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, confirmed reports broke out, stating that the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UNESCO have rules wherein the entity that first discovers unnamed features underwater have the right to name those features, prompting Filipino officials to realize that China was after, not just research, but also the naming rights over the underwater features of the Benham Rise which will be internationally recognized through UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/08/1785645/china-seeks-name-sea-features-philippine-rise&lt;/ref&gt; A CSIS expert concluded that the current Philippine government is 'well-intentioned but naive'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/195587-duterte-naive-west-philippine-sea-gregory-poling-csis&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the research halt ordered by Duterte, it was clarified by the Philippine government that all researches ongoing at the time the halting was made were officially cancelled, but the government still fully allows research activities in the Rise ''after'' the halting. Foreign researchers, including Chinese, may still do research within the Rise if they apply for research activities through the Philippine government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2018/02/06/palace-clarifies-foreign-research-may-be-allowed-philippine-rise-587568&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this clarification, rallies surged in Philippine metropolitan streets. Duterte later insisted, in a bid to disperse public anxiety, that the Rise belongs to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2018/02/10/philippine-rise-belongs-philippines-duterte-insists-588240&lt;/ref&gt; February 12, 2018, the International Hydrographic Organization approved the names proposed by China for five features in the Benham Rise after China submitted to the organization its research findings on the area. The names given by China were all in Chinese, namely, ''Jinghao'' Seamount (some 70 nautical miles east of Cagayan), ''Tianbao'' Seamount (some 70 nautical miles east of Cagayan), ''Haidonquing'' Seamount (east at 190 nautical miles), ''Cuiqiao'' Hill, and ''Jujiu'' Seamount, the last two form the central peaks of the Benham Rise undersea geological province. The Chinese naming of the features met public protests in the Philippines, however, the Philippine government itself chose to impose a bystander policy, enlarging public anxiety towards the Duterte regime's buddy-buddy policy towards China.&lt;ref name="news.abs-cbn.com"&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/02/12/18/china-named-5-undersea-features-at-ph-rise-says-expert&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/164127/breaking-china-named-5-undersea-features-ph-rise-expert&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Bam Aquino]] protested the Chinese naming of the features and the inaction of the Duterte administration on the issue. In February 14, 2018, Philippine ambassador to the United Nations [[Teodoro Locsin Jr.]] defended China's naming of sea features within the Philippine Rise and tweeted that critics on the issue are 'childish and stupid', sparking a word war. Senate President [[Aquilino Pimentel III]] stated that he is 'not bothered' by the Chinese names and he sees no problems with the Chinese names given by China.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/164167/pimentel-sees-no-problem-chinas-benham-naming&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, the Presidential Palace announced that it objects and it shall not recognize the Chinese names of the features and it will appeal for its rejection in the International Hydrographic Organization although Palace spokesperson noted that it will be hard to reject the already-internationally acknowledged names as the Philippines is not a member of the organization. On the other hand, China is a member of the organization. The Philippine government also said that their embassy in Beijing will coordinate with the Chinese regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/196018-philippines-rejects-chinese-names-benham-rise-features&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/02/14/Philippines-wont-recognize-Chinese-names-of-Benham-Rise-features.html&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, the Palace announced that they intend to give Philippine names on the features of the Philippine Rise.&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/02/15/benham-rise-features-philippines-name-harry-roque.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few hours later, the presidential palace clarified that it has 'no problem' with the Chinese names in the Philippine Rise, citing that 'not all Chinese food with Chinese names belong to China, so not all sea features with Chinese names belong to it as well'.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnation.inquirer.net/164266/chinese-names-ph-rise-no-problem-says-palace&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Senior Justice [[Antonio Carpio]], the foremost expert on Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights, stated that the government should take bolder moves and conduct research on the Philippine Rise and establish internationally accepted names of the Rise's sea features to counter Chinese intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;http://malaya.com.ph/business-news/news/carpio-ph-should-name-philippine-rise-features-pronto&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians condemned the passive attitude of the Duterte government on Filipino sovereignty and sovereign rights, while the presidential palace maintained its stand that it shall continue to exercise sovereign rights and if possible, naming rights over features in the Philippine Rise while maintaining a cordial relationship with China despite continuous Chinese intrusions. In February 16, the Duterte government sent a fraction of its military personnel into Cagayan Valley to 'chase away' Chinese warships in the Rise. The foreign affairs secretary cited the deployment as the 'largest deployment of Marines to Cagayan Valley,'.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/16/18/govt-deploys-troops-to-guard-philippine-rise&lt;/ref&gt; In February 18, 2018, it was revealed that China, intends to name a total of 142 features within the coming months, where all proposed names shall be in native Chinese.

Photos of the event were circulated by the government online. In May 16, it was revealed that Duterte's son and special adviser did not rode a jetski in the Rise, instead they rode in Casiguran Bay of [[Casiguran, Aurora]], a small body of water thousands of kilometers west from the Rise and enveloped by a landmass separating it from the Rise. The revelation sparked further outrage. Opposition leaders called the jetski event as nothing but government 'publicity stunt'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/05/16/1815775/critics-hit-benham-rise-publicity-stunt-casiguran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/202832-bong-go-philippine-flag-benham-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and strategic significance==
[[File:Ph Territorial Map.png|thumb|Territorial waters of the [[Philippines]]. The Benham Rise is located directly east of [[Luzon]].]]
Benham Rise has been part of the culture of ancient Filipinos. Ancient [[Catanduanes]] people have fished and roamed the area long before the colonial era. In fact, it is celebrated in Catandunganons' folktales, legends and poetry. Today, large percentage of fish caught by Catandunganon comes from Benham Rise. Its local Catandunganon term is called Kalipung-awan (means loneliness in an isolated place), as fisherfolks who catch marine life in the area for days often feel loneliness due to the area's vast waters which is seldom fished by other ethnic peoples aside from those living in Catanduanes. Its strategic location southeast of [[Taiwan]], east of [[Luzon]], and west of American territory of [[Guam]] make it a feature of [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/04/china-may-have-been-surveying-strategic-waters-east-of-philippines/ |publisher=''[[The Diplomat]]'' |title=China May Have Been Surveying Strategic Waters East of Philippines |first=Steven |last=Stashwick |date=March 31, 2017 |access-date=March 31, 2017 |quote=The Benham Rise is directly south of the eastern approaches to the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, which is the main access route from the Western Pacific Ocean to the South China Sea.

In May 2017, the feature has been designated by the Philippines as a "protected food supply exclusive zone" prohibiting mining and oil exploration in the Benham Plateau.&lt;ref name="cnnphilrise"/&gt; To commemorate first anniversary of the Philippine government's renaming of the feature to "Philippine Rise", {{convert|500|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} of the feature was declared a "Strict Protection Zone" exclusive for use for scientific research, while about {{convert|3000|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} of the marine area is designated as a Special Fisheries Management Area.&lt;ref name="dutertempa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Virgil|title=Duterte declares parts of Benham Rise a marine protected area|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/653472/duterte-declares-benham-rise-a-marine-protected-area/story/|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=GMA News|date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
'''Corporate manslaughter''' is a [[crime]] in several [[jurisdiction]]s, including [[England and Wales]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Michael (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MunPbB_0MC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=hong+kong+manslaughter+company&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7zhzRXynew&amp;sig=ktkOL9Rmw8kpCsL7HcREww09e4E&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ei=-2Q4TPGtGM-LkAWojtWsAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ ''Criminal law in Hong Kong'', p.400], Hong Kong University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It enables a [[corporation]] to be punished and censured for culpable conduct that leads to a person's death. This extends beyond any compensation that might be awarded in [[civil litigation]] or any criminal prosecution of an individual (including an employee or contractor). The [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]] came into effect in the UK on 6 April 2008.

==Theory==
Clarkson identifies six theories of corporate manslaughter:&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;
*Identification doctrine;
*Aggregation doctrine;
*Reactive corporate fault;
*Vicarious liability; 
*Management failure model; and
*Corporate ''[[mens rea]]''.

===Identification doctrine===
This approach holds that the offence of corporate manslaughter is made out when an individual commits all the elements of the offence of [[manslaughter]] and that person is sufficiently senior to be seen as the [[controlling mind]] of the corporation. Prior to the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, this is how the law applied in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

===Aggregation doctrine===
This approach, known in the [[U.S. law|U.S.]] as the '''collective knowledge doctrine''', aggregates all the acts and mental elements of various company employees and finds the offence if all the elements of manslaughter are made out, though not necessarily within a single '''controlling mind'''. This approach is used in the U.S. but has been rejected in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

===Reactive corporate fault===
This idea was proposed by Fisse and Braithwaite.&lt;ref&gt;Fisse (1983), Fisse &amp; Braithwaite (1988, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that where an individual had committed the ''[[actus reus]]'' of manslaughter, a court should have the power to order the employing corporation to institute measures to prevent further recurrence and should face criminal prosecution should they fail to do so.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

===Vicarious liability===
The broader principle of [[vicarious liability]] (''[[respondeat superior]]'' in the U.S.) is often invoked to establish corporate manslaughter. In the U.S., where an employee commits a crime within the sphere of his employment and with the intention of benefitting the corporation, his criminality can be imputed to the company. The principle has sometimes been used in England and Wales for [[strict liability]] offences concerning regulatory matters but the exact law is unclear.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

===Management failure model===
This is the approach to be taken under the [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]] which came into force in the UK in April 2008. Where a corporation's activities cause a person's death and the failure was because of a breach that falls far below what can reasonably be expected of the organisation in the circumstances, the offence is made out.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

===Corporate ''mens rea''===
A further approach is to accept the [[legal fiction]] of [[Juristic person|corporate personality]] and to extend it to the possibility of a corporate ''mens rea'', to be found in corporate practices and policies.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt; This approach has been widely advocated in the U.S., as the '''corporate ethos standard'''&lt;ref&gt;Ragozino (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in [[Australian law|Australia]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Rose (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==
The existence of such a crime has been criticised, especially from the point of view of [[law and economics]] which argues that civil [[damages]] are a more appropriate means of compensation, recognition of the loss suffered and deterrence.&lt;ref name="clarkson"&gt;Clarkson (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments emphasise that, because the civil courts award compensation commensurate with the damage done, they apply the appropriate level of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;Khanna (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | ... pursuing corporate criminal liability results in society bearing the higher sanctioning costs of stigma penalties and the increased costs of deterring corporate misbehaviour created by the procedural protections of criminal law. | Khanna (1996) ''p.''1533 }}

Again, such arguments contend that "over-deterrence" may divert resources from other socially beneficial activities.&lt;ref&gt;Fischel &amp; Sykes (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | ... when the penalty exceeds the social harm, the problem of socially excessive product prices and litigation costs again arises. | Fischel &amp; Sykes (1996), ''p.''325 }}

However, these views have themselves been criticised. Clarkson identifies four valuable characteristics of criminal prosecution:&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;
*Stronger procedural protection of corporations, such as proof [[beyond reasonable doubt]];
*More powerful enforcement agencies, such as the [[Health and Safety Executive]] in the [[UK]];
*The stigma and censure that follow from conviction; and
*The symbolic role of criminal law that "sends a message" to society.

A further strand of criticism holds that only individuals can commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission'' [1995] 2 AC 500, at 507 ''per'' [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffmann]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it is individuals who feel the threat of deterrence. In [[England and Wales|England]] in 1994, OLL Ltd were convicted of corporate manslaughter over the [[Lyme Bay kayaking tragedy]] and [[Fine (penalty)|fined]] £60,000 while Peter Kite, one of the company's [[company director|directors]], was [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d to three years' [[imprisonment]], arguably a greater influence on the conduct of company managers.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Kite and Others'', ''The Independent'', 9 December 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further, a corporation may simply be a "veil" for an individual's activities, easily [[liquidation|liquidated]] and with no reputation to protect.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt; Again it is argued, company fines ultimately punish [[shareholder]]s, [[customer]]s and [[employee]]s in general, rather than culpable managers.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt;

==By jurisdiction==

===United Kingdom===
*[[Corporate manslaughter (England and Wales)]]

===Australia===
The [[Australian Capital Territory]] recognises the crime of [[Industrial manslaughter]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]] Bill C-45 was enacted as a response to the [[Westray Mine]] explosion that killed twenty-six miners in 1992. The Bill added a new section to the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] which reads, "217.1 Every one who undertakes, or has the authority, to direct how another person does work or performs a task is under a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to that person, or any other person, arising from that work or task."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/legisl/billc45.html|title=Bill C-45 - Overview |date=2015-03-18|publisher=Canadian Centre for Occupational Health &amp; Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In 2012, proposals were put forward in the [[New Zealand]] Parliament for a corporate manslaughter statute, in the wake of the CTV building collapse during the [[2011 Canterbury earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/rebuilding-christchurch/8474797/Corporate-manslaughter-law-change-weighed|title=Corporate manslaughter law change weighed |author=Tracy Watkins|date=2013-03-26|publisher=Fairfax NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pike River Mine disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6684847/Pike-River-hearing-told-corporate-manslaughter-charge-needed|title=Pike River hearing told corporate manslaughter charge needed|date=2012-04-03|publisher=Fairfax NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015 [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] had a [[private member's bill]] in the ballot that would, if passed, add a charge of corporate manslaughter to the [[Crimes Act 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/proposed-bills/51HOH_MEMBILL044_1/crimes-corporate-manslaughter-amendment-bill|title=Crimes (Corporate Manslaughter) Amendment Bill|date=2013-12-03|publisher=NZ Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, anyone who prevents someone from leaving a country or state and may have lawfully arrested and held such persons for a length of time may be referred to as a Detaining Power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/375?OpenDocument|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - Geneva Convention (III) on Prisoners of War, 1949|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">The '''Digital Divide Network''' (DDN) is an online community of activists, policymakers, researchers and concerned citizens interested in sharing knowledge to help bridge the [[digital divide]]. It is a spinoff of Helping.org (Helping.org later changed its name to [[Network for Good]]). [[TakingITGlobal]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada produces and coordinates DDN.

== History ==

DDN was originally launched as the Digital Divide Clearinghouse in October 1999. The Clearinghouse was a section of a larger web portal called Helping.org. Launched by the [[AOL Foundation]], the [[Benton Foundation]], the [[National Urban League]] and other institutions, Helping.org was dedicated to volunteerism, technology [[capacity building]] for [[Non-profit organizations|nonprofits]] and charitable giving. Two months after the website was launched, [[Bill Clinton]] hosted a national Digital Divide Summit in [[Washington D.C.]] During the meeting, representatives from [[civil society]] and the private sector met with Clinton; soon, the idea was hatched to create a new national [[Web portal]] dedicated to bridging the digital divide. This decision led to the Digital Divide Clearinghouse spinning off from Helping.org to become a new website, [http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org The Digital Divide Network], which was launching in December 1999 by the Benton Foundation.

DDN has become a leading website for organizations interested in sharing news, research and other resources to help bridge the digital divide. The site has become more international as well, with users from more than 75 countries. In February 2004, the site and its senior staff relocated to [[Massachusetts]] to move their operation to the Education Development Center (EDC), as part of the creation of a new institute called the EDC Center for Media &amp; Community. DDN was then managed by director [[Andy Carvin]]. Cedar Pruitt served as website editor from April 2004 until September 2005. DDN is managed by TakingITGlobal.org, the Toronto-based [[NGO]] that redesigned the website in 2004.  Andy Carvin is no longer directly involved in the website, though he continues to moderate the group's email discussion list.

{{Disability}}
The '''Disability Discrimination Act''' is an act passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] in which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, education, publicly-available premises, provision of goods and services, accommodation, clubs and associations, and other contexts. Discrimination is defined to include failing to make reasonable adjustments for the person.

Complaints made under the Act are made to the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]].

==Background to the legislation==
At the time of the Act's enactment, a variety of anti-discrimination acts for people with disabilities already existed in the different state legislatures, some dating back to the early 1980s. All states and territories except [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]] had anti-discrimination laws in place, and these two places had legislation under consideration. There were three reasons given for enacting a federal law:
*Standardise the scope of rights offered around the country
*Implement the Australian Government’s obligations as a signatory to international declarations on the rights of people with disabilities.
*Enable regulation of discriminatory practices of Commonwealth authorities.

==Productivity Commission report==
In 2004, the findings of the [[Productivity Commission]]'s enquiry into the Act were published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070209175007/http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiry/dda/finalreport/index.html "Review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992"], 30 April 2004, [[Productivity Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission found that while there was still room for improvement, particularly in reducing discrimination in employment, overall the Act had been reasonably effective.

In addition, the Commission found that people with a disability were still less likely than other people to finish school, have a TAFE or university qualification, and be employed. They are more likely to have a below average income, be on a pension, live in public housing and in prison. The average personal income for people with a disability is 44 per cent of the income of other Australians.

==Significant cases==

===Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (2000)===
{{main|Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (2000)}}

This case, brought by Bruce Maguire, concerned the website of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympics]], and the inability of those with [[vision impairment]]s to efficiently use the website.

In its decision, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Commission]] found that the [[Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]] (SOCOG) had discriminated against the complainant in contravention of s 24 of the Act, "in that the web site does not include ALT text on all images and image maps links, the Index to Sports cannot be accessed from the Schedule page and the Results Tables provided during the Games on the web site will remain inaccessible."

The Commission also dismissed SOCOG's claim that modifying its website to meet the requirements would cause it unjustifiable hardship and established that such hardship cannot be used to avoid liability for breaching s 24 of the Act. SOCOG was ordered to render the website accessible by 15 September 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">The '''Dixmoor 5''' are five [[African-American]] men who, as teenagers in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], were falsely convicted of the 1991 rape and murder of 14-year-old Cateresa Matthews. At the time of arrest, the defendants, Robert Taylor, Jonathan Barr, James Harden, Robert Lee Veal and Shainne Sharp were all between the ages of 14 and 16.

During high pressure interviews, three of them gave false confessions leading to convictions for all five. The teens alleged that they were coerced into confessing, claiming they were physically abused and threatened during their interrogations. One of the boys who confessed had an IQ of 56 and developmental disabilities. Two pleaded guilty and testified against the others in exchange for shorter sentences.

'''Eliot Laurence Spitzer''' (born June 10, 1959) is a retired American politician, attorney, and educator. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served as the 54th [[Governor of New York]] from 2007 until 2008.

Spitzer worked as an attorney in private practice with several New York law firms before becoming attorney general, where he worked for six years as a prosecutor with the office of the Manhattan district attorney. He was then elected to two four-year terms as the [[New York State Attorney General|Attorney General of New York]], serving from 1999 to 2006.  He was elected Governor of New York and served as the [[List of Governors of New York|54th Governor of New York]], from January 1, 2007, until his resignation on March 17, 2008, in the midst of [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|a prostitution scandal]].&lt;ref name="resignationCNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/12/spitzer/index.html |title=Spitzer to step down by Monday |accessdate=March 12, 2008 |publisher=CNN | date=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org] | March 12, 2008 | Spitzer Resigns After Sex Scandal, Pressure | [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88134976]&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to attend [[Harvard Law School]], where he met and married [[Silda Wall Spitzer|Silda Wall]]. Spitzer was an editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.

==Legal career==
Upon receiving his [[Juris Doctor]], Spitzer clerked for Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, then joined the law firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]]. He stayed there for less than two years before leaving to join the New York County District Attorney's office.

Spitzer joined the staff of Manhattan District Attorney [[Robert M. Morgenthau]], where he became chief of the labor-racketeering unit and spent six years (1986-1992) pursuing [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name="Atlas01"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donway|first1=Roger|title=Eliot Spitzer: Ayatollah General|url=http://atlassociety.org/commentary/capitalism-and-morality/capitalism-morality-blog/3650-eliot-spitzer-ayatollah-general|website=The Atlas Society|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer's biggest case came in 1992, when he led the investigation that ended the [[Gambino crime family]]'s organized crime control of Manhattan's trucking and garment industries.

Spitzer devised a plan to set up his own sweatshop in the city's garment district, where he turned out shirts, pants and sweaters, and hired 30 laborers. The shop manager eventually got close to the Gambinos, and officials were able to plant a bug in their office. The Gambinos, rather than being charged with extortion – which was hard to prove – were charged with antitrust violations.&lt;ref name="Atlas01" /&gt; Joseph and [[Thomas Gambino]], the latter being an extremely high-ranking member, and two other defendants took the deal and avoided jail by pleading guilty, paying $12 million in fines and agreeing to stay out of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Adi| last=Ignatius| title=Wall Street's Top Cop| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003960,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=December 30, 2002| accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitzer left the District Attorney's office in 1992 to work at the law firm of [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.biography.com/people/eliot-spitzer-279076#background |title=Eliot Spitzer Biography|publisher=[[FYI (U.S. TV channel)|Bio.]] |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1998 he worked at the law firm Constantine and Partners on a number of consumer rights and antitrust cases.

==New York State Attorney General==

===Campaigns===
{{Main|New York Attorney General elections}}
{{See also|Electoral history of Eliot Spitzer}}

====1994 campaign====
In February 1991 [[Robert Abrams]], a Democrat and the longstanding New York State Attorney General, announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate seat for New York then occupied by incumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[Al D'Amato]].&lt;ref name="Verhovek01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verhovek|first1=Sam Howe|title=Abrams to Run For U.S. Senate In 1992 Contest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/02/nyregion/abrams-to-run-for-us-senate-in-1992-contest.html|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he announced his intention the Senate election was almost two years in the future. Abrams won the nomination in the Democratic primary but narrowly lost to D'Amato in the general election in November 1992. Ten months later, in September, 1993, Abrams announced that he would resign his position as Attorney General as of December 31, 1993, although he still had one year remaining in his term. To fill this vacancy the New York State Legislature elected Assemblyman [[G. Oliver Koppell]] to serve out the remainder of the Attorney General's term during 1993.

Thirty-four-year-old Spitzer decided to run as a Democratic candidate in the 1994 election for Attorney General, as did Koppell, Brooklyn Family Court Judge [[Karen Burstein]], and Kings County DA [[Charles J. Hynes]]. At the time, Spitzer was a young and relatively unknown defense attorney representing white-collar criminals. When he announced his campaign Spitzer suggested that, if elected, he would use the state's antitrust laws to pursue corporate polluters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF97CFAD23DF11&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM News Archives: The Buffalo News]. Nl.newsbank.com (May 5, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer was the only candidate to support the [[Capital punishment in New York|death penalty]]. In a televised debate among the candidates, Spitzer was criticized for financing his campaign using $3 million of his own and family money.&lt;ref name="DailyGazette01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Attorney General Race Wide Open|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zxQxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=leAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4158,3131582&amp;dq=elliot+spitzer&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=The Daily Gazette (Schenectady)|agency=Associated Press|date=12 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite heavy funding from his own family, he placed last among the four Democratic candidates for the nomination, receiving just 19% of the vote. Burstein, the only woman and gay candidate,&lt;ref name="Gazette02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mokrzycki|first1=Mike|title=Burstein just ahead of Koppell|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0RQxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=leAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3130,3514464&amp;dq=elliot+spitzer&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=The Daily Gazette|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the primary with 31% of vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=88209 NY Attorney General – D Primary Race – Sep 13, 1994]. Our Campaigns.&lt;/ref&gt; Burstein subsequently lost in the general election to Republican [[Dennis Vacco]], part of a nationwide Republican sweep, that included the election of Republican [[George Pataki]] as the new Governor of New York displacing the Democratic incumbent, Governor [[Mario Cuomo]].

====1998 campaign====
Four years later, Spitzer again wanted to run for Attorney General and on May 6, 1998 he announced he would run for the office for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF9ADDE8887B16&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM News Archives: The Buffalo News]. Nl.newsbank.com (May 6, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, he emerged as the front-runner among the Democratic candidates, ranking first at the Democratic convention with 36% of the vote. He also had the most amount of money, with over $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/28/nyregion/primary-ahead-in-attorney-general-race.html Primary Ahead in Attorney General Race – New York Times]. ''The New York Times''. (May 28, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he won the Democratic [[primary election]] with 42% of the vote. He defeated State Senator [[Catherine Abate]] (27%), Koppell (22%), and former Governor's Counsel Evan Davis (9%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=122181 NY Attorney General – D Primary Race – Sep 15, 1998]. Our Campaigns.&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election Spitzer would face the incumbent, Dennis Vacco, a Republican.

In late October, he conceded that his father lent him most of the money he raised. He financed both campaigns from two sets of loans: $4.3 million in 1994 and $4.8 million in 1998, both from [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Company]]. Spitzer stated "I have worked long, long hours for my dad and for various businesses. Look, I'm not saying that I am underpaid. But any effort to challenge the propriety of that fee is way off base."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/28/nyregion/1998-campaign-money-spitzer-concedes-that-his-father-has-helped-pay-for.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE MONEY; Spitzer Concedes That His Father Has Helped to Pay for Campaigns – New York Times]. ''The New York Times''. (October 28, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; On October 28, ''[[The New York Times]]'' endorsed Spitzer saying both candidates were flawed but "Vacco's performance and his key policy positions make him an even worse choice. In only four years Mr. Vacco has turned an important office with a distinguished public-service tradition into a patronage mill known for taking suspect contributions and for his mixed record on such key issues as women's right to abortion." They also said "Spitzer has promised a politically moderate approach that puts the public interest ahead of rigid philosophy and special-interest contributors."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/opinion/eliot-spitzer-for-attorney-general.html Eliot Spitzer for Attorney General – New York Times]. ''The New York Times''. (October 29, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Spitzer went on to defeat Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco by a small margin of victory of 0.6%. Spitzer did not win a single county in [[Upstate New York]]. Amazingly, he won just 6 counties in the state: [[New York County, New York|New York]] (81%), [[Bronx County, New York|Bronx]] (80%), [[Kings County, New York|Kings]] (75%), [[Queens County, New York|Queens]] (67%), [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] (52%), and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] (48%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=79411 NY Attorney General Race – Nov 03, 1998]. Our Campaigns.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002 reelection campaign====
In 2002 Spitzer ran for re-election and a second term as New York's Attorney General. Spitzer defeated Republican Judge [[Dora Irizarry]] 66%–30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1657 NY Attorney General Race – Nov 05, 2002]. Our Campaigns.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure overview===
As Attorney General, Spitzer stepped up the profile of the office. Traditionally, state attorneys general have pursued [[consumer rights]] cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate [[white-collar crime]], securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Gross|authorlink=Daniel Gross|title=Eliot Spitzer – How New York's attorney general became the most powerful man on Wall Street |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2108509/sidebar/2108525 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Attorney General's office has [[Wall Street]] (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the [[Martin Act]] of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to [[subpoena]] witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this [[statute]] to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Kroft |title=The Sheriff of Wall Street |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/23/60minutes/main555310.shtml |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=May 25, 2003 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Raymond J. |last=Keating |title=Spitzer's 'federalist papers' are onerous |url=http://blog.nysrpa.org/?p=513 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=August 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. [[corporate scandal]]s that began with the collapse of [[Enron]] in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and [[United States Congress|Congress]] failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in [[public opinion]].

During his term in office Spitzer also commissioned a 1999 study of the [[NYPD]]'s [[stop-and-frisk]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dianepublishing.net/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=0788187538|title= New York City Police Department's 'Stop &amp; Frisk' Practices: A Report to the People of the State of New York from the Office of the Attorney General|publisher=Diane Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Nation]]'' endorsed Spitzer as a possible Democratic candidate for vice president, stating that he was "the single most effective battler against [[corporate abuses]] in either political party".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&amp;pid=1295 Running for Running Mate]. ''The Nation''. Retrieved March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, not chosen.

In January 2005, the president of the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] described Spitzer's approach as "the most egregious and unacceptable form of intimidation we've seen in this country in modern times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. group is taking on Spitzer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/worldbusiness/us-group-is-taking-on-spitzer.html

===Notable cases===

In addition to prosecutions and civil actions in the financial sector, Spitzer pursued cases in both state and federal courts involving pollution, entertainment, technology, prostitution, corruption, occupational safety and health.

===Loan investigation controversy===
The New York State Senate Investigations committee considered investigating a controversial multi-million dollar loan the governor's father [[Bernard Spitzer]] gave him when he ran for attorney general in 1998, a loan the younger Spitzer paid back.&lt;ref name="2nyt072307"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loanpost072307"&gt;Dicker, Fredric.

[[File:Spitzer-on-stage (292269882).jpg|thumb|Spitzer celebrating on Election Night]]
On December 8, 2004, Spitzer announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of New York. While long rumored, Spitzer's announcement was unusually early—nearly two years before the election. As a result of Spitzer's relative speed in bringing state Democrats to his side, he gained the respect of Democratic leaders nationwide. [[New Mexico]] Governor [[Bill Richardson]] dubbed Spitzer the "future of the Democratic Party" at a fund raiser held in June 2005 for Spitzer's gubernatorial campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In January 2006, Spitzer selected New York State Senate minority leader [[David Paterson]] as his choice for lieutenant governor and running mate. After announcing his candidacy, Spitzer was endorsed by numerous New Yorkers, including state Comptroller [[Alan Hevesi]] and two former New York City mayors, [[David Dinkins]] and [[Ed Koch]].

Spitzer was elected governor on November 7, 2006, when he defeated Republican [[John Faso]] and [[Libertarian Party of New York|Libertarian]] John Clifton, among others, with 69 percent of the vote. He won with the largest margin of victory ever in a New York gubernatorial race.&lt;ref&gt;Plotch, Philip Mark. ''Politics Across the Hudson: The Tappan Zee Megaproject''.

During the traditional midnight ceremony on January 1, 2007, Spitzer was sworn in as Governor of New York. A public ceremony was held at 1 p.m. on the same day that featured brass and percussion players from the [[Empire State Youth Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cooper |title=Amid Champagne and Cheers, Spitzer Is Sworn in as Governor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/nyregion/01inaug.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking tradition, the ceremony was held outdoors – the first outdoor inauguration ceremony in New York for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aVp7olerYxwc&amp;refer=home "Spitzer, Sworn in as New York Governor, Vows Historic Reform"], Bloomberg, January 1, 2007. Retrieved July 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After taking the oath of office, he attended a concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in his honor, headlined by [[James Taylor]] and [[Natalie Merchant]].

===Legislative measures supported===
* [[Jonathan's Law]] – In May 2007 Governor Spitzer signed this legislation concerning parental and guardian access to files and records concerning their children and child abuse investigations.

===Roadblocks to reform===
[[File:EliotSpitzerApril24.07.jpg|thumb|left|Spitzer speaking in April 2007]]
Spitzer's reform-based platform, and his pledge "to change the ethics of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]", hit an early roadblock when his ideas on how to fill vacancies in the executive department were defeated by the state legislature. According to the [[New York State Constitution]], it is the duty of the state legislature to fill executive vacancies. The governor was criticized as unreasonable for admonishing the legislature when it took constitutional actions. The appointment of state assemblyman [[Thomas DiNapoli]] to succeed the disgraced [[Alan Hevesi]] as [[New York State Comptroller]] was a serious blow to the new governor. Spitzer had backed an outside panel to draft a list of qualified candidates; the legislature resisted Spitzer's desires when these included no legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cooper |title=Legislators Pick a Comptroller, Defying Spitzer. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/nyregion/08comptroller.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 8, 2007 |accessdate=February 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Assembly Democrats were alienated over the incident, and questioned Spitzer's refusal of extending [[patronage]] to party members seeking local{{Vague|date=January 2010}} political appointments&lt;!-- Is this about state (as opposed to local, i.e., municipal, county, etc.) appts, calling for service near their homes or businesses? --&gt;.{{Verify source|date=January 2010}} Spitzer's choice was New York City Finance Commissioner [[Martha Stark]], who was selected by a panel that consisted of former State Comptroller [[Edward Regan]], former State Comptroller [[Carl McCall]] and former New York City Comptroller [[Harrison J. Goldin]]. On February 7, 2007, when the Legislature voted, Stark was one of two names put into nomination, along with Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Long Island, Assembly Leader [[Sheldon Silver]]'s choice. The final vote was 150 for DiNapoli and 56 for Stark. Stark's main support came from Democrats in the Senate, along with Republicans in both chambers.{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}

Spitzer traveled to the home districts of Democratic assemblymen William B. Magnarelli and George S. Latimer (in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Westchester County]] respectively), and publicly criticized them for their votes on DiNapoli; he had plans to exert similar pressure on other of his party's legislators.&lt;ref&gt;Fenner, Austin and Mahoney, Joe. {{cite web |url=http://nydailynews.com/front/v-pfriendly/story/497049p-418915c.html |title=Bulldog Spitzer rips pol |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', February 12, 2007.

Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Spitzer's key campaign pledges was to reform the state budget process. While the state did pass a budget on schedule in 2007, the ultimate results fell short of what many reformers hoped Spitzer would achieve. The ''[[New York Post]]'' opined, "Spitzer promised reform, and delivered something completely different" and termed the budget itself "bitterly disappointing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/04032007/postopinion/editorials/eliots_education_editorials_.htm "ELIOT'S EDUCATION"], ''[[New York Post]]'', April 3, 2007. Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitzer's budget quickly turned into a deficit, as by the end of October it was projected the state would run a deficit exceeding $4 billion for the year. During Spitzer's first year the state payroll increased, aggravating the budget problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2007/12/10/daily37.html |title=State payroll jumps with Spitzer | date=December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing the public sector payroll, in late 2007 New York State started leading the nation in lost jobs. The 2008–09 budget includes measures to counter financial effects of the crisis in the financial sector starting in the second half of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.budget.state.ny.us/eBudget0809/ExecutiveBudgetPresentation2008-09Final.pdf |title=2008–09 Executive Budget, Eliot Spitzer |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311190720/http://publications.budget.state.ny.us/eBudget0809/ExecutiveBudgetPresentation2008-09Final.pdf |archivedate=March 11, 2008 }}.

Spitzer was criticized by members of the [[New York State Legislature]] for failing to compromise on issues during his first few months as governor. In one exchange, according to the ''New York Post'', Spitzer told New York State Assembly Minority Leader [[James Tedisco]]: "Listen, I'm a f - - -king [hyphens ''sic'' on ''Post'' website] steamroller and I'll roll over you and anybody else", although they reported that neither party had provided the confirmation the ''Post'' sought.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, Fredric.

Tedisco later accused Spitzer of cutting $300,000 of state funding for health care and education grants in the [[Schenectady]] area as retaliation for Tedisco's opposition to the Spitzer plan to allow [[illegal immigrants]] New York State driver's licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredric U.

In the wake of the  [[Eliot Spitzer political surveillance controversy|political surveillance controversy]] involving Bruno, Spitzer was accused of pandering to special interest groups to solidify his base of support. "The governor who took office vowing to clean up Albany has lost so much public support that he is reduced to feathering the nest of the unions and other liberals," wrote Michael Goodwin of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Michael, [http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_cornered_by_troopergate_spitzer_is_showi.html Cornered by Troopergate, Spitzer is showing his desperation], ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, ''The Washington Post'' published an [[op-ed]] written by Spitzer in which he criticized the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] for inhibiting States from pursuing [[predatory lending|predatory lender]]s.&lt;ref name="wplender"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302783.html|title=Predatory Lenders' Partner in Crime; How the Bush Administration Stopped the States From Stepping in to Help Consumers|last=Spitzer|first=Elliot |date=February 14, 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposal to legalize same-sex marriage===
In April 2007, Spitzer proposed a bill that would legalize [[same-sex marriage in New York]]. State Senate Majority Leader [[Joe Bruno]] announced his opposition to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitzer unveils gay marriage bill; Senate leader balks|agency=Associated Press |date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation passed in the [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]] on June 19, 2007, but was denied in the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and was returned to the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A08590|title=Bill Summary – A08590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2007, Spitzer issued an [[executive order]] directing that state offices allow illegal immigrants to be issued [[driver's license]]s effective December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Department of Motor Vehicles Changes License Policy to Include More New Yorkers and Implements New Regime of Anti-Fraud Measures to Strengthen the Security of the System

===Resignation===
In the wake of the revelations, Spitzer announced on March 12, 2008, that he would resign his post as governor at noon on March 17, 2008, amid threats of his [[impeachment]] by state lawmakers.&lt;ref name=resignationCNN/&gt;

Spitzer said at a news conference in Manhattan: 

{{quote|I cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the people's work. Over the course of my public life, I have insisted{{emdash}}I believe correctly{{emdash}}that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself.

Spitzer's lieutenant governor, [[David Paterson]], succeeded him as governor of New York State and served the remaining {{sfrac|2|3|4}} years of Spitzer's four year term.

==Post-resignation==

===Prostitution scandal developments===
On July 16, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article that explained how Spitzer used campaign funds to pay for two [[Mayflower Hotel]] bookings, $411.06 apiece, where he was alleged to have met with prostitutes. While it remains unclear if Spitzer stayed in the hotel on the nights he booked, ''The Times'' has stated that Spitzer met with prostitutes in early 2008. Spitzer declined to comment on the issue.&lt;ref name="New York Times2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spitzer Charged Campaign for Hotel Bills, Raising Question About His Funds |first=Danny |last=Hakim |work=The New York Times |date=June 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/nyregion/16spitzer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, prosecutors who were in charge of the case announced that Spitzer would not face criminal charges for his involvement in the sex ring. They cited that no evidence of misuse of public funds was found and therefore it would not serve the public interest to press charges against Spitzer, who offered an apology for his conduct, saying "I appreciate the impartiality and thoroughness of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and I acknowledge and accept responsibility for the conduct it disclosed."&lt;ref name="times/no charges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/nyregion/07spitzer.html |title=No Federal Prostitution Charges for Spitzer |last=Hakim|first=Danny|author2=William K.

In September 2009, Spitzer joined the faculty of the [[City College of New York]] as an adjunct instructor of political science and taught an undergraduate course called "Law and Public Policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/humanities/rifkind/upload/Spitzer-Flyer-2.pdf|title=A Special Private Conversation with Gov.

=== Media appearances ===
Spitzer continued to make public appearances and engage in media commitments following his resignation. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a Spitzer opinion piece in November 2008 conveying his analysis of the [[financial crisis of 2008]] and suggested remedies. Spitzer concluded the piece by saying that he hoped the Obama Administration would make the right policy choices, "although mistakes I made in my private life now prevent me from participating in these issues as I have in the past."&lt;ref name=WaPoOpEd&gt;{{cite news |title=How to Ground the Street|first=Spitzer |last=Eliot|work=The Washington Post|date=November 16, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111303634.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitzer became a regular columnist for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine and in December, 2008 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' published the first of a new series of columns by Spitzer dedicated to the economy.&lt;ref name="Slate.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Too Big Not To Fail |first=Eliot |last=Spitzer |publisher=Slate.com |date=December 3, 2008 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2205995/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 22, 2011, ''The New York Times'' reported that Spitzer has been sued for a combined $90 million over an August 22, 2010 ''Slate'' column about Wall Street firm [[Marsh &amp; McLennan]] by two former executives of the company, claiming that they were libeled by the column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/business/media/spitzer-and-slate-face-lawsuit-over-column-on-wall-street.html| title=Spitzer and Slate Face Defamation Lawsuit| first=Jeremy W.| last=Peters| newspaper=The New York Times| date=August 22, 2011| accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit by one of the executives was dismissed the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/nyregion/federal-judge-dismisses-libel-lawsuit-against-ex-gov-spitzer.html | title=Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Ex-Gov.

Spitzer took on various public speaking arrangements, beginning with a discussion with the New York chapter of the [[Entrepreneurs' Organization]] on June 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Intimate Evening With Eliot Spitzer |first=Joseph |last=Steinberg |publisher=EO-NY |date=April 7, 2009 |url=http://www.eonyc.org/index.php?section=events&amp;evtid=704 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422151624/http://www.eonyc.org/index.php?section=events |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also made a number of television appearances in 2009 and 2010, including ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and ''[[Campbell Brown (TV series)|Campbell Brown]]'' (CNN program), as well as appearing as a substitute anchor on [[MSNBC]]. On June 24, 2010, [[CNN]] announced that Spitzer would be joining the network to host a "round-table" discussion program alongside center-right commentator [[Kathleen Parker]]. ''Parker Spitzer'', compared by some media outlets to the defunct ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', replaced ''[[Campbell Brown (TV series)|Campbell Brown]]'' in the 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] timeslot on weeknights starting in October.&lt;ref name="spitzerparker1"&gt;{{Cite news | title = US: Former governor Eliot Spitzer joins CNN | work = The Spy Report | publisher = Media Spy | date = June 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/06/25/us-former-governor-eliot-spitzer-joins-cnn/ | accessdate = June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, CNN announced that Parker was leaving the show, which was renamed ''[[In the Arena]]'' on February 28, 2011. On July 6, 2011, CNN announced it was canceling ''In the Arena'' and shifting ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' to the 8 p.m. time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/cnn-cancels-in-the-arena-with-eliot-spitzer/| date=July 6, 2011| title=CNN Cancels 'In the Arena' With Eliot Spitzer| first=Brian| last=Stelter| newspaper= The New York Times| accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2012, Spitzer joined Al Gore's cable television network, [[Current TV]], in the wake of the sudden firing of [[Keith Olbermann]] from the network, and immediately began hosting his own program ''[[Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Gore|Gore, Al]], and [[Joel Hyatt]], [http://current.com/blog/93722062_open-letter-to-the-viewers-of-current.htm "Open letter to the viewers of Current"], Current TV, March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 6, 2013, Spitzer announced that he had left both ''Viewpoint'' and Current TV, and that he would not be joining Current TV in its latest venture with [[Al Jazeera]]. "Moving forward, their mission will be different," he said. He also stated: "For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues. It was a continuation of what I tried to do in government. And that doesn't fit with their vision of what they are going to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eliot Spitzer Ends His Show on Current TV|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/eliot-spitzer-end-his-show-on-current-tv/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 7, 2013|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2013, Spitzer announced he was running for [[New York City Comptroller]], and would start a petition the following day. 3,750 valid signatures from registered voters from his party were required by July 11 to register for the race but Spitzer was able to submit over 27,000 signatures to the city Board of Elections before the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spitzer Submits Signatures to Get on NYC Ballot|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/spitzer-submits-signatures-get-nyc-ballot|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer commented that he was asking for forgiveness, and hopeful that voters could forgive him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asking Forgiveness, Spitzer Will Run for City Comptroller |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/nyregion/spitzer-seeks-ballot-for-city-comptrollers-race.html|first=Michael|last=Barbaro|first2=David W.|last2=Chen|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Eliot Spitzer lost the primary on September 10, 2013 to [[Scott Stringer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live Results: New York City Primary Elections|url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2013/nyc-primary-results?rr|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 10, 2013|first=Aaron|last=Bycoffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investing===
In 2012, Spitzer became an investor in [[TipRanks]], an Israeli financial technology start-up company that ranks Wall Street analysts. He became a member of the company's board of directors.&lt;ref name="Dealbook"/&gt;

===2016 extortion scandal===
In February 2016, Spitzer was investigated by the New York City Police Department after being accused of assault by Svetlana Travis-Zakharova, a woman from Russia, in an incident that supposedly occurred at the [[Plaza Hotel]] on February 13, 2016. The New York Daily News reported Spitzer had been accused of attacking the woman, who tried to kill herself by slitting her wrists after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-Gov. Spitzer being investigated for assaulting woman|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/ex-gov-spitzer-investigated-assaulting-woman-article-1.2531507|website = NY Daily News|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Travis subsequently recanted her accusations and no charges were filed.&lt;ref name="NYT2016Sept"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse|title=Eliot Spitzer Sues Woman Who Accused Him of Assault|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/nyregion/eliot-spitzer-sues-woman-who-accused-him-of-assault.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 September 2016|publisher=NewYorkTimes|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a month, Travis − who left for Russia in February&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hays|first1=Tom|title=Woman charged in ex-NY governor extortion plot held on bail|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3d85b54d4e9f485fa5f4b29a67de2385/woman-accused-trying-extort-money-ex-gov-spitzer|accessdate=12 October 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; − turned from an alleged victim into a suspect. On October 10, she was arrested upon landing at [[JFK International Airport]]. On October 12, Travis-Zakharova, 26,&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1/&gt; faced state charges of grand larceny by extortion, while also being investigated for prostitution. Over two years, prosecutors claimed, she had collected around $50,000 from Spitzer in exchange for keeping "intimate details" of their relationship secret from his relatives.&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP/&gt; The money was allegedly deposited into a bank in Russia.&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=James|title=Bail set at $1M for woman accused of extorting money from ex-NY Gov.

Also on October 12, Travis faced forgery and identity theft charges, from an unrelated incident, after purportedly signing a high-end apartment lease under a different name, costing the victim − a 67-year-old New Jersey man − $18,000. The bail was set at $1 million.&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_2/&gt;

== Real estate career ==

Following his father's illness and death in 2014 and with politics behind him, Spitzer came to lead his family's real estate business, Spitzer Enterprises, despite having avoided the role for much of his life. Spitzer sold his company's apartments in [[The Corinthian (Manhattan)|The Corinthian]] and the [[Crown Building (Manhattan)|Crown Building]] for a large profit, which he used to fund a $700 million project of three waterfront buildings in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|South Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Bagli |first1=Charles V. |title=Spitzer Charges Into His Family's Real Estate Business |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-06-15 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/nyregion/spitzer-charging-into-his-familys-real-estate-business.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Silda Wall Spitzer|Silda Wall]] and Eliot Spitzer married on October 17, 1987, and together they have three daughters: Elyssa (b. 1990), Sarabeth (b. 1993), and Jenna (b. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2013/03/10/silda-spitzer-still-with-husband-eliot-five-years-after-luv-guv-scandal |work=[[New York Post]] |title=Silda Spitzer still with husband Eliot five years after 'Luv Guv' scandal |first=Maureen |last=Callahan |date=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitzer is alleged to have had a romantic affair with Lis Smith, a 31-year-old spokeswoman for then-New York City Mayor-elect [[Bill de Blasio]].  She had been Spitzer's spokeswoman during his 2013 run for comptroller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/nyregion/spitzer-and-his-wife-say-their-marriage-is-over.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Spitzer and His Wife Say Their Marriage is over |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |date=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/nyregion/lis-smith-girl-bashed-out-of-a-job-in-mayors-office.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Tabloid Bashing, and a Lost Job With the Mayor |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |date=January 17, 2014 |quote=Ms. Smith was prepared for the negative press attention she knew she would receive as Mr. Spitzer's girlfriend, she told me.

The [[Association of European Research Libraries]] recommends the use of FAIR principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Association of European Research Libraries |title=Open Consultation on FAIR Data Action Plan - LIBER |url=https://libereurope.eu/blog/2018/07/13/fairdataconsultation/ |website=LIBER |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 paper by advocates of FAIR data reported that awareness of the FAIR concept was increasing among various researchers and institutes, but also, understanding of the concept was becoming confused as different people apply their own differing perspectives to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mons |first1=Barend |last2=Neylon |first2=Cameron |last3=Velterop |first3=Jan |last4=Dumontier |first4=Michel |last5=da Silva Santos |first5=Luiz Olavo Bonino |last6=Wilkinson |first6=Mark D. |title=Cloudy, increasingly FAIR; revisiting the FAIR Data guiding principles for the European Open Science Cloud |journal=Information Services &amp; Use |date=7 March 2017 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=49–56 |doi=10.3233/ISU-170824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4515">'''Fair play for musicians''' is a full-page propaganda [[advertisement]] that was published on 7 December 2006 in the [[Financial Times]] newspaper calling on the [[UK]] Government to extend the existing 50 years [[copyright]] protection for sound recordings in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppluk.com/ppl/ppl_cd.nsf/News20061206  |title=British musicians demand fair play on copyright term |accessdate=17 November 2008 |publisher=[[Phonographic Performance Limited]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009082025/http://www.ppluk.com/ppl/ppl_cd.nsf/News20061206 |archivedate = 9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consisted of around 4,500 names in small print filling the full page and its style was consistent with other newspaper [[petitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/suw/320393547/in/set-72157594416637345 |title=I see dead people 1 |accessdate=17 November 2008 |publisher=[[Flickr]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The text "fair play for musicians" appeared in large red type over the list of names.  In the centre of the page a box contained the text:
:"We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright in sound recordings."
At the bottom of the page the following text appeared:
:"On behalf of over 3,500 record companies and 40,000 performers"

The 'fair play for musicians' advertisement was viewed as a direct response to the [[Gowers Review]] published by the [[British Government]] on 6 December 2006 which recommended the retention of the 50 year protection for sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6216152.stm |title=Musicians sign copyright advert |accessdate=17 November 2008 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertisement was organised by [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] as another element of their campaign for retrospective copyright term extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2006/12/12/i-see-dead-people/ |title=I see dead people |accessdate=17 November 2008 |publisher=[[Open Rights Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement was controversial as it was seen as another step in a protracted campaign to influence British Government policy, and gave rise to worldwide media coverage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/07/gowers_europe/ |title=Music industry will take copyright battle to Europe |accessdate=17 November 2008 |publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/09/comment.music |title=They live like aristocrats.

Moore]] and a stone monument of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the rotunda of the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]].

==Background==
When Judge Moore was a circuit court judge, he became famous for his fights over the display of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom.

On August 1, 2001, Justice Moore unveiled a 5,280-pound (2,400&amp;nbsp;kg) block of granite with the Ten Commandments engraved on it, installed during the middle of the preceding night without the knowledge of the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] Associate Justices.&lt;ref&gt;''Glassroth'', 229 F. Supp. 2d at 1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of lawyers consisting of [[Stephen R. Glassroth]], [[Melinda Maddox]] and [[Beverly Howard (lawyer)|Beverly Howard]], who felt their clients might not receive fair treatment if they did not share Moore's religious opinion, and that the placement of the monument violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], filed civil suits in [[United States district court|Federal Court]] against Justice Moore in his official capacity as Chief Justice to have the monument removed.

==District Court proceedings==
The trial began on October 15, 2002. Evidence for the plaintiffs included testimony that lawyers of different religious beliefs had changed their work practices, including routinely avoiding visiting the court building to avoid passing by the monument, and testimony that the monument created a religious atmosphere, with many people using the area for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/seeking-justice/case-docket/glassroth-v-moore |title=Glassroth v. Moore |work=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore argued that he would not remove the monument, as doing so would violate his oath of office:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The monument] serves to remind the Appellate Courts and judges of the Circuit and District Court of this State and members of the bar who appear before them, as well as the people of Alabama who visit the [Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building], of the truth stated in the Preamble to the Alabama Constitution that in order to establish justice we must invoke 'the favor and guidance of almighty God'.&lt;ref name="glassroth"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On this note, Moore said that the Ten Commandments are the "moral foundation" of U.S. law, stating that in order to restore this foundation, "we must first recognize the source from which all morality springs ... [by] recogniz[ing] the sovereignty of God." He added that the addition of the monument to the state judiciary building marked "the beginning of the restoration of the moral foundation of law to our people" and "a return to the knowledge of God in our land".&lt;ref name="glassroth"/&gt;

Additionally, Moore acknowledged an explicit theistic intent in placing the monument, agreeing that the monument "reflects the sovereignty of God over the affairs of men" and "acknowledge[s] God's overruling power over the affairs of men".&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt; However, in Moore's view this did not violate the doctrine of [[separation of church and state]]; as the presiding judge later summarized it, Moore argued that "the Judeo-Christian God reigned over both the church and the state in this country, and that both owed allegiance to that God", although they must keep their affairs separate.&lt;ref name="glassroth"/&gt;

On November 18, 2002, [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama|District Court]] Judge [[Myron H. Thompson]] held the monument violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If all Chief Justice Moore had done were to emphasize the Ten Commandments' historical and educational importance ... or their importance as a model code for good citizenship ... this court would have a much different case before it. But the Chief Justice did not limit himself to this; he went far, far beyond. He installed a two-and-a-half ton monument in the most prominent place in a government building, managed with dollars from all state taxpayers, with the specific purpose and effect of establishing a permanent recognition of the 'sovereignty of God,' the Judeo-Christian God, over all citizens in this country, regardless of each taxpaying citizen's individual personal beliefs or lack thereof. To this, the Establishment Clause says no.&lt;ref name="glassroth"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge Thompson's decision mandated that Moore remove the monument from the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] by January 3, 2003, but [[Court order|stayed]] this order on December 23, 2002, after Moore appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]].

==Court of Appeals decision==
A three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit unanimously affirmed the original decision on July 1, 2003, agreeing that "the monument fails two of ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman|Lemon's]]'' three prongs. It violates the Establishment Clause." Additionally, the court noted that different religious traditions assign different wordings of the Ten Commandments, meaning that "choosing which version of the Ten Commandments to display can have religious endorsement implications".&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt;

After the decision of the Court of Appeals, Moore did not ask the court for a rehearing, nor did he request the Court of Appeals to stay its mandate pending the filing of a petition to the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a writ of [[certiorari]].  On July 30, 2003, having received no request to stay the mandate, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate to the District Court.

==Subsequent developments==
On August 5, 2003, the District Court entered its "Final Judgment and Injunction," and enjoined Chief Justice Moore, his officers, agents, servants, and employees and those persons in active concert or participation with him who received actual notice of this injunction from "failing to remove, by no later than August 20, 2003, the Ten Commandments monument at issue in this litigation from the non-private areas of the Alabama State Judicial Building."&lt;ref name=GlassrothFinInj&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Glassroth v. Moore |vol=275 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1347 |pinpoint=1349 |court=M.D. Ala. |date=2003 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/275/1347/2463094/ |accessdate=2017-11-22 |quote=}} {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2003, Moore stated publicly that he would not comply with the injunction issued to him by the District Court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Chief Justice of the State of Alabama, it is my duty to administer the justice system of our state, not to destroy it. I have no intention of removing the monument of the Ten Commandments and the moral foundation of our law. To do so would, in effect, result in the [be a] disestablishment of our system of Justice in this State. This I cannot and will not do!&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/religion/inremoore82203cmp.pdf In re Moore]'' (Ala. Ct. Jud. Aug. 22, 2003). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The time limit for removal expired on August 20, with the monument still in place in the building's rotunda. As specified in Judge Thompson's order, the state of Alabama faced fines of $5,000 a day until the monument was removed. On August 21, 2003, when Moore failed to comply with the August 5, 2003, Order of the District Court, the eight Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of Alabama, issued an order recognizing that "[t]he refusal of officers of this Court to obey a binding order of a federal court of competent jurisdiction would impair the authority and ability of all of the courts of this State to enforce their judgments," and issued an order countermanding the "administrative decision of the Chief Justice to disregard the writ of injunction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama" and ordered "that the Building Manager of the Alabama Judicial Building be, and the same hereby is, DIRECTED to take all steps necessary to comply with the injunction as soon as practicable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/religion/glsrthmre82103alsc.pdf ''In re Compliance with Writ of Injunction'', Order No. 03-01] (Ala. Aug. 21, 2003. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later case, ''McGinley v. Houston et al.'', in which another lawyer sued Gorman Houston, the Senior Associate Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and the other justices for removing the monument.&lt;ref name=McGinley&gt;{{cite court |litigants=McGinley v. Houston |vol=282 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1304 |pinpoint= |court=M.D. Ala. |date=2003 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/282/1304/2480144/ |accessdate=2017-11-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed on the grounds that removing a monument of the Ten Commandments does not constitute an establishment of religion.&lt;ref name=McGinley/&gt;

Justice Moore was later removed from office for judicial misconduct for failing to comply with the order of the federal court.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.judicial.state.al.us/documents/final.pdf In re Moore]'' (Ala. Ct. Jud. Nov. 13, 2003), {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220045651/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/documents/final.pdf |date=February 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Moore v.

The '''Government of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Vlada Hrvatske}}), formally the '''Government of the Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Vlada Republike Hrvatske}}), commonly abbreviated to '''Croatian Government''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska Vlada}}), is the main [[executive branch]] of government in [[Croatia]]. It is led by the [[Prime Minister of Croatia|President of the Government]] ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Vlade}}), informally abbreviated to [[premier]] ({{lang-hr|premijer}}) or [[prime minister]]. The prime minister is nominated by the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]] from among those candidates who enjoy [[majority]] support in the [[Croatian Parliament]]; the candidate is then chosen by the Parliament. There are 20 other government members, serving as [[deputy prime minister]]s, government ministers or both; they are chosen by the prime minister and confirmed by the Parliament (Sabor). The Government of the Republic of Croatia exercises its executive powers in conformity with the [[Croatian Constitution]] and legislation enacted by the Croatian Parliament. The [[Cabinet of Andrej Plenković|current government]] is led by Prime Minister [[Andrej Plenković]].

Following the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] of 1868, the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and the Government of the Land or officially the Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Government of the Land ({{lang-hr|Zemaljska vlada}} or ''Kraljevska hrvatsko-slavonsko-dalmatinska zemaljska vlada'')—headed by a crown-appointed [[Ban (title)|ban]]—were established. This government existed until the [[Austria-Hungary]] breakup and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]' creation in 1918. In 1939, the [[Banovina of Croatia]] was established and a head of the Banovina of Croatia (Ban) was appointed by the crown, but no effective government was formed before [[World War II]]. In 1943, the [[ZAVNOH]] established an executive board to act as a new government. Communist [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], while a part of Communist [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], had a separate government (from 1953 to 1990 known as the Executive Council, appointed by the Sabor) with limited powers (excluding defence and foreign relations; this was similar to all the previous governmental forms). Following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first multi-party elections]] and the adoption of the present [[Constitution of Croatia]] in 1990, the present governmental form was adopted and [[Stjepan Mesić]] became the first person to lead a non-communist government (however, with Croatia as part of [[Yugoslavia]]), while [[Josip Manolić]] was the first prime minister of an [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|independent Croatia]]. Since [[Revolutions of 1989|Communist rule's end]], the Republic of Croatia has had fourteen governments headed by twelve different prime ministers. Nine governments have been formed by the [[Croatian Democratic Union]], three by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], one was headed by a [[Independent (politician)|non-partisan]] prime minister and one was a [[national unity government]] (formed during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]'s peak).

The term "Government" in Croatia (''{{lang|hr|Vlada}}'') primarily refers to the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], as used by the government itself, the press and colloquially, as that branch of the government (''{{lang|hr|vlast}}'') is responsible for day-to-day governance of the nation (''{{lang|hr|uprava}}''); this sense is intended when it is said that a political party forms the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Croatia country profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1097128.stm|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Social Democrat Ivo Josipovic elected Croatia president|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8450380.stm|date=11 January 2010|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Govt-About"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Government|title=About Croatian Government|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh|accessdate=16 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318045625/http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh|archivedate=18 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its widest, the term Croatian Government can refer collectively to all three traditional branches of government, including the [[Legislature|legislative branch]] (the [[Sabor]]) and [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] (the [[Judiciary of Croatia]]), as well as other parts of government and civil services which are part of the [[Politics of Croatia|state of Croatia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The Government, the main executive power of the Croatian state, is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Croatia|prime minister]] (PM). The PM currently has four deputies (elected by the [[Croatian Parliament]]), who also serve as government ministers; there are 16 other [[minister (government)|minister]]s, who are appointed by the prime minister with the approval of the Sabor (by absolute majority vote). The government ministers are each in charge of a particular sector of activity such as [[Foreign minister|Foreign Affairs]]. The prime minister and all the deputies form an inner cabinet, tasked with coordinating and supervising the work of government ministers on behalf of the PM; the inner cabinet also prepares materials for meetings of the full government cabinet (consisting of the inner cabinet and the remaining 16 ministers). The first deputy prime minister also discharges the duties of the prime minister when the latter is incapacitated or absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne Novine]]|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2011_12_150_3084.html|title=Zakon o Vladi Republike Hrvatske|trans-title=Government of the Republic of Croatia Act|language=Croatian|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[State Secretary|State secretaries]] ({{lang-hr|državni tajnici}}) are the highest officials below each minister. There are one or more State secretaries in the ministries. Each State secretary is appointed by the Government for the term of the minister, and is responsible to the minister. They act as deputy ministers and attend Government meetings only exceptionally. State secretaries are also heads of the Central State Offices (see below).

The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic. The government's [[official residence]] is at the [[Banski dvori]] in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="VRH-PoliticalStructure"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Government|url= http://www.vlada.hr/en/about_croatia/information/political_structure| title=Political Structure|date=6 May 2007|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cabinet normally meets at the Banski dvori, occasionally its meetings are held elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Večernji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/unatoc-nezadovoljstvu-sdp-a-jakovcic-ce-sutra-potpisati-projekt-clanak-314297|title=Unatoč nezadovoljstvu SDP-a, Jakovčić će sutra potpisati projekt|trans-title=Despite dissatisfaction of the SDP, Jakovčić signs the project tomorrow|date=28 July 2011|author=Tamara Opačak-Klobučar|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Republic of Croatia exercises its executive powers in conformity with the [[Croatian Constitution]] and legislation enacted by the Croatian Parliament, the Sabor ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski sabor}}). Its structure, operational procedures and decision-making processes are defined by the Government of the Republic of Croatia Act (2011 with 2014 and 2016 amendments) and the Government Rules of Procedure (2015 with 2015 amendments). The Constitution mandates that the Government proposes legislation and other documents to the parliament, proposes the [[Government budget|budget]] and gives financial reports, implements Acts and other decisions of the parliament, enacts any regulations required to implement the Acts, defines [[Foreign relations of Croatia|foreign]] and internal policies, directs and oversees the operation of state administration, promotes the economic development of the country, directs the activities and development of public services and performs other activities conforming to the provisions of the Constitution and applicable legislation. The Government also passes regulations and administrative acts and orders appointments and removals of appointed officials and civil servants within the scope of its powers. Furthermore, the Government makes rulings in cases of conflicts of jurisdiction between governmental institutions, responds to questions asked parliamentary majority and opposition representatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/prvi-aktualni-sat-nove-vlade-u-saboru--pitanja-za-milanovica-pripremilo-desetak-hdz-ovaca-i-nitko-iz-sdp-a/1000692/|language=Croatian|title=Početak prve sjednice novog saziva Sabora obilježio je sukob HDSSB-a i SDSS-a|trans-title=Start of the first session of new Sabor assembly marked by clash of HDSSB and SDSS|authors=Suzana Barilar, Nikola Sever-Šeni|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepares proposals of new legislation and other regulations, gives opinions on legislation and other regulations and adopts strategies for the economic and social development of the country.&lt;ref name="Government-Act"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne Novine]]|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2011_12_150_3084.html|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o Vladi Republike Hrvatske|trans-title=Government of the Republic of Croatia Act|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ustav-RH"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_07_85_2422.html|title=Ustav Republike Hrvatske|trans-title=Constitution of the Republic of Croatia|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ministry of Foreign Affairs building (Croatia).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (Croatia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] building|alt=Building in formal style behind scattered trees]]
The Government manages [[state property]] of the Republic of Croatia unless special legislation provides otherwise. It may appoint special committees to manage the property on its behalf; this process is implemented through appointed members of [[supervisory board]]s and [[Board of directors|managing boards]] of companies partially or wholly owned by the Republic of Croatia. (The Government also determines these appointees' salaries.) The Government maintains specialized bodies, agencies and offices—including the Legislation Office, the Office for Human Rights and the Rights of National Minorities and Public Relations Service—that are required by the Government Act of 2011, as well as committees to decide administrative matters. Various branches of government may establish joint services.&lt;ref name="Government-Act"/&gt; There are further entities established by the government as companies designed to support the aims of the Government, such as the [[Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] that strives to fund the reconstruction and development of the [[economy of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]|url=http://www.hbor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=1487|title=About HBOR|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Local ([[Croatian cities|city]]/[[municipalities of Croatia|municipality]]) and regional ([[counties of Croatia|county]])
governments are separate from the central government; the latter maintains a State Administration Office in each county, under the Ministry of Public Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ministry of Administration|url=http://www.uprava.hr/default.aspx?id=466|language=Croatian|title=Ustrojstvo državne uprave i struktura upravljanja|trans-title=State Administration System and Administration Structure|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government is [[responsible government|responsible]] to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or any member of the Government in particular by an [[Majority|absolute majority]] vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister and other members of the Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in [[Narodne Novine]]—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.&lt;ref name="Government-Act"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ustav-RH"/&gt;

===Government operations===
Government meetings are public; however, the government may decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The [[quorum]] for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian [[sovereignty]] to [[Supranational union|supranational organisations]], changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a [[referendum]].&lt;ref name="Government-Act"/&gt;

The inner or core cabinet (the prime minister and the PM's deputies) monitors and discusses the operation of the government, and may hold preliminary discussions on any matter performed by the government. The core cabinet may act as the government in emergencies when the government is unable to meet; however, its decisions must be verified at the next government session to remain in force. The [[Chief of staff|Government Secretary]] coordinates agencies, offices and other services subordinated to the government.&lt;ref name="Government-Act"/&gt;

==Current government==
{{main|Cabinet of Andrej Plenković|Croatian parliamentary election, 2016}}

Since 19 October 2016, the President of the Government (Prime Minister) has been [[Andrej Plenković]]. There are four deputy prime ministers: [[Marija Pejčinović Burić]], [[Tomislav Tolušić]], [[Damir Krstičević]] and [[Predrag Štromar]]. The Government ministers are from the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and the [[Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats]] (HNS), with two more of them being independent politicians.

Following the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the subsequent [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] of 1868, the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] was established, along with the Government of the Land, officially the Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Government of the Land ({{lang-hr|Zemaljska vlada}} or ''Kraljevska hrvatsko-slavonsko-dalmatinska zemaljska vlada'') headed by a crown-appointed ban.

[[Socialist Republic of Croatia|People's Republic of Croatia]], from 1963 [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], a part of [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], maintained its own government (of limited powers, excluding defence and foreign relations). The government was appointed by and responsible to the [[Sabor]]. During the Communist era, there were 14 governments of Croatia. From 1953 to 1990 the official name of the government was the Executive Council of the Sabor ({{lang-hr|Izvršno vijeće Sabora}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Zbornik Pravnog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Rijeci|issn=1330-349X|publisher=[[University of Rijeka]], Faculty of Law|title=Prijedlozi i nacrti konfederalizacije Jugoslavije 1990./91.&amp;nbsp;– posljednji pokušaji "spašavanja" zajedničke države|trans-title=Proposals and Drafts for Confederalisation of Yugoslavia in 1990/1991&amp;nbsp;– the Last Attempts to Salvage the Common State|language=Croatian|pages=761–803|author=Budislav Vukas, ml.|date=December 2006|volume=27|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|parliamentary elections]] and the adoption of the present [[Constitution of Croatia]] in 1990, the present form of government was begun. On 30 May 1990, [[Stjepan Mesić]] became the first person to hold the title of Prime Minister of Croatia, and [[Franjo Gregurić]] was the first prime minister of an [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|independent Croatia]], as he held the office on 8 October 1991 when the declaration of independence came into effect.&lt;ref name="VRH-Prethodne"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Government|url=http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/prethodne_vlade_rh|language=Croatian|title=Prethodne vlade RH|trans-title=Previous governments of the Republic of Croatia|accessdate=10 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123152513/http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/prethodne_vlade_rh|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabor-Independence-8Oct1991"&gt;{{cite web|work=Official web site of the Croatian Parliament|publisher=Sabor|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=20091&amp;sec=2462|title=Ceremonial session of the Croatian Parliament on the occasion of the Day of Independence of the Republic of Croatia|date=7 October 2004|accessdate=29 July 2012|archivedate=29 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Wk9bFY8?url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art%3D20091%26sec%3D2462|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of governments of the Republic of Croatia===
{{see also|Prime Minister of Croatia|List of cabinets of Croatia}}
Since 30 May 1990 (the first multi-party parliamentary election held following the 45-year Communist rule), the Republic of Croatia has had a total of fourteen governments headed by twelve different prime ministers. The prime minister in the first government after the first multi-party election was Stjepan Mesić, who would later go on to become the [[President of Croatia]]. That government was formed by the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), as were seven other governments of Croatia. Three governments have been formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP), and one was a [[national unity government]] (representing a wide coalition of political parties) formed during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]'s peak, between July 1991 and August 1992, with Franjo Gregurić as the prime minister.&lt;ref name="VRH-Prethodne"/&gt;

The '''Great Lakes Commission''' is a [[United States]] interstate agency established in 1955 through the Great Lakes Basin Compact, in order to "promote the orderly, integrated and comprehensive development, use and conservation of the water resources of the [[Great Lakes Basin]]," which includes the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The Great Lakes Commission provides policy development, coordination, and advocacy on issues of regional concern, as well as communication and research services.

The eight member states are [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]].
The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] are associate members.

There is a separate and distinct entity with a similar brief, the [[International Joint Commission]], which exists between the [[federalism|federal]] levels of the United States and Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8748">{{Monarchism |Concepts}}
'''Hereditary titles''', in a general sense, are [[title]]s of nobility, positions or [[Style (manner of address)|style]]s that are [[Inheritance|hereditary]] and thus tend or are bound to remain in particular families.

Though both monarchs and nobles usually inherit their titles, the mechanisms often differ, even in the same country. The British crown has been heritable by women since the medieval era (in the absence of brothers), while the vast majority of hereditary noble titles granted by British sovereigns are not heritable by daughters. 

==Gender preference==
Often a hereditary title is inherited only by the legitimate, eldest son of the original grantee or that son's male heir according to masculine [[primogeniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Murphy| first = Michael Dean| title = A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts| url = http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| accessdate = 2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries and some families, titles descended to all children of the grantee equally, as well as to all of that grantee's remoter descendants, male and female. This practice was common in the [[Kalmar Union]], and was frequently the case in the [[Letters Patent]] issued by king [[Eric of Pomerania]].&lt;ref&gt;Adels og Våpenbrev utstedt av danske (unions) konger indtil 1536 ("Letters Patents issued by danish (union) kings until 1536") published The Society for the advancement of science. Copenhagen 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, females have much less frequently been granted noble titles and, still more rarely, hereditary titles. However it was not uncommon for a female to inherit a noble title if she survived all kinsmen descended [[patrilineally]] from the original grantee or, in England, if she survived just her own brothers and their male-line descendants. Rarely, a noble title descends to the eldest child regardless of gender (although by law this has become the prevalent form of titular inheritance among the [[Spanish nobility]]). A title may occasionally be shared and thus multiplied, in the case of a single title, or divided when the family bears multiple titles. In some traditions inheritance by adoption is an alternative to inheritance by biological kinship, as in the Hindu tradition to assure there is a male heir of the same [[caste]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the [[French nobility]], often the children and other male-line descendants of a lawful noble titleholder self-assumed the same or a lower title of nobility; while not legal, such titles were generally tolerated at [[court (royal)|court]] during both the ''[[ancien regime]]'' and 19th century France as ''[[courtesy title|titres de courtoisie]]''.

==Examples==
*Hereditary [[monarchy]] – in [[Bhutan]], [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tonga]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Bahrain]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Other national constitutions use different modes of succession to their monarchies, e.g. the election of the Pope in the Vatican City, and especially in East Asia often adding an element of selection (e.g. at a family council) among eligible relations of the monarch. Special cases are the two elective monarchies, [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk1/rk1.htm Yang di-Pertuan Agong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Arab Emirates]], where the constituent states of each federation are hereditary monarchies but those rulers form an electoral college that assigns the federal position of head of state to one of their number for a term (of five years).
*Titles of [[nobility]] in the United Kingdom ([[Duke]], [[Marquess]], [[Earl]], [[Viscount]] and [[Baron]]) and other countries (see [[peerage]]). In the United Kingdom, most titles of nobility (peerages and the lower title of [[Baronet]]) pass only to the eldest son (or in the non ducal Peerage of Scotland to the eldest daughter in the absence of male heirs); all other sons and daughters of peers are commoners though they may use one or more not independently heritable [[courtesy title]]s, either [[Lord]], [[Lady]] or The [[Honourable]] depending on the rank of the peerage held by their father or mother, or another title styled like a peerage but without a seat in the Lords, usually one or two ranks below father's.&lt;ref name="BP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/peerage/sitepages/page66b.asp |title=Burke's Guide to British Titles: Courtesy Titles |publisher=Burke's Peerage and Gentry |year=2005 |accessdate=13 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711185146/http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/peerage/sitepages/page66b.asp |archivedate=11 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many European countries, titles may be inherited by all the heirs -- male and female -- of a family, whose members thus all share the same title at the same time (for instance, within the [[szlachta]] nobility of [[Poland]] or in the nobilities of the successor states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). Indeed in Poland a coat of arms could eventually be correctly adopted by marriage to a titled [[szlachta]] spouse -- either male or female.  In the Far East the main (Chinese-induced) tradition is rather for titles to devalue as the generations succeed each other, but not to the same rank.
*Hereditary [[chieftaincy]] - manifested in countries in various parts of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[South America]], and [[Oceania]]. Examples range from the politically powerful (such as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] and the [[king of the Zulu Nation]]) to the merely titular (such as the [[raja]]s of [[India]] and the [[Arab]] [[shaykh]]s).
*Some [[Court appointment|court title]]s, e.g. in the [[United Kingdom]], including [[Earl Marshal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/earl_marshal.htm Earl Marshal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lord Great Chamberlain]]. Most of these are [[sinecure]]s, i.e. purely ceremonial. They pass generally to the eldest son (except for that of Lord Great Chamberlain, which is split between the heads of the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Cholmondeley]] and [[Baron Middleton|Willoughby]] families).
*Many other – especially feudal age – offices became inheritable, often connected to military (e.g. keeper of a castle; in Japan even ''[[shōgun]]'') or domanial functions, which is also why some such functions became noble titles (e.g. [[Burgrave]], [[Margrave]]).
*While the hereditary membership of a privileged class or caste may imply a title or not (sometimes confusingly called untitled nobility), it frequently forms a prerequisite for various titled positions, e.g. [[quarters of nobility]] required by a military order. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* Certain religious positions, such as the [[Aga Khan]] and [[Dā'ī al-Mutlaq]].

==Coparcenary==
&lt;!-- [[Coparcenary]], [[Co-parceners]] and [[Coparcener]] redirects here --&gt;

Coparcenary is the situation in which two or more people inherit a title equally between them as a result of which none can inherit until all but one have renounced their right to the inheritance. This could arise when a title passes through and vests in female heirs in the absence of a male heir. Before they could inherit, each of the female heirs would be an [[heir presumptive]]. After they inherited, since the title could not be held by two people simultaneously, two daughters (without a brother) who inherited in this way would do so as co-parceners. In these circumstances, the title would in fact be held in abeyance until one of them renounced for herself and her successors in favour of the other. In [[England and Wales]], passage of a title in this fashion is effected under the rules laid down in the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Coparcenary|volume=7|page=94|inline=1|noicon=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Index on Censorship''' is a campaigning publishing organisation for [[freedom of expression]], which produces a quarterly magazine of the same name from London. The present Chief Executive of Index on Censorship, since May 2014, is Jodie Ginsberg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/apr/08/freedom-of-speech-censorship Former journalist to head Index on Censorship], The Guardian, 5 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is directed by the non-profit-making Writers and Scholars International, Ltd. (WSI) in association with the UK-registered charity Index on Censorship (founded as the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust), which are both chaired by the British writer and author [[David Aaronovitch]]. WSI was created&lt;ref name="theiner"&gt;Scammell, Michael (1984). "How Index on Censorship Started" in ''They Shoot Writers, Don't They?'', Theiner, George; London: Faber &amp; Faber, pp. 19–28. {{ISBN|978-0-571-13260-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by poet [[Stephen Spender]], Oxford philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]], the then editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' [[David Astor]], writer and Soviet Union expert [[Edward Crankshaw]]. The founding editor of ''Index on Censorship'' was the critic and translator [[Michael Scammell]] (1972–81), who still serves as a patron of the organisation.

The operation is based at 292 [[Vauxhall Bridge Road]] in central London.

== The magazine ==
''Index on Censorship'' magazine was founded by Michael Scammel in 1972.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|publisher=Eurozine|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120065558/http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports free expression, publishing distinguished writers from around the world, exposing suppressed stories, initiating debate, and providing an international record of censorship. The quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate. ''Index on Censorship'' also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers. ''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008.

The original inspiration to create ''Index'' came from prominent Soviet dissidents (see Founding History, below), but from its outset, the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the former military regimes of Latin America, and the former [[Soviet Union]] and its satellites.&lt;ref name="theiner" /&gt; The magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and [[Internet censorship]].

In the first issue of May 1972 Stephen Spender wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin of frustration. However, the material by writers which is censored in Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most exciting that is being written today. Moreover, the question of censorship has become a matter of impassioned debate; and it is one which does not only concern totalitarian societies."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accordingly, the magazine has sought to shed light on other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and internet censorship. Issues are usually organised by theme, and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on [[freedom of the press]] and other [[free speech]] violations. Occasionally, ''Index on Censorship'' publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones.

Over the years, ''Index on Censorship'' has presented works by some of the world's most distinguished writers and thinkers, including [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire, Stuart (1997), "Should Index be above the battle?" in W. L. Webb &amp; Rose Bell, ''An Embarrassment of Tyrannies: 25 years of Index on Censorship'', London: Victor Gollancz, pp. 186–195. {{ISBN|0-575-06538-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent issues under the editorship of Rachael Jolley have covered taboos, the legacy of the [[Magna Carta]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s enduring legacy in protest. There have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on internet censorship. The Russia issue (January 2008) won an [[Amnesty International]] Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists [[Fatima Tlisova]] and [[Sergei Bachinin]], and Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov.

Since January 2010 it has been published by [[Sage Publications]], an independent for-profit academic publisher.&lt;ref name="SAGE"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.sagepub.com/press/2009/june/ic.sp |title=SAGE to publish Index on Censorship|publisher=SAGE Publications|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2009, the magazine was published and distributed by [[Routledge]], part of the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] group.

In addition to print and annual subscriptions, ''Index on Censorship'' is available on [[Exact Editions]], an application for the iPhone/iPad and Android.&lt;!-- no commercial advertising --&gt;

It is also a partner with [[Eurozine]], a network of more than 60 European cultural journals.&lt;ref name=euro /&gt;

== Publishing landmarks ==
[[File:Svět knihy 2011 - Index on Censorship.jpg|thumb|Philip Spender, Jo Glanville, Michael Scammell]]
[[File:IndexOnCensorshipLogo.png|thumb|Logo until 2012]]
Other landmark publications include [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]'s writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak [[Charter 77]] manifesto drafted by [[Václav Havel]] and others. Index published the first English translation of [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s Nobel Prize acceptance speech. ''Index on Censorship'' published the stories of the "[[Forced disappearance#Argentina|disappeared]]" in [[Argentina]] and the work of banned poets in [[Cuba]]; the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. ''Index on Censorship'' has a long history of publishing writers in translation, including [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], [[Ivan Klima]], [[Ma Jian (writer)|Ma Jian]] and Nobel laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]], and news reports including [[Anna Politkovskaia]]'s coverage of the war in Chechnya (Issue 2/2002).

Sir [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' (1977), which is set in a Soviet mental institution, originally performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, was inspired by the personal account of former detainee [[Victor Fainberg]] and [[Clayton Yeo]]'s expose of the use of psychiatric abuse in the USSR, published in ''Index on Censorship'' (Issue 2, 1975).&lt;ref name="Nadel"&gt;Nadel, Ira (2004). ''Double Act: A Life of Tom Stoppard''. London: Methuen. pp. 264–268. {{ISBN|0-413-73060-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoppard became a member of the advisory board of ''Index on Censorship'' in 1978 and remains connected to the publication as a Patron of ''Index''.

''Index on Censorship'' published the World Statement by the International Committee for the Defence of [[Salman Rushdie]] in support of "the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their critics on the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship, intimidation and violence. Six months later, ''Index'' published the ''Hunger Strike Declaration'' from four student leaders of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Zhou Duo]], [[Hou Dejian]] and [[Gao Xin]].

''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website. The offences against free expression documented in that first issue's ''Index Index'' listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' on the grounds that it "insulted a friendly power" – the United States, where it had been made and freely shown.

''Index on Censorship'' paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the [[Prague Spring]] (Issue 3/1976). It included several pieces by Václav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play ''Conversation'', and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' by [[John Gay]].&lt;ref name="Nadel" /&gt;

The magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript. Index also published an English version of Havel's play ''Mistake'', dedicated to [[Samuel Beckett]] in gratitude for Beckett's own dedication of his play ''Catastrophe'' to Havel. Both short plays were performed&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Jo (16 September 2009). [http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/09/godot-to-the-rescue/ "Godot to the Rescue"]. Index On Censorship.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Free Word Centre to mark the launch of Index's special issue looking back at the changes of 1989 (Issue 4, 2009).
&lt;!-- SAGE already mentioned --&gt;

== Campaigns ==
''Free Speech is not For Sale'', a joint campaign report by Index on Censorship and English PEN highlighted the problem of so-called [[libel tourism]] and the English law of defamation's chilling effect on free speech. After much debate surrounding the report's ten key recommendations, the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw pledged to make English defamation laws fairer.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Jo (22 November 2009). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/nov/22/libel-reform-jack-straw "Libel reform will liberate us all"], ''The Guardian'' (UK), ''Comment is Free''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A free press can’t operate or be effective unless it can offer readers comment as well as news. What concerns me is that the current arrangements are being used by big corporations to restrict fair comment, not always by journalists but also by academics." He added: "The very high levels of remuneration for defamation lawyers in Britain seem to be incentivising libel tourism."&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, Isabel; Swinford, Steven (November 22, 2009), [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article6926997.ece "Jack Straw pledges action to end libel tourism"], ''The Times'' (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

These campaigns and others were illustrative of then CEO John Kampfner's strategy, supported by then chair Jonathan Dimbleby, to boost Index's public advocacy profile in the UK and abroad beginning in 2008. Until then the organisation did not regard itself as "a campaigning organisation in the mould of [[Article 19]] or [[Amnesty International]]", as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001,&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Smith, Sarah (2001), "Index on Censorship" in Jones, Derek (ed.), ''Censorship: A World Encyclopaedia''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to use its "understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant" to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes (such as China, from 1989) through extensive coverage.

== External links ==
The Index on Censorship website [https://www.indexoncensorship.org/ http://www.indexoncensorship.org] was relaunched on 21 July 2013, replacing the former www.indexonline.org blog. The new website provides the hub for all the organisation's published writing, events and programmes. It carries some content from ''Index on Censorship'' magazine, but mostly originally commissioned articles and blogs on free expression issues.

The site also has an extensive archive of resources which offers a searchable global listing of organisations and media that champion freedom of expression; reports surveying freedom of expression around the world; links to censorship circumvention guides and software; and a selection of the best writing about landmark issues in the fight for free expression over the years, such as the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the controversy surrounding the publication of [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'']]'s Muhammad cartoons in Denmark, and internet censorship. It provides information about all current events, issues of magazines and projects that the organisation is undertaking.

== Arts and international programmes ==
Index on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organisation's philosophy into practice. In 2009 and 2010 Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The organisation's arts programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship. It uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate. It works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression.

Index on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film &amp; video, visual arts and performance. Recent examples include an exhibition of photostories produced by women in Iraq, ''Open Shutters''; and programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, imagine art after, exhibited at [[Tate Britain]] in 2007.

Index is also working with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Burma's creative community. Index also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, ''Seven Years With Hard Labour'', weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18401 "Amnesty hosts hard-hitting performances of real life stories"]. Amnesty.org (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; Index also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg.

== Partners ==
''Index on Censorship'' works in partnership with major groups working for freedom of expression rights, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], [[English PEN]], [[PEN International]], [http://humanrightshouse.org/ Human Rights House Network] and [[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] among many other groups to create landmark events of national and international significance. Index was one four international freedom of expression organisations on the programming committee of the First [[Global Forum on Freedom of Expression]] in Oslo June 1 – 6 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!-- expressionforum.org down – other source, please?--&gt;

The organisation regularly contributes to the national and international media, and plays a regular part in major literary events and public debate, including the [[Hay Festival|Hay]] and [[Edinburgh Festival]]s and political functions such as the Institute of Ideas, the Convention on Modern Liberty.

''Index on Censorship'' is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organisations]] that monitors [[censorship]] worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]]. It is also a member of the [[Tunisia Monitoring Group]], a coalition of 16 free expression organisations that  lobbies the [[Tunisia]]n government to improve its human rights record.

== Founding history ==
The original inspiration for Index on Censorship came from two prominent Soviet dissidents, [[Pavel Litvinov]], grandson of the former Soviet Foreign Minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]], and [[Larisa Bogoraz]], the former wife of the writer, [[Yuli Daniel]], who had written to The Times in 1968 calling for international condemnation of the rigged trial of two young writers and their typists on charges of 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'. (One of the writers, Yuri Galanskov, died in a camp in 1972).

Spender organised a telegram of support and sympathy from 16 British and US public intellectuals, including [[W.H. Auden]], [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[J. B. Priestley]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], among others. In reply Litvinov suggested, in a letter later published in Index's first issue, for some form of publication "to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR".

Spender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell sought to go further than this, wishing to cover then current censorship in right-wing dictatorships such as Greece, Portugal, and the military regimes of Latin America, as well as in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.&lt;ref name="theiner" /&gt;

Describing the organisation's objectives Hampshire said "the tyrant's concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should always be challenged. There should be noise of publicity outside every detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every tyrannical denial of free expression."

The magazine was originally to be called Index, as suggested by Scammell, a reference to the lists or Indexes of banned works that are central to the history of censorship, including the Roman Catholic Church's ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Index of Forbidden Books), the Soviet Union's ''Censor's Index'' and apartheid South Africa's ''Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature''.&lt;ref name="theiner" /&gt;

Scammell later admitted that the line ''on Censorship'' was added as an afterthought after it was perceived that the reference was not clear to readers. "Panicking, we hastily added the words 'on censorship' as a subtitle," wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, "and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index ''of'' Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title."

== Controversies ==

=== Robert Fisk ===
In December 2002 Index on Censorship faced calls to cancel a charity performance of the [[John Malkovich]] film ''[[The Dancer Upstairs (film)|The Dancer Upstairs]]'' at London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA). Speaking to students the previous May, Malkovich had been asked who – as the star of ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' – he would like to fight a duel with. He picked [[Robert Fisk]], ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper's Middle East correspondent, and [[George Galloway]], at the time a Glasgow Labour MP, adding that rather than duel them, he would "rather just shoot them".

Fisk reacted with outrage&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk, [http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html "Hate and Star Power: Why Does Malkovich Want to Kill Me?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004195018/http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html |date=2009-10-04 }}, Counterpunch, 13 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and the media rights group [[Reporters sans Frontieres]] condemned Malkovich, but in an online article Index's then Associate Editor (now deputy CEO) [[Rohan Jayasekera (writer)|Rohan Jayasekera]], dismissed the actor's comments as "flippant" in an article on the organisation's (www.indexonline.org) blog site:

:Over the years since (the [[Rwanda]] genocide), and not without criticism, ''Index on Censorship'' has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. ''Index on Censorship'' is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls — some say to equivocate — on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights.

The fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. Since taking over as CEO in 2008 John Kampfner has strongly reinforced the campaigning profile of the organisation (see Arts and Advocacy programmes above).

=== Theo Van Gogh ===
In November 2004, ''Index on Censorship'' attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch film-maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Sullivan |title=BBC Weeps For Yasser Arafat |url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/bbc-weeps-for-yasser-arafat/4736/ |work=[[The New York Sun]] |publisher=Ronald Weintraub |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog described Van Gogh was a "free-speech fundamentalist" on a "martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities" in an "abuse of his right to free speech". Describing Van Gogh's film [[Submission (2004 film)|''Submission'']] as "furiously provocative", Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as:

:A sensational climax to a lifetime's public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo!&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

There were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators. [[Nick Cohen]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper wrote in December 2004, that:

:When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none. He told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn't have made the mistake of believing that ''Index on Censorship'' was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle – in the same way as [[Amnesty International]] is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle. It may have been so its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting 'hate speech' as protecting free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Cohen |authorlink=Nick Cohen |title=Censor and sensibility |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1371869,00.html |work=The Observer |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ursula Owen]], the chief executive of ''Index on Censorship'' while agreeing that the blog post's "tone was not right", contradicted Cohen's account of his conversation with Jayasekera in a letter to the ''Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ursula |last=Owen |authorlink=Ursula Owen |title=Free to speak |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/19/letters.theobserver |work=The Observer |date=19 December 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Danish cartoons ===
In December 2009 the magazine published an interview with [[Jytte Klausen]] about a refusal of [[Yale University Press]] to include the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Mohammed Cartoons]] in Klausen's book ''[[The Cartoons that Shook the World]]''. The magazine declined to include the cartoons alongside the interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/wendy_kaminer/2009/12/censorship_at_index_on_censorship.php "Censorship at Index on Censorship"], TheAtlantic.com.

Individualism makes the individual its focus&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; and so starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Classical liberalism]], [[existentialism]], and [[anarchism]] are examples of movements that take the human individual as a central unit of analysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Individualism thus involves "the right of the individual to freedom and self-realization".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}} pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Another humanist trend which cannot be ignored was the rebirth of individualism, which, developed by Greece and Rome to a remarkable degree, had been suppressed by the rise of a caste system in the later Roman Empire, by the Church and by feudalism in the Middle Ages.[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html "The history guide: Lectures on Modern European Intellectual History"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anthropocentricity and individualism...Humanism and Italian art were similar in giving paramount attention to human experience, both in its everyday immediacy and in its positive or negative extremes...The human-centredness of Renaissance art, moreover, was not just a generalized endorsement of earthly experience.

==Etymology==
In the [[English language]], the word "individualism" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the [[Owenism|Owenites]] in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by [[Saint-Simonianism]] or came up with it independently.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Claeys, Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Claeys |title="Individualism," "Socialism," and "Social Science": Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800–1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of [[James Elishama Smith]], who was a [[millenarian]] and a [[Christian Israelite]]. Although an early [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a "universalism" that allowed for the development of the "original genius." Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; [[William Maccall]], another [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Romanticism|German Romanticism]], to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work "Elements of Individualism".&lt;ref name="Swart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swart, Koenraad W. |author-link=Koenraad W. Swart |title="Individualism" in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (1826–1860) |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1962 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.2307/2708058|jstor=2708058|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual==
{{Main|Individual}}
An individual is a person or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]], individual means "indivisible", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person." (q.v. "The problem of [[proper name]]s"). From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Individuality is the state or quality of being an individuated being; a person separated from everything with unique character by possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires in comparison to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Izenberg|title=Impossible Individuality: Romanticism, Revolution, and the Origins of Modern Selfhood, 1787-1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ60DyQi8mYC&amp;pg=PA18|date=3 June 1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2066-9|pages=18+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individuation principle  ===
{{main|Individuation}}
The principle of individuation
, or ''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}'',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Carl Jung]], individuation is a process of transformation, whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, [[active imagination]] or [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to takexamples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An analysis of the prelude to a case of schizophrenia (Vol. 2, R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.&lt;ref name="Jung's Individuation process"&gt;[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html Jung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20&lt;/ref&gt; In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', [[Gilbert Simondon]] developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Simondon]]. ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (Paris, Aubier, 1989; reprinted in 2007 with a preface by Bernard Stiegler)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of [[Bernard Stiegler]] draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. For Stiegler "the ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;'s acknowledge each other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individualism and society==
Individualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an [[Egotism|egoist]]). The individualist does not follow one particular philosophy, rather creates an amalgamation of elements of many, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he/she finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a common trait of an individualist. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], claims that his concept of "[[general will]]" in the "[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]" is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).

Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly "self-regarding" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than "other-regarding" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|"guilt" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an "internal reference standard", and [[Shame society|"shame" societies]] (e.g., Japan, "bringing shame upon one's ancestors") with an "external reference standard", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is "acceptable" or not.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture." Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualism is often contrasted&lt;ref name="Hayek 1994 17, 37–48"/&gt; either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact, there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.

===Methodological individualism===
[[Methodological individualism]] is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Joseph|last=Heath|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals' preferences as givens. [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|date=Mar 1977|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Competitive individualism===
It is a form of individualism that arises from competitive systems. The function of the system is to maintain an inequality in the society and fields of human engagement. This pins the ups and downs of a person's life onto themselves by not acknowledging a range of factors like influence of socioeconomic class, race, gender, etc. It supports the privilege theories that affirms position of certain individuals higher in the hierarchy of ranks at the expense of others. For better individuality cooperation is considered to be a better remedy for personal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Schniedewind|author2=Ellen Davidson|title=Open Minds to Equality: A Sourcebook of Learning Activities to Affirm Diversity and Promote Equity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc1aqFD88cC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|publisher=Rethinking Schools|isbn=978-0-942961-32-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political individualism==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.|source=[[Oscar Wilde]], ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', 1891}}

Individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy against obligations imposed by social institutions (such as the state or religious morality). For [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Civil libertarianism]] is a strain of political thought that supports civil liberties, or which emphasizes the supremacy of [[individual rights]] and [[personal freedom]]s over and against any kind of authority (such as a [[State (polity)|state]], a [[corporation]], social norms imposed through [[peer pressure]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil%20libertarian?r=14|title=the definition of civil libertarian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarianism is not a complete [[ideology]]; rather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights]]. Because of this, a civil libertarian outlook is compatible with many other political philosophies, and civil libertarianism is found on both the [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] in modern politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2|title=The Political Compass|first=The Political|last=Compass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to [[John Locke|Lockean individualism]] ... and non-lockean individualism may encompass [[socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

British Historians Emily Robinson, Camilla Schofield, Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite, and Natalie Thomlinson have argued that by the 1970s Britons were keen about defining and claiming their individual rights, identities and perspectives.  They demanded greater personal autonomy and self-determination and less outside control. They angrily complained that the 'establishment' was withholding it.  They argue this shift in concerns helped cause [[Thatcherism]], and was incorporated into Thatcherism's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Robinson, et al. "Telling stories about post-war Britain:  popular individualism and the 'crisis' of the 1970s." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 28.2 (2017): 268-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism===
{{main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
Liberalism (from the Latin ''liberalis'', "of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=liberalis&amp;ending=|title=Latin Word Lookup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the belief in the importance of individual freedom. This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other [[Western world|Western]] nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since [[the Enlightenment]]. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or [[confucian]] societies in [[Asia]] or the [[Middle East]] (though [[Taoist]]s were and are known to be individualists).&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Chinese Super State of Primary Societies: Taoist Philosophy for the 21st Century, You-Sheng Li, June 2010, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote praising "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954059-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all intents and purposes, liberalism here refers to classical liberalism and should not be confused with [[modern liberalism in the United States]],.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Goodman, {{cite web|url=http://www.goodmaninstitute.org/how-we-think/classical-liberalism-vs-modern-liberalism-and-modern-conservatism/|title=Classical Liberalism vs Modern Liberalism and Modern Conservatism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has its roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and rejects many [[Foundationalism|foundational]] assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the [[Divine Right of Kings]], hereditary status, and [[state religion|established religion]]. [[John Locke]] is often credited with the philosophical foundations of [[classical liberalism]]. He wrote "no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."&lt;ref name = "locke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = Two Treatises of Government (10th edition) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/trgov10h.htm | accessdate = January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, liberal ideas began to influence governments in Europe, in nations such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, England and Poland, but they were strongly opposed, often by armed might, by those who favored absolute monarchy and established religion. In the 18th century, in America, the first modern liberal state was founded, without a monarch or a hereditary aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Sigmund, editor, ''The Selected Political Writings of John Locke'', Norton, 2003, {{ISBN|0-393-96451-5}} p. iv "(Locke's thoughts) underlie many of the fundamental political ideas of American liberal constitutional democracy...", "At the time Locke wrote, his principles were accepted in theory by a few and in practice by none."&lt;/ref&gt; The American ''Declaration of Independence'' includes the words (which echo Locke) "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are [[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Declaration of Independence'', July 4, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism comes in many forms. According to [[John N. Gray]], the essence of liberalism is toleration of different beliefs and of different ideas as to what constitutes a good life.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-56584-678-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
Anarchism is a set of [[Political philosophy|political philosophies]] that hold the [[state (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful,&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

For influential Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] "All anarchists, whatever tendency they belong to, are individualists in some way or other. But the opposite is not true; not by any means. The individualists are thus divided into two distinct categories: one which claims the right to full development for all human individuality, their own and that of others; the other which only thinks about its own individuality and has absolutely no hesitation in sacrificing the individuality of others. The Tsar of all the Russias belongs to the latter category of individualists. We belong to the former."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Anarchy_and_Organization__The_Debate_at_the_1907_International_Anarchist_Congress.html#toc2|title=Anarchy and Organization: The Debate at the 1907 International Anarchist Congress - The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, [[loss of tradition|no tradition]], no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself." "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.

An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism,"&lt;ref name="Goodway, David 2006, p. 99"&gt;Goodway, David. [[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]]. Liverpool University Press, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold  |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"/&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia Americana p. 176"&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge.

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission.

He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

==Philosophical individualism==

===Ethical egoism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}
Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism)&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. However, these doctrines may occasionally be combined with ethical egoism.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaemonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of [[libertarianism]] or individualist anarchism as in Max Stirner, although these can also be based on altruistic motivations.&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{cite web

==== Egoist anarchism ====
{{Main|Egoist anarchism}}
[[Egoist anarchism]] is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of anarchist thought]] that originated in the [[philosophy of Max Stirner]], a nineteenth-century [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of [[individualist anarchism]]."&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"/&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia Americana p. 176"/&gt; without regard for God, state, or morality.&lt;ref name="Miller, David 1987. p. 11"/&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[union of egoists|unions of egoists]], non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will,&lt;ref name=nonserviam&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13 |title=The union of egoists |journal=Non Serviam |volume=1 |first=Svein Olav |last=Nyberg |pages=13–14 |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg |oclc=47758413 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |ref=harv |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = [[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egoist anarchism|Egoist anarchists]] argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt; "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy but within anarchism it has also gone beyond Stirner.

It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual."&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/John_Beverley_Robinson__Egoism.html|title=Egoism - The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] (see [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche]]) and Stirner were frequently compared by French "literary anarchists" and anarchist interpretations of Nietzschean ideas appear to have also been influential in the United States.&lt;ref name="Ref_ae"&gt;O.

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of [[19th century philosophy|19th-]] and [[20th century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie, John. ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie. ''Existentialism'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, D. E. ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism,&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon. ''Basic Writings of Existentialism'' (Modern Library, 2004, pp. ix, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that the individual solely has the responsibilities of giving one's own life [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and living that life [[Authenticity (philosophy)|passionately and sincerely]],&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'' (Oneworld, 2003, pp. 4–6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Walter. ''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1968, pp. 37–40)&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|despair]], [[angst]], [[Absurdism|absurdity]], [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Alienation|alienation]], and [[boredom]].&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, John. ''The Oxford handbook of religion and emotion'' (Oxford, 2008, pp. 387–88)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent existential philosophers retain the emphasis on the individual, but differ, in varying degrees, on how one achieves and what constitutes a fulfilling life, what obstacles must be overcome, and what external and internal factors are involved, including the potential consequences of the [[Christian existentialism|existence]]&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James et al. ''Modern Christian Thought: The Twentieth Century'' (Fortress Press, 2006, Chapter 5: Christian Existentialism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Clancy.

Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became fashionable after [[World War II]] as a way to reassert the importance of human individuality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Guignon, Charles B. and Derk Pereboom. ''Existentialism: basic writings'' (Hackett Publishing, 2001, p. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freethought===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as [[truth]] without recourse to knowledge and [[reason]]. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of authority, [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sect]]arianism, [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s. Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC Encyclopedia of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanism===
{{Main|Humanism}}
Humanism is a perspective common to a wide range of [[ethics|ethical stances]] that attaches importance to human dignity, concerns, and capabilities, particularly rationality. Although the word has many senses, its meaning comes into focus when contrasted to the supernatural or to appeals to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=humanism ''n.'' 1 a rationalistic system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. 2 a Renaissance cultural movement that turned away from medieval scholasticism and revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman thought.|publication-date = 2007}} Typically, abridgments of this definition omit all senses except #1, such as in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=38402&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humanism Collins Essential English Dictionary], and {{cite book|title=Webster's Concise Dictionary|publisher=RHR Press|year = 2001|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection) |publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies |url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 Jan 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, humanism has been associated with an anti-clericalism inherited from the 18th-century Enlightenment ''[[philosophes]]''. 21st century Humanism tends to strongly endorse [[human rights]], including [[reproductive rights]], [[gender equality]], [[social justice]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
Philosophical hedonism is a meta-ethical theory of value which argues that [[pleasure]] is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]] and pain is the only intrinsic bad.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/hedonism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Andrew|last=Moore|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure (an umbrella term for all inherently likable emotions) is the only thing that is good in and of itself or by its very nature.  This implies evaluating the moral worth of character or behavior according to the extent that the pleasure it produces exceeds the pain it entails.  &lt;!-- This last sentence was:  "The normative implications of this are evaluating character or behavior as morally good to the extent that one is concerned with pleasure/pain qua pleasure/pain or an action leads to a greater balance of pleasure over pain than any other would." --&gt;

===Libertinism===
{{Main|Libertine}}
A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/libertine|title=libertine|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=libertine|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertines place value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]]. During the [[Baroque era]] in France, there existed a [[Freethought|freethinking]] circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as ''libertinage érudit'' and which included [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Élie Diodati]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René Pintard|title=Le Libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeL29wMqdbgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101818-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/fideism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Amesbury|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s libertinism to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html A Martyr to Sin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivism===
{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] is a system of philosophy created by philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982) that holds: [[reality]] exists independent of consciousness; human beings gain knowledge rationally from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; the moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest. Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form—a work of art—that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally. Objectivism celebrates man as his own hero, "with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical anarchism===
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], American individualist anarchist who focused on economics calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism"&lt;ref&gt;Tucker said, ''"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward."''Benjamin Tucker. ''Instead of a Book'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; and adhering to the [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] economics of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Josiah Warren]]]]
Philosophical anarchism is an [[anarchist school of thought]]&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gabardi, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1957102 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300—02.&lt;/ref&gt; which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]] and – in contrast to revolutionary anarchism – does not advocate violent revolution to eliminate it but advocates peaceful evolution to superate it.&lt;ref&gt;According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], Benjamin Tucker coined the term "philosophical anarchism," to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants. ''Antliff, Allan. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQTk-N4JWbYC Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde]. University of Chicago Press. p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command.

Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[Mohandas Gandhi]], William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates [[self-government]] with a "progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others." The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution." The fourth type retains a moderated form of Egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Michael.

Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical anarchists include A. John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].

===Subjectivism===
{{Main|Subjectivism}}
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.

[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.

[[Horst Matthai Quelle]]  was a [[Spanish language]] [[Germany|German]] anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle. ''Textos Filosóficos (1989-1999)''. p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt; One of his main views was a "theory of infinite worlds" which for him was developed by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt;

====Solipsism====
{{Main|Solipsism}}
Solipsism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[wikt:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[wikt:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].

==Economic individualism==
The [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, the [[community]], the corporation etc. for him or her.

===Liberalism===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage|title=Modern Political Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Hudelson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable classical liberals in the 19th century include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical liberalism was revived in the 20th century by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and further developed by [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Loren Lomasky]], and [[Jan Narveson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Conway (academic)|David Conway]]. ''Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-312-21932-1}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of liberalism before the 20th century.

===Individualist anarchism and economics===
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Influential [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]]]]
In regards to economic questions within individualist anarchism there are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] ([[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Emile Armand]], early Benjamin Tucker); [[natural rights]] positions (early Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], Josiah Warren); and egoistic disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Max Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later Benjamin Tucker, [[Renzo Novatore]], [[illegalism]]). Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "Unlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business." &lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mutualism====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]].

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats...What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian."

===Right-libertarianism===
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{Main|Right-libertarianism}}
Right-libertarianism or right libertarianism is a phrase used by some to describe either non-[[collectivist]] forms of libertarianism&lt;ref&gt;Serena Olsaretti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZmGrPKu8BMC Liberty, Desert and the Market: A Philosophical Study], Cambridge University Press, 2004, 14, 88, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; or a variety of different libertarian views some label "right" of mainstream libertarianism including "[[libertarian conservatism]]".

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls it "right libertarianism" but states: "Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social—rather than economic—issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism—right-libertarianism—there is also a version known as '[[left-libertarianism]]'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism Libertarianism], [[Stanford University]], July 24, 2006 version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As creative independent lifestyle==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[Irish people|Irish]] [[socialist]] writer of the [[decadent movement]] and famous [[dandy]]]]
The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''The Soul of Man under Socialism''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in ''De Profundis'', he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'', which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."&lt;ref name="flag.blackened.net"/&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962. p. 447"/&gt; The word individualism in this way has been used to denote a personality with a strong tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemia: The Underworld of Art"/&gt;

Anarchist writer [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchists as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siècle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('[[free love]]') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing."&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"/&gt;

In relation to this view of individuality, French Individualist anarchist [[Emile Armand]] advocates [[ethical egoism|egoistical]] denial of social conventions and dogmas to live in accord to one's own ways and desires in daily life since he emphasized anarchism as a way of life and practice. In this way he opines "So the anarchist individualist tends to reproduce himself, to perpetuate his spirit in other individuals who will share his views and who will make it possible for a state of affairs to be established from which authoritarianism has been banished. It is this desire, this will, not only to live, but also to reproduce oneself, which we shall call "activity".&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html|title=Emil Armand "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity"|first=|last=_wlo:dek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism'', humanist philosopher [[Tzvetan Todorov]] identifies individualism as an important current of socio-political thought within modernity and as examples of it he mentions [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Marquis de Sade]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"&gt;''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In La Rochefoucauld, he identifies a tendency similar to [[stoicism]] in which "the honest person works his being in the manner of a sculptor who searches the liberation of the forms which are inside a block of marble, to extract the truth of that matter."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt; In Baudelaire he finds the [[dandy]] trait in which one searches to cultivate "the idea of beauty within oneself, of satisfying one's passions of feeling and thinking."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt;

The [[Russian American|Russian-American]] poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] once wrote that "The surest defense against Evil is extreme individualism, originality of thinking, whimsicality, even—if you will—eccentricity. That is, something that can't be feigned, faked, imitated; something even a seasoned imposter couldn't be happy with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |title=Dictionary.com - The world's favorite online dictionary! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119120030/http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] famously declared, "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist"—a point of view developed at length in both the life and work of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Equally memorable and influential on [[Walt Whitman]] is Emerson's idea that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines." Emerson opposes on principle the reliance on civil and religious social structures precisely because through them the individual approaches the divine second-hand, mediated by the once original experience of a genius from another age. "An institution," he explains, "is the lengthened shadow of one man." To achieve this original relation one must "Insist on one's self; never imitate" for if the relationship is secondary the connection is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/emerson/#H2|title=Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[International Space Station]] program''' is tied together by a complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between the fifteen nations involved in the project, governing ownership of the various components, rights to crewing and utilization, and responsibilities for crew rotation and station resupply.  These agreements tie together the five space agencies and their respective International Space Station Programs and govern how they interact with each other on a daily basis to maintain station operations, from traffic control of spacecraft to and from the station, to utilization of space and crew time. In spring 2010, the International Space Station Program Managers from each of the five partner agencies were presented with [[Aviation Week]]'s [[Laureate Award]] in the Space category,&lt;ref name="Aviation Week Laureate Awards"&gt;{{cite web | last = Michels | first = Jennifer | date = 18 March 2010 | url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2010/03/18/awx_03_18_2010_p0-213236.xml&amp;headline=Aviation%20Week%202010%20Laureate%20Awards&amp;channel=defense | title = Aviation Week 2010 Laureate Awards | publisher = Aviation Week | accessdate = 8 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and NASA's International Space Station Program was awarded the 2009 [[Collier Trophy]].

==Legal aspects==

===1998 Agreement===

The legal structure that regulates the  station is multi-layered. The primary layer establishing obligations and rights between the ISS partners is the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), an [[international treaty]] signed on January 28, 1998 by fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project. The ISS consists of Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United States, and eleven Member States of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). Article 1 outlines its purpose:

''This Agreement is a long term international co-operative framework on the basis of genuine partnership, for the detailed design, development, operation, and utilization of a permanently inhabited civil Space Station for peaceful purposes, in accordance with international law''.&lt;ref name = "legal framework"&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 July 2001 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAH7O0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = International Space Station Legal Framework | work = International Space Station | publisher = European Space Agency | accessdate = 16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGA sets the stage for a second layer of agreements between the partners referred to as 'Memoranda of Understanding' (MOUs), of which four exist between NASA and each of the four other partners. There are no MOUs between ESA, Roskosmos, CSA and JAXA because NASA is the designated ''manager'' of the ISS. The MOUs are used to describe the roles and responsibilities of the partners in more detail.

A third layer consists of bartered contractual agreements or the trading of the partners' rights and duties, including the 2005 commercial framework agreement between NASA and [[Roskosmos]] that sets forth the terms and conditions under which NASA purchases seats on Soyuz crew transporters and cargo capacity on unmanned [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transporters.

A fourth legal layer of agreements implements and supplements the four MOUs further. Notably among them is the ISS code of conduct, setting out [[criminal jurisdiction]], anti-harassment and certain other behavior rules for ISS crewmembers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Farand | first = Andre | url = http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/file_download.php/785db0eec4e0cdfc43e1923624154cccFarand.pdf| title = Astronauts' behaviour onboard the International Space Station: regulatory framework | format = pdf | work = International Space Station | publisher = UNESCO | accessdate = 16 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060913194014/http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/file_download.php/785db0eec4e0cdfc43e1923624154cccFarand.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
made in 1998.

===Utilization===
There is no fixed percentage of ownership for the whole space station. Rather, Article 5 of the IGA sets forth that ''each partner shall retain jurisdiction and control over the elements it registers and over personnel in or on the Space Station who are its nationals''.&lt;ref name = "legal framework"/&gt; Therefore, for each ISS module only one partner retains sole ownership. Still, the agreements to use the space station facilities are more complex.

The station is composed of two sides: [[Russian Orbital Segment]] (ROS) and [[U.S. Orbital Segment]] (USOS).&lt;ref name = "Russian side"&gt;{{cite web | date = 5 March 2016 | url = http://www.airspacemag.com/space/rare-look-russian-side-space-station-180956244/?no-ist | title = A Look at the Russian Side of the Space Station | publisher = Air&amp;Space Mag | accessdate = 5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program operations==

===Expeditions===
{{See also|List of International Space Station expeditions}}
Long-duration flights to the International Space Station are broken into expeditions. Expeditions have an average duration of half a year, and they commence following the official handover of the station from one Expedition commander to another. Expeditions 1 through 6 consisted of three-person crews, but the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] led to a reduction to two crew members for Expeditions 7 to 12. [[Expedition 13]] saw the restoration of the station crew to three. While only three crew members are permanently on the station, several expeditions, such as [[Expedition 16]], have consisted of up to six  astronauts or cosmonauts.  Only 3 members were active at any given time, one of the 'seats' was rotated out during separate flights.&lt;ref name="ISSEx"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Space Station Expeditions|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html|date=10 April 2009|accessdate=13 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908103956/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html|archivedate=8 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html|title=International Space Station|accessdate=22 October 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907073730/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html|archivedate=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[STS-115]] expanded of the living volume and capabilities of the station so that it could host a crew of six.  Expedition 20 was the first ISS crew of this size.   Expedition 20's crew was lifted to the station in two separate [[Soyuz-TMA]] flights launched at two different times (each Soyuz-TMA can hold only three people): [[Soyuz TMA-14]] on 26 March 2009 and [[Soyuz TMA-15]] on 27 May 2009. However, the station would not be permanently occupied by six crew members all year. For example, when the Expedition 20 crew ([[Roman Romanenko]], [[Frank De Winne]] and [[Robert Thirsk|Bob Thirsk]]) returned to Earth in November 2009, for a period of about two weeks only two crew members ([[Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams]] and [[Maksim Surayev|Max Surayev]]) were aboard. This increased to five in early December, when [[Oleg Kotov]], [[Timothy Creamer]] and [[Soichi Noguchi]] arrived on [[Soyuz TMA-17]]. It decreased to three when Williams and Surayev departed in March 2010, and finally returned to six in April 2010 with the arrival of [[Soyuz TMA-18]], carrying [[Aleksandr Skvortsov (cosmonaut)|Aleksandr Skvortsov]], [[Mikhail Korniyenko]] and [[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]].&lt;ref name="ISSEx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="current"/&gt;

The International Space Station is the [[Space station#List of occupied space stations, with statistics|most-visited spacecraft]] in the history of space flight. {{As of|2015|10|09}}, The ISS has had 220 visitors. ''[[Mir]]'' had 137 visitors (104 different people).&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387230114/ref=ord_cart_shr/202-3649698-1866219?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visiting spacecraft===

Spacecraft from four different space agencies visit the ISS, serving a variety of purposes. The [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] from the European Space Agency, the Russian Roskosmos Progress spacecraft and the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency have provided resupply services to the station. In addition, Russia supplies a Soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation and emergency evacuation, which is replaced every six months. Finally, the US serviced the ISS through its [[Space Shuttle program]], providing resupply missions, assembly and logistics flights, and crew rotation until the program was retired in 2011.

[[SpaceX]] was the first private company to resupply the ISS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/|title=International Space Station Commercial Resupply Launch|first=Mark|last=Garcia|date=3 April 2015|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 8, 2012.

The availability of docking ports on the station, and traffic from four different agencies and launch sites must be coordinated.  Spacecraft launches can see delays while waiting for traffic to clear &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/isstodate.html|title=Worldwide testing and ISS traffic push ATV launch to autumn 2007|accessdate=11 April 2010|publisher=ESA|date=22 March 2007|author=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular tight traffic jam occurred during the latch of ESA's Jules Verne [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] in spring 2008.  The cargo ship launched 2 day prior to [[STS-123]], and had to wait in a holding orbit performing system tests while waiting for the shuttle to clear the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMX6KK26DF_iss_0.html|title=Traffic jam in space: ATV docking under tight schedule|accessdate=11 April 2010|publisher=ESA|date=31 January 2008|author=Tariq Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016|04|13}}, there have been 46 Soyuz, 63 Progress,  5 ATV, 5 HTV, 5 Cygnus, 7 Dragon and 37 Space Shuttle flights to the station.&lt;ref name="ISStD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/onthestation/facts_and_figures.html|title=About the Space Station: Facts and Figures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expeditions require, on average, 2,722&amp;nbsp;kg of supplies, Soyuz crew rotation flights and Progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year.&lt;ref name="Livelist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFERS4LZE_Life_0.html|title=Live listing of spacecraft operations|publisher=NASA|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016|04|13}}, there were six spacecraft docked for the first time with the ISS:

==Commercial Orbital Transportation Services==
{{Main|Commercial Orbital Transportation Services}}
On January 18, 2006 NASA announced ''Commercial Orbital Transportation Services'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=NASA |date=2006-01-18 |title=NASA Seeks Proposals for Crew and Cargo Transportation to Orbit |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18791 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has suggested that "Commercial services to ISS will be necessary through at least 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Space Operations Mission Directorate |title = Human Space Flight Transition Plan |publisher = NASA |date = 2006-08-30 |url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/tran_plan.pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928222416/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/tran_plan.pdf |archivedate = 2006-09-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of flying payloads to ISS on government-operated vehicles, NASA would spend $500 million (less than the cost of a single Space Shuttle flight) through 2010 to finance the demonstration of orbital transportation services from commercial providers.

COTS must be distinguished from the related [[Commercial Resupply Services]] (CRS) program. COTS relates to the development of the vehicles, CRS to the actual deliveries. COTS involves a number of [[Space Act Agreement]]s, with NASA providing milestone-based payments.

On December 23, 2008, NASA entered into CRS contracts with [[Orbital Sciences]] and [[SpaceX]] to utilize their COTS cargo vehicles—[[Cygnus spacecraft|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], respectively—for cargo delivery to the International Space Station.

==Future of the ISS==
{{globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
[[Image:Heads of Agency International Space Station.jpg|thumb|The heads of the ISS agencies from Canada, Europe, Japan, Russia and the United States meet in Tokyo to review ISS cooperation.]]

Former [[NASA Administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] says the International Space Station has a role to play as NASA moves forward with a new focus for the manned space programme, which is to go out beyond Earth orbit for purposes of human exploration and scientific discovery. "The International Space Station is now a stepping stone on the way, rather than being the end of the line," Griffin said.&lt;ref name="Explore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/griffin_why_explore.html|title=Why Explore Space?|accessdate=2008-07-31|last=Griffin|first=Michael|date=July 18, 2001|publisher=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824135119/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/griffin_why_explore.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin has said that station crews will not only continue to learn how to live and work in space, but also will learn how to build hardware that can survive and function for the years required to make the round-trip voyage from Earth to Mars.&lt;ref name="Explore"/&gt;

Despite this view, however, in an internal e-mail leaked to the press on 18 August 2008 from Griffin to NASA managers,&lt;ref name="leak"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/news/080907-nasa-griffin-email.html|title=NASA Chief Vents Frustration in Leaked E-mail|accessdate=2008-11-06|work=Space.com|publisher=Imaginova Corp|year=2008|first=Tariq|last=Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leak3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=29133|title=Internal NASA email from NASA Administrator Griffin|accessdate=2008-11-03|publisher=SpaceRef.com|author=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emailimage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/files/GriffinEmail.jpg |title=Michael Griffin email image |accessdate=2008-11-06 |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |year=2008 |first=Michael |last=Griffin |format=jpg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230642/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/files/GriffinEmail.jpg |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin apparently communicated his belief that the current US administration had made no viable plan for US crews to participate in the ISS beyond 2011, and that the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] (OSTP) were actually seeking its demise.&lt;ref name="leak3"/&gt; The e-mail appeared to suggest that Griffin believed the only reasonable solution was to extend the operation of the [[space shuttle]] beyond 2010, but noted that Executive Policy (i.e. the [[White House]]) was firm that there will be no extension of the space shuttle retirement date, and thus no US capability to launch crews into orbit until the [[Ares I]]/[[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] system becomes operational in 2014, at the earliest.&lt;ref name="leak3"/&gt; He did not see purchase of Russian launches for NASA crews as politically viable following the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], and hoped the incoming [[Barack Obama]] administration would resolve the issue in 2009 by extending space shuttle operations beyond 2010.

A solicitation issued by NASA [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|JSC]] indicates NASA's intent to purchase from Roscosmos "a minimum of 3 Soyuz seats up to a maximum of 24 seats beginning in the Spring of 2012" to provide ISS crew transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=134686 |title=PROCUREMENT OF CREW TRANSPORTATION AND RESCUE SERVICES FROM ROSCOSMOS |publisher=NASA JSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=134857 |title=Modification |publisher=NASA JSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2008, NASA released a statement regarding the leaked email, in which Griffin said:

{{quote|The leaked internal email fails to provide the contextual framework for my remarks, and my support for the administration's policies.

===New partners===
China has reportedly expressed interest in the project, especially if it would be able to work with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]].

==Costs==
The most cited figure of an estimate of overall costs of the ISS ranges from 35 billion to 160 billion [[United States dollar|USD]].&lt;ref name="cost2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14505278/|title=What's the cost of the space station?|accessdate=September 30, 2008|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|year=2006|author=Alan Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA, the only agency actually stating potential overall costs on its website, estimates [[Euro|€]]100 billion.&lt;ref name = "costs"/&gt; Giving a precise cost estimate for the ISS is not straightforward, as it is difficult to determine which costs should actually be contributed to the ISS program, or how the Russian contribution should be measured.

===NASA===
[[Image:NASA-Main budget chart 14-01-2004.svg|thumb|NASA's current budget projections see an end to ISS funding in 2017, in order to free funds for the [[Vision for Space Exploration]].]]
The overall majority of costs for NASA are incurred by flight operations and expenses for the overall management of the ISS. Costs for initially building the U.S. portion of the ISS modules and external structure on the ground and construction in space as well as crew and supply flights to the ISS do account for far less than the general operating costs ''(see [[#2005 ISS budget allocation|annual budget allocation below]])''.

NASA does not include the basic Space Shuttle program costs in the expenses incurred for the ISS program, despite the fact that the Space Shuttle has been nearly exclusively used for ISS construction and supply flights since December 1998. NASA's 2007 budget request lists costs for the ISS (without Shuttle costs) as $25.6 billion for the years 1994 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html | title = NASA 2007 Budget and 2006 Strategic Plan | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 16 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018225518/http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of 2005 and 2006 about $1.7 to 1.8 billion are allocated to the ISS program. The annual expenses will increase until 2010 when they will reach $2.3 billion and should then stay at the same level, however inflation-adjusted, until 2016, the defined end of the program. NASA has allocated between $300 and 500 million for program shutdown costs in 2017.

====2005 ISS budget allocation====
[[Image:STS-114 Steve Robinson on Canadarm2.jpg|thumb|NASA allocates about 125 million US dollars ([[USD]]) annually to [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]s.]]
The $1.8 billion expensed in 2005 consisted of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55411main_28%20ISS.pdf | title = International Space Station Major Events FY 2005 | work = International Space Station | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 16 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101162122/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55411main_28%20ISS.pdf|archivedate=1 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Development of new hardware''': $70 million were allocated to core development, for instance development of systems like navigation, data support or environmental.
*'''Spacecraft Operations''': $800 million consisting of $125 million for each of software, extravehicular activity systems, and logistics and maintenance. An additional $150 million is spent on flight, avionics and crew systems. The rest of $250 million goes to overall ISS management.
*'''Launch and Mission operations''': Although the Shuttle launch costs are not considered part of the ISS budget, mission and mission integration ($300 million), medical support ($25 million) and Shuttle launch site processing ($125 million) is within the ISS budget.
*'''Operations Program Integration''': $350 million was spent on maintaining and sustaining U.S. flight and ground hardware and software to ensure integrity of the ISS design and the continuous, safe operability.
*'''ISS cargo/crew''': $140 million was spent for purchase of supplies, cargo and crew capability for [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] flights.

====Shuttle costs as part of ISS costs====
[[File:STS-125 EVA4 Working inside Hubble.jpg|thumb|The only non-ISS-related Shuttle flight between 2005 and 2011 was a [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission on [[STS-125]].]]

Only costs for mission and mission integration and launch site processing for the 33 ISS-related Shuttle flights are included in NASA's ISS program costs. Basic costs of the Shuttle program are, as mentioned above, not considered part of the overall ISS costs by NASA, because the Shuttle program is considered an independent program aside from the ISS. Since December 1998 the Shuttle has, however, been used nearly exclusively for ISS flights (since the first ISS flight in December 1998, until October 2007 only 5 flights out of 28 flights have not been to the ISS, and only the planned [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission in 2009 will not be ISS-related out of 13 planned missions until the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2010).

====Post-Shuttle ISS supply &amp; costs====
The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of Atlantis' final flight on July 21, 2011.  NASA was reliant even at the time on some of the resupply contracts being fielded out to Soyuz and Progress and the other unmanned tugs, but it had launched a few years earlier into a program of aggressive development of commercial US resupply vehicles.  At the beginning of 2014 both [[SpaceX]]'s [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] and [[Orbital Sciences Corporation|Orbital]]'s [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] vehicles have fulfilled commercial resupply contracts, and NASA will be shifting to full-time reliance on these, and possibly in the medium-term future SNC's Dream Chaser and the NASA-developed Orion capsule.
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
On January 8, 2014, the White House announced that the ISS was having its funding extended from an outlook that ended in 2020 to at least 2024.  An estimate was issued that it would cost $3B/year for 2012-2024, a substantial share of NASA's then-$17B budget.

===ESA===
{{further|European contribution to the International Space Station}}
ESA calculates that its contribution over the 15 year lifetime of the project will be €9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/0712050-sts122-esa-columbus.html|title=European Hopes Ride on New Space Lab, Cargo Ship|author=|date=|website=space.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just the costs for the Columbus Laboratory tops more than €1.4 billion (about $2.1 billion), including the money spent on the ground control infrastructure known as [[Columbus Control Center]] to operate it. The total development costs for [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] amount to approximately €1.35 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/iss/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-4609//7588_read-11385/|title=DLR - International Space Station ISS - Europe sets a course for the ISS|first=redaktion dlr.de db,|last=sh|date=|website=www.dlr.de|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and considering that each [[Ariane 5]] launch costs around €150 million, each ATV launch will incur considerable costs as well.

The ISS has been far more expensive than originally anticipated. The [[ESA]] estimates the overall cost from the start of the project in the early 1990s to the prospective end in 2017 to be in the region of [[Euro|€]]100 billion ([[United States dollar|$]]157 billion or [[U.K.|£]]65.3 billion).&lt;ref name = "costs"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = How Much Does It Cost? | publisher = [[European Space Agency|ESA]] | accessdate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JAXA===
The development of the [[Japanese Experiment Module]], [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]'s main contribution to the ISS, has cost about 325 billion yen (about $2.8 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Prepares Space Station's Largest Laboratory for Flight
|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/070502_techwed_kibo.html|publisher=''[[space.com]]''|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2005, JAXA allocated about 40 billion yen (about 350 million USD) to the ISS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Seeking 13 Percent Budget Hike for Space Activities |url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive04/budgetarch_090704.html |publisher=''[[space.com]]'' |accessdate=2008-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206183659/http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive04/budgetarch_090704.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual running costs for Japanese Experiment Module will total around $350 to 400 million. In addition JAXA has committed itself to develop and launch the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]], for which development costs total nearly $1 billion. In total, over the 24 year lifespan of the ISS program, JAXA will contribute well over $10 billion to the ISS program.

===Roskosmos===
A considerable part of the [[Russian Space Agency]]'s budget is used for the ISS. Since 1998 there have been over two dozen Soyuz and Progress flights, the primary crew and cargo transporters since 2003. The question of how much Russia spends on the station (measured in [[United States dollar|USD]]), is, however, not easy to answer. The two modules currently in orbit are derivatives of the [[Mir]] program and therefore development costs are much lower than for other modules. In addition, the exchange rate between ruble and USD is not adequately giving a real comparison to what the costs for Russia really are.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===CSA===
Canada, whose three main contributions to the ISS are the [[Canadarm2]], the mobile base system, and [[Dextre]] (the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, also known as the Canada Hand), estimates that through the last 20 years it has contributed about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1.4 billion to the ISS. Canada has continued to be a vital member of ISS through the past ten years and continues to play a major role in the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/facts.asp |title=International Space Station facts and figures |accessdate=2007-01-28 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603192932/http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/iss/facts.asp |archivedate=2008-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[International Space Station]] has been the target of varied criticism over the years. Critics contend that the time and money spent on the ISS could be better spent on [[human versus robotic spaceflight|other projects]]—whether they be [[robotic spacecraft]] missions, [[space exploration]], investigations of problems here on Earth, or just tax savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A waste of space |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-01-26-a-waste-of-space |publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian|author=Mail &amp; Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, like [[Robert L. Park]], argue that very little [[Scientific method|scientific]] [[research]] was convincingly planned for the ISS in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN04/wn092404.html |title=Space Station: Maybe They Could Use It to Test Missile Defense |accessdate=2009-03-23 |last=Park |first=Bob |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322174138/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN04/wn092404.html |archivedate=2009-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue that the primary feature of a space-based laboratory is its [[microgravity environment]], which can usually be studied more cheaply with a "[[Vomit Comet|vomit comet]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN06/wn091506.html |title=Space: International Space Station Unfurls New Solar Panels |accessdate=2007-06-15 |last=Park |first=Bob |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704141406/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN06/wn091506.html |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most ambitious ISS projects to date, the [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]], has been cancelled due to the prohibitive costs [[NASA]] faces in simply completing the ISS. As a result, the research done on the ISS is generally limited to experiments which do not require any specialized apparatus. For example, in the first half of 2007, ISS research dealt primarily with human biological responses to being in space, covering topics like [[kidney stones]], [[circadian rhythm]], and the effects of [[cosmic rays]] on the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="renal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Renal-Stone.html|title=Renal Stone Risk During Spaceflight: Assessment and Countermeasure Validation (Renal Stone)|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916102157/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Renal-Stone.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sleep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Sleep-Long.html|title=Sleep-Wake Actigraphy and Light Exposure During Spaceflight-Long (Sleep-Long)|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916102107/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Sleep-Long.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ALTEA.html|title=Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA)|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130072708/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ALTEA.html |archivedate=November 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have attacked the ISS on some technical design grounds:
# [[Jeff Foust]] argued that the ISS requires too much maintenance, especially by risky, expensive [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]].&lt;ref name="foust"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/453/1|title=The trouble with space stations|accessdate=2009-03-23|publisher=[[The Space Review]]|year=2005|author=[[Jeff Foust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''The American Enterprise'' reports, for instance, that ISS astronauts "now spend 85 percent of their time on construction and maintenance" alone.
# The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has mentioned that its orbit is rather highly inclined, which makes Russian launches cheaper, but US launches more expensive.&lt;ref name="astrosoc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/34/space2.html|title=Up, Up, and Away|accessdate=September 10, 2006|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|year=1996|author1=James J. Secosky |author2=George Musser }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended as a design point, to encourage Russian involvement with the ISS&amp;mdash;and Russian involvement saved the project from abandonment in the wake of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]]&amp;mdash;but the choice may have increased the costs of completing the ISS substantially.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, it may not be true since additional delta-v required from launching Kennedy space center (28.45 deg) to ISS station (51.6 deg of Russia) is ~34.5&amp;nbsp;m/s ( 460&amp;nbsp;m/s*cos(28.45)*cos(51.6) - 460*cos(51.6) )which is very small (~0.3% velocity or ~1% payload reduction) compare to 9.5 to 10&amp;nbsp;km/s required to reach to orbit. However if launching from 51 deg to 28 deg could cost as much as ~3&amp;nbsp;km/s or &gt;60% payload reduction (assuming direction correction at same orbital altitude, 7.67&amp;nbsp;km/s * 2*sin((51.6-28.8)/2) ). This is due to the fact that delta-v adjustment happens at different respective instantaneous velocities ( 0&amp;nbsp;m/s on ground for USA but 7.67&amp;nbsp;km/s for Russia).

In response to some of these criticisms, advocates of manned space exploration say that criticism of the ISS project is short-sighted, and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars' worth of tangible benefits to people on Earth. Jerome Schnee estimated that the indirect economic return from spin-offs of [[human spaceflight|human space exploration]] has been many times the initial public investment.&lt;ref name="Schnee"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=640676&amp;id=1&amp;qs=Ntt%3DSchnee%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchall%26N%3D0%26Ns%3DPublicationYear%257C0|title=Economic impact of large public programs The NASA experience|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)|year=1976|author1=Ginzburg, E. |author2=Kuhn, J. W. |author3=Schnee, J. |author4=Yavitz, B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the claims by the Federation of American Scientists argued that NASA's rate of return from spin-offs is actually "astoundingly bad", except for aeronautics work that has led to aircraft sales.&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/spp/eprint/jp_950525.htm|title=NASA Technological Spinoff Fables|accessdate=September 17, 2006|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|author=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also say that NASA is often casually credited with "spin-offs" (such as [[Velcro]] and portable computers) that were developed independently for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Park |title=The Virtual Astronaut |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/4/park.htm |work= |publisher=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA maintains a list of spin-offs from the construction of the ISS, as well as from work performed on the ISS.&lt;ref name="spinoff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/|title=NASA Spinoff|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI)|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ISSspin.html| title = International Space Station Spinoffs| accessdate = 2006-09-14| author = NASA Center for AeroSpace Information (CASI) |date=2005-10-21 |publisher = NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928215326/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ISSspin.html |archivedate=2006-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, NASA's official list is much narrower and more arcane than dramatic narratives of billions of dollars of spin-offs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

It is therefore debatable whether the ISS, as distinct from the wider space program, will be a major contributor to society. Some advocates argue that apart from its scientific value, it is an important example of international cooperation.&lt;ref name="thirdanniv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacetoday.org/SpcStns/FirstAnnivOccupy.html |title=International Space Station: Human Residency Third Anniversary |accessdate=2009-03-23 |publisher=Space Today Online |year=2003 |author=Space Today Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091625/http://spacetoday.org/SpcStns/FirstAnnivOccupy.html |archivedate=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the ISS is an asset that, if properly leveraged, could allow more economical manned Lunar and Mars missions.&lt;ref name="marstoday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18482|title=Interview with Niolai (sic) Sevostianov, President, RSC Energia: The mission to Mars is to be international|accessdate=2009-03-23|publisher=Mars Today.com/SpaceRef Interactive Inc|year=2005|author=[[S.P.

==End of Mission==
In 2009, NASA had stated plans to end the ISS programme and [[Satellite#End of life|deorbit]] the ISS in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/12/AR2009071201977.html|title=As Space Station Nears Completion, It Faces End of Mission|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=18 July 2009|author=Joel Achenbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in accordance with the then-President Bush's [[Vision for Space Exploration|policy]]. President Obama announced new [[Space policy of the Barack Obama administration|policy]] in 2010, extending the program through 2020.&lt;ref name="NewBudget"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Statement by Charlie Bolden, NASA Budget Press Conference|publisher=NASA|date=1 February 2010|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420994main_2011_Budget_Administrator_Remarks.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201183639/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420994main_2011_Budget_Administrator_Remarks.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All five ISS-participating space agencies had indicated in 2010 their desire to see the platform continue flying beyond 2015, but Europe struggled to agree on funding arrangements within its member states, until agreement was reached in March 2011.&lt;ref name="2028 tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1003/11station/|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=11 March 2010|title=Space station partners set 2028 as certification goal|author=Stephen Clark|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/8034-international-space-station-fly-2028-nasa-partners.html |title=International Space Station Could Fly Through 2028, NASA Partners Say |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=31689|publisher=SpaceRef.com|date=22 September 2010|title=International Partners Discuss Space Station Extension and Use|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia and ISS partners in a 2011 statement said that work is being done to make sure other modules can be used beyond 2015. The first Russian module was launched in 1998, and the 30th anniversary of that module's launch has been chosen as a target date for certification of all components of the ISS.&lt;ref name="2028 tokyo"/&gt;

According to a 2009 report, [[RKK Energia]] is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the Russian Orbital Segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station, known as the [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex]] (OPSEK). The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS include the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]] (MLM), currently scheduled to be launched mid-2018, along with other Russian modules which are currently planned to be attached to the MLM. Neither the MLM nor any additional modules attached to it would have reached the end of their useful lives by 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer who believes that, based on the experience from ''Mir'', a thirty-year life should be possible, except for micrometeorite damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.&lt;ref name="RussiaSave"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009|author=Anatoly Zak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Outer Space Treaty]] the United States is legally responsible for all modules it has launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/publications/STSPACE11E.pdf United Nations Treaties and Principles on Outer Space]. (PDF) . United Nations. New York. 2002. {{ISBN|92-1-100900-6}}. Retrieved on 2011-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In ISS planning, NASA examined options including returning the station to Earth via shuttle missions (deemed too expensive, as the station(USOS) is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://search.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9794&amp;page=28|isbn=0-309-06938-6|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|pages=28–30|author=Thomas Kelly|title=Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to [[Skylab]], boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would simply delay reentry) and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area.&lt;ref name=ISSEIS&gt;{{cite web|title = Tier 2 EIS for ISS|publisher = NASA|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19960053133_1996092350.pdf|accessdate=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical feasibility of a controlled targeted deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be possible only with Russia's assistance.&lt;ref name=ISSEIS/&gt; At the time ISS was launched, the Russian Space Agency had experience from de-orbiting the [[Salyut 4]], [[Salyut 5|5]], [[Salyut 6|6]], and [[Salyut 7|7]] space stations, while NASA's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite (the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]]) would not occur for another two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry Debris Field estimation methods and application to Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|publisher=Mission Operations Directorate, NASA Johnson Space Center|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010084992_2001127597.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA currently has no spacecraft capable of de-orbiting the ISS at the time of decommissioning.&lt;ref name="atvDeorbit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/03/215291/nasa-may-buy-esas-atv-to-de-orbit-iss-at-end-of-life.html|accessdate=27 September 2009|title=NASA may buy ESA's ATV to de-orbit ISS at end of life|publisher=Flightglobal|author=Rob Coppinger|date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skylab]], the only space station built and launched entirely by the US, decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years, and no&lt;!--yes the solar panels were re-arranged, but that has no significant effect, also, the atmospheric entry article helps with refs and explaining this--&gt; attempt was made to de-orbit the station using a [[Atmospheric entry|deorbital burn]].

[[File:Jean-Baptiste Gobel (1727-1794).jpg|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Gobel (1727-1794)]]
'''Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel''' (1 September 1727 &amp;ndash; 13 April 1794) was a French [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cleric and politician of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. He was executed during the [[Reign of Terror]].

==Biography==
Gobel was born in the town of [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]] in [[Alsace]] to a lawyer to the Sovereign Council of Alsace and tax collector for the [[Seigneury]] of Thann. After outstanding success in his early schooling in [[Porrentruy]], he studied at the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Colmar]], then [[theology]] in the [[German College]] in [[Rome]], from which he graduated in 1743.

===Clerical career===
Gobel was ordained a Catholic priest in 1750 and then became a member of the [[cathedral chapter]] of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel|Prince-Bishop of Basel]], [[Simon Nikolaus Euseb von Montjoye-Hirsingen]], based in [[Porrentruy]], In 1771 he was appointed the [[auxiliary bishop]] of the [[diocese]] for the section that was situated in French territory, being named by the [[Holy See]] as a [[titular bishop]] ''[[in partibus]]'' of [[Lod|Lydda]].  He consecrated the next Prince-Bishop, [[Friedrich Ludwig Franz von Wangen zu Geroldseck]], on 3 March 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bwangen|Bishop Friedrich Ludwig Franz von Wangen zu Geroldseck|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Found to have been living beyond his means, he was relieved of his duties by Wangen zu Geroldseck's successor, [[Franz Joseph Sigismund von Roggenbach]], in 1782. After this he began to espouse "reformist" ideas. His political life began when he was elected deputy to the [[Estates-General of 1789]] by the clergy of the [[Bailiwick]] of [[Huningue]].

The turning-point of his life was Gobel's action in taking the oath of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] (3 January 1791), in favour of which he had declared himself since 5 May 1790. The document gave the appointment of priests to the electoral assemblies, and, after taking the oath, Gobel had become so popular that he was elected [[constitutional bishop]] in several dioceses. He chose the [[Archbishop of Paris|Archbishopric of Paris]], and in spite of the difficulties which he had to encounter before he could enter into possession, he took up office on 17 March 1791&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; and was consecrated on 27 March by eight bishops, including [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]]. This action was rejected by the [[Holy See]],&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.206&lt;/ref&gt; which has never recognized him as a legitimate holder of the office, and continues to hold the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] archbishop, [[Antoine-Eléonore-Léon Le Clerc de Juigné]], as the legitimate Archbishop of Paris during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bleclj|Archbishop Antoine-Eléonore-Léon Le Clerc de Juigné|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
On 8 November 1792, Gobel was appointed administrator of Paris. His public display of [[anti-clericalism]] was most likely a careful tactic to ensure the sympathy of politicians: among other things, he declared himself opposed to [[clerical celibacy]]. On the [[French Revolutionary Calendar|17th Brumaire in the year II]] (7 November 1793),&lt;ref&gt;Citizens, Simon Schama, Penguin 1989 p.778&lt;/ref&gt; he came before the bar of the [[National Convention]] for his activities as civil commissioner in Porrentruy, and, in a famous scene, resigned his episcopal functions, proclaiming that he did so for love of the people, and through respect for their wishes. The previous night, a delegation from the Commune led by [[Jacques Hébert|Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]] and [[Anacharsis Cloots|Cloots]] had demanded that he publicly renounce his faith or be put to death by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Citizens, Simon Schama, Penguin 1989 p.778&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of [[Jacques Hébert]], who were then pursuing their [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|anti-Christian policy]], claimed Gobel as their representative. At the same time, Hébert's rival [[Maximilien Robespierre]] viewed Gobel as an [[Atheism|atheist]] - although he was not accused of [[apostasy]], and never publicly professed [[atheism]].

Robespierre's vision of a [[Deism|deist]] [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] was threatened by the opposition of atheist [[Hébertists]] (''see [[Cult of Reason]]''), and Gobel shared the fate of the latter. Imprisoned, he was found guilty of the so-called '[[Luxembourg prison plot']] together with [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]], [[Lucile Duplessis|Lucile Desmoulins]], wife of the recently executed [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Marie Marguerite Françoise Hébert|Françoise Hebert]], wife of the recently executed Hébert, and an assortment of other prisoners of various types.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989, p.416-417&lt;/ref&gt; All of the alleged conspirators were sentenced to death on the morning of 13 April and guillotined that same afternoon.

'''Jury duty''' or '''Jury service''' is service as a [[jury|juror]] in a [[Legal proceedings|legal proceeding]].

==Juror selection process==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=April 2016}}
{{Main|Jury selection}}

The [[prosecutor]] and [[Defense (legal)|defense]] can dismiss potential jurors for various reasons, which can vary from one state to another, and they can have a specific number of arbitrary dismissals, or unconditional [[peremptory challenge]], which does not require specific reasons. The judge can also dismiss potential jurors.

Some courts had been sympathetic to jurors' privacy concerns and refer to jurors by number, and conduct ''[[voir dire]]'' ''[[in camera]]'' (i.e., in private). In the United States, there have also been [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] challenges and medical privacy (e.g., [[HIPAA]]) objections to this.&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford P. L. (2001.) [http://contentdm.ncsconline.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/juries&amp;CISOPTR=31 "Making the Case for Juror Privacy: A New Framework for Court Policies and Procedures"], State Justice Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Australia uses an [[adversarial system]], and potential jurors are randomly selected from an [[electoral roll]].

Jurors receive a small payment for each day of attendance. Employers are also required to pay their employees "make-up pay", that is, the usual pay the employee would have earned from working, less the jury duty payment received from the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury duty|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/community-service-leave/jury-duty|website=[[Fair Work Ombudsman]]|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the National Employment Standards, make-up pay is required only for the first ten days of jury service - however the laws of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia extend the make-up pay requirement for the entire duration of the jury service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nedim|first1=Ugur|title=What Does Jury Duty Pay?|url=https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/what-does-jury-duty-pay/|website=Sydney Criminal Lawyers|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The jury system in New South Wales is administered by the Jury Services Branch of the Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales, an office in the [[Department of Attorney General and Justice (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Attorney General and Justice]], and operates in accordance with the ''Jury Act 1977''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/scanact/inforce/NONE/0 |title=NSW Legislation |publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jury Amendment Act 2010''. These laws detail persons who are disqualified, ineligible, or may be excused from jury service are detailed. In addition, the ''Jury Exemption Act 1965''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07386 ''Jury Exemption Act 1965''] — ComLaw, Australian Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|jea1965203|Jury Exemption Act 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; and section 7, "Excuse for cause",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/lrc/ll_lrc.nsf/pages/LRC_r117chp07 Report 117 (2007) – Jury selection: 7. "Excuse for cause"] — Law Reform Commission — Lawlink NSW&lt;/ref&gt; of LRC ''Report 117 (2007)'' details other persons who can or may not serve as jurors or otherwise claim exemption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/lrc/ll_lrc.nsf/pages/LRC_r117toc  Report 117 (2007) – Jury selection] — Law Reform Commission — Lawlink NSW&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who are blind and/or deaf may be excluded from jury service.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum R. (2011.) [http://www.altlj.org/news-and-views/opinion/92-participating-in-political-and-public-life "Participating in Political and Public Life"], ''Alternative Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the juror selection process, both parties can object to up to three potential jurors without providing reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/DP12CHP4 Discussion Paper 12 (1985) – Criminal Procedure: The Jury in a Criminal Trial] — Law Reform Commission — Lawlink NSW&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of the Sheriff of NSW disseminates resources for jurors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/cats/jury_service.html Jury Service] — CaTS Corporate New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt; Jurors may be compensated for their service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/cats/jury_service/payment.html Payment for jury service] — CaTS Corporate New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Trial by jury in Scotland}}

According to 2016 figures from the [[Ministry of Justice]], there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. In Scotland the percentage is much higher due to having a lower population as well having juries made up of 15 people as opposed to 12 people in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is the chance of being called for jury service?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36140259|publisher=BBC|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial proceeding means any action or suit, including any condemnation, preliminary, informational, or other proceeding of a judicial nature, but does not include an administrative proceeding (a summons or subpoena, to serve as a witness, by an administrative law judge). Administrative proceedings do not have juries; they are not informational or preliminary in nature and the judge makes the ultimate decisions.

When a person is called for jury duty in the [[United States]], that service is mandatory and the person summoned for jury duty must attend. Failing to report for jury duty is illegal and usually results in an individual simply being placed back into the selection pool in addition to potential criminal prosecution. Repeatedly ignoring a jury summons without explanation will result in strict penalties, which may include being fined or a [[Arrest_warrant#Bench_warrant|bench warrant]] issued for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/juryreporting/juryfqa.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Juror Service in New Jersey |publisher=New Jersey Judiciary Court System |date=June 2017 |accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers are not allowed to fire an employee for being called to jury duty, but they are typically not required to pay salaries during this time.&lt;ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us"/&gt; When attended, potential jurors may be asked to serve as a juror in a trial, or they may be dismissed.

In the United States, government employees are in a paid status of leave (in accordance with {{usc|5|6322}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/us/2010/title5/|title=Title 5: Government Organization and Employees — Justia|publisher=Law.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the duration spent serving as a juror (also known as court duty or court leave by some organizations). Many quasi-governmental organizations have adopted this provision into their contract manuals.&lt;ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us"/&gt; Accordingly, government employees are in a paid status as long as they have received a summons in connection with a judicial proceeding, by a court or authority responsible for the conduct of that proceeding to serve as a juror (or witness) in the District of Columbia or a state, territory, or possession of the United States, [[Puerto Rico]], or the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has held, in ''[[Butler v. Perry]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=240&amp;invol=328 240 U.S. 328] (1916), that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] does not prohibit "enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.".

===Reactions===
Although jury duty is regarded as vital to the administration of justice and, as such, is considered a condition of U.S. citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Jeffrey B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RaZ_AKgMIqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''We, the jury: the jury system and the ideal of democracy''], Harvard University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-674-00430-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; jury duty has been criticized by some [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups as a form of [[involuntary servitude]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp |title=For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto – Murray N.

In both the United States and Canada jurors having conscientious objection to service are generally excused from service. This chiefly includes groups like the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]].

===Jury scam in the United States===
In recent years, citizens of the United States have been targets of a "jury scam", wherein they are called by persons posing as officers from a court, claiming that the person did not show up for jury duty and that charges will be pressed.&lt;ref name="uscourts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/JuryService/JurorScams.aspx |title=Juror Scams |publisher=Uscourts.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets are then told that the matter can be resolved if personal information is given.

[[United States federal courts|Federal courts]] mostly use the [[USPS]], however, and calls do not require personal information.&lt;ref name="uscourts1"/&gt;

'''The Justice and Security Act 2013''' (c. 18) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], firstly to provide for oversight of the [[MI6|Security Service]] (MI5), the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) on intelligence or security matters. Secondly the bill proposes to provide for the establishment of [[closed material procedures]] (CMP) in relation to certain civil proceedings. Thirdly to prevent the making of court orders for the disclosure of what the government deems to be sensitive information. The Bill was published as a Justice and Security Green Paper on 3 October 2011. It was presented to Parliament on 28 November 2012. It completed its [[House of Lords]] Committee stage on 7 February 2013. It had its second reading debate on 18 December 2012, and its third reading and report stage on 7 March 2013.

==Justice and Security Green Paper==

On 3 October 2011, [[Kenneth Clarke]] the then [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] at the [[Ministry of Justice]] representing the Government, published a Justice and Security Green Paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf|title=Justice and Security Green Paper|publisher=Government UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing to make secret procedures available in all types of civil proceedings. The proposal is that, even when the Government is itself involved in proceedings, it should have the power to decide for itself whether to invoke the secret procedure, with only a very limited review by the court. Most secret procedures to date, have been confined to a few specialist types of case, usually immigration, cases involving issues of [[national security]], and control order proceedings involving terror suspects. If the new [[Green Paper]] proposals become law, this power will be used not only in cases involving national security, but also in any other case where the Government decides that the disclosure of sensitive material is likely to result in ‘harm to the public interest’. The controversial Green Paper is now the Justice and Security Bill 2012-13, currently being sponsored through parliament and the Lords by the Rt Hon [[Lord Wallace of Tankerness]], who is also the Government sponsor of the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2012]].

===Closed material procedures===

If you are before a court, whether in criminal or civil proceedings, you can see and challenge the other side’s evidence. In a civil case the judge will give detailed reasons for their decisions, and the whole process will be subject to scrutiny by the public and Press. Closed materials, are never shown to the other party, or his lawyers, who are excluded from parts, if not all of the hearing.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2114186/Doubts-growing-MPs-plans-secret-justice-chilling-reality-revealed-time.html|title=No to Secret Justice campaign|publisher=Daily Mail. 13 March 2012 | location=London|first1=James|last1=Chapman|first2=Kirsty|last2=Walker|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government considers there are some cases where the court can decide the case, without giving the other party any details of the case against him. Those pushing for this radical change to the British justice system are concerned about the dangers arising from the disclosure of sensitive material, also the dangers of non-disclosure of materials involving government accountability.

===Public Interest Immunity===

The British justice system has a set of rules called [[public-interest immunity]] (PII), which is a principle of English [[common law]] under which the [[English courts]] can grant a [[court order]] allowing one [[litigant]] to refrain from [[Discovery (law)|disclosing]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the [[public interest]]. At the extreme, public interest immunity rules may mean that a case cannot be heard at all. This is an exception to the usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings.  In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging.

It is of note that fewer PII certificates have been issued in recent years. For example, MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining a PII certificate since the 1995 Tomlinson case, and have thus been subject to court scrutiny for investigations such as the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales. In the ''[[Crown Prosecution Service]] v [[Paul Burrell]]'' [2002] – A Public Interest Immunity Certificate allowed the prosecution to apply to the judge for a ruling that disclosure of certain information would be harmful to the public interest and should not be made public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,825502,00.html MPs criticise Queen over Burrell case – The Guardian, Nov 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special advocates===

A submission to Government ministers, from 57 of the 69 current special advocates, states CMP's "represent a departure from the foundational principle of natural justice, that all parties are entitled to see and challenge all evidence relied upon before the court, and to combat that evidence by calling evidence of their own". The submission states that "Government ministers should not be endowed with discretionary powers to extend unfairness and lack of transparency to any proceedings to which they are themselves party". Further warning, "it would leave Britain with more [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] rules than any other country in the world, more suited to despotic regimes such as [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2109001/Secret-courts-condemned--lawyers-run-them.html |title=No to Secret Justice campaign|publisher=Daily Mail. 2 March 2012 | location=London |first=James |last=Chapman |date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrister Martin Chamberlain, who's worked in secret courts since 2003, describes a system of justice worthy of [[Franz Kafka]], describing Josef K’s fictional ordeal in ''[[The Trial]]'', as closed material procedures in Britain in the 21st century. "As a special advocate, you are able to see and hear both the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ evidence. But often, the Government witness will refuse to answer particular questions in open court, and the issue will have to be pursued by the special advocate in a closed hearing. But, after seeing the closed material, I am prohibited from speaking to my client. So I will never know if he had an alibi or an innocent explanation and nor will the court".&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt;

===Right of a fair trial ===
{{main|Right to a fair trial}}
The right to a fair trial has been defined in numerous regional and [[international human rights instruments]]. It is one of the most extensive human rights and all international human rights instruments enshrine it in more than one article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* the right to be heard within a reasonable time

* the right to interpretation&lt;ref name="Doebbler 2006 108"/&gt;

There are several concerns that the Bill makes no provision whatsoever for recording and reporting on the use of CMPs, nor for any notice to be provided for CMPs, nor is there any provision for closed judgments or materials to be reviewed, or opened when secrecy is no longer required. Also that [[defendant]]s will not be allowed to be present, or know or challenge the case against them, and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. The governments commitment to ''open justice and transparency'' have not been addressed, in spite of the [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]] 24th Report (Ch 6) that identified democratic accountability and media freedom as “the missing issue in the Green Paper”. The bill establishes an unnecessary, unjustifiable regime of secrecy, with the potential to become widespread in cases already beset by [[secrecy]], and in which CMPs would not result in fairer trials. The Bill denies the press and public to know about important matters of public interest. The scope of amendments to the Bill fall well below what the Joint Committee on Human Rights recommended&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Human Rights, (2012), 4th Report: Legislative Scrutiny&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Bill Committee written evidence Dr Lawrence McNamara (J&amp;S 01)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee on Human Rights also said "in all the evidence it had received, apart from that of the Government, the proposals indicate a ‘radical departure’ from ancient principles of ‘open justice and fairness’". The committee criticised Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] for refusing to allow even special advocates to have access to information so they could assess whether secret trials were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2232125/Ministers-fail-win-argument-secret-courts.html|title=No to Secret Justice campaign|publisher=Daily Mail. 13 November 2012 | location=London|first=James|last=Chapman|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal Democrats====
The issue of CMPs is controversial within the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the junior party in the coalition government. A motion put forward by Jo Shaw, former parliamentary candidate for [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]], to the party's 2012 autumn conference and passed "overwhelmingly" called upon its MPs to vote against Part 2 of the bill relating to CMPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference|title=Secret courts plan receives blow at Lib Dem conference|first=Rajeev|last=Syal|date=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, only seven of the party's then fifty-six MPs voted against the bill's third reading on 4 March 2013, leading to an emergency motion being filed for the party's spring conference the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/03/lib-dems-prepare-challenge-clegg-over-secret-courts-betrayal|title=Lib Dems prepare to challenge Clegg over secret courts betrayal|first=George|last=Eaton|date=5 March 2013|publisher=New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was coupled with Shaw's resignation from the party, and was again passed "overwhelmingly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/activists-quit-in-protest-over-government-plans-for-secret-courts-8528071.html|title=Activists quit in protest over government plans for 'secret courts'|first=Andrew|last=Grice|date=10 March 2013|location=London|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Shaw, human rights lawyers [[Dinah Rose]] and [[Philippe Sands]], and copyright reform activist [[Cory Doctorow]] publicly announced their resignations of their party memberships following the bill's vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2013/03/12/libdems-leave-over-support-for.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21732790 | work=BBC News | title=Lib Dems reject 'secret courts' plan at spring conference | date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/justice-security-i-quit-the-lib-dems | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Philippe | last=Sands | title=I'm leaving the Liberal Democrats too | date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Convention on Human Rights ===
Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to a fair trial, an 'implied' right stemming from the 'equality of arms', that hearings should be adversarial and both parties should have access to the same evidence and witnesses. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has held that Article 6 (especially the 'implied' rights) is not an absolute right and that measures restricting the rights of the defense so as to safeguard an important public interest are lawful if "strictly necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

On 22 November 2012, by margins of over 100 votes, peers voted to remove ministers’ exclusive right to apply for secret hearings, as a ‘tilting of the balance away from the free individual towards the interest of the state’, and give judges the discretion in deciding on secret court hearings. Lord Wallace of Tankerness, representing the Government in rejecting the Lords concerns said that “at present people assumed the Government settled controversial cases because there had been ‘some wrongdoing’ whereas in fact it was often that relevant material could not be put before the court”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No to Secret Justice campaign|publisher=Daily Mail. 22 November 2012|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2236585/Secret-courts-plan-chaos-Lords-reject-closed-hearings-crushing-majority.html | location=London|first1=James|last1=Chapman|first2=Jason|last2=Groves|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law Society of England and Wales ===
The Law Society has repeatedly stated opposition to the use of CMPs to ordinary civil proceedings. The Society contends the Government has failed to present a national security case for jeopardising these fundamental constitutional principles. The Society re-stated this position in a letter jointly signed with General Council of the Bar, to the Minister Without Portfolio, Rt Hon [[Kenneth Clarke]] MP: “Closed Material Procedures depart from an essential principle that all parties are entitled to see and challenge all of the evidence relied upon before the court, and to combat that evidence by evidence of their own. In addition, they undermine the principle that public justice should be dispensed in public, and will weaken fair trial guarantees of equality of arms, which are essential elements of the rule of law”.&lt;ref&gt;Letter reported in The Guardian (2012), Lawyers Challenge Clarke Justice Bill, London: Guardian News Media&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2013, more than 700 UK legal figures published their concerns in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', insisting that the Government’s Justice and Security Bill is “contrary to the rule of law,” “dangerous and unnecessary” and will “fatally undermine” the fairness of court hearings by undermining the right to a fair trial and open justice. [[Michael Fordham]] QC, a leading public law specialist, warned judges might refuse to preside over secret courts stating; “Secret trials undermine the principles of open justice and natural justice on which the rule of law is built. By promoting the spread of secrecy, state authorities become self-immunised from proper public scrutiny.”&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285603/Scrap-dangerous-unnecessary-secret-justice-hundreds-lawyers-QC-urge-Government.html#ixzz2MCZTnKHh|title=Daily Mail. "No to Secret Justice" 28-2-2013|publisher=dailymail.co.uk | location=London|first=James|last=Chapman|date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International concerns===
On 28 February 2013, a group of international organisations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and similar bodies from [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]], [[Egypt]] and [[Hungary]], also expressed similar concerns about the controversial British 'Justice and Security legislation', warning in a joint statement: ‘If the UK Parliament passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and within our own justice systems across the world.’ &lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

The '''law and literature''' movement focuses on the [[interdisciplinary]] connection between [[law]] and [[literature]]. This field has roots in two major developments in the intellectual history of law—first, the growing doubt about whether law in isolation is a source of value and meaning, or whether it must be plugged into a large cultural or philosophical or social-science context to give it value and meaning; and, second, the growing focus on the mutability of meaning in all texts, whether literary or legal.  Those who work in the field stress one or the other of two complementary perspectives: ''Law in literature'' (understanding enduring issues as they are explored in great literary texts) and ''law as literature'' (understanding legal texts by reference to methods of literary interpretation, analysis, and critique).

This movement has broad and potentially far reaching implications with regards to future [[teaching methods]], [[scholarship]], and [[Statutory interpretation|interpretations]] of legal texts. Combining literature's ability to provide unique insight into the [[human condition]] through text with the legal framework that regulates those human experiences in reality gives a [[democracy|democratic]] [[judiciary]] a new and dynamic approach to reaching the aims of providing a [[justice|just]] and [[morality|moral]] society. It is necessary, in practical thought and discussion about the use of legal [[rhetoric]], to understand text's role in defining human experience.

== History of the movement ==
Perhaps first to envision the movement were [[John Wigmore]] and [[Benjamin Cardozo]], who acknowledged "[[novelists]] and [[poets]]" as the principal teachers of law in the first half of the 20th century. Most scholars, however, credit [[James Boyd White]] as the founder of the law and literature movement because of the dedicated research and distinguished publications he has contributed to this rapidly growing field. Among his many literary books and articles, White's most renowned publication, ''[[The Legal Imagination]]'', is often credited with initiating the law and literature movement.  This book, first published in 1973, is a fusion of anthology and critique, superficially resembling a traditional legal casebook but drawing on a much wider and more diverse range of sources, with headnotes and questions emphasizing the relationship of legal texts to literary analysis and literary texts to the legal issues that they explore.

The movement began attracting attention in the 1970s and by the 1980s had gained substantial ground in academia. The proponents of the ''law-in-literature'' theory, such as [[Richard Weisberg]] and [[Robert Weisberg]], believe that literary works, especially [[narratives]] centered on a legal conflict, will offer [[lawyers]] and judges insight into the "[[nature of law]]" that would otherwise go missing in the traditionally strict study of legal rhetoric.

In its early stages, the law and literature movement focused strictly on the ''law in literature'' theory; however, beginning in the late 1970s the ''law as literature'' perspective began to gain popularity. This perspective seeks to enhance legal studies by examining and interpreting legal texts using the techniques of [[literary critics]]. Scholars such as White and [[Ronald Dworkin]] find greater relevance in ''law as literature'' because it maintains that the meaning of legal texts, such as [[written law]], like any other [[genre]] of literature, can only be discovered through interpretation. Although legal scholars have long considered both literary and legal texts in their study of the [[legal process]], the recent degree to which the two seemingly separate genres interact has sparked great debates among scholars.

== Law in literature ==
The law in literature view is specifically concerned with the way in which legal situations are presented in literature. Generally, they place a high value on the "independent" view from which literary writers are able to see the law. They believe that such authors have a lesson to teach legal scholars and lawyers alike about the human condition, and the law's effect on it. Such scholars tend to cite authors like [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], and [[Charles Dickens]]. The fictional situations presented in literature, these scholars assert, can tell a great deal about political and social situations, and the individual that often find themselves before the court.  For example, [[Robert Weisberg]] believes that the law in literature offers fertile possibilities. He suggests that even though some literature cannot instruct its readers about legal situations, they can still educate law students about the human condition.

[[Richard H. Weisberg]], professor at [[Cardozo School of Law]] is another leading scholar of law and literature.  Following the lead of James Boyd White, he sees an intrinsic value in the use of literature as a means of discussing legal topics. Unlike White however, who places value on literature for its ability to stimulate critical thought and theory, Weisberg believes that literature should be valued for its ability to cause one to relate to others, and for the political and social contexts that novels, particularly those dealing with the law, grapple with. For Weisberg, this is reason enough for its justification in the legal arena because such novels cause their students to reach conclusions regarding human understanding. In his study ''Poethics'', Weisberg states that, "Poethics in its attention to legal communication and to the plight of those who are 'other', seeks to revitalize the ethical component of the law."

Richard Weisberg's interest in the law and literature movement might be seen as slightly different than that of White, who places emphasis on the rhetorical techniques and abilities that literature utilizes. Weisberg rather wishes to use literature as a way of critiquing social institutions and legal norms. For him it is the subject matter of novels and not their rhetorical tools that make them important in instructing law students, as well as furthering understanding of legal matters for the independent law scholar. 
	
One example of his attempting to validate his stance of the effect of novels onto legal minds, is one where Weisberg cites a real life French lawyer living in [[France]] during the beginning of the deportation of French [[Jews]] to [[concentration camps]]. The lawyer was attempting to assign the duty of determining Jewry of an individual with only two Jewish grandparents to the state, then controlled by the [[Nazis]] and collaborators. In describing the words chosen by the lawyer, Weisberg believes that the "masking of a moral crime" is a direct descendant of ''[[Nietzschean]] ressentiment'', which is widely believed to be a philosophical outlook that permeates through the writings of [[Albert Camus]] and Kafka-literary authors whose works law and literature proponents cite often, including Weisberg. His belief that ressentiment makes its way into the writings of lawyers, such as this Frenchman, is seen as enough of a reason for him to view legal novels as compelling arguments of the human condition and thus their validity towards legal debate.

== Law as literature ==
Law as literature scholars see value in the techniques employed by literary scholars. Generally speaking, these scholars may see legal text as a form of literature thus making [[literary critique]] and analysis of it possible. Unlike the law in literature scholars, these minds only see possibilities in the tools of literary theory, and not really the subject of the great novel that law students often find themselves reading, although most might agree that literature serves a purpose that allows for ethical development and growth within the student.

[[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] was a proponent of law as literature.  "The success of Cardozo's books was also due in part to their distinction as literature.  Convinced that style could not be separated from substance, Cardozo brought the Judicial process to life in lucid, eloquent prose sprinkled with humor, anecdotes, and practical allusions."  (enotes.com, Benjamin Nathan Cardozo 1870-1938)

While [[James Boyd White]] acknowledges the relevance of the ''law-in-literature'' perspective, he finds ''law-as-literature'' more tenable because of the position's ability to combine the two seemingly disparate disciplines and allow for text to fulfill its role of defining culture and creating relationships. According to White, [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''
{{quote|is meant to teach the reader how to read his way into becoming a member of an audience it defines-into becoming one who understands each shift of tone, who shares the perceptions and judgments the text invites him to make, and who feels the sentiments proper to the circumstances. Both for its characters and readers, this novel is in a sense about reading and what reading means}}

[[Ronald Dworkin]] also supports the arguments in favor of the use of literature to improve legal understanding.  In his article, ''Law as Interpretation'', Dworkin stated, "I propose that we can improve our understanding of law by comparing legal interpretation with interpretation in other fields of knowledge, particularly literature."  He believes that our interpretations of literary works may help us to an improved understanding of our [[cultural]] environment, which in turn helps us to come to a better understanding and interpretation of the law.

==Law and Literature in Europe==
The Law and Literature movement in Europe is wide-ranging and fruitful and a number of networks in [[Europe]] are significant to the movement.  There is for example a European Network for Law and Literature Scholarship run by Jeanne Gaakeer, Professor at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Greta Olson, Professor at the Justus-Liebig Universität Giessen. Gaakeer's influence is also reflected in her publications, for example Hope Springs Eternal: An Introduction to the Work of James Boyd White (University of Michigan, 1998), and she is co-editor of Crossing Borders: law, language and Literature, Wolf Legal Publishers The Netherlands, 2008.  Greta Olsen has edited a number of books including 9/11 Ten Years On(2011) Current Trends in Narratology. Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 2011 and In the Grip of the Law: Trials, Prisons and the Space Between. Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 2004a.  There is also a Nordic Network for Law and Literature and two Italian Networks for Law and Literature, AIDEL and ISLL.  In Norway: The Bergen School of Law and Literature, directed by Professor Arild Linneberg, Faculty of Humanities, Department of Linguistic, Literary and Aesthetic Studies, University of Bergen. Law and Literature in Europe is energetic but at times less self-promoting than its American counterpart.  Greta Olson's article ‘De-Americanising Law and Literature Narratives: Opening Up the Story’ in the journal ‘Law and Literature’ 2010 (published by Cardozo in the USA) provides a reminder of scholarly activity in Europe as well as warning against a ‘tendency to universalise our scholarly narratives’ where some debates are particular to the American setting.  She calls upon European scholars to ‘remember that the peculiarities of our own legal systems and legal histories need to be kept in mind as we contest law with the aesthetic and use law to query the literary’.

Post-conference productions such as the [[Oxford University Press]] collection Law and Literature: Current Legal Issues Volume 2: Law and (1999) edited by [[Michael Freeman (editor)|Michael Freeman]] and [[Andrew Lewis (editor)|Andrew Lewis]] are testament to the number of approaches opened up by this interdisciplinary approach. In the United Kingdom, scholars of note include Maria Aristodemou, with her Law and Literature from her to eternity, which looks at a number of texts from ancient Greek to modern day novels from a feminist and postmodern perspective.  Adam Gearey's Law and Aesthetics provides a discussion of aesthetics and ethics relevant to contemporary law and literature scholarship, and to the development of postmodern jurisprudence, using a range of reference points from classical literature, from [[Sophocles]] to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] to [[Nietzsche]].  Professor Ian Ward, Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives which considers a range of texts from [[Shakespeare]], to children's literature, to [[Ivan Klima]] and [[Umberto Eco]] and, more recently Ward's Law, Text, Terror,  looking at the phenomena of terror and the rhetoric of terrorism tracing back through literature, popular culture and politics.  Professor Melanie Williams’ book Empty Justice: One Hundred Years of Law, Literature and Philosophy explores in particular feminist and existential questions as well as genre movements relating to caselaw combined with works by, for example, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[J. G. Ballard]], [[John Fowles]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Iris Murdoch]], whilst her Secrets and Laws provides a range of essays on legal and political issues of note, from ethics, terrorism and identity to notions of obscenity, rape, sex and violence, through the prism of poetry, [[W. H. Auden]] and [[R. S. Thomas]] as well as 19th and 20th century works of fiction.  Kieran Dolin's A Critical Introduction to Law and Literature takes in a wide range of historical periods from [[Renaissance literature]] to [[Victorian literature]] and modern texts, exploring a number of topical approaches to crime, feminism, race and colonialism, whilst [[Paul Raffield]]’s Shakespeare's Imaginary Constitution : late Elizabethan politics and the theatre of law (Hart, 2010) is an addition to the critical work available on Shakespeare and the Law. The Italian law and literature scholar Daniela Carpi has also written a book on Shakespeare and the Law as well as an interesting text discussing [[Plato]]’s relevance to 20th century English Literature.

These instances of European outputs in the Law and Literature movement are in no way representative of the large literature to be found in articles written by the above named scholars as well as others in the field.

==Significant contributions to the movement==
{{cleanup|date=September 2016|reason=Excessively biographical.}}

=== Jack Balkin ===
[[Jack Balkin]] is a professor of [[constitutional law]] at [[Yale Law School]]. While his work in legal rhetoric draws on literary theory, he contends that law is best analogized to the [[performing arts]] such as [[music]] and [[drama]], rather than to literature.  For this reason, there is little to no work in which Balkin analyzes literature's relevance to the law, but his applications of the argument through other artistic mediums gain him admission to this discussion, as well.

In his views on politics and its effect on legal standards, Balkin adheres to what is known as "[[partisan entrenchment]]".  This theory states that the party that controls the [[White House]] can place in the federal courts judges and justices that share the [[U.S. President|President]]'s political views.  This in turn affects [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justices and, ultimately, constitutional doctrine.

=== Robert F. Barsky ===
[[Robert Barsky]] is a Professor of Literature, and a Professor of Law at [[Vanderbilt University]], where he actively teaches courses on the law-literature overlap, and directs the [https://my.vanderbilt.edu/robertbarsky/literature-and-law-seminar-robert-penn-warren-center/ Robert Penn Warren Seminar on Literature and Law]. His work focuses upon the construction in narrative of the person, either in law (with examples from the domain of Convention refugees and undocumented immigrants) or in literary texts, from a perspective that references the work of  [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]],  [[Pierre Bourdieu]],  [[Marc Angenot]],  [[Michael Holquist]] and others. A longtime contributor to the field, and a frequent reviewer of texts relating to it, Barsky works to bring a humanistic approach that favors dialogism, storytelling and empathy to the many realms captured by the idea of border-crossing. His works include a trilogy of law-literature informed books ([https://www.routledge.com/Undocumented-Immigrants-in-an-Era-of-Arbitrary-Law-The-Flight-and-the/Barsky/p/book/9781138849488 Undocumented Immigrants in an Era of Arbitrary Law, Routledge Law 2016]; [https://www.routledge.com/Arguing-and-Justifying-Assessing-the-Convention-Refugees-Choice-of-Moment/Barsky/p/book/9780754614814 Arguing and Justifying, Ashgate 2001]; [https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/pbns.29/main Constructing a Productive Other, John Benjamins 1994]), and to the on-line open access border-crossing journal called AmeriQuests: Narrative, Law and Literature (www.ameriquests.org), which he founded as the Canadian Bicentennial Visiting Professor at the Yale Center for International and Area Studies in 2002-3. Because much of the legal corpus to which he refers emanates from the realm of migration studies, he has also contributed widely to translation and interpretations studies, with reference to both legal and literary texts.

=== Adam Gearey ===
Adam Gearey is Reader in Law at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/law/ Birkbeck School of Law], [http://www.lon.ac.uk/ University of London].   He has a BA (Hons-English/History) ([[University of York]]), M.A. Socio-Legal Studies ([[University of Sheffield]]), CPE/LSF ([[Manchester Polytechnic]]), PhD (Birkbeck College, University of London).  He was appointed as a lecturer at [http://www.kent.ac.uk/law/ Kent Law School] in 1996, moving to the School of Law at Birkbeck in 1998.  In 2001-2002, he was a visiting professor in the Faculty of Law at [[Makerere University]], Uganda; and in 2003 a visiting professor at the [[University of Pretoria]]. He is currently a visiting scholar at The Center for Law and Society, [[University of California, Berkeley]] and a visiting professor at the [http://www.upeace.org/ University of Peace, Costa Rica]. His present project concerns political justice.

In [[The Times Higher Education]], Gearey [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=105603&amp;sectioncode=26 commented on his work on [[James Joyce]]'s chaotic novel, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''], and ideas of law, stating I tried to trace the ways the account of the giving of the law in the Bible fed into the narratives of Finnegans Wake. Just as the Bible appropriated the Jewish Old Test-ament account of the law, Joyce's novel, in its turn, rewrote the Gospel narratives, to become a messianic announcement of the female messiah and a new law of love. These ideas could not have been thought without the encouragement of the "[[critical legal theory]]" scene. ..But it would be wrong to see this as a "movement". It is an impossible community of those who disagree as much as they agree. Leaning to broadly continental traditions of thought, to [[psychoanalysis]], [[post-Marxism]] and [[feminism]], there is a strong sense of sustained and creative dialogue in "critical" circles. The revolution in legal thought is still to come’.

=== Eric Heinze ===
[[Eric Heinze]] is Professor of Law &amp; Humanities at the [//www.law.qmul.ac.uk/ School of Law, Queen Mary, University of London].   In ''The Concept of Injustice''&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; he presents a literary approach to reasoning about justice.  He calls that standpoint ‘post-classical’, in contrast to a ‘classical’ Western tradition, dating back to [[Plato Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']], which assumes a static, logical opposition between the concepts of ‘justice’ and ‘injustice’.  Heinze's ‘post-classical’ approach recognises the impossibility of theorising justice and injustice as mutually exclusive categories.

Central to Heinze's research is the thesis that law is constantly underpinned by necessary, yet conflicting and irreconcilable theories of its own legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;‘Power Politics and the Rule of Law: Shakespeare’s First Historical Tetralogy and Law’s “Foundations”’, '''29''' ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' (2009), pp. 230-63; ‘Heir, Celebrity, Martyr, Monster: Legal and Political Legitimacy in Shakespeare and Beyond’, '''20'''(1) ''Law &amp; Critique'' (2009), pp. 79-103; ‘“This power isn’t power if it’s shared”: Law and Violence in Jean Racine’s ''La Thébaïde''’, '''22'''(1) Law &amp; Literature (2010), pp. 76 – 109&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his research focuses on the problem of legitimacy with particular reference to concepts of ‘imperialism’ and ‘nationalism’, concepts which he presents not as fixed, but as malleable and often overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;‘Imperialism and Nationalism in Early Modernity: The “Cosmopolitan” and The “Provincial” in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline’, '''18'''(3) ''Journal of Social &amp; Legal Studies'' (2009), pp. 139 – 68; ‘“He’d turn the world itself into a prison”: Empire and Enlightenment in Jean Racine’s ''Alexander the Great''’, '''4'''(1) ''Law &amp; Humanities'' (2010), pp. 63 – 89&lt;/ref&gt; His approach further examines language as both the defining yet also infinitely manipulated tool of law as the institution and justification of political power.&lt;ref&gt;‘“Where be his quiddities now?”: Law and Language ''in Hamlet''’, in ''Law and Language: Current Legal Issues'', vol. 15, Michael Freeman &amp; Fiona Smith, eds., Oxford University Press (2013), pp 201-20&lt;/ref&gt; Examining ancient and early modern literature, Heinze traces the demise of what he calls ‘unity’ theories of justice, and their progressive displacement by ‘measurement’ theories, which, he argues, become paramount within Western modernity.

=== Allan Hutchinson ===
[[Allan Hutchinson]] is a professor at [[York University]]'s [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] and served as associate dean from 1994 to 1996.  Hutchinson is a legal theorist and has devoted a lot of time to examining the failure of law.  He also believes there is no central or primary foundational interpretive method for interpreting the law.  The main point of his work is the judging of "an engaged game of rhetorical justification" which the judge must interpret, such as a [[statute]], a line of [[precedents]], or the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  He has a [[nonfoundationalist]] perspective which searches for the truth that forms [[reality]].  Hutchinson says that method and medium must change, so self-creation becomes the engine and energy of social change.  You can grasp life by living and this task cannot be completed by outside [[language]] or through language.  Hutchinson argues that politically charged and unstable context shapes our understanding of legal rules.  Hutchinson's understanding of truth confirms that law is [[politics]].  A nonfoundationalist account of law is compatible with a diverse range of political results. A definitive account of Hutchinson's legacy was published in ''[[The Journal Jurisprudence]]'', Vol 7, in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurisprudence.com.au/juris7/hm2.pdf|title=A Final Letter|author=Allan Hutchinson|publisher=''The Journal Jurisprudence'' Vol.7|date=2010|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ian Ward ===
Ian Ward is a professor of law and degree programme director at [[Newcastle University]] Law School. He is also on the editorial board for ''[[Studies in Law and Literature]].'' Ward received a BA from [[University of Keele]] in 1986, a Ph. D from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1989, an LLM from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1990 and a MSc from [[University of Leicester]] in 2010. Ward believes that students in both fields, law and literature, can benefit from studying rhetoric alongside law. His research lies in legal theory and [[public law]] among others. Ward has published numerous works dealing with law and literature and legal theory.

In his publication ''Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives'', Ward discusses the future goals of the law and literature movement while exploring elements of law in famous pieces of literature. In chapter 1 of this publication, Ward describes law ''in'' literature as the process of examining "the possible relevance of literary text, particularly those which present themselves as telling a legal [[narrative|story]], as texts appropriate for study by legal scholars." He then sees law ''as'' literature as the process of seeking "to apply the techniques of literary criticism to legal texts." He believes that the relationship between the two are complimentary. He states discussing the debate about the importance of the Law and Literature Movement shows "its enduring strength."

=== Robin West ===
Another advocate for the integration of legal studies with the serious examination of literary texts, [[Robin West]] has frequently turned to [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial]]'' to discuss the [[rule of law]]. As a critic of [[Richard Posner]]'s more economic take on the law, she does not dismiss the implications made by authors in legal fictional texts. For example, when discussing Kafka, West asserts that:
{{quote|Obedience to legal rules to which we would have consented relieves us of the task of evaluating the [[morality]] and prudence of our actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin West]]. ''Authority Autonomy And Choice: The Role Of Consent In The Moral And Political Visions Of Franz Kafka And Richard Posner''. 99 Harv. L. Rev. 384, 424 (Dec. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Comments such as these show West's [[ideological]] stand on the power of literature as well as her personal [[philosophy of law]]. West's arguments tend to focus on the human condition as read in books as well as the individual submission to authority, and what she believes to be an apparent contradiction. She calls for scholars to interpret, create and critique narrative texts in order to broaden their understanding of the human condition, and the law's effect on it and the community as a whole. West believes in a so-called 'political, communal and ethical re-constitution', a mode of thinking that one might engage in when reading and critiquing texts, both fictional and legal.  Because of this duality, West asserts, law and literature become more related and thus more valid in discussion when debating the implications of one or the other.

These views have caused her to be seen as in the same camp as James Boyd White, although some argue that she goes even further, by becoming more of a political writer than a legal and literary critic. In her book, ''Narrative, Authority and the Law'', West notably diverges from thinkers like [[Richard Weisberg]] and James Boyd White by stating that there should be less focus on the debate within the texts and instead a 'truly radical critique of power'. She expands by stating, "By focusing on the distinctively imperative core of [[adjudication]], instead of its interpretive gloss, we free up meaningful criticism of law."

Such assertions lead some to believe her goals are more political than scholarly in nature.  West may be seen not only as a scholar of law and literature, but also as a member of the [[critical legal studies]] movement (CLS).

=== Melanie Williams ===
Melanie Williams read Law at the [[University of Cambridge]], graduating with a BA Hons in Law in 1988 (MA 1991).  She has a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] and an MA in [[English Literature]] from the [[University of Sussex]] and is a Fellow of the [[Higher Education Academy]].  She is Professor of Law at the School of Law, [[University of Exeter]].  Formerly, she was Professor and Reader of Law at [[Swansea University]] and prior to that Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Aberystwyth]] until 2003.  Professor Williams’ research interests include Interdisciplinary Studies in Philosophy, Law and Literature, Law and Culture; approaches to Law and Ethics, Feminist and Socio-legal studies.  She is an editorial board member with Law and Humanities (Hart); International Journal of Law in Context (CUP); Law, Culture and Humanities (Sage); Jurisprudence (Hart);‘Law and Literature’ series, DeGruyter, Berlin and New York.

A review of Professor Williams book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Empty_justice.html?id=L-BmBtjzwtgC&amp;redir_esc=y Empty Justice] in the Entertainment and Sports Law Journal [2006] reads:
‘Melanie Williams’s book is in part what its sub-title declares: a series of case studies dating from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth, linking literary and philosophical texts to legal issues. It is also in part what its title declares: a peroration on the jurisprudential idea of ‘empty justice’, using literary texts as accessible ways into difficult concepts. What neither title nor sub-title declares is that this is first and foremost a work of feminist theory. Williams's goal has been to show (with doubters particularly in mind) ‘how pervasive feminist issues are for all persons and all belief systems’ (p. xxv).Williams wears her learning lightly, and the wealth of inter-woven illustrative examples, contextual details and outlines of theoretical debates really achieves its object of making feminist issues central, inevitable even. And she writes beautifully’.

== Criticisms of law and literature ==
[[Richard Posner]] has played an important role in the [[law and economics]] movement.  As the author of ''Law and Literature: A misunderstood Relationship'' (now in its third edition, titled simply ''Law and Literature''), Posner is highly critical of the law and literature movement and the book helps to voice his more hard-lined interpretation of the law. The book can be seen as a reaction against the writings of [[Robin West]], who has written substantially against Posner's economic take on [[Statutory interpretation|legal interpretation]]. A powerful critic of the writings of White, Weisberg, and West, Posner sees literature as having no weight in the legal realm although he does hold the authors in high esteem. He writes, "Although the writers we value have often put law into their writings, it does not follow that those writings are about law in any interesting way that a lawyer might be able to elucidate."

Posner does not believe in the use of literary discourse in jurisprudential debate, and in [[Colloquy (law)|colloquy]] has described West's analysis of literature in legal debate as "particularly eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Posner|Richard A Posner]]. ''The Ethical Significance of Free Choice: A Reply to Professor West''. 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1433 (1985-1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Posner writes that "law is subject matter rather than technique", and that legal method is the method of choice in legal realms, not a literary one. To expand further, Posner believes literary works have no place in judicial debate because one can never truly contemplate the original meaning of the author, and that novels should only be considered in their contexts. He characterizes the discovery of laws in fiction as "ancillary" and asserts the main subject matter of a novel is always the human condition, and not the legal setting. From this perspective, the legal background created by [[Kafka]] and [[Albert Camus]] are simply that, background, and have no further meaning beyond the environment which they create.

This isn't to say that Posner doesn't think in literary terms-far from it. For instance he characterizes [[Albert Camus]]'s ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', as the "growth of self-awareness" on the part of the hero, [[Meursault]]. Posner gives weight to such situations on personal levels and only on personal levels, yet dismisses any sort of legal implications of such situations as lacking in "[[wikt:realism|realism]]". Such assertions and arguments have placed him in sharp contrast with Richard Weisberg, who has cited ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' numerous times, among other books. Posner sees literature's importance in legal studies only because they may help the lawyer grow as an individual and to develop character, but sees no value in them as social critiques of the era in which they were developed and written, as Law and Literature scholars might ascribe to them. Certainly he sees no value in them as sources of [[legal philosophy]] and reform.

Highly critical of the notable Law and Literature scholars, Posner believes that such legal minds have taken literature "too seriously" and assigned them an unsubstantiated amount of weight in the expansion of legal knowledge and jurisprudential debate.

[[Richard Delgado]] and [[Jean Stefancic]] were against White and his theory of certain famous legal cases in U.S. history and agree with Posner on several issues.  Their theory is that the actual impact of [[contemporary literature]] on the substance of judicial opinion-making is limited because judges distinguish legal texts.  According to Delgado and Stefancic, judges' moral positions are determined by normative social and political forces rather than by literature.  They are firm believers of the [[critical race theory]] which is a school of sociological thought that emphasizes the socially constructed nature of race.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35509">'''Laws regarding incest in the United States''' vary widely between jurisdictions regarding both the definition of the offense and penalties for its commission.

==Overview==
{{Further|Sexuality in the United States}}
In all but two states, incest is criminalized between consenting adults. In New Jersey and Rhode Island, incest between consenting adults (16 or over for Rhode Island, 18 or over for New Jersey) is not a criminal offense, though marriage is not allowed in either state. New Jersey also increases the severity of underage sex offenses by a degree if they're also incestuous, and criminalizes incest with 16-17 year olds (the normal [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]] in New Jersey is 16).

{{Asof|2010}} cases of incest involving consenting adults are often not revealed to outside parties, and therefore prosecutions of these cases do not frequently occur. Cases of parent-adult child incest exposed to law enforcement are usually uncovered by another parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clark-Flory, Tracy|url=https://www.salon.com/2010/12/10/incest/|title=The law on "consensual" incest|publisher=''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''|date=2010-12-11|accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions is necessary to help compliance the requirements of the MSA to end and prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and achieve maximum yield &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/18/2016-24500/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-national-standard-guidelines#h-3|title=Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; National Standard Guidelines|date=2016-10-18|work=Federal Register|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Overfished US stocks 2015.png|thumb|NOAA Fisheries stock status of 2015]]

== Background ==
In 2006, the [[Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act|Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act]] was established to end and prevent overfishing though the use of annual catch limits and accountability measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/ns1_resources.html|title=National Standard 1 – Related Resources :: Office of Sustainable Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=Office of Sustainable|website=www.nmfs.noaa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reasons for why the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization act was created was because of: 
* A handful of fish stocks has declined to the point of their survival being threatened
* To make it possible for small fishing companies to compete with massive fishing fleets 
* Failure to prevent or terminate overfishing of the International fishery agreement
* To provide optimal yields on a continuing basis to preserve and maintain fisheries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/msa/documents/msa_amended_2007.pdf|title=Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Standard 1 - Optimum Yield ==
The National Standard 1 pertains:
* Providing Stability for Fisheries
* Adding Flexibility to rebuilding plans
* Updating optimal yield and maximum sustainable yield concepts
* Improving guidance on managing data-limit stocks
* Consolidating guidance on identifying stocks to be included in federal fishery management plans
* Provisions to further advance ecosystem-based fisheries management&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisheries|first1=Office of Sustainable|title=2016 Revisions to National Standard 1 Guidelines :: Office of Sustainable Fisheries|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/ns1_revisions.html|website=www.nmfs.noaa.gov|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Standard 2 - Scientific Information ==
The counsel may decide to allow this type of overfishing if the fishery is not overfished and if all of the following lower conditions are satisfied:
* Such action will result in longterm net benefits to the Nation
* Mitigating measures have been considered and it has been demonstrated that a similar level of longterm net benefits cannot be achieved by modifying fleet behavior, gear selection/configuration, or other technical characteristic in a manner such that no overfishing would occur
* The resulting rate of fishing mortality will not cause any stock or stock complex to fall below its MSST more than 50 percent of the time in the long term, although it is recognized that persistent overfishing is expected to cause the affected stock to fall below its Bmsy more than 50 percent of the time in the long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== National Standard 3 - Management Units ==
The SAFE report provides information to the [[Council|Counsils]] for determining annual harvest levels for each stock. To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_3_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Standard 3 is to induce a comprehensive approach to fishery management. The geographic scope of the fishery, for planning purposes, should cover the entire range of the stocks of fish and to not be overly constrained by Political boundaries. Whenever possible, an Fishery Management Plan should manage interrelated stocks of fish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== National Standard 4 - Allocations ==
Defined by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's]] (NOAA) [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS), Allocation is "a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to participate in a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or individuals" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/morrison_scott_nmfs_f_spo_148.pdf|title=Review of Laws, Guidance, Technical Memorandums and Case Studies Related to Fisheries Allocation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Standard 4 pertains to the conservation and management measures avoiding discrimination between residents of different states. If it is or becomes necessary to assign fishing privileges among various U.S. fishermen, such allocation shall be:
# Fair and equitable to all such fishermen
# Reasonably calculated to promote conservation
# Managed in a manner that no particular individual, corporation or other entity squires an excessive share of such privileges
An Fishery Management Plan may not differentiate amount U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or corporations on the basis of their state or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_4_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Standard 5 - Efficiency ==
Conservation and Management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; except that no measure shall have economic allocation of its sole purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_5_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "utilization", is meant to be interpreted as; harvesting, processing, marketing, and nonconsumptive use of the resource. In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest the optimal yield with the minimum use of economic inputs as labor, capital, interest and fuel.

This standard highlights one process that a fishery can/should contribute to the planet's benefit with a low effect society:
* Given a set of objectives for the fishery, an Fishery Management Plan should contain management measures that result in as efficient a fishery as is practicable or desirable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Another efficient Fishery Management Plan includes:
* Management Plan that allows a fishery to manage at the lowest cost possible (e.g., fishing effort, administration and enforcement) for a particular level of catch and initial size &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==  National Standard 6 - Variations and Contingencies ==
Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catch.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_6_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Conservation and management" implies the wise use of fishery resources through a management plan that includes some protection against the following uncertainties: Timely respond to resource, industry, and other national and regional needs.

Fishery Management Plans should consist of a suitable impact in favor of conservation. Allowances for uncertainties should be factored into the backbone of a Fishery Management Plan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Examples include: 
* Reduce optimal yield from lack of information of a stock
* Establish a reserve as the creation of a reserve may include uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or environmental factors
* Adjust management techniques as a council could guard against producing drastic changes in fishing patterns, allocations, or practices
* Highlight habitat conditions as knowing the original habitat condition can help address the impacts of pollution and habitat degradation
* Contingencies can establish a flexible management plan that contains a range of management options for unpredicted events (e.g., unexpected resource surges or failures, fishing effort greater than expected, disruptive gear conflicts)

== National Standard 7 - Costs and Benefits  ==
Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_7_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires Councils to prepare Fishery Management Plans for overfished fisheries and for other fisheries where regulation will be beneficial according to cost whether its in the present or future.

The following factors shall be considered, among others to implement an Fishery Management Plan:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* The importance of fishery to the Nation and to the regional economy
* The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an Fishery Management Plan can improve or maintain that condition
* The extent to which the fishery could be or is already adequately managed by states, by state/Federal programs, by Federal regulations pursuant to Fishery Management Plans or inter nation commissions, or by industry self-regulation, consistent with the policies and standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
* The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among user groups and whether an Fishery Management Plan can further that resolution
* The economic condition of a fishery and whether an Fishery Management Plan can produce more efficient utilization
* The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an Fishery Management Plan can foster orderly growth
* The costs associated with an Fishery Management Plan, balanced against the benefits&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== National Standard 8 - Communities ==
Conservation and Management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements with the Magnuson-Stevens Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that are based upon the best scientific information available in order to:
# Provide for the sustained participation of such communities; and 
# To the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_8_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This standard is meant to take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities from an Fishery Management Plan. This consideration, however, is within the context of the conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Careful consideration regarding the importance of fishery resources to affected fishing communities, thus, must not compromise the achievement of conservation requirements and goals of the Fishery Management Plan.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== National Standard 9 - Bycatch ==
Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable:
# Minimize bycatch; and
# To the extent by catch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_9_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "bycatch" is to be interpreted as fish that are harvested in a fishery, but are not sold or kept for personal use.

National Standard 9 requires Councils to consider the bycatch effects of existing and planned conservation and management measures. Bycatch may delay or prevent efforts to protect marine ecosystems, efforts to achieve sustainable fisheries and delay or prevent the full benefits they may provide to the Nation.

Bycatch can increase substantially the uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality, which increases difficulty to assess the status of stocks, to set the appropriate Optimal Yield and define overfishing levels. and to ensure that Optimal Yields are attained and overfishing levels are not exceeded. Bycatch may also preclude other more productive uses of fishery resources.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== National Standard 10 - Safety of Life at Sea ==
Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/national_standards/documents/national_standard_10_cfr.pdf|title=Fishery Conservation and Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Standard 10 promotes Councils to reduce the risk in crafting their management measures. If the management measures can meet the other national standards and the legal and practical requirements of conservation and management then there should be no problem. This standard is not meant to give preference to one method of managing a fishery over another.

Non-inclusive list of safety considerations that shall be considered in evaluating management measures under national standard 10:
# Operating environment shall be put into consideration of a Fishing Management Plan that should try to avoid creating situations resulting in vessels going out further, fishing longer, or fishing in weather worse than if there were no management measures.
# Gear and vessel loading requirements shall be put into consideration of an Fishing Management Plan that should consider the safety and stability of fishing vessels when required specific gear or requiring the removal of gear from the water.
# Limited season and area fisheries shall be put into consideration of an Fishing Management Plan that should attempt to reduce the impacts of fisherman fishing in bad weather and overlaid their vessel with catch and/or gear.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Margaretta Bleecker Faugères''' (October 11, 1771 – January 9, 1801) was the daughter of [[Ann Eliza Bleecker]]. She was an American playwright, poet and political activist.

==Childhood==
Margaretta Bleecker was born in [[New York City]] to John and Ann Eliza Bleecker, members of the American Dutch aristocracy. Shortly after her birth, they moved to their country estate in [[Troy, New York|Tomhannock]], a small village north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], where they lived in the "most perfect tranquility"&lt;ref name="Posthumous"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Posthumous Works Of Ann Eliza Bleecker|last=Faugeres |first=Margaretta V.|authorlink= |year=1793 |publisher=T.and J.

During the war Margaretta lost her grandmother, her aunt and her sister. Her mother was devastated by the loss and never fully recovered. Margaretta described their life after the war as "tolerable tranquility". Her mother developed a tendency towards depression and destroyed most of her own writings. Margaretta's tragedy continued with the loss of her mother when she was twelve years old.&lt;ref name="execute"&gt;{{cite book |title=Executing race: early American women's narratives of race, society, and the law |last=Harris|first=Sharon M.|authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lZqG90WYhkC&amp;dq=Belasarius+by+bleecker+faugeres&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= |isbn=0-8142-5131-5 |pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sometime after her mother's death, she and her father moved to [[New York City]] where she continued her education and began to write. She was committed to establishing her mother's reputation as a writer as well as her own. She started publishing her mother's poetry, what was left of it, in ''The New York Magazine'' in 1790.&lt;ref name="Wieland"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wieland, Or, the Transformation: An American Tale, With Related Texts |last=Brown |first=Charles Brockden|authorlink= |author2=Philip Barnard |author3=Stephen Shariro  |year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1Lp5VbFfsMC&amp;dq=Margaretta+Bleecker&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= |isbn=0-87220-974-1 |pages=278–279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly she began publishing her own essays and poems in the same periodical. Her reputation as a poet grew and for a few years she was considered the "premier poet" of the magazine. She had strong political views and concentrated her writings around the [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]], her support of the [[French Revolution]] and her disapproval of [[capital punishment]].

In June 1791, ''The New York Magazine'' published her essay ''Fine Feelings Exemplified in the Conduct of a Negro Slave'' in which she challenged [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s claim that slaves lacked "finer feelings",&lt;ref name="execute"/&gt; she wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot help thinking that their sensations, mental and external, are as acute as those of the people whose skin may be of a different colour; such an assertion may be bold, but facts are stubborn things, and had I not ''them'' to support me, it is probable I should not attempt to oppose the opinions of such an eminent reasoner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her support of the French Revolution was probably shaped by her friendship with a French physician, Peter Faugeres, who shared her political views. They were married, in opposition to her father's wishes, on [[Bastille Day]], July 14, 1792. Her marriage proved to be miserable; it became widely known that her husband abused her and within just a few years managed to squander her large fortune.&lt;ref name="PoA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Female poets of America|last=Griswold|first=Rufus Wilmot|authorlink= |year=1872|publisher=J. Miller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7wOAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Margaretta+Bleecker&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= |isbn= |pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, she published ''The Posthumous Works of Ann Eliza Bleecker in Prose and Verse, to which is added a Collection of Essays, Prose and Poetical'', a collection of her mother's work and her own. In 1795, she wrote ''Belisarius: A Tragedy''. It was her major literary achievement, a blank-verse tragedy in four acts which echoed her views on human rights.

Faugeres opposed the death penalty for murder which made her view more radical than most. She felt it was inconsistent for a country which boasted of its freedom and happiness.&lt;ref name="execute" /&gt; She wrote ''The Ghost of John Young'' in 1797. It was a six-page pamphlet arguing against the use of capital punishment. It was a poetic narrative in which she gave ''John Young's'' perspective from the grave.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I a murderer was by ''rage '' propell'd; and I have heard the last harsh decree, &lt;br&gt; but if the ''maniac'' is a murderer held, say ''cool deliberate'' actors, ''what are ye''?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not much is known of the remainder of her life. Her husband died of [[Yellow Fever]] in 1798. She taught school at an academy in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] and later in [[Brooklyn]]. Her last published work, ''"Ode"'', was composed to support a July 4, 1798, speech given by [[Governor George Clinton]], of whom she was a longtime supporter. The text was written to remind those of the price of revolution and the need for change. Faugeres saw beyond her privileged class and wrote about the democratic ideals of equality and justice. She sought radical change for American society and politics. She died on January 9, 1801, in Brooklyn and is buried next to her father in the Bowery Methodist Church cemetery.

Margaretta Van Wyck Bleecker and Peter Faugeres had 2 daughters, Eveanna Electa Faugeres (1795–1841) and Margaret Mason Faugeres (1797–1820). Eveanna married John Anthony Bleecker (her cousin) and had 8 children. Margaret married Edward P. Brady and was married 5 years before her death.

{{Competition law}}
'''Merger control''' refers to the procedure of reviewing [[mergers , acquisitions]] under [[antitrust]] / competition law. Over 130 nations worldwide have adopted a regime providing for merger control. National or supernational competition agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] [[European Commission]] or the [[US]] [[Federal Trade Commission]] are normally entrusted with the role of reviewing mergers.

Merger control regimes are adopted to prevent anti-competitive consequences of concentrations (as mergers and acquisitions are also known). Accordingly, most merger control regimes normally provide for one of the following substantive tests:

* Does the concentration significantly impede [[effective competition]]? ([[European Union|EU]], [[Germany]])
* Does the concentration substantially lessen competition? ([[United States|US]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])
* Does the concentration lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position? ([[Switzerland]], [[Russia]])

In practice most merger control regimes are based on very similar underlying principles. In simple terms, the creation of a dominant position would usually result in a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to [[effective competition]].

The large majority of modern merger control regimes are of an ''ex-ante'' nature, i.e. the reviewing authorities carry out their assessment before the transaction is implemented.

While it is indisputable that a concentration may lead to a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the antitrust authority faces the challenge of applying various [[Economics|economic]] theories and rules in a legally binding procedure.

==Horizontal mergers==

The vast majority of significant competition issues associated with mergers arises in horizontal mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 1.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A horizontal merger is one between parties that are competitors at the same level of production and/or distribution of a good or service, i.e., in the same [[relevant market]].&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of anticompetitive effects associated with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and coordinated effects.

'''Unilateral effects''', also known as non-coordinated effects, arise where, as a result of the merger, competition between the products of the merging firms is eliminated, allowing the merged entity to unilaterally exercise market power, for instance by profitably raising the price of one or both merging parties’ products, thus harming consumers.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 2.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homogeneous products|homogeneous markets]], unilateral effects can be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player with only a few or no other competitors. In these markets, an important role in the assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice  and the  Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 6.3 http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#6c&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Differentiated Bertrand competition|differentiated markets]], unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two merging companies have highly [[Substitute good|substitutable goods]]. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the [[substitutability]] of the products supplied by the two firms – the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 28 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coordinated effects''' arise where, under certain market conditions (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully be able to [[Coordination game|coordinate]] their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of unilateral effects, the most common form of coordinated effects is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market.

The main question in analysing coordinated effects should be whether the merger materially increases the likelihood that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing [[Coordination game|coordination]]. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger.  This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to coordinated effects.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. D.3 and D.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[European Union]] merger control regime, in order for coordinated effects to arise the so-called "[[Airtours]] criteria" have to be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;From the judgment of the General Court of the European Union which introduced these criteria. See Case T-342/99, Airtours v Commission, [2002] ECR II-2585.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "[[Airtours]] criteria", coordination is more likely to emerge in markets where it is relatively simple to reach a common understanding on the terms of coordination. In addition, three conditions are necessary for coordination to be sustainable. First, the coordinating firms must be able to monitor to a sufficient degree whether the terms of [[Coordination game|coordination]] are being adhered to. Second, discipline requires that there is some form of credible deterrent mechanism that can be activated if deviation is detected. Third, the reactions of outsiders, such as current and future competitors not participating in the coordination, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the results expected from the [[Coordination game|coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 41 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-horizontal mergers==

There are two basic forms of non-horizontal mergers: vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertical mergers''' are mergers between firms that operate at different but complementary levels in the chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product.  In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same [[relevant market]].  As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either [[relevant market]]. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other.  Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical effects can produce competitive harm in the form of foreclosure. A merger is said to result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies' ability and/or incentive to compete.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 29 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of foreclosure can be distinguished. The first is where the merger is likely to raise the costs of downstream rivals by restricting their access to an important input (input foreclosure). The second is where the merger is likely to foreclose upstream rivals by restricting their access to a sufficient customer base (customer foreclosure).&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 30 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be noted that in general vertical merger concerns are likely to arise only if market power already exists in one or more markets along the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.10 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conglomerate mergers''' involve firms that operate in different [[Relevant market|product markets]], without a vertical relationship.  They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets.  In practice, the focus is on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.12 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Merger review in this area is controversial, as commentators and enforcement agencies disagree on the extent to which one can predict competitive harm resulting from such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.13 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such a disagreement is for instance illustrated by the different outcomes of the merger control reviews by the authorities of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] of the [[Honeywell#GE-Honeywell merger attempt|GE/Honeywell merger attempt]].

Proponents of conglomerate theories of harm argue that in a small number of cases, where the parties to the merger have strong market positions in their respective markets, potential harm may arise when the merging group is likely to foreclose other rivals from the market in a way similar to vertical mergers, particularly by means of tying and bundling their products.  When as a result of foreclosure rival companies become less effective competitors, consumer harm may result.

However, it should be stressed that in these cases there is a real risk of foregoing efficiency gains that benefits consumer welfare and thus the theory of competitive harm needs to be supported by substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.14-3.15 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory and voluntary regimes==

A merger control regime is described as "mandatory" when filing of a transaction is compulsory. Mandatory regimes normally also contain a so-called "suspensory clause", which implies that the parties to a transaction are indefinitely prevented from closing the deal until they have received merger clearance. The majority of merger jurisdictions worldwide have mandatory merger control systems. An examples of a mandatory system with suspensory clause is provided by the [[European Union]] merger control.&lt;ref&gt;See Regulation of the Council (EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EU Merger Regulation) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction can also be made between "local" and "global" bars on closing/implementation; some mandatory regimes provide that the transaction cannot be implemented within the particular jurisdiction (local bar on closing) and some provide that the transaction cannot be closed/implemented anywhere in the world prior to merger clearance (global bar on closing). A number of jurisdictions worldwide have a merger control regime which imposes a global bar on closing. This creates obstacles for the parties to a concentration to close a transaction until a number of the regulatory clearances required are obtained.

A merger control regime is described as "voluntary" when the parties are not prevented from closing the deal and implementing the transaction in advance of having applied for and received merger clearance.  In these circumstances the merging parties are effectively taking the risk that the competition authority will not require them to undo the deal if in due course it is found that the transaction is likely to have an anti-competitive effect.  Voluntary regimes are fairly exceptional. The United Kingdom, for instance, has a voluntary merger control regime. However, the [[Office of Fair Trading]] can request the parties to a merger that has already completed to hold the two businesses separate pending an investigation (so called "[[initial undertakings]]").

Mandatory regimes can be considered effective in preventing anticompetitive concentrations since it is almost impossible to unravel a merger once it has been implemented (for example because key staff have been made redundant, assets have been sold and information has been exchanged). On the other hand, voluntary regimes are seen as constituting less of a burden for merging firms.

'''Mülk''' was a type of land tenure under the [[Ottoman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forni|title=Land tenure policies in the Near East|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y8999T/y8999t0f.htm|publisher=FAO|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Türkische Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte (1071-1920)|isbn=9783447036832|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}

==Characteristics of mülk==
Mülk was similar to [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land; owners could buy, sell, and mortgage freely. It was exempt from some kinds of land taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mulk|url=http://mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/mulk.htm|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mülk was about more than just the ''land''; it might also include the right to annual [[malikane]] payments from tenants and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=İslamoğlu-İnan|title=State and Peasant in the Ottoman Empire: Agrarian Power Relations and Regional Economic Development in Ottoman Anatolia During the Sixteenth Century|year=1994|isbn=9789004100282|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In much of the near east, mülk can be contrasted against miri, which was effectively state-controlled land (perhaps a former mülk forfeited to the state when the owner had no heir to pass it on to).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman Land Registration Law as a Contributing Factor in the Israeli-Arab Conflict|url=http://www.beki.org/landlaw.html|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some ways, mülk was similar to [[Waqf|vakuf]] property.

These regional reporters are supplemented by reporters for a single state like the [[New York Supplement]] (N.Y.S. 1888–1938; 2d 1938–) and the [[California Reporter]] (Cal.Rptr. 1959–1991; 2d 1991–2003; 3d 2003–) which include decisions of intermediate state appellate courts. The New York Supplement covers both intermediate appellate courts and state trial courts, since there is also an official reporter for the latter in New York State.

==Additional information==

Indices of citations are provided by [[Shepard's Citations]] while the [[West American Digest System]] offers access by hierarchized [[Index term|keywords]].

Today, the NRS is the primary publication route for opinions from the [[United States courts of appeals|federal courts of appeals]], the [[United States district court|federal district courts]], and state appellate courts in many states that currently do not have an official reporter (either because they never had one or abolished it in favor of the NRS).  The NRS is available at [[law library|law libraries]] throughout the United States, and is also available through online legal research databases like [[Westlaw]] and [[LexisNexis]].  Since the NRS now comprises over 10,000 volumes, and many older cases have been overruled or superseded, only the largest law libraries keep a complete hard copy set on site.  Most law libraries either do not carry older volumes or retrieve them on request from off-site compact storage.  

While enormous in size and vast in scope, the NRS is not entirely comprehensive.  In the 1890s, West retroactively brought all pre-1880 published cases of all lower federal courts into the NRS framework by compiling them into the ''Federal Cases'' reporter.  But West never did the same thing with all U.S. Supreme Court cases which predate the publication of the ''Supreme Court Reporter'', nor with all  published state cases that predate the start of the NRS regional or state-level reporters. The NRS does not include opinions from state trial courts, courts administered by territorial governments (as distinguished from federal territorial courts), [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Indian courts]], or administrative agencies at either the federal or state level.  Certain opinions from federal courts of appeals, federal district courts, and state appellate courts are not selected or designated for publication.  However, all these materials can be found separately on legal research databases.

The '''National Youth Rights Association''' ('''NYRA''') is a youth-led [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] organization in the [[United States]] promoting [[youth rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.org/|title=National Youth Rights Association|work=National Youth Rights Association|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately ten thousand members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} NYRA promotes the lessening or removing of various legal restrictions that are imposed on young people but not adults, for example, the [[drinking age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.org/issues/drinking-age/|title=National Youth Rights Association » Drinking Age|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[voting age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.org/issues/voting-age/|title=National Youth Rights Association » Voting Age|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the imposition of youth [[curfew]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.org/issues/curfew/|title=National Youth Rights Association » Curfew|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Youth rights movement ===
{{further|History of youth rights in the United States}}

The youth rights movement first utilized the [[Internet]] in 1991,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} with the creation of the Y-Rights listserv mailing list. Two members of that original Internet presence, Matthew Walcoff and Matt Herman, began a non-profit organization out of that mailing list known as [[Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions|ASFAR]]. Not too long after ASFAR was founded, a [[Rockville, Maryland]] high school student began a youth rights group called YouthSpeak. At the same time, a third youth from Canada, Joshua Gilbert, was starting a youth rights organization for his country, the Canadian Youth Rights Association (CYRA). Walcoff, Herman, Hein and Gilbert all met through ASFAR, and decided to start a non-profit corporation to help unify the youth rights movement, which at that point consisted of almost a dozen different groups around North America and the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Forming NYRA ===

By June 1998, NYRA was incorporated as a [[Maryland]] [[non-profit]] [[public-benefit corporation]] with intention to lead the Youth Rights political movement in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} It was formed by the original founders of ASFAR because of the desire to create a moderate, pragmatic organization in the [[Youth Rights, USA|Youth Rights]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

NYRA's Executive Director from 2000 to 2012 was [[Alex Koroknay-Palicz]]. As its key spokesman, he was featured on [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[PBS]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', as well as many others, on youth rights issues such as the voting and drinking ages. In 2012, Koroknay-Palicz stepped down before reemerging in 2015.

2005 was a significant year for NYRA.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In late March, Koroknay-Palicz and several NYRA members traveled to Vermont in support of a bill lowering the drinking age to 18.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  They visited numerous colleges and signed up over 2000 new supporters.  They participated in a debate at the Vermont state house, and the event was significantly covered by the media.  Meanwhile, in Washington state, a new chapter in [[Olympia, Washington]], testified in support of a state constitutional amendment to lower the state's voting age to sixteen.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} From February to August 2006, President Adam King led a local campaign to add a nonvoting student adviser onto the Buncombe County (N.C.) Board of Education.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} His project had the support of the ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]'' and over 60 faculty members and administrators at his high school.  However, in August, the Board of Education rejected his proposal citing that they already had sufficient student input.  During his campaign, King made several appearances in the media.

By 2006, NYRA's main area of focus was expanding its local chapters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Chapters had increased fivefold between 2003 and 2006.  In 2006, the Board of Directors formally established that chapters are separate legal entities.  The chapter formation division saw a major restructure near the end of 2006.  Previously, the division was divided into five regions with one person assigned to that region.  However, the division's management decided to utilize a national pool of representatives working with all intents throughout the nation. In December 2006, NYRA received its first substantial grant from the Babson Foundation.  And in January 2007, it began renting an office from [[Common Cause]] in downtown Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/26/AR2007112602238.html Age Is Just a Number - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the organizations changed its slogan from "[https://web.archive.org/web/20050512143015/http://www.oneandfour.org/archives/2005/04/the_last_civil.html the last civil rights movement]", in reference to the [[youth rights movement]], to "live free, start young."

In 2009, NYRA began to take prominent legal action and assert itself as a force for youth and students in [[jurisprudence]]. The organization filed its first joint amicus curiae brief in [[Safford Unified School District v. Redding|Safford v. Redding]], a student rights case brought before the United States Supreme Court, its President published an opinion opposing the Barr et al. v. Lafon case in the award-winning University of Pittsburgh School of Law journal "[[the Jurist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2008/08/sixth-circuit-ruling-on-confederate.php |title=JURIST - Hotline: Sixth Circuit ruling on Confederate flag ban is an attack on students' rights |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829024341/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2008/08/sixth-circuit-ruling-on-confederate.php |archivedate=August 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a local chapter filed a lawsuit against the city of West Palm Beach, Florida, in an effort to repeal its curfew, a case which is still ongoing.

NYRA co-sponsored the First Annual National Youth Rights Day which occurred on April 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalyouthrightsday.org/ National Youth Rights Day]. Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Epstein]] wrote The Young Person's Bill of Rights for this event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drrobertepstein.com/NationalYouthRightsDay/YOUNG_PERSONS_BILL_OF_RIGHTS.html The Young Person's Bill of Rights]. Robert Epstein in celebration of the First Annual National Youth Rights Day on April 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==

NYRA is a [[501(c)(3)]] organization registered as a [[nonprofit]] corporation in Maryland.

It is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors, including Anne Sheridan (President).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/about/board-of-directors/ Board of Directors]. National Youth Rights Association official website. Retrieved 07/29/17.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">The '''Olney–Pauncefote Treaty''' of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that would have required arbitration of major disputes. The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.

The [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]] was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state [[Richard Olney]] in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat [[Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote|Julian Pauncefote]].  President [[William McKinley]] supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. In Britain it was promoted by pacifist Liberal MP [[Randal Cremer]]; the main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.

In the US Senate, however, a series of amendments exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin.  Virtually nothing was left of the original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.

The '''Pacific Salmon Commission''' is a regulatory body run jointly by the [[Canadian government|Canadian]] and [[United States government]]s. Its mandate is to protect stocks of the five species of [[Pacific salmon]]. Its precursor was the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, which operated from 1937 to 1985. The PSC enforces the Pacific Salmon Treaty, ratified by Canada and the U.S. in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/pacific-salmon/|title=Pacific Salmon|last=Lane|first=E.D.|author2=W. Pennell|year=2011|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Seining salmon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Seining]] salmon on the [[Columbia River]], 1914]]
[[File:Falsepass ak SharonJeanWarjackAmandaDawn.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Salmon seiners docked at [[False Pass]], [[Alaska]]]]
Pacific salmon have been an important food source and trade commodity for Northwest First Nations peoples for millenia. After European explorers arrived, the first large-scale commercial salmon fisheries were started in the early 1800s. Lucrative fisheries were established on the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Fraser River|Fraser]] rivers, including [[canneries]] geared for export. Harvests increased year-to-year until the 1910s. The abundance of the resource had precluded any disagreements between the Canadian and American governments until this point.&lt;ref name="Roos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=John F.|title=Restoring Fraser River salmon : a history of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, 1937-1985 |year=1991|publisher=Pacific Salmon Commission|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-9694947-0-X |pages=10–13, 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the 1920s onward, stocks began to decline, a result of [[over-fishing]] and the degradation and obstruction of migratory rivers. Competition between American and Canadian fisheries for the dwindling resource led to conflict. Disputes were complicated by the fact that the salmon crossed several international borders during their lifespan. In 1930, the governments met and proposed the Fraser River Convention to regulate fishing and mitigate environmental damage to salmon habitats. The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission was formally founded in 1937.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y4652e/y4652e09.htm|title=North American Pacific Salmon: A Case of Fragile Cooperation|last=Miller|first=Kathleen A.|publisher=United Nations Fisheries and Aquaculture Organisation|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPSFC==
The early focus of the IPSFC was to restore the Fraser runs of [[sockeye salmon]]. Three obstacles were identified - the [[Hells Gate, British Columbia|Hells Gate]] portion of the [[Fraser Canyon]] (where a landslide in 1913 caused by railway engineers had partially blocked the river), the [[Quesnel River]] splash dam, and the [[Adams River (British Columbia)|Adams River]] splash dam. During the 1940s, fish ladders and spillways were constructed by the Commission at Hell's Gate. The splash dams on the Quesnel and Adams were dynamited and removed.&lt;ref name="Roos" /&gt;

==Pacific Salmon Treaty==
By the 1970s, cooperation between the two governments in setting fishing quotas had faltered. In 1982, a comprehensive treaty was signed and was fully ratified in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/pacificsalmontreaty.asp|title=Pacific Salmon Treaty|last=Harrison|first=John|year=2010|work=Columbia River History|publisher=Northwest Power and Conservation Council|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It limited catches of Alaska, Fraser, and Columbia salmon to pre-set quotas and committed the governments to improving the spawning capacities of the region's rivers. The treaty was amended in 1999.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Structure==
The PSC is divided into five panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Panels| work = | publisher = Pacific Salmon Commission| date = | url = http://www.psc.org/about-us/structure/panels/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Panel covers Alaska and northern British Columbia stocks. The Fraser River Panel covers the Fraser, while the Southern Panel is responsible for the Columbia and other U.S. stocks. The Yukon and Transboundary Panels monitor stock in the Yukon River, and stock in rivers crossing through British Columbia and the Alaska panhandle respectively. Each panel monitors harvesting, spawning, and habitat quality in its respective region, then makes recommendations to the Commission. These recommendations determine seasonal fishing quotas and openings.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

'''Palestinian law''' is the law  administered by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] within the territory pursuant to the [[Oslo Accords]].  It has an unusually unsettled status, as of 2014, due to the complex [[legal history]] of the area, the overlapping [[jurisdiction]]s, and the lawlessness and high [[crime rate]] in those areas. Palestinian law includes many of the legal regimes and precepts used in Palestinian ruled territory and administered by the Palestinian Authority (West Bank areas A and B) and Hamas (Gaza Strip), which is not an independent nation-state.

The scope of this article is to explain the legal history, context and development of law, the current fields of study of law in Palestinian ruled territory, as well as the state of lawlessness in those territories.  It is also to discuss the domestic and international positions on which set of laws are controlling in [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ruled territory today.

==Terminology==
Due to the changing usages of the terms "Palestine" and "Palestinian" throughout history, the term may also be associated with regimes that are not associated with the Palestinian law of today.  Examples include the discussion (in a reference work dating from 1906) of the [[Talmud]]ic interpretation of laws from Palestine before 70 AD, also known as [[Halakha]]: "Those of the laws of Palestine that were extended after [[Babylonian captivity|the Exile]] were originally enacted for the purpose of protecting the judicial administration and economic interests of Palestine, and with a view to encourage settlement there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=33&amp;letter=P Jewish Encyclopedia online from 1906]. Accessed July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such references to ancient Palestinian law do not apply to the Palestinian legal situation since at least 1948.

==Jurisdictional background==

Essentially, says one [[legal scholar]], "the legal system in 'Palestine' consists of layer upon layer of law that almost all remain in effect."&lt;ref name=Muhaisen&gt;Wadi Fouad Muhaisen, ''The Palestinian Legal System'' (essay, 2003), found at   [http://www.theyap.org/showcase/politicsandlaw/palestinianlegalsystem/ The Palestinian Legal System at Yap.com website].  Accessed July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The major issue is the:

{{quote|question of whether the emerging state of Palestine will be capable of overseeing a system of rule of law. This debate is important not only in the political arena but in the legal arena as well, since a viable state must have a legal system that is functional and reliable. Despite the historically deteriorated condition of the Gazan and West Bank legal systems under occupation, the Palestinians recently have sought to seize the opportunity to determine the fate of their own legal heritage. To determine how this may be possible, we must look at what laws currently exist in the Palestinian territories.

The law applied in different parts of the West Bank and Gaza strip is a combination of the various laws imposed on said areas throughout this century. Instead of each new law superseding the previous law, almost all of these laws remain in effect in the territories. Therefore, one would have to research multiple legal systems and codes to determine the law in one area. This is quite a confusing situation. The Palestinian legal system can be compared to a tossed salad, with layers of different laws and systems all mixed up into a confused mess. This situation in the Palestinian Territories is perhaps unprecedented in modern history.|&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;}}

The laws that applied come from many jurisdictions through history: "Customary Law ... Ottoman Law ... British Law ... Jordanian Law ... Egyptian Law ... Israeli" law and even the informal strictures of the [[Wikt:intifada|intifada]], and finally, the [[Palestinian National Authority]]'s Basic law.&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;

The subject of [[sovereignty]] is both controversial and unsettled; "neither the PLO nor the PA is recognized as a sovereign state by the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Walman&gt;{{cite journal|work=New York State Law Digest|publisher=[[New York State Bar Association]]|last=Ferstendig|first=David L.|title=Second Circuit Dismisses Action Against Palestinian Liberation Organization and Palestinian Authority Under Anti-Terrorist Act: Court finds there to be no general jurisdiction under ''Daimler''|number=671|page=1|date=October 2016}}, citing ''Waldman v. PLO'', 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 16089 (2d Cir. Aug. 31, 2016) and ''[[Daimler AG v. Bauman]]'', 134 S.Ct. 746 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Law==
The ''[[Basic law]]'', established in 2002, is the proposed [[constitution]] of a future Palestinian state.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/basiclaw.htm Mideastweb website].&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one report, "Palestinians had been requesting that the law be signed into effect since 1997, in order to formally guarantee a modicum of basic rights."&lt;ref name=mideast /&gt;  It was enacted by the [[Palestinian Legislative Council|PLC]] (the Legislature of PNA) and signed by [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref name=mideast /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is not entirely clear that Chairman Arafat's signature was required.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was amended on March 19, 2003 "to allow the creation of the Prime Minister Position in the Palestinian National Authority...."&lt;ref name=USAID&gt;Amended Basic Law, found at [http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/misc/Amended_Basic_Law.pdf USAID government law website English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801054229/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/misc/Amended_Basic_Law.pdf |date=2008-08-01 }}. Accessed July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basic Law is based loosely on [[Shari'a]]:
{{Quote|According to Article 4:
# Islam is the official religion in Palestine. Respect and sanctity of all other heavenly religions shall be maintained. 
# The principles of Islamic Shari'a shall be the main source of legislation. 
# Arabic shall be the official language.|Mideastweb.org &lt;ref name=mideast /&gt;}}

The Basic Law is introduced with "In The Name of God, The Merciful, The Compassionate,"&lt;ref name= USAID /&gt; as are most documents in [[Islam]]ic countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Articles of the Basic Law===
With 121 articles, it is more akin to a [[United States|state]] [[constitution]] in comprehensiveness, detail and length.

The "[[bill of rights]]" Articles of the Basic Law, as amended March 19, 2003, cover the following topics:
# "Palestine is part of the large[r] Arab World ...." &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# "The People is the source of power" and the 3 branches of government enshrines "the principle of [[separation of powers]]" &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# States that "Jerusalem is the Capital of Palestine." &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# Islamic law is the basis, and Arabic is the official language, of Palestine
# Creates "a democratic parliamentary system based on political and party pluralism" and a popularly elected President
# Recognizes the "principle of the [[rule of law]]" &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# Regulates citizenship
# Defines the official flag
# Protects against "discrimination because of race, sex, color, religion, political views, or disability" &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# Protection of [[human rights]]
# Protection of [[Political freedom|freedom]] and [[procedural due process]]
# Rights to "be informed of the reasons for his arrest or detention",&lt;ref name=USAID /&gt; to contact an attorney, and a speedy trial (see [[Miranda rights]])
# No duress, torture or forced confessions
# Rights to be "innocent until proven guilty",&lt;ref name=USAID /&gt; to a defense, and to a lawyer for defense
# Crime and punishment defined by law
# Right to bodily integrity
# Prohibition of searches except by lawful order
# Freedom of private religious practice ("Freedom of belief, worship, and performance of religious rituals are guaranteed, provided that they do not violate public order or public morals." &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;)
# Freedom of expression
# Freedom of movement
# Creation of a [[free market economy]] and prohibition against taking without fair compensation
# Insurance for health, disability, retirement, "welfare of families of martyrs’", and [[prisoners of war]] &lt;ref name=USAID /&gt;
# Right to housing
# Right to an education

==Statutes and legislation==
There is some confusion amongst [[jurist]]s, scholars and laymen about exactly what legal regime exists, and which laws apply, in Palestinian ruled territory.

[[Mahdi Abdul Hadi]], a legal scholar, believes that all prior and current law continues to apply in the Palestinian territories, including "the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] laws, the [[Jordanian laws]] that used to govern the [[West Bank]] before 1967 and the [[Egyptian law]] that governed [[Gaza Strip]] before 1967, in addition to the [[Israeli military orders]]."&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Party Law"&gt;Seminar summary notes, ''The Party Law in Palestine'' (Summary of the Seminar organized by PASSIA at Best Eastern Hotel in Ramallah on Political Parties Law and the upcoming PLC elections), found at [http://www.passia.org/meetings/2005/Ammar-Dwaik-2005s.htm Passia.org website].  Accessed July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Abdul Hadi, the first step was the organization of "Palestinian civil society", that is, a [[common law|traditional law]], "then came the [[Madrid Conference]] and the [[Oslo Accords]] which drafted laws to govern the Palestinian political life for the interim period."&lt;ref name="Party Law" /&gt;  Following that, "the general elections in 1996 ... brought about the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] as the legislative body of the Palestinian people in the Palestinian lands."&lt;ref name="Party Law" /&gt;

[[Ottoman law]] has governed Palestine since 1517, and the [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]] is still in force, one of the causes of [[International law and Israeli settlements|international controversy over land seizures]].&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shehadeh|first1=Raja|title=The Land Law of Palestine: An Analysis of the Definition of State Lands|journal=[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]|volume=11|issue=2|pages=82–99|doi=10.2307/2536271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman statutory "codification mirrored Islamic law but also incorporated elements of European law, especially the [[law of France]]."&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;

==Judicial and customary law==
{{main|Urf}}

Islamic customary law applies in Palestinian ruled territory:
{{quote|Alongside every formal legal system in Palestinian history, there existed a system of customary law known as "Urf", which means “that which is known” in Arabic. This was a system of rules outside the court system, which handles disputes based on traditional oral customs.|&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;}}

The term urf, meaning "to know", refers to the customs and practices of a given society. Although this was not formally included in Islamic law,&lt;ref name=UrfEI&gt;"Urf", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sharia]] recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of [[Muhammad]] but were not abrogated by the [[Qur'an]] or the tradition (this is called "Divine silence"). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says what the people, in general, consider good is also considered as such by [[Allah|God]]. Urf is the Islamic equivalent of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref name = Urf&gt;Hasan (2004), p. 169-71&lt;/ref&gt;

In the application of urf, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality; [[jurist]]s also tend, with caution, to give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars.&lt;ref name = Urf/&gt;

==Criminal law==
{{see also|Palestinian National Authority#Law, order, and lawlessness in Palestinian areas}}

For the most part, crimes and violent acts are considered [[criminal law|crimes of violence]] and fall under the purview of the [[criminal justice]] system. The Palestinian Authority operates under its own criminal law, such as its Penal Code. In addition, "the Palestinian Authority also imposes the death penalty pursuant to the PLO Revolutionary Penal Code, of 1979." The PNA utilizes both military and special, state security courts for most death penalty cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/English/Inter_Palestinian_Violations/Death_Penalty_in_the_PA.asp Death Penalty in the PA] B'Tselem&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
Civil law used the customary law in Palestine: "''Urf'' covered disputes such as contracts, family disputes, personal injury, and land matters."&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;

==Participatory justice==
Through the use of ''urf'', Palestinians use [[alternative dispute resolution]], specifically forms of participatory justice: "This system stressed conciliation, mediation, and family honour."&lt;ref name=Muhaisen /&gt;

==Palestinian Land Law==
{{main|Palestinian Land Law}}
The Palestinian Land Law is a law that prohibits Palestinians from selling land to citizens of Israel. The punishment for violators is the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Reid Weiner|title=Human rights of Christians in Palestinian society|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|page= 13|year=2005|isbn=965-218-048-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mcOfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Palestinian++death+penalty+selling+land&amp;dq=Palestinian++death+penalty+selling+land&amp;lr=&amp;ei=n7b7SfX0M4WKygSqrLWlBQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Parochial Libraries Act 1708''' (7 Ann c 14) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. It governed [[parish|parochial]] libraries established for ministers of the [[Church of England]]. 

This Act was partly in force in Great Britain at the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Chronological Table of the Statutes]], 1235 - 2010. [[The Stationery Office]]. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-11-840509-6}}. Part I. Page 80, read with pages viii and x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is one of the oldest pieces of legislation concerning [[libraries]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The preamble to the Act noted that throughout the country, many parish clergy were provided with stipends so small that they were not able to purchase books for their studies, and as a result many small charitable libraries for this purpose had been recently established.

In order to better protect these libraries from misuse or disposal, the Act stipulated that such establishments were to be maintained for the purpose for which they had been provided, and that the incumbent of the parish was to provide security, if so requested, "by bond or otherwise", to ensure this. The appropriate [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of the Church, or the supervising [[archdeacon]], was given authority to enquire into the condition of parochial libraries and appoint visitors to examine them, to ensure that they were maintained in a good condition. On the death of an incumbent, or his removal, the library was to be locked and secured until they were replaced, to prevent the loss of the books, excepting any routine use made of the room it was stored in.

Within six months of taking up the incumbency of a parish with a parochial library, or of the establishment of a new library, the incumbent was to produce a catalogue of all the books then in the library and deposit it with the bishopric; likewise, all parochial libraries in existence as of the time of the Act were to have such a catalogue produced and deposited by 29 September 1709. As a counterpart to these periodic records, a current register of any donated books or other donations was to be kept, recording the name of the benefactor and the details of the gift.

It was also provided that the ordinary (and, if still living, the original benefactor) were able to make regulations for the use and upkeep of the library, providing that they did not conflict with the original terms of the donation. No book was permitted to be sold or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the ordinary, and then only in cases where it was a duplicate of an existing work. If any book was taken from the library, the incumbent was permitted to bring a lawsuit for damages in the name of the ordinary, any such damages (rated at three times the cost of the book plus legal fees) being used for the maintenance of the library, or to apply to a [[Justice of the Peace]] for a warrant to find the book and immediately return it to the library.

The Act is prospectively repealed and replaced (except as to Wales) by the draft Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Care of Churches Measure[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201719/jtselect/jtecc/94/94.pdf], a Measure of the [[General Synod of the Church of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">'''Philippine energy law''' is the [[Philippines#Law|Philippines law]] concerning [[energy]], both [[fossil fuel]]s and [[renewable energy]].  [[Energy law]] in the [[Philippines]] is important because that nation is one of the fastest growing in Asia, and has over 80 million residents.  Researching Philippine law is somewhat complicated, because all laws are numbered sequentially, not by topic or year, and consists of [[statute]]s, Presidential decrees, other regulations, and [[case law]].  Nonetheless, private entities have organized the law into readily accessible formats.&lt;ref name="abernales"&gt;[http://www.abernales.com/enerlaw.htm Art Abernales' website Energy law page].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">In Switzerland, the '''place of origin''' ({{lang-de|Heimatort or Bürgerort}}, literally "home place" or "citizen place"; {{lang-fr|Lieu d'origine}}; {{lang-it|Luogo d'origine}}) denotes where the Swiss citizen has his municipal citizenship. It is not to be confused with the [[place of birth]] or the [[Domicile (law)|place of residence]], although two or all three of these locations can be identical depending on the person.

== Acquisition of the municipal citizenship ==
[[File:Switzerland Zollikofen 1918 Heimatschein front.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Front of a 1918 Zollikofen (Bern) ''Heimatschein'' municipal citizenship certificate.]]
[[Swiss citizenship]] has three tiers:
*Municipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, like sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into the local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality.
*[[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. It requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.
*Country citizenship, for which both of the above is a requirement, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland, and involves a criminal background check.
The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality while the municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen.

However, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show his or her connection to the place he currently lives in - and thus have several places of origins. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for a municipal citizenship for a mere 100 Swiss francs or so after having lived in the same town for just one year or two. Especially in the past, though, it has been normal to demand 2000 or 4000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee because of the former financial obligations involved for the municipality.

A child born to Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to mixed parents (Swiss father, foreign mother or vice versa) acquires the citizenship and thus the place of origin of the parent that is a Swiss citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4, Federal Law on the Acquisition and the Loss of Swiss Citizenship ("Bundesgesetz über Erwerb und Verlust des Schweizer Bürgerrechts")&lt;/ref&gt;

== International confusion ==
The [[Swiss identity card]], the [[Swiss passport|passport]] and the [[driving licence]] do not show the birthplace of the holder but the place of origin, while it is usual for non-Swiss identity papers or passports to show the birthplace. In some cases, the place of origin is identical with the birthplace, but not so in the large majority. This can be even more confusing by the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.

== Significance and history ==
A citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters - or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.

Until 2012, the law required that the place of origin carries, for two years after moving, all [[social welfare]] costs of a citizen who changes his domicile. This was changed in 2012, when the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] voted with 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the only payer of welfare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/kanton-aargau/aenderung-im-sozialhilfe-gesetz-heimatort-verliert-seine-bedeutung-125759414 |title=Änderung im Sozialhilfe-Gesetz: Heimatort verliert seine Bedeutung |last=Hartmann |first=Silvan |date=9 December 2012 |website=Aargauer Zeitung |access-date=1 March 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more and more cantons joined treaties that assured that the domicile has to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer persons lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).&lt;ref name="HLSfuersorge"&gt;[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]], entry [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D25809.php "Fürsorge"] (welfare)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1681, the [[Tagsatzung]] - the then-time Swiss parliament - decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were not appropriately cared for by their place of origin.&lt;ref name="HLSfuersorge" /&gt;

In the 19th century, Swiss authorities even offered free emigration to the [[United States of America|United States]] if the Swiss citizen consented to losing the place of origin, and thus his or her right to receive welfare.&lt;ref name="HLSfuersorge" /&gt;

{{Populism sidebar}}
'''Populism''' is a range of political approaches that deliberately appeal to "the people," often juxtaposing this group against a so-called "elite." There is no single definition of the term, which developed in the 19th century and has been used to mean various things since that time. Few politicians or political groups describe themselves as "populists", and in political discourse the term is often applied to others pejoratively. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, various different definitions of populism have been used, although some scholars propose rejecting the term altogether.

A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation_(creative_process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents "the people" as a morally good force against "the elite"{{fact|date=November 2018}}, who are perceived as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how "the people" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present "the elite" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, all of which are depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing the interests of other groups—such as foreign countries or immigrants—above the interests of "the people". According to this approach, populism is a thin-ideology which is combined with other, more substantial thick ideologies such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left–right political spectrum]] and there is both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].

Other scholars active in the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' in different ways. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the scholar [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant power structures. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse, the term has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.

The term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the Russian Empire it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. During the 20th century, various parties emerged in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] that were described as populist. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly popular, used in reference largely to left-wing groups in the Latin American [[pink tide]], right-wing groups in Europe, and both right and leftist groups in the U.S. In 2017 'populism' has been chosen as the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] [[Word of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/populism-revealed-as-2017-word-of-the-year-by-cambridge-university-press |title='Populism' revealed as 2017 Word of the Year by Cambridge University Press |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and common use==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Although frequently used by historians, social scientists, and political commentators, the term [''populism''] is exceptionally vague and refers in different contexts to a bewildering variety of phenomena.|source=Margaret Canovan on how the term ''populism'' was used, 1981{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=3}} }} 

The term ''populism'' is a vague and contested term that has been used in reference to a diverse variety of phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} The term originated as a term of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century,{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=5}} while in the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|pp=5–6}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=14}}

Although the term started out as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has since rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as "populists".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], "there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings."{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like [[socialism]], which have been widely used as a self-designation by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=5}}

More usually, the term is used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} In being applied in this way, the term "populism" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]] and generally presented as something to be "feared and discredited".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as "populists" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that "Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}

Canovan noted that "if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} The confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and [[Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser]] stated that "while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Similarly, Canovan noted that the term "does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas" and that it "provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that "although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=100}}
Although academic definitions of ''populism'' have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between "the people" and "the elite".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}}

==Ideational definition==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=A thin-centred ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic camps, "the pure people" versus "the corrupt elite," and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Mudde and Kaltwasser{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} }}

A common approach to defining populism is known as the ideational approach.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} In this definition, populism is applied to politicians and groups which make appeals to "the people" who they then contrast against "the elite".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell define populism as an ideology that "pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Albertazzi |first1=Daniele |last2=McDonnell |first2=Duncan |title=Twenty-First Century Populism |url=http://www.palgrave.com/resources/sample-chapters/9780230013490_sample.pdf |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |page=3 |year=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103230/http://www.palgrave.com/resources/sample-chapters/9780230013490_sample.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this understanding, note Mudde and Kaltwasser, "populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of "an antagonistic relationship" between "the people" and "the elite", and is "latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} This understanding conceives of populism as a discourse, ideology, or worldview.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}

In this approach, populism is viewed as a "thin ideology" or "thin-centred ideology" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the "thick-centred" or "full" ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[liberalism]], and [[socialism]], which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2pp=95, 99–100, 106|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=6}} According to Stanley, "the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=[Populism's] core consists of four distinct but interrelated concepts:
* The existence of two homogeneous units of analysis: 'the people' and 'the elite'.
* The antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite.
* The idea of popular sovereignty.
* The positive valorisation of 'the people' and denigration of 'the elite'.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Ben Stanley{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} }}

As a result of the various different ideologies which populism can be paired with, the forms that populism can take vary widely,{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} and populism itself cannot be positioned on the [[left–right political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=294|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=8}} The ideologies which populism can be paired with can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's [[Alberto Fujimori]] who promoted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with politicians like Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] who promoted socialist economics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=8–9}} Populist leaders thus "come in many different shades and sizes" but, according to Mudde and Kaltwasser, share one common element: "a carefully crafted image of the vox populi."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=20}} Stanley expressed the view that although there are "certain family resemblances" that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was "no coherent tradition" unifying all of them.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}

While many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the [[vanguard of the proletariat]], by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the "voice of the people" more widely.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=549–50}} On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with "the people" and "the nation" becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}}

Populism is, according to Mudde and Kaltwasser, "a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}}
Mudde noted that populism is "moralistic rather than programmatic".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into "friends and foes", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have "different priorities and values" but as being fundamentally "evil".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of "the elite", from which "the people" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}}

===The people===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Populists (claim to) speak in the name of the 'oppressed people', and they want to emancipate them by making them aware of their oppression. However, they do not want to change their values or their 'way of life.' This is fundamentally different from, for example, the (early) socialists, who want(ed) to 'uplift the workers' by re-educating them, thereby liberating them from their 'false consciousness'. For populists, on the other hand, the consciousness of the people, generally referred to as common sense, is the basis of all good (politics).|source=Political scientist Cas Mudde{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=546–47}} }}

In simplifying the complexities of reality, the concept of "the people" is vague and flexible,{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=9}} with this plasticity benefitting populists who are thus able to "expand or contract" the concept "to suit the chosen criteria of inclusion or exclusion" at any given time.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}} In employing the concept of "the people", populists can encourage a sense of shared identity among different groups within a society and facilitate their mobilisation toward a common cause.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=9}} One of the ways that populists employ the understanding of "the people" is in the idea that "the people are sovereign", that in a democratic state governmental decisions should rest with the population and that if they are ignored then they might mobilize or revolt.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} This is the sense of "the people" employed in the late 19th century United States by the People's Party and which has also been used by later populist movements in that country.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}}

A second way in which "the people" is conceived by populists combines a socioeconomic or class based category with one that refers to certain cultural traditions and popular values.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} The concept seeks to vindicate the dignity of a social group who regard themselves as being oppressed by a dominant "elite" who are accused of treating "the people's" values, judgements, and tastes with suspicion or contempt.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=10}} A third use of "the people" by populists employs it as a synonym for "the nation", whether that national community be conceived in either [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic]] or [[Civic nationalism|civic]] terms. In such a framework, all individuals regarded as being "native" to a particular state, either by birth or by ethnicity, could be considered part of "the people".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=11}}

Populism typically entails "celebrating them ''as'' the people", in Stanley's words.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}
The political scientist Paul Taggart proposed the term "the heartland" to better reflect what populists often mean in their rhetoric.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=545}} According to Taggart, "the heartland" was the place "in which, in the populist imagination, a virtuous and unified population resides".{{sfn|Taggart|2000|p=95}} Who this "heartland" is can vary between populists, even within the same country. For instance, in Britain, the centre-right [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conceived of "[[Middle England]]" as its heartland, while the far-right [[British National Party]] conceived of the "native British people" as its heartland.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}}
Mudde noted that for populists, "the people" "are neither real nor all-inclusive, but are in fact a mythical and constructed sub-set of the whole population".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}} They are an [[imagined community]], much like the imagined communities embraced and promoted by nationalists.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}}

Populism often entails presenting "the people" as the [[underdog]].{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}} Populists typically seek to reveal to "the people" how they are oppressed.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}} In doing so, they do not seek to change "the people", but rather seek to preserve the latter's "way of life" as it presently exists, regarding it as a source of good.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=546–47}} Although populist leaders often present themselves as representatives of "the people", they often come from elite strata in society; examples like Berlusconi, Fortuyn, and Haider were all well-connected to their country's political and economic elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=560}}

===The elite===

 | footer = Slovakia's [[Vladimír Mečiar]] and Venezuela's [[Hugo Chávez]] are examples of populists who were elected to office and then had to shift their concepts of "the elite" to account for their own newly elite status.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}}
}}

Anti-elitism is a characteristic feature of populism.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=295}} In populist discourse, the "fundamental distinguishing feature" of "the elite" is that it is in an "adversarial relationship" with "the people".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}
In defining "the elite", populists often condemn not only the political establishment, but also the economic elite, cultural elite, and the media elite, which they present as one homogenous, corrupt group.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=11–12}} When operating in liberal democracies, populists often condemn dominant political parties as part of "the elite" but at the same time do not reject the party political system altogether, instead either calling for or claiming to be a new kind of party different from the others.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=546}}

Although condemning almost all those in positions of power within a given society, populists often exclude both themselves and those sympathetic to their cause even when they too are in positions of power.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}} For instance, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), a right-wing populist group, regularly condemned "the media" in Austria for defending "the elite", but excluded from that the ''[[Kronen Zeitung]]'', a widely read [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] that supported the FPÖ and its leader [[Jörg Haider]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}}

When populists take governmental power, they are faced with a challenge in that they now represent a new elite. In such cases—like Chávez in Venezuela and [[Vladimír Mečiar]] in Slovakia—populists retain their anti-establishment rhetoric by making changes to their concept of "the elite" to suit their new circumstances, alleging that real power is not held by the government but other powerful forces who continue to undermine the populist government and the will of "the people" itself.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}} In these instances, populist governments often conceptualise "the elite" as those holding economic power.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In Venezuela, for example, Chávez blamed the economic elite for frustrating his reforms, while in Greece, the left-wing populist Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] accused "the lobbyists and oligarchs of Greece" of undermining his administration.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In populist instances like these, the claims made have some basis in reality, as business interests seek to undermine leftist-oriented economic reform.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}}

[[File:Evo Morales 2017.jpg|thumb|left|The Bolivian government of left-wing populist [[Evo Morales]] and his [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] has been described as the "prototypical case" of ethnopopulism.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} ]]

Although left-wing populists who combine populist ideas with forms of socialism most commonly present "the elite" in economic terms, the same strategy is also employed by some right-wing populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the United States during the late 2000s, the [[Tea Party movement]]—which presented itself as a defender of the capitalist [[free market]]—argued that big business, and its allies in [[United States Congress|Congress]], seeks to undermine the free market and kill competition by stifling small business.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Among some 21st century right-wing populists, "the elite" are presented as being political progressives committed to [[political correctness]].{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}} The Dutch right-wing populist leader [[Pim Fortuyn]] referred to this as the "Church of the Left".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}}

In some instances, particularly in Latin America, "the elites" are conceived not just in economic but also in ethnic terms, representing what political scientists have termed [[ethnopopulism]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=14, 72}} In Bolivia, for example, the left-wing populist leader [[Evo Morales]] juxtaposed the [[mestizo]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous]] "people" against an overwhelmingly [[White Bolivians|European]] "elite",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} declaring that "We Indians [i.e. indigenous people] are Latin America's moral reserve".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} In the Bolivian case, this was not accompanied by a racially exclusionary approach, but with an attempt to built a pan-ethnic coalition which included European Bolivians against the largely European Bolivian elite.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=72–73}} In areas like Europe where nation-states are more ethnically homogenous, this ethnopopulist approach is rare given that the "people" and "elite" are typically of the same ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}}

In various instances, populists claim that "the elite" is working against the interests of the country.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the [[European Union]] (EU), for instance, various populist groups allege that their national political elites put the interests of the EU itself over those of their own nation-states.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Similarly, in Latin America populists often charge political elites with championing the interests of the United States over those of their own countries.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=13–14}} Another common tactic among populists, particularly in Europe, is the accusation that "the elites" place the interests of immigrants above those of the native population.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} In instances where populists are also anti-Semitic, such as [[Jobbik]] in Hungary and [[Attack (political party)|Attack]] in Bulgaria, the elites are accused of favouring Israeli and wider Jewish interests above those of the national group, with some instances in which "the elite" is accused of being made up of many Jews as well.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, "the elite" can sometimes be presented as "ethnic traitors".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}

===The general will===

A third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or ''volonté générale''.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=16}}
An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Chávez's 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that "All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence. Because of that its judgement is pure, its will is strong, and none can corrupt or even threaten it."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=16–17}} For populists, the general will of "the people" is something that should take precedence over the preferences of "the elite".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}

As noted by Stanley, the populist idea of the general will is connected to ideas of majoritarianism and authenticity.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}} Highlighting how populists appeal to the ideals of "authenticity and ordinariness", he noted that what was most important to populists was "to appeal to the ''idea'' of an authentic people" and to cultivate the idea that they are the "genuine" representatives of "the people".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}} In doing so they often emphasise their physical proximity to "the people" and their distance from "the elites".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}

In emphasising the general will, many populists share the critique of representative democratic government previously espoused by the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=16–17}} This approach regards representative governance as an aristocratic and elitist system in which a country's citizens are regarded as passive entities. Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilized for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referenda]] and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Kaltwasser suggested that "it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that "support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism."{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}
Populist notions of the "general will" are usually based on the idea of "[[common sense]]".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=18}}

===Populism versus elitism and pluralism===

[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]

Stanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to "the people" had become "an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice", with elections and referenda predicated on the notion that "the people" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a "non-populism" in the form of both [[elitism]] and [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=543|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7}}

Elitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view "the people" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and "the elites" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=543–44|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7}} Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some—like Spain's [[Francisco Franco]] and Chile's [[Augusto Pinochet]]—reject democracy altogether, while others—like Spain's [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and Austria's [[Joseph Schumpeter]]—support a limited model of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=7}}

Pluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests. In this context, [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] is seen not as a weakness but a strength.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7}} Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group—whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership etc—and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=7–8}} Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}

==Other definitions==

The popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilization of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] in the US.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}}

[[File:Presentación del Documental CATASTROIKA y Presentación de la Revista Debates y Combates (7215329954).jpg|thumb|left|The Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] developed his own definition of populism. He regarded it as a positive force for emancipatory change in society]]

The Laclauan definition of populism, so called after the Argentinian political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] who developed it, uses the term in reference to what proponents regard as an emancipatory force that is the essence of politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} In this concept of populism, it is believed to mobilise excluded sectors of society against dominant elites and changing the status quo.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Laclau's initial emphasis was on class antagonisms arising between different classes, although he later altered his perspective to claim that populist discourses could arise from any part of the socio-institutional structure".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}}
This definition is popular among critics of [[liberal democracy]] and is widely used in critical studies and in studies of West European and Latin American politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}}

The socioeconomic definition of populism applies the term to what it regards as an irresponsible form of economic policy by which a government engages in a period of massive public spending financed by foreign loans, after which the country falls into [[hyperinflation]] and harsh economic adjustments are then imposed.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=3–4}} This use of the term was used by economists like [[Rudiger Dornbusch]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and was particularly popular among scholars of Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Since that time, this definition continued to be used by some economists and journalists, particularly in the US, but was uncommon among other [[social sciences]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}}

An additional approach applies the term ''populism'' to a political strategy in which a charismatic leader seeks to govern based on direct and unmediated connection with their followers.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} This is a definition of the term that is popular among scholars of non-Western societies.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} Mudde suggested that although the idea of a leader having direct access to "the people" was a common element among populists, it is best regarded as a feature which facilitates rather than defines populism.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=545}}

In popular discourse, ''populism'' is sometimes used in a negative sense in reference to politics which involves promoting extremely simple solutions to complex problems in a highly emotional manner.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde suggested that this definition "seems to have instinctive value" but was difficult to employ empirically because almost all political groups engage in sloganeering and because it can be difficult to differentiate an argument made emotionally from one made rationally.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde thought that this phenomenon was better termed ''[[demagogy]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} Another use of the term in popular discourse is to describe opportunistic policies designed to quickly please voters rather than deciding a more rational course of action.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Examples of this would include a governing political party lowering taxes before an election or promising to provide things to the electorate which the state cannot afford to pay for.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=542–43}} Mudde suggested that this phenomenon is better described as ''[[political opportunism|opportunism]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}}

Some scholars argue that populist organizing for empowerment represents the return of older "Aristotelian" politics of horizontal interactions among equals who are different, for the sake of public problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Harry C.

==Populist mobilization==

There are three forms of political mobilization which populists have adopted: that of the populist leader, the populist political party, and the populist social movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=42–43}} The reasons why voters are attracted to populists differ, but common catalysts for the rise of populists include dramatic economic decline or a systematic corruption scandal that damages established political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} For instance, the [[Great Recession]] of 2007 and its impact on the economies of southern Europe was a catalyst for the rise of [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' corruption scandal of the early 1990s played a significant part in the rise of the Italian populist [[Silvio Berlusconi]]{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} and Brazil's [[Operation Car Wash]] advantaged [[Jair Bolsonaro]]'s rise to power in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmjornal.pt/mundo/detalhe/juiz-da-lava-jato-vai-ser-superministro-no-governo-de-bolsonaro Juiz da Lava Jato vai ser ‘superministro’ no governo de Bolsonaro]&lt;/ref&gt; Another catalyst for the growth of populism is a widespread perception among voters that the political system is unresponsive to them.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=101}} This can arise when elected governments introduce policies that are unpopular with their voters but which are implemented because they are considered to be "responsible" or imposed by supra-national organisations; in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure form the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many countries in the [[European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic austerity measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101–102}}

===The populist leader===

The populist leader is, according to Mudde and Kaltwasser "the quintessential form of populist mobilization".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with "the people",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of "the people" themselves,{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or "voice of the people".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=62}} The overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Perón]] was the wife of Juan Perón, Marine Le Pen the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}

Populist leaders often present themselves as men of action rather than men of words, talking of the need for "bold action" and "common sense solutions" to issues which they call "crises".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} Male populist leaders often express themselves using simple and sometimes vulgar language in an attempt to present themselves as "the common man" or "one of the boys" to add to their populist appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=64, 66}} An example of this is [[Umberto Bossi]], the leader of the right-wing populist Italian [[Lega Nord]], who at rallies would state "the League has a hard-on" while [[The finger|putting his middle-finger]] up as a sign of disrespect to the government in Rome.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=66}} Another recurring feature of male populist leaders is the emphasis that they place on their own virility.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} An example of this is the Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who bragged about his [[bunga bunga]] sex parties and his ability to seduce young women.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=64}} Among female populist leaders, it is more common for them to emphasise their role as a wife and mother.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}} The US right-wing populist [[Sarah Palin]] for instance referred to herself as a "hockey mom" and a "mama grizzly",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}} while Australian right-wing populist [[Pauline Hanson]] stated that "I care so passionately about this country, it's like I'm its mother. Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}}

Populist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the "elite". Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant "old boys' club",{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=69–70}} while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=72–73}} In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as [[Ross Perot]], Thaksin Shinawatra, or Silvio Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=70–71}}
Mudde and Kaltwasser noted that "in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=73–74}}
Mudde and Kaltwasser suggested that "true outsiders" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Chávez and Peru's Fujimori.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=74–75}} More common is that they are "insider-outsiders", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=75}} The Dutch right-wing populist [[Geert Wilders]] had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist [[Party for Freedom]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}
Only a few populist leaders are "insiders", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75–76}} One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party;{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75–76}} another is [[Rafael Correa]], who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}

Populist leaders are sometimes also characterised as [[strongman (politics)|strongmen]] or—in Latin American countries—as [[caudillo]]s.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} In a number of cases, such as Argentina's Perón or Venezuela's Chávez, these leaders have military backgrounds which contribute to their strongman image.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}
Other populist leaders have also evoked the strongman image without having a military background; these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Mečiar, and Thailand's [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}
Populism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Kaltwasser, "only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} Rather than being populists, many strongmen—such as Spain's Francisco Franco—were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}

In most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=43–44}} These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like [[Fortuynism]] in the Netherlands, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, [[Berlusconism]] in Italy and [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Populist mobilization is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=42}} Mudde and Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}} Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}}

===Populist political parties===

A second form of mobilization is through the form of the populist political party.
Populists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of "the people", in power.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}}
In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones; the elitist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a Marxist-Leninist group which governed [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=54–55}} In other instances, such as the Austrian FPÖ and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=55}} In some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's [[Justicialist Party]] after Juan Perón's death in 1974, or the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] after Chávez's death in 2013.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when [[Marine Le Pen]] replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=55–56}}

Many populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}

===Populist social movements===

[[File:Occupy Wall Street sign in Queens, NYC.jpg|thumb|right|The Occupy movement is an example of a populist social movement]]

The third form is that of the populist social movement. Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with "the people" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the Occupy movement, which originated in the US and used the slogan "We are the 99%", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: "real democracy now – we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}

Few populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] ("Common Man Party").{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=56–57}}

==Populism and other themes==

Canovan proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of "agrarian populism"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} The other four were forms of "political populism", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} She noted that these were "analytical constructs" and that "real-life examples may well overlap several categories",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}}

===Democracy and populism===

There have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only "true" form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}}

Mudde and Kaltwasser argued that "populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} It undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejection notions of pluralism and the idea that anything should constrain the "general will" of "the people".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In practice, populists operating in liberal democracies often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} The Italian populist Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by popular governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances—such as Orban in Hungary—the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}

At the same time, populism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilization of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=83, 84}} When some populists have taken power—most notable Chávez in Venezuela—they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referenda.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93–94}}

Even when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}

===Mainstream responses to populism===
Mudde and Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who "claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented "them" as "evil" or "foolish", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, "the best way to deal with populism is to engage—as difficult as it is—in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters" in order to "better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them."{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}

====United States====
Mainstream politicians have sometimes sought to co-operate or build alliances with populists. In the United States, for example, various Republican Party figures aligned themselves with the Tea Party movement, while in countries like Finland and Austria populist parties have taken part in governing coalitions.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}}

====Europe====
A more common approach has been for mainstream parties to openly attack the populists and construct a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' to prevent them from gaining political office {{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}} While mainstream parties may continue to hold their ideological positions, evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that mainstream politicians may adopt a populist political style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=2017-06-28|title=Fighting fire with fire: Mainstream adoption of the populist political style in the 2014 Europe debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=715–734|doi=10.1177/1369148117715646|issn=1369-1481|url=https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/fighting-fire-with-fire(3bd11a1b-816b-4442-8b26-e133dab177e0).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2018, [[Hillary Clinton]] recommended mainstream politicians should restrict immigration into Europe. Doing so, she believed, would starve populist politicians of electoral support from voters concerned over large-scale immigration: "I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message - 'we are not goind to be able to continue to provide refuge and support' - because if we don't deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wintour|first= Patrick|date= 22 November 2018|title= Hillary Clinton: Europe Must Curb Immigration to Stop Rightwing Populists|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit|work= The Guardian|location= |access-date= 25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Tony Blair]] said centrist politicians had to accept that immigration is a key issue for voters and is driving populist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Wintour|first= Patrick|date= 22 November 2018|title= Clinton, Blair, Renzi: Why we Lost, How to Fight Back|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/clinton-blair-renzi-why-we-lost-populists-how-fight-back-rightwing-populism-centrist|work= The Guardian|access-date= 28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once populists are in political office in liberal democracies, the judiciary can play a key role in blocking some of their more illiberal policies, as has been the case in Slovakia and Poland.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}} The mainstream media can play an important role in blocking populist growth; in a country like Germany, the mainstream media is for instant resolutely anti-populist, opposing populist groups whether left or right.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}}
Mudde and Kaltwasser noted that there was an "odd love-hate relationship between populist media and politicians, sharing a discourse but not a struggle".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=115}} In certain countries, certain mainstream media outlets have supported populist groups; in Austria, the ''Kronen Zeitung'' played a prominent role in endorsing Haider, in the United Kingdom the ''[[Daily Express]]'' supported the [[UK Independence Party]], while in the United States, [[Fox News]] gave much positive coverage and encouragement to the Tea Party movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=114}}

====South America====
In some cases, when the populists have taken power, their political rivals have sought to violently overthrow them; this was seen in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], when mainstream groups worked with sectors of the military to unseat Hugo Chávez's government.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=113}}

===Authoritarianism and populism===
Scholars have argued that populist elements have sometimes appeared in [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Ferkiss 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz and Shanks–Meile 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlet and Lyons, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter | last=Fritzsche |title=Rehearsals for fascism: populism and political mobilization in Weimar Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf5nAAAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195057805 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006022046/https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf5nAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=6 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Catherine | last=Fieschi |title=Fascism, Populism and the French Fifth Republic: In the Shadow of Democracy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWOyLUZfRT0C |year=2004 |publisher=Manchester UP |isbn=9780719062094 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084111/https://books.google.com/books?id=yWOyLUZfRT0C |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gino | last=Germani |title=Authoritarianism, Fascism, and National Populism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6CMlIY0e0C |year=1978 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=9781412817714 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084111/https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6CMlIY0e0C |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracist [[scapegoating]] employed by various populist movements can create "a seedbed for [[fascism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rupert 1997: 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazism|National Socialist]] populism interacted with and facilitated fascism in interwar Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, distressed middle-class populists mobilized their anger against the government and big business during the pre-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period. The Nazis "parasitized the forms and themes of the populists and moved their constituencies far to the right through ideological appeals involving [[demagoguery]], scapegoating, and conspiracism".&lt;ref&gt;Berlet 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fritzsche:&lt;ref name="Fritzsche 1990: 233-235"&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 233–35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Nazis expressed the populist yearnings of middle–class constituents and at the same time advocated a strong and resolutely anti-Marxist mobilization...Against "unnaturally" divisive parties and querulous organized interest groups, National Socialists cast themselves as representatives of the commonwealth, of an allegedly betrayed and neglected German public...Breaking social barriers of status and caste, and celebrating at least rhetorically the populist ideal of the people's community...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century, the [[pink tide]] spreading over Latin America was "prone to populism and authoritarianism".&lt;ref name="ISBESTER"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isbester |first1=Katherine |title=The Paradox of Democracy in Latin America: Ten Country Studies of Division and Resilience |date=2011 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |isbn=9781442601802 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Levitsky and James Loxton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Loxton |first2=James |title=Populism and Competitive Authoritarianism in the Latin America |date=30 August 2012 |publisher=[[American Political Science Association]] |location=New Orleans}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Raúl Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Madrid |first1=Raúl |title=The Rise of Ethnic Politics in Latin America |date=June 2012 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521153256 |pages=178–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] and his regional allies used populism to achieve their dominance and later established authoritarian regimes when they were empowered. Such actions, Weyland argues, proves that "Populism, understood as a strategy for winning and exerting state power, inherently stands in tension with democracy and the value that it places upon pluralism, open debate, and fair competition".&lt;ref name="JODweyland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weyland |first1=Kurt |last2=de la Torre |first2=Carlos |last3=Kornblith |first3=Miriam |title=Latin America's Authoritarian Drift |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=July 2013 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=18–32 |doi=10.1353/jod.2013.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localism and populism===

Jane Wills, a Professor of Human Geography in the University of Exeter, argued that the increasing numbers of populist politicians are endorsing localism as the framework for public policy.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189"&gt;Wills, Jane. "Populism, localism and the geography of democracy." ''Geoforum'', Volume 62 (June 2015), pp. 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; She defined that populism is the form of politics that involves actions to speak for the people in a register that is more authentic to the experiences and needs of those people.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; In other words, most likely that Populist Party policies would contradict with parties supporting the elites.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; She also used anti-politics to describe populist or localist politician because they stood against mainstream politics.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt; She used the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) as an example where UKIP adopted localism into frame working their policies. Mainstream politicians from Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat threatened by the rise of UKIP and their adoption on localism policy, in which they increasingly exposed from the emotional connection to the people.&lt;ref name="Wills 2015 p188-189" /&gt;

==History==

Scholars who have studied populism agree that it is a modern phenomenon.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=21}} Its origins are often traced to the late nineteenth century, when movements termed populist arose in both the [[Russian Empire]] and the United States.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=21}} In this, populism has been linked to the spread of [[democracy]], both as an idea and as a framework for governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=21}}

=== North America ===

{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|header=|header_align=left/right/center|header_background=|footer=The [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties|footer_align=left/right/center|footer_background=|width=|image1=Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|width1=250|caption1=|image2=Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=250|caption2=}}

In North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilization and weak organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with [[agrarianism]] and often known as "prairie populism".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} For these groups, "the people" were yeomen—small, independent farmers of European descent—while the "elite" were the bankers and politicians of the northeast.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}}

The [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] of the late 19th century United States is considered to be "one of the defining populist movements";{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} its members were often referred to as the "Populists" at the time.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referenda.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=17}} The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge. In the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]], the People's Party supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]; after his defeat, the People's Party's support declined.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1pp=17–18, 44–46|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=23}}
Other early populist political parties in the United States included the [[United States Greenback Party|Greenback Party]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party of 1912]] led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party of 1924]] led by [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and the [[Share Our Wealth]] movement of [[Huey Long]] in 1933–1935.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Rosenstone, ''Third parties in America'' (Princeton University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald P. Formisano, ''For the People: American Populist Movements from the Revolution to the 1850s'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, populist groups adhering to a [[social credit]] ideology had various successes at local and regional elections from the 1930s to the 1960s, although the main [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] never became a dominant national force.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=23–24}}

By the mid-20th century, US populism had moved from a largely [[progressivism|progressive]] to a largely [[reactionary]] stance, being closely intertwined with the [[anti-communist]] politics of the period.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=24}} In this period, the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] and sociologist [[Daniel Bell]] compared the anti-elitism of the 1890s Populists with that of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref name="mkazin1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kazin |first1=Michael |title=How Can Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Both Be 'Populist'? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |accessdate=13 July 2016 |website=The New York Times |date=22 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209061534/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |archivedate=9 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all academics accepted the comparison between the left-wing, anti-[[big business]] Populists and the right-wing, anti-communist McCarthyites, the term "populist" nonetheless came to be applied to both left-wing and right-wing groups that blamed elites for the problems facing the country.&lt;ref name="mkazin1"/&gt; Some mainstream politicians in the Republican Party recognised the utility of such a tactic and adopted it; Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] for instance popularised the term "[[silent majority]]" when appealing to voters.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=24}} Right-wing populist rhetoric was also at the base of two of the most successful third-party presidential campaigns in the late 20th century, that of [[George C. Wallace]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and [[Ross Perot]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=25}} These politicians presented a consisted message that a "liberal elite" was threatening "our way of life" and using the welfare state to placate the poor and thus maintain their own power.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=25}}

In the first decade of the 21st century, two populist movements appeared in the US, both in response to the [[Great Recession]]: the [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Tea Party movement]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=26}} The populist approach of the Occupy movement was broader, with its "people" being what it called "[[We are the 99%|the 99%]]", while the "elite" it challenged was presented as both the economic and political elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26–27}} The Tea Party's populism was [[producerist|Producerism]], and thus implicitly racialized, while "the elite" it presented was more party partisan than that of Occupy, being defined largely—although not exclusively—as the Democratic administration of President [[Barack Obama]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26–27}}
The [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kazin |first1=Michael |title=How Can Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Both Be 'Populist'? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |accessdate=25 May 2016 |date=22 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209061534/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/how-can-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-both-be-populist.html |archivedate=9 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both campaigns criticized free trade deals such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Litvan |first1=Laura |title=Trump and Sanders Shift Mood in Congress Against Trade Deals |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-17/trump-and-sanders-shift-mood-in-congress-against-trade-deals |accessdate=25 May 2016 |agency=Bloomberg |date=17 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521215110/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-17/trump-and-sanders-shift-mood-in-congress-against-trade-deals |archivedate=21 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brodwin |first1=David |title=Nobody Wins a Trade War |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-14/the-economic-danger-of-trumps-and-sanders-trade-proctectionism |accessdate=25 May 2016 |website=U.S. News &amp; World Report |date=14 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513050239/http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-14/the-economic-danger-of-trumps-and-sanders-trade-proctectionism |archivedate=13 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fontaine |first1=Richard |last2=Kaplan |first2=Robert D. |title=How Populism Will Change Foreign Policy |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-05-23/how-populism-will-change-foreign-policy |accessdate=25 May 2016 |website=Foreign Affairs |date=23 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524105923/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-05-23/how-populism-will-change-foreign-policy |archivedate=24 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's electoral victory coincided with a similar trend of populism in Europe in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hewitt |first1=Gavin |title=Widespread revolt against the political centre |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-36357617 |accessdate=25 May 2016 |publisher=BBC News |date=24 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524131559/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36357617 |archivedate=24 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern antecedents===

Populism has been identified with aspects of the [[Protestant Reformation]] by  German historian Peter Blickle, who stresses the tradition of populist, corporative, anti-feudal politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Andrew Pettegree |title= The Reformation: Critical Concepts in Historical Studies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HDC_veJaoQ8C&amp;pg=PA153 |year=2004 |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |page=153 |isbn= 978-0-4153-1668-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carter Lindberg|title=The European Reformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cTb-zKfjS8C&amp;pg=PA21|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=21|isbn=9781444360868}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant groups like the [[Anabaptists]] formed ideas about ideal [[theocratic]] societies, in which peasants would be able to read the Bible themselves. Attempts to establish these societies were made during the [[German Peasants' War]] (1524–1525) and the [[Münster Rebellion]] (1534–1535). The peasant movement ultimately failed as cities and nobles made their own peace with the princely armies, which restored the old order.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Scott, ''The Early Reformation in Germany: Between Secular Impact and Radical Vision.'' Ashgate, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Populist elements appeared in the English Civil War of the mid-17th century, especially among the [[Levellers]].  The movement was committed to popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. The hallmark of Leveller thought was its populism, as shown by its emphasis on equal natural rights, and their practice of reaching the public through pamphlets, petitions, and vocal appeals to the crowd. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Foxley|title=The Levellers: Radical Political Thought in the English Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9ySDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=207|isbn=9780719089367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]

In the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the ''[[narodnichestvo]]'' movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}} The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} This agrarian populism was quite similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting the peasantry as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}

In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}

In the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33–34}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralization and politicization of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Kaltwasser, that populism became "a relevant political force in Europe", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}

Following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of "the people" against the "elite", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan "Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a "real" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}

[[File:Jean Marie LePen.jpg|thumb|left|Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and leader of the French National Front, the "prototypical radical right party" which used populism to advance its cause.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=34–35}}]]

At the turn of the 21st century, populist rhetoric became increasingly apparent in Western Europe, where it was often employed by opposition parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} For example, in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|the 2001 electoral campaign]], the Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] accused [[Tony Blair]]'s governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of representing "the condescending liberal elite". Hague repeatedly referring to it as "metropolitan", implying that it was out of touch with "the people", who in Conservative discourse are represented by "Middle England".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}}

By the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like Jörg Haider's FPÖ in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the [[Syriza]] party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed Eurosceptic sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}

[[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (1778–1852), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Religious minister|Minister]], a professor at the [[University of Berlin]] and the "father of [[gymnastics]]", introduced the concept of [[Volkstum]], a racial notion which draws on the essence of a people that was lost during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Adam Mueller]] went a step further by positing the belief that the state was a larger totality than the government institutions. This paternalistic vision of [[aristocracy]] concerned with social orders had a dark side in that the opposite force of modernity was represented by the [[Jews]], who were said to be eating away at the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZNVO4uOJCYQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT402&amp;lpg=RA1-PT402&amp;dq=%22Adam+M%C3%BCller+Juden%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |publisher= |isbn=9783110133790 |last1=Schmitz-Berning |first1=Cornelia |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Populism also played a role in mobilizing middle class support for the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 149–50, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, distressed middle–class populists mobilized their anger against the government and big business during the pre-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] Weimar period. According to Fritzsche: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Nazis expressed the populist yearnings of middle–class constituents and at the same time advocated a strong and resolutely anti-Marxist mobilization... Against "unnaturally" divisive parties and querulous organized interest groups, [[National Socialists]] cast themselves as representatives of the commonwealth, of an allegedly betrayed and neglected German public...[b]reaking social barriers of status and [[caste]], and celebrating at least rhetorically the populist ideal of the people's community...&lt;ref name="Fritzsche 1990: 233-235"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The party is considered populist, [[ecologist]], and partially [[Eurosceptic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-I0k_cJgsIQjWNqMJDWNaHIcdMA?docId=CNG.d6da68039416eecb0c88f76427f9bc45.ab1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218224533/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-I0k_cJgsIQjWNqMJDWNaHIcdMA?docId=CNG.d6da68039416eecb0c88f76427f9bc45.ab1|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grillo himself described the Five Star Movement as being populist in nature during a political meeting he held in Rome on 30 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"We appeal to the instincts of people.

=== Latin America ===
{{Main|Populism in Latin America}}

Mudde and Kaltwasser noted that Latin America has the world's "most enduring and prevalent populist tradition".{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27–28}}

The first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising "the people": these included [[Getúlio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Perón]] in Argentina, and [[José María Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=28–29}} These relied on the ''[[Americanismo]]'' ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from [[imperialism|imperialist]] powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}}

The second wave took place in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), stabilizing the economy and ending hyperinflation.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=29–30}} Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}}

The third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist program that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty "back to the people", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}}

=== Oceania ===
During the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=38}}

Those parties—[[New Zealand First]] and [[United Future]]—benefited greatly in 2002 from running almost textbook populist advertising campaigns, which helped both parties increase their proportion of the [[party vote]] to levels unanticipated at the commencement of the election campaign.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt; The [[New Zealand National Party]] made limited attempts at articulating populism in its advertising, but suffered from the legacy of being part of the 1990s establishment.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt;

In preparation for the 2005 election, then-leader of the National Party [[Don Brash]] delivered the [[Orewa Speech]] in 2004 on allegations of Māori privilege. This speech has been labelled populist due to the polling beforehand which had revealed to the National Party that the topic of race relations was sensitive enough to sway voters, and its perceived intent to exploit long-held grievances in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Jon|date=2 May 2017|title=Orewa and the Rhetoric of Illusion|journal=Political Science|volume=56:2|issue=2|pages=111–29|doi=10.1177/003231870405600212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success in the polls granted to the National Party by this speech led to the delivery of a speech dubbed "Orewa 2" the next year, this time on welfare dependency.

===Africa and Asia===

In much of Africa, populism has been a rare phenomenon.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}}
In North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Turkey's [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=39–40}} Although the [[Arab Spring]] was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=40}}

In southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38–39}}

===Late 20th and early 21st century growth===

Mudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103–104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the "[[high culture]]" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}

Mudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, "More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better."{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}

Another factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555–56}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}

Pippa Norris examined two widely held views on the causes of populism growth. The first was the	''economic insecurity perspective'' where it is based on the consequences of the transformation of the workforce in post-industrial economies. The other theory was the ''cultural backlash thesis'' according to which the rise of populism is a reaction to the previous predominant progressive values. According to Norris, the latter seems more convincing.{{sfn | Inglehart | Norris | 2016 | p=1 &amp; 29-30}}

The '''Razing of Friesoythe''' took place on 14{{nbsp}}April 1945 during the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Western Allies' invasion of Germany]] towards the end of World War II. In early April, the [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]], advancing into north-west Germany, attacked the German town of [[Friesoythe]]. The [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]] captured the town. During the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier and it was rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian.

Under this mistaken belief the division's commander, [[Major General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. The rubble was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier the division had destroyed the centre of [[Sögel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable.

Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years afterwards, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had "no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe". There has been no investigation by Canadian authorities of the event.

==Context==

In early April 1945 the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, part of [[II Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands as the Western Allies launched their invasion of Germany in the wake of the crossing of the Rhine in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history described the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognised that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&amp;nbsp;April, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, part of the 4th{{nbsp}}Canadian (Armoured) Division, made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}

===Battle for Sögel===

The division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to Sögel, which the [[Lake Superior Regiment|Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]] captured on 9{{nbsp}}April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Major General [[Christopher Vokes]], the [[division (military)|divisional]] commander, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/christopher-vokes/|title=Christopher Vokes|last=Morton|first=Desmond|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113111850/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/christopher-vokes/|archive-date=13 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished with several truck-loads of dynamite. Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as "The Sod of Sögel".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}

{{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, a number of houses in the centre of Sögel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.|The Victory Campaign, C. P. Stacey (1960){{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}

==Battle for Friesoythe==

The Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching a strategic crossroads on the outskirts of Friesoythe on 13&amp;nbsp;April. As it was early spring the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the river [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would not be able to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11–12&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11{{nbsp}}April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&amp;nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&amp;nbsp;April and 12&amp;nbsp;April. It was clearly a German and not a Canadian initiative.{{Harv|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{Harv|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&amp;nbsp;Parachute Division]] and a number of anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}&lt;ref&gt;War Diary, General Staff, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, 1 April 1945 – 30 April 1945. Appendix 38; dated April 14th, 1945. Library and Archives Canada, RG 24, vol. no. 13794. Intelligence report signed: E. Sirluck, Capt.&lt;/ref&gt; The paratroopers repelled the first attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered a number of killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/one-more-river-to-cross-the-canadians-in-holland-feature/|title=One More River to Cross: The Canadians in Holland|last=Marsh|first=James H.|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329212709/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/one-more-river-to-cross-the-canadians-in-holland-feature/|archive-date=29 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick E. Wigle). The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn attack on 14&amp;nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. During the attack, a small number of German soldiers caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}&lt;ref&gt;War Diary, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, April 14, 1945, pp. 10–11. Ottawa, ON, Canada. National Archives of Canada, RG 24, v. 15,005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}

===Destruction of Friesoythe===
Vokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death and wrote in his autobiography "A first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back". Vokes wrote "I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194–5}}

The Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their colonel.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435–7}} After Vokes issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with flamethrowers mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. Other soldiers fanned out down side streets, throwing phosphorus grenades or improvised [[Molotov cocktail]]s made from petrol containers into buildings. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoy was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, "the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade records, "when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}

See [[Research exemption]].

Bolar was a generic drug manufacturer. Roche was a brand-name pharmaceutical company which made and sold Dalmane, the active ingredient of which was protected by patent.

Before patent expiration, Bolar used the patented chemical in experiments to determine if its generic product was bioequivalent to Dalmane in order to obtain FDA approval for its generic version of Dalmane. Bolar argued that its use of the patented product was not infringement under the experimental use exception to the patent law.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Bolar’s contention holding that the experimental use exception did not apply because Bolar intended to sell its generic product in competition with Roche’s Dalmane after patent expiration and, therefore, Bolar’s experiments had a business purpose.

Bolar also argued that public policy in favor of availability of generic drugs immediately following patent expiration justified the experimental use of the patented chemical because denying such use would extend Roche’s monopoly beyond the date of patent expiration. The court rejected this argument, stating that such policy decisions should be made by Congress. Likewise, the court decided that apparent policy conflicts between statutes such as the Food and Drug Act and the Patent Act should be decided by Congress and not the courts. 

Shortly after ''Roche v. Bolar'' was decided, Congress did pass a law permitting use of patented products in experiments for the purpose of obtaining FDA approval (section 271-e-1 of the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]], informally known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act" [Public Law 98-417], which established the modern system for FDA approval of generic drugs.)

[[File:Solar Decathlon 09 aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Student-built houses powered exclusively by solar power on display in [[Washington D.C.]] at the Solar Decathlon 2009.]]
The U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) '''Solar Decathlon'''  is a collegiate competition, comprising 10 contests, that challenges student teams to design and build highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by renewable energy. The winners will be those teams that best blend design architectural and engineering excellence with innovation, market potential, building efficiency, and smart energy production. In the summer of 2018, DOE merged its two student building design competitions into one Solar Decathlon competition.

The combined competition features two tracks, the Design Challenge and the Build Challenge. The Solar Decathlon provides a hands-on experience and unique training that prepares the competing students to enter the clean energy workforce. This international competition has been a driving force in raising awareness about clean energy since its inception in 2002. Technologies and solutions used in Solar Decathlon homes have advanced the residential building industry both in the United States and abroad.

After the first Solar Decathlon was held in 2002, the competition occurred biennially in 2005, 2007, 2009,  2011,  2013, 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solardecathlon.gov/past.html|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Solar Decathlon|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Decathlon 2017 was located in Denver, Colorado, adjacent to the 61st &amp; Peña station on the University of Colorado A line commuter train connecting Denver International Airport to downtown Union Station. In addition to the competition, Solar Decathlon 2017 also featured a sustainability expo, professional development and consumer workshops, and middle-school education events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.solardecathlon.gov/2017/visit.html|title=Plan Your Visit|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Solar Decathlon|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open to the public and free of charge, the Solar Decathlon allows visitors to tour energy- and water-efficient houses, and gather ideas to save energy and conserve water in their own homes.

The Solar Decathlon 2017 competition was presented by DOE and administered by Energetics, Incorporated, a subsidiary of [[VSE Corporation]]. Previous competitions were administered by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).

Since the first competition in 2002, the Solar Decathlon has expanded internationally to include competitions in Europe, China, Latin America and Caribbean, the Middle East, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.solardecathlon.gov/international.html|title=International|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Solar Decathlon|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] was established under a 2007 memorandum of understanding between the United States and [[Spain]] , which hosted competitions in 2010 and 2012.

The sixth Solar Decathlon took place on October 3–13, 2013, in [[Orange County Great Park]] in [[Irvine, California]] – it was the first Solar Decathlon to take place outside Washington D.C., and was won by [[Vienna University of Technology]] (Team Austria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solardecathlon.gov/about.html|title=About Solar Decathlon|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DzuzdbGF?url=http://www.solardecathlon.gov/about.html|archivedate=January 28, 2013|work=[[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] Solar Decathlon|accessdate=January 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solardecathlon.gov/past/2013/|title=Highlights from Solar Decathlon 2013|publisher=Solar Decathlon|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The seventh Solar Decathlon was held October 8 – 18, 2015, also at the [[Orange County Great Park]]. Stevens Institute of Technology was the overall winner. This was their third Solar Decathlon competition.

The eighth Solar Decathlon in the U.S. was held October 5–15, 2017, in Denver, Colorado, at the 61st &amp; Peña Station on the University of Colorado A line commuter rail connecting Denver International Airport to downtown Union Station. Eleven teams competed to design, build, and operate the most cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive solar-powered house. The Swiss Team won the overall competition with their entry, NeighborHub. It was the first entry for this combined team of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, School of Engineering and Architecture Fribourg, Geneva University of Art and Design, and the University of Fribourg.

===Awards===
In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] awarded the Solar Decathlon an [[Honor Award]] for its emphasis on "renewable energy, energy-efficient, and environmentally responsible systems" and its role in "educating a new generation of built-environment professionals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/honor-award/2010-honor-award.html|title=2010 Honor Award: A Salute to Civic Innovators|year=2010|publisher=[[National Building Museum]]|accessdate=March 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329052704/http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/honor-award/2010-honor-award.html|archivedate=March 29, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of contests==
Like the Olympic decathlon, the DOE Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests. The contests evaluate cost-effective design; innovation balanced with market potential; water and energy efficiency; energy production and time-of-use energy; and communications strategies. Each Solar Decathlon contest is worth a  maximum of 100 points, for a potential competition total of 1,000 points. Teams earn points through task completion, performance monitoring, and jury evaluation. The contests may change after each competition in response to participant feedback, market dynamics, and DOE goals.  

The contests for the 2019-2020 event:
* Energy Performance
* Engineering
* Financial Feasibility and Affordability
* Resilience
* Architecture
* Operations
* Market Potential
* Comfort and Environmental Quality
* Innovation
* Presentation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78607">Over the past two decades, '''state-building''' has developed into becoming an integral part and even a specific approach to [[peacebuilding]] by the international community. Observers across the political and academic spectra have come to see the state-building approach as the preferred strategy to peacebuilding in a number of high-profile conflicts, including the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian]], Bosnia, Iraq, and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. According to the political scientist [[Anders Persson]], internationally led state-building is based on three dimensions: a security dimension, a political dimension and an economic dimension. Of these three, security is almost always considered the first priority.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Anders (2012). [http://cesran.org/building-a-state-or-maintaining-the-occupation-international-support-for-fayyads-state-building-project.html "Building a state or maintaining the occupation? International support for Fayyad’s state-building project"], ''Journal of Conflict Transformation and Security'', Vol. 2, No. 1, pp: 101–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general argument in the academic literature on state-building is that without security, other tasks of state-building are not possible.
Consequently, when state-building as an approach to peacebuilding is employed in conflict and post-conflict societies, the first priority is to create a safe environment in order to make wider political and economic development possible. So far, the results of using the state-building approach to peacebuilding have been mixed, and in many places, such as in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, the initial high expectations set by the international community have not been met. The literature on state-building has always been very clear in that building states has historically been a violent process and the outcomes in the above-mentioned cases and many others confirm the destabilizing and often violent nature of state-building.

==Definition==
There are two main theoretical approaches to definitions of state-building.

First, state-building is seen by some theorists as an activity undertaken by external actors (foreign countries) attempting to build, or re-build, the institutions of a weaker, post-conflict or [[Failed state|failing state]]. This 'exogenous' or International Relations school views state-building as the activity of one country in relation to another, usually following some form of intervention (such as a UN peacekeeping operation).

The second, developmental, theory followed a set of principles developed by the [[OECD]] in 2007 on support to conflict-affected states which identified 'statebuilding' as an area for development assistance.  The result saw work commissioned by donor countries on definitions, knowledge and practice in state-building, this work has tended to draw heavily on political science.  It has produced definitions that view state-building as an indigenous, national process driven by state-society relations.  This view believes that countries cannot do state-building outside their own borders, they can only influence, support or hinder such processes. Illustrations of this approach include a think-piece commissioned for OECD{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} and a research study produced by the [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal, '' [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1340&amp;title=understanding-state-building-political-economy-perspective-analytical-conceptual-paper-processes-embedded-tensions-lessons-international-engagement|Understanding State-Building from a Political Economy Perspective: An Analytical and Conceptual Paper on Processes, Embedded Tensions and Lessons for International Engagement]'', 2007; [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The developmental view was expressed in a number of papers commissioned by development agencies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} These papers tend to argue that state-building is primarily a 'political' process rather than just a question of technical capacity enhancements and sees state-building as involving a threefold dynamic of: political (usually elite) deals, the prioritization of core government functions and the willingness to respond to public expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090118231836/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/State-in-Development-Wkg-Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A further important influence on thinking on states affected by conflict was the [[World Bank]]'s 2011 World Development Report, which avoided the language of state-building while addressing some related themes.

Across the two streams of theory and writing there is a broader consensus that lessons on how to support state-building processes have not yet been fully learned.  Some believe that supporting state-building requires the fostering of legitimate and sustainable state institutions, but many accept that strategies to achieve this have not yet been fully developed. Little of the post-conflict support to state-building undertaken so far has been entirely successful. From an exogenous perspective, it can be argued that sustained focus on supporting state-building has tended to happen in states frequently characterized by brutalized civilian populations, destroyed economies, institutions, infrastructure, and environments, widely accessible small arms, large numbers of disgruntled soldiers to be demobilized and reintegrated, and ethnically or religiously divided peoples. These obstacles are compounded by the fundamental difficulty of grafting democratic and human rights values onto countries with different political, cultural, and religious heritages. Pluralizing societies is theoretical in its viability for immediate political and economic stability and expediency; ideological overtones can be met with opposition within host nations and issues of self-determination and external state trusteeship and stewarding of nascent institutional reform, or its creation, could damage a tenuous post-conflict national self-identity (for critical analyses of neotrusteeship, see e.g. Ford &amp; Oppenheim, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neotrusteeship or Mistrusteeship? The "Authority Creep" Dilemma in United Nations Transitional Administration {{!}} Journal of Transnational Law {{!}} Vanderbilt University|url = https://wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu/jotl/2012/07/neotrusteeship-or-mistrusteeship-the-authority-creep-dilemma-in-united-nations-transitional-administration/|website = wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu|access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both schools of thinking have generated critiques and studies seeking to test the propositions made.  A more developmental approach with an emphasis on composite state-building processes would have implications for donor programmes, diplomacy and [[Peacekeeping|peace-keeping]].  Some research has tried to test some of the ideas involved&lt;ref&gt;(OECD, Do No Harm in State-building 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one donor agency issued a guidance note for its own programmes.&lt;ref&gt;(DFID, Building Peaceful States and Societies 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Important critiques were developed by NGOs such as [[Conciliation Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/resources/occasional-papers/documents/CR_2Renegotiating_Settlement_20Mar09-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Asia Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/PoliticalSettlementsFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; focused primarily on Whaites proposition that a 'political settlement' drives state-building.  There have also been attempts to test out the thesis by looking at individual areas of state provision, particularly the area of healthcare.  Further research on state–society relations has also been undertaken by groups including the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium and the Crisis States Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandfragilestates.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=32&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

While some development papers have tried to argue that state-building takes place in all countries and that much can be learnt from successful state-building there is a tendency to narrow the discussion to the most problematic contexts.  As a result, much of the literature on state-building is preoccupied with post conflict issues. See e.g. (Dahrendorf, 2003), (The Commission on Post-Conflict Reconstruction, 2003), (Collier, 2003) (Fukuyama, 2004), (Paris, 2004), (Samuels 2005). Critiques common to both schools include inadequate strategy and a lack of coordination, staffing weaknesses, and that funding is insufficient or poorly timed. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that many of the tasks sought to be achieved are extremely complex and there is little clarity on how to best proceed. For instance, it is extremely difficult to provide security in a conflictual environment, or to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate armies successfully. It remains practically impossible to address vast unemployment in states where the economy is destroyed and there is high illiteracy, or to strengthen the rule of law in a society where it has collapsed. Moreover, the unintended negative consequences of international aid are more and more evident. These range from distortion of the economy to skewing relationship of accountability by the political elite towards internationals rather than domestic population.

The [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] (UNRISD) determined that basic state capacities are to

i. Assist in the acquisition of new technologies

ii. Mobilize and channel resources to productive sectors

iii. Enforce standards and regulations

iv. Establish social pacts

v. Fund deliver and regulate services and social programmes&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"&gt;UNRISD 2010. "Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction." Chapter 10, pp. 3–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

States must be able to create the
# Political Capacity to address the extent to which the necessary coalitions or political settlements can be built
# Resource Mobilization Capacity to generate resources for investment and social development
# Allocate Resources To Productive And Welfare-Enhancing Sectors&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3" /&gt;

When developing this infrastructure a state can meet several roadblocks including policy capture from powerful segments of the population, opposition from interest groups, and ethnic and religious division.
Developing countries have tried to implement different forms of government established in advanced democracies. However, these initiatives have not been fully successful. Scholars have looked back at the development of Europe to determine the key factors that helped create bureaucracies that were sustainable throughout the centuries.

== Application of state-building theories ==

=== The predatory theory ===

==== War making ====
When studying the development of European states, Charles Tilly identified that European countries engaged in four activities:&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985"&gt;Peter B. Evans, D. R.; Skocpol, T., War Making and State Making as Organized Crime Bringing the State Back In. Cambridge University Press: 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

# war making – eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals
# state making – eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside their own territory
# protection – eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients
# extraction – acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities.

For Tilly, these activities are interdependent and rely in the state’s ability to monopolize violence. Before the consolidation of European states, kings relied on their lords’ troops to emerge victorious from war, setting the final boundaries of their territories after years of campaigns. Still, these lords and their private armies could become potential threats to the king’s power during peacetime. Originally, structures were created to facilitate extraction from the king’s subordinates in exchange for protection (from their enemies and from the state), covering the expenses of war campaigns. However, extraction also economically strengthened the states, allowing them to expand their hold over the use violence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of these four activities, war making was the main stimulus to increasing the level of taxation, thus increasing the capacity of the state to extract resources otherwise known as [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985" /&gt; The increased capacity of the state to extract taxes from its citizens while facing external threats prompted [[Jeffrey Herbst]] to propose allowing failed states to dissolve or engage in war to re-create the process endured by European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbst | first1 = J | year = 1996 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 120–144 | doi=10.1162/isec.21.3.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extraction in exchange for protection was further argued by economic historian Frederic Lane. Lane argued that "governments are in the business of selling protection... whether people want it or not".&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com"&gt;Tilly, Charles: War Making and State Making as Organized Crime. 1985. http://www.jesusradicals.com/uploads/2/6/3/8/26388433/warmaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lane argued that a monopoly was best equipped to produce and control violence. This, he argued, was due to the fact that competition within a monopoly raised costs, and that producing violence renders larger economies of scale.&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com" /&gt; Although the logic was consistent with the predatory theory of the state in early modern Europe,&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2004 | title = State building, interstate and intrastate rivalry: A study of post-colonial developing country extractive efforts, 1975–2000 | url = | journal = International Studies Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 53–72 | doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbst’s point of view was criticized by several scholars including Richard Joseph who were concerned that the application of predatory theory was an excessive approach of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joseph | first1 = R. | last2 = Herbst | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 175–184 | doi=10.1162/isec.22.2.175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have disregarded the limited view of this theory and have instead extended it to include strong external threats of any kind. External threats to the state produce stronger institutional capacities to extract resources from the state.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2005 | title = War, rivalry, and state building in Latin America | url = | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 451–465 | doi=10.2307/3647725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In harnessing this increased capacity, Cameron Thies describes the state as a machine that requires a "driver" that is able to use the increased capacity to expand influence and power of government. The driver can be state personnel, a dominant class, or a charismatic individual. Without these drivers, the political and military machine of the state has no direction to follow and therefore, without this direction, war and the increased resources extracted from war can not be used for growth.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt; On the other hand, internal wars, i.e. civil wars, have a negative effect on extraction of a state. Internal rivals to the state decrease the state's capacity to unify and extract from its citizens. Rivals usually will bargain with the state to lower their tax burden, gain economic or political privileges.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt;

==== Limited access orders ====
In their paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass|last2=Wallis|first2=John|last3=Weingast|first3=Barry|date=December 2006|title=A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w12795|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass North, John Wallis, and Barry Weingast offer an alternative framework - limited access orders - for understanding the predatory role of the state. In limited access orders, entry is restricted in both economic and political systems to produce rents which benefit the ruling elites. In open access orders, entry is open to all. The logic of the open access state is based in impersonality. Both systems are interdependent and are only stable when both have similar access frameworks, either limited or open. Transitioning from a limited access order to an open access order involves difficult, radical changes based on three "doorstep conditions": 1) rule of law for elites, 2) perpetual life for organizations, and 3) political control of the military. Once all three initial conditions are satisfied, more incremental changes can be made to move the state further in the direction of an open access order.

=== Social changes and social order ===
In his study on countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, Joel Migdal presented the necessary and sufficient conditions for establishing a strong state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societies and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=269–275|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered "massive societal dislocation" that weakens old social control and institutions as the necessary condition. Such cases include the [[Black Death]] and the [[Hundred Years' War]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=91–92|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of world economy into Asia, Africa and Latin America in the 19th century, the combination of war and revolution in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and mass migration in [[Taiwan]] and [[Israel]] in the 20th century. Furthermore, he listed the sufficient conditions as follows:
* World historical timing when exogenous political forces were in favor of concentrated social control;
* Existence of military threat from outside or other groups in the country;
* A group of skillful and independent people to build an independent bureaucracy;
* Skillful top leadership that would take advantage of the above conditions.

== Differentiating "nation-building", military intervention, regime change ==

Some commentators have used the term "nation-building" interchangeably with "state-building" (e.g. Rand report on America's role in nation-building). However, in both major schools of theory the state is the focus of thinking rather than the "nation" (''nation'' conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity history, culture and language). The issues debated related to the structures of the state (and its relationship to society) and as result state-building is the more broadly accepted term.  In political science '[[nation-building]]' usually has a quite distinct meaning, defined as the process of encouraging a sense of national identity within a given group of people, a definition that relates more to socialisation than state capacity (see the ODI, OECD, and DFID reports cited above).

Similarly, state-building (nation-building) has at times been conflated with military intervention or regime change. This derives in part from the military actions in Germany and Japan in World War II and resulting states, and became especially prevalent following the military interventions in Afghanistan (October 2001) and Iraq (March 2003). However, the conflation of these two concepts has been highly controversial, and has been used by opposing ideological and political forces to attempt to justify, or reject as an illegal military occupation, the actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hence, regime change by outside intervention should be differentiated from state-building.

There have been some examples of military interventions by international or multilateral actors with a focus on building state capacity, with some of the more recent examples including Bosnia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Such interventions are alternatively described as "neotrusteeship" or "neoimperialism". Under this framework, strong states take over part of all of the governance of territories with underdeveloped existing governing structures, often with the backing of international legal authority. Unlike the classic imperialism of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this type of intervention is aimed at (re)building local state structures and turning over governance to them as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|last2=Laitin|first2=David|date=Spring 2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Neotrusteeship-and-the-Problem-of-Weak-States.pdf|journal=International Security|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts vary in the scope of their objectives, however, with some believing that sweeping change can be accomplished through the sufficient and intelligent application of personnel, money, and time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building|last=Dobbins|first=James|last2=et. al.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2007|isbn=978-0833039880|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that any such plans will founder on the inherent unpredictability of interventions and that lengthy, sustained interventions often prevent local leaders from taking responsibility and strengthen insurgent forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Can Intervention Work?|last=Stewart|first=Rory|last2=Knaus|first2=Gerald|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2012|isbn=978-0393342246|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-trusteeship, shared sovereignty, and other new models of intervention rest on the assumptions that intervention is the most effective strategy for state-building and that countries cannot recover from the failures of government without external interference. However, Jeremy M. Weinstein proposes autonomous recovery exists as a process that offers "lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;''Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective''. Jeremy M. Weinstein. Working Paper Number 57. April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The argument suggests that external interference detracts from the state-building by-products produced from war or military victories, given that military intervention makes rebel victories less likely and that peace-building discourages violence. External support undermines the creation of a self-sustaining relationship between rulers or political leaders and its constituents. Foreign aid promotes governments that maintain the same leaders in power and discourages developing a revenue extraction plan that would bind local politicians and local populations. War or military victories create conditions for self-sustaining and representative institutional arrangements through the domestic legitimacy and capacity of state revenue extraction that are by-products of war.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Versus peace-building==
State-building does not automatically guarantee peace-building, a term denoting actions that identify and support structures that strengthen and solidify peace in order to prevent a relapse into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Boutros-Ghali, Boutros (1992) "An Agenda for Peace: Preventive Diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping", paragraph 21&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst they have traditionally been considered two individual concepts with a complex relationship giving rise to dilemmas and necessitating trade-offs, as Grävingholt, Gänzle and Ziaja argue, the two actually representative two diverging perspectives on the same issue: a shaky social peace and a breakdown of political order.&lt;ref&gt;Grävingholt J, Gänzle S &amp; ZiajaS (2009), Policy Brief:

Concepts of Peacebuilding and State Building – How Compatible Are They?, ''German Institute for Development,'' p.2, Available at https://www.die-gdi.de/uploads/media/Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding__Draft_11-03-09__01.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016). 
&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] emphasises that peace-building and state-building are not the same, it does recognise the nexus between them and the reinforcement of one component has on the other: 'peace-building is primarily associated with post-conflict environments, and state-building is likely to be a central element of it in order to institutionalise peace'.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2008), Concepts and Dilemmas of State Building

in Fragile Situations: from Fragility to Resilience, ''Journal on Development'', Vol 9, Issue 3, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/governance-peace/conflictandfragility/docs/41100930.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Paris' model including the peace-building and state-building is one of the better known ones. He advocates an Internationalisation Before Liberalisation (IBL) approach, arguing that peace-building must be geared towards building liberal and effective states, thus 'avoiding the pathologies of liberalization, while placing war-shattered states on a long-term path to democracy and market-oriented economics'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heathershaw | first1 = J | last2 = Lambach | first2 = D | year = 2008 | title = Introduction: Post-Conflict Spaces and Approaches to Statebuilding | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17502970802436296?instName=King%2527s+College+London| journal = Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 269–289 | doi = 10.1080/17502970802436296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the advantages of incorporating peace-building and state-building in the same model, applicational limitations should be recognised. In practice, foreign and security policy making still largely treat them as separate issues. Moreover, academics often approach the subjects from different angles. Heathershaw and Lambach caution that in practice, interventions that attempt the ambitious goals that Paris (amongst others) sets out may be coercive and driven by a 'the end justifies the means' outlook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This concern is acute in [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions for there have been instances where peace-builders aspire not only to go a step further and eradicate the causes of violence, which are oftentimes not agree upon by the parties to the conflict, but also to invest 'post-conflict societies with various qualities, including democracy in order to reduce the tendency toward arbitrary power and give voice to all segments of society; the rule of law in order to reduce human rights violations; a market economy free from corruption in order to discourage individuals from believing that the surest path to fortune is by capturing the state; conflict management tools; and a culture of tolerance and respect'.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M &amp; Zuercher C (n.D), The Peacebuilder's Contract:

How External State-building Reinforces Weak Statehood, ''Research Partnership on Postwar State-Building'', p.2, Available at http://www.sfb-governance.de/teilprojekte/projekte_phase_1/projektbereich_c/c1/barnettzuercherstatebuilding.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Such ambitious goals are questionable when the [[United Nations]] has been seen to struggle in high-profile conflict-ridden situations such as [[Darfur]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Where it has accomplished a degree of stability such as in Haiti and Liberia, it endures pressure 'to transition from heavy and costly security-oriented peacekeeping operations to lighter, peace-building-oriented missions'. Introducing state-building to mandates is controversial not only because this would entail extra costs and commitments but also because 'the expansion of peacekeeping into these areas has de facto extended the authority of the Security Council, with political, financial, institutional, and bureaucratic implications that have yet to be fully addressed'.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman J &amp; Tortolani B (2009), Implications of Peacebuilding and Statebuilding in United Nations Mandates, ''International Forum Challengers of Peace Operations'', p.2, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.operationspaix.net/DATA/DOCUMENT/4997~v~Implications_of_Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding_in_United_Nations_Mandates.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the inherently political nature of state building, interventions to build the state can hinder peace, increasing group tensions and sparking off further conflict.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Menocal, Alina Rocha (2009) 'State-building for peace’: navigating an arena of contradictions [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/3673.pdf] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the consensus that has emerged stressing that 'a minimally functioning state is essential to maintain peace',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ignores the complications that poor legitimacy and inclusion can lead to in the future, undermining the whole process.{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} For instance, while the [[Guatemala|Guatemala Peace Accords]] were considered successful, 'the formal substance of these agreements has not altered power structures that have been in place for decades (if not centuries) in any substantial manner. The underlying (informal) understanding among elites – that their privileges and hold on power are not to be touched – appears to remain. Therefore, while the Accords may be deemed successful because they prevented the outbreak of war, this 'success' was tainted by the implications made by a subsequent report published by the Commission of Historical Clarification in February 1999. In it 'particular institutions were singled out as responsible for extensive human rights abuses. State institutions were attributed responsibility for 93% of these, and the guerrilla forces 3%. In unexpectedly strong language, the report described Guatemalan governmental policy at the height of the war as a policy of genocide'.&lt;ref&gt;Salvesen H (2002), Guatemala: Five Years after the Peace Accords: The Challenges of Implementing Peace, ''International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO)'' for the Norwegian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, p. 13, Available at  http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/37978/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/c1f807e7-a86a-4a6d-a248-10c6c1315551/en/2002_03_Guatemala+Five+Years+After+the+Peace.pdf. (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforcement of these state institutions as part of the peace-building process taints it by association.

Efforts to "appease" or 'buy off' certain interest groups in the interest of peace may undermine state-building exercises, as may power-sharing exercises that could favor the establishment of a political settlement over effective state institutions. Such political settlements could also enshrine power and authority with certain factions within the military, allowing them to carve up state resources to the detriment of state-building exercises.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1499 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in weak states where the government has not sufficient power to control peripheries of the territory, alliances with the elites could strengthen the state's governing power.  Yet, these alliances are successful if the agreement is mutually beneficial for the parties e.g. elites's power is threatened by competition and the entitlement of the government would help them to diminish it. In return, the government would acquire information and control over the peripheries' policies. Afghanistan since 2001, is an example of a beneficial pact between government and elites; entitling some select set of warlords as governors yielded a strongman brand of governance in two key provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warlords, strongman governors, and the state in Afghanistan|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Dipali|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes peace-building efforts bypass the state in an effort bring peace and development more quickly, for example, it was found that many NGOs in the Democratic Republic of Congo were building schools without involving the state. The state also may be part of the problem and over-reliance on the state by international actors can worsen security inside the country.

Conversely, state corruption can mean that state building efforts serve only one ethnic, religious or other minority group, exacerbating tensions that could escalate towards violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1498 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; State building can also assist predatory states to strengthen their institutions, reinforcing abusive authority and further fueling grievances and popular resistance.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"/&gt;

In practice, however, there remains confusion over the differences between state-building and peace-building. The UN's [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] stated that "along with establishing security, the core task of peace-building is to build effective public institutions that, through negotiations with civil society, can establish a consensual framework for governance with the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;High-Level Panel of Threats, Challenges and Change, paragraph 229&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 UN study found that a number of UN officials felt that the establishment of effective and legitimate state institutions was a key indicator of a successful peace operation.&lt;ref&gt;Call, Charles T (2008), "The Fallacy of the 'Failed State', 'Third World Quarterly'', 29:8, p 1498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market-oriented aid==

Aid is an important part to the development dialogue. In the 1980s and 1990s due to a series of economic crises and unsuccessful attempts in intervention programs in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and [[Eastern Europe]], the international community shifted towards a market-oriented model of foreign aid.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritz | first1 = V. | last2 = Menocal | first2 = A. R. | year = 2007 | title = Developmental states in the new millennium: Concepts and challenges for a new aid agenda | url = | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 531–552 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor countries believed that a reduction in the size and the reach of the state could provide a more efficient outcome.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt; However, the success of East Asia, East Europe, Brazil, and India has suggested even market economies require a capable state to grow sustainably.  Moreover, international donors became concerned over seriously malfunctioning states in the 1990s, i.e. [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt;

==State Capacity==
Economic historians Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama define state capacity as "the ''ability'' of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=April 2017|title=States and economic growth: Capacity and constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498316301966|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=64|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, various definitions of state capacity among scholars.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berwick, Elissa and Fotini, Christia|first=|date=Forthcoming 2017|title=Building State Capacity|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berwick and Fotini consolidate the literature of state capacity into 3 different domains: extractive capacity, governmental capacity, and regulatory-productive capacity:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Extractive capacity''' is the process of collecting rents in order to provide resources for the governed. Taxing is the most common form of extraction.  Tilly argues that state-building was not intended, but once it has begun, extraction capacity was necessary.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Furthermore, Herbst argues that war is a catalyst to start or increase extractive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. "War and the State in Africa." International Security (1990): 117-139&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Governmental capacity''' is the ability of lower level governmental workers to implement the agenda of the higher level of government. 
* '''Regulatory-Productive Capacity''' is the capacity of the state to provide output for the citizens. This output can include the enforcement of laws and the setting of policy for the citizens. 
State capacity is widely cited as an essential element to why some countries are rich and others are not: "It has been established that the richest countries in the world are characterized by long-lasting and centralized political institutions"; "that poverty is particularly widespread and intractable in countries that lack a history of centralized government... and are internally fragmented"; "and countries with weak state capacity are particularly vulnerable to civil war and internal conflict".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Pritchett, Woolcock &amp; Andrews (2013)&lt;sup&gt;[[State-building#cite note-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; offer a criticism of why state building fails to work. They claim that many countries are in a capability trap – countries are, at most, converging at a very low pace to the same levels of state capacity. They estimate that on average, it would take 672 years for the bottom 15 countries to reach the state capability level of the best performer if their capabilities keep growing at the same average rate with which they have grown since their political independence.{{efn|They use three index to estimate state capability: i) ‘government effectiveness’ from the World Bank World Governance Indicators, ii) resource efficiency, from the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, and iii) ‘progressive deterioration in public services’ from the Failed State Index.}} Other indexes suggest that countries are not catching up: the bureaucratic quality and corruption index from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) have a negative pace of growth for the bottom 30 countries. The authors argue that the capability trap shows that external assistance to increase state capacity have not been successful in accelerating the development process. They identify that this implementation failure may occur through two techniques: i) ''systemic isomorphic mimicry'', by which the structures of institutions are imitated (specific rules are followed) but they do not serve purposes functional to the society; and ii) ''premature load bearing'', in which the pressure exerted by outsiders undermines the organic evolution of local institutions.

== State structures within the concept of state-building ==

The term "state" can be used to mean both a geographic sovereign political entity with a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with the other states, as defined under international law (Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, December 26, 1933, Article 1),  as well as a set of social institutions claiming a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a given territory (Max Weber, 1919).

For the purposes of state-building in environments of instability, the sub-structures of states can be defined as a political regime (or system of government), a governance framework (or constitution), and a set of state institutions (or organizations) such as the armed forces, the parliament, and the justice system. State capacity refers to the strength and capability of the state institutions. Nation conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity, history, culture, and language.

===Authoritarian regime===

Governments that have implemented the top-down method present the idea that there is a great external threat that can diminish the capabilities of a state and its citizens. The perceived threat creates an incentive that focuses policy, make elites cooperate, and facilitates the adoption of a nationalistic ideology. In an [[authoritarian government]], political, military, and ideological power is concentrated to be conducive to policy continuation. The bureaucracies implemented are well trained, well paid, and highly competitive in recruitment and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = P. | last2 = Rauch | first2 = J. E. | year = 1999 | title = Bureaucracy and growth: A cross-national analysis of the effects of "Weberian" state structures on economic growth | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 5| pages = 748–765 | doi=10.2307/2657374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically successful states in East Asia have taken on programs to create infrastructure, subsidize the farming sector, provide credit, support spending on targeted research, and invest in health and education. However, most governments are non-developmental and unstable. Furthermore, even when countries have tried to pursue authoritarian strategies that have worked, specifically Brazil, a divided military, regional oligarchs in power, and vast disparities in inequality delegitimized the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, C., Why East Asia overtook Latin America: agrarian reform, industrialisation and development. Third World Q 2002, 23 (6), 1073-1102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic regime===

A democratic regime engages citizens more actively than a top-down government. It respects the right of citizen to contest policies. Successful democracies developed political capacities by nurturing active citizenship, maintaining electoral competitiveness that gave value to the votes of the poor, fostered political parties that were strongly oriented towards equality, and had strong party-social movement ties.

== Approaches ==
While many specific techniques exist for creating a successful state-building strategy, three specific approaches have been identified by the recent 2010 UNRISD report.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  These three approaches would all fall under the endogenous school of thinking, and are: [[Good Governance]], [[New Public Management]], and [[Decentralization]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Good governance ===
{{main article|Good governance}}
[[Good governance]] is a very broadly used term for successful ways a government can create public institutions that protect people’s rights.      There has been a shift in good governance ideals, and as Kahn&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Khan, Mushtaq H. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. DESA, June 2009. Web. 10 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2009/wp75_2009.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; states, "The dominant 'good governance' paradigm identifies a series of capabilities that, it argues are necessary governance capabilities for a market-friendly state.  These include, in particular, the capabilities to protect stable property rights, enforce the rule of law, effectively implement anti-corruption policies and achieve government accountability."
This good governance paradigm is a market-enhancing process which emerged in the 1990s.  This approach involves enforcing the rule of law, creating stronger property rights, and reducing corruption.  By focusing on improving these three traits, a country can improve its market efficiency.  There is a theoretical cycle of market failure&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; which explains how a lack of property rights and strong corruption, among other problems, leads to market failure:

* The cycle starts with economic stagnation, which can enhance and expose the inefficiencies of a weak government and rule of law that cannot effectively respond to the problem.
* Because a government is unaccountable or weak, small interest groups can use the government for their specific interests, resulting in rent seeking and corruption.
* Corruption and rent seeking from interest groups will lead to weak property rights that prevent citizens and smaller businesses from the assurance that their property is safe under national law.  Also the corruption will result in welfare-reducing interventions.
* These weak property rights and welfare-reducing interventions lead to high transaction cost markets.
* High transaction cost markets lead back to economic stagnation.

While it is understood that improving rule of law and reducing corruption are important methods to increasing the stability and legitimacy of a government, it is not certain whether this approach is a good basis for a state building approach.  Researchers&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; have looked at this approach by measuring property rights, regulatory quality, corruption, and voice and accountability.  There was little correlation found between increasing property rights and growth rates per capita GDP.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Similarly, there is disagreement among development researchers as to whether it is more beneficial to promote comprehensive set of reforms or to promote a minimal set of necessary reforms in contexts of poor institutionalization. Proponents of the former approach have put forward the concept of "good enough governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee S.|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x/epdf|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 | issue = 5 |pages=553–574|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Public Management ===

In response to the unsuccessful attempts to strengthen government administrations, developing countries began to adopt market-oriented managerial reforms under the pressure of the IMF and the World Bank. [[New Public Management]] approach first emerged in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  New Public management uses market like reforms within the public sector to provide the government with the necessary power to implement a development plan on the economy while also using competitive market-based techniques to enhance public sector production.  It changed public sector employment practices from career tenure positions towards limited-term contracts for senior staff, locally determined pay, and [[performance-related pay]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Secondly, the provision of government services shifted towards contracts, franchising, vouchers, and user charges in an effort to promote efficiency in service provision to citizens.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

In this type of government, large bureaucracies within a ministry (the principal) no longer maintain their hierarchical structure but rather are composed of operational arms of ministries that perform the role of an individual agent. The strategy has been more prominent in liberal market-driven policy regimes like New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. Continental Europe has been more resistant to implementing this type of policy. In developing countries, the implementation of these types of infrastructure has been difficult because the markets for the delivery of services are imperfect and increase the danger of regulatory capture by companies. For successful implementation, governments must have the infrastructure to measure reliable performance indicators and the capacity to regulate the behavior of private providers.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
In reference to state building approaches [[decentralization]] is beneficial because "It seeks to reduce rent-seeking behavior and inefficient resource allocation associated with centralized power by dispersing such power to lower levels of government, where the poor are likely to exercise influence and a variety of actors may participate in the provision of services".&lt;ref&gt;UNRISD 2010. “Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction.” Chapter 10, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations to decentralization are the reduction of the meritocratic basis can limit the state's capacity to serve citizens, limited control of the fiscal funds at the local level can prevent effectiveness, and substantial inequalities in fiscal capacity among different regions can create ineffective redistribution of resources. Therefore, for these policies to work, there must be coordination efforts to ensure that growth-oriented and redistributive strategies initiated at the central government are implemented regionally. Furthermore, government elites must be in favor of low-income groups and grass root groups should be able to engage with local authorities during policy making.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

== Examples of state-building ==
European states replicated or bequeathed their institutions in the territories they colonized, but many new emerging states have evolved differently. European states consolidated after long years of internal and external struggles that greatly differ in context from the struggles of some recently emerged states.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985). "War making and state making as organized crime," in ''Bringing the State Back In'', eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, &amp; T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===

Kosovo has gone through extensive state building by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), that assumed all executive, legislative and judicial powers in 1999, aiming to restore order, stability and peace in the turbulent region. This is a unique example of state-building that is directly administered by external actors, the effectiveness of which is to this date contested. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, Enver Hoxhaj claimed Kosovo is the most successful state-building example in the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=Hoxhaj: Kosovo, the most successful state-building example in the region.|url=http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,217,1398|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Republic of Kosovo.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its transition from war and genocide, to peace and progress has been remarkable. The developmental progress of Kosovo is apparent in its new institutional framework, that although initially centrally planned and administered by the UNMIK, has gradually transferred competencies to relevant national bodies and relevant institutions. The 2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the UNMIK claims of 'encouraging signals of commitment by the parties to engaging with one another through peaceful means and dialogue to resolve their differences'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|url=https://unmik.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/old_dnn/S-2012-818.pdf|website=Reports of the Secretary-General on UNMIK|publisher=UNMIK|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kosovo remains a "black hole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=J|title=Building State Failure in Kosovo?|journal=Contemporary Southeastern Europe|date=2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–25|url=http://www.suedosteuropa.uni-graz.at/cse/sites/default/files/papers/coelho_kosovo.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe, being a semi-consolidated authoritarian regime, noting high levels of corruption, crime and unemployment, casting doubts over the extent to which state-building was successful. Arguably, the state is still overly dependent on international aid and external assistance for its economy, part of which is still linked to networks of the old war economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deppler|first1=M|title=The Economic Consequences of the Kosovo Crisis: An Updated Assessment|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/kosovo/052599.htm#II|website=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive state building

===Latin America===

Latin America experienced a period of rapid economic growth and political stability in the late-19th century, following [[Independence of Latin America|independence]] and subsequent decades of decline caused by violence, reduced state-capacity, and fiscal fragmentation. This trajectory is markedly successful relative to other{{which|date=September 2017}} post-conflict societies at the time. Differences can be attributed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to the demography of Latin America compared to other newly-independent European colonies, the massive European presence in Latin America,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} the collapse of indigenous institutions, and the death of indigenous populations - unparalleled at the time. Latin Americans also enacted a number of liberal public policies swiftly and effectively, such as [[abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]] ([[Saint-Domingue]] in 1793, [[Haiti]] in 1804, [[New Spain]] in 1813, [[Peru]] in 1854, Brazil in 1888), socializing property rights over land, and eliminating public monopolies, which fostered long-term stability that facilitated economic growth and established a new political economy for these new nations. The growth and stability seen in Latin America, however, did come at a high social cost  in the form of social inequality that continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert H., John H. Coatsworth, and Jeffrey G. Williamson. 2007. “Lost Decades: Post-independence Performance in Latin America and Africa.” The Journal of Economic History&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century it became economically and politically difficult for Latin American countries to increase revenues, which led states to turn to debt for the necessary resources to pay for war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} As a result, Latin American countries did not establish the same tax basis that their European counterparts did. This can be explained by the predatory theory. Studies on the extraction of tax revenues have demonstrated that both external and internal rivals affect the ability of a state to develop and extract resources from its citizens. Interstate rivals had a positive effect on the state's capacity to extract resources while intrastate rivals had a negative effect on state building.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}}

===Africa===

[[Charles Tilly|Tilly]]'s theory that external threats strengthen the state's capacity to extract taxes from its citizens can apply to developing countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = State Building, Interstate and Intrastate Rivalry: A Study of Post-Colonial Developing Country Extractive Efforts, 1975-2000 |jstor = 3693563 |journal = International Studies Quarterly |date = 2004-01-01 |pages = 53–72 |volume = 48 |issue = 1 |first = Cameron G. |last = Thies |doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both external state rivals and internal ethnic rivals prompted states to increase their extraction of taxes from citizens while internal political rivals failed to affect the extraction of taxes.{{citation needed | reason= This statement is contested in political science|date= February 2016}} The [[leader]]s in power try to maintain their position by catering to the majority ethnic group and by increasing taxes to gain the resources to diminish threats from minority ethnic groups. Thus the presence of internal ethnic rivals creates the capacity to significantly increase the [[tax ratio]].

Drawing on Charles Tilly's theory of European state formation, a number of scholars have suggested that in focusing on internal rivalries, rather than challenging colonial borders, rulers were "less likely to see their economies as a resource to be nurtured than as an object of periodic plunder—the analogy to Olson's (1993) roving bandits should be clear" (Thies, 2004: 58). In the absence of external threats, rulers thus had no impetus to replicate the patterns described by Tilly—war making, coercion, resource extraction—that had proven crucial to the process of centralization of power in the states of Europe.

For example, in ''[[States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control|States and Power in Africa]]'' (2000), [[Jeffrey Herbst]] explains that "domestic security threats, of the type African countries face so often, may force the state to increase revenue; however, civil conflicts result in fragmentation and considerable hostility among different segments of the population", undermining the state's ability to rally the population's support for the "national project" (2000: 126).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Herbst, J.: States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. (Second edition) (eBook, Paperback and Hardcover) |url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10355.html |website = press.princeton.edu |access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, Herbst argues that war in Europe lead to strong states and that without war African states will remain weak.&lt;ref name="Herbst"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2538753 |title = War and the State in Africa |last = Herbst |first = Jeffery |date = Spring 1990 |journal = International Security |doi = 10.2307/2538753 |pmid = |volume=14 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, external threats allowed states to tax, increase taxation, and forge a national identity. Additionally, the states that were invaded and taken over (such as [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] or Ireland) by stronger countries were militarily and politically weak. African states are poor, have weak governments, and are fragmented on ethnic or regional lines. According to theory, these weak African states should be susceptible to external threats, but this is not the case. In Africa, Herbst notes, there are rarely conflicts between states, and if there are, war does not threaten the existence of the state. For example, in the 1979 [[Uganda–Tanzania War|Uganda-Tanzania]] War, Tanzania invaded Uganda to overthrow [[Idi Amin]], but after the Tanzanians had removed Amin, they left the country. Although African states do not experience widespread interstate war, Herbst argues they need it to reform the tax structure and to build a national identity. Herbst concludes that war in Africa is likely to occur when African leaders realize that their economic reforms and efforts to build a national identity do not work and in desperation will start wars to build the states that their countries need.&lt;ref name="Herbst"/&gt; [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James Robinson]] disagrees with Herbst in the grade of influence of war on state-building, stating that European colonization and European influences in the continent impacted more deeply the creation of institutions, and therefore, states in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = James A | year = 2002 | title = States and Power in Africa by Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 510–519 | doi=10.1257/jel.40.2.510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2017}} the provision of [[public services]], another dimension of state-building, which includes the management of human capital within the realm of service along with the delivery of public services, remains another major challenge for post-conflict African nations. Academics have built models of the political economy in post-conflict African societies to understand the trade-off between the capability, delivery, and stability of public-service administration, and policies which result in weak civil service rooted in the nations' legacies of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers have emphasized that the internal violence seen in Africa was characteristic for [[early modern Europe]]an politics and that this{{which|date=September 2017}} type of structure may resolve to produce an increased level of political order.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000" /&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}} A number of scholars have  criticized this claim for its "excessively Darwinian", overly deterministic and Euro-centric understanding of the process of state-formation (Thies, 2004: 69, see also Joseph, 1997).

==== South Sudan ====
The international intervention which culminated in renewed conflict in South Sudan is cited{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an example of a flawed application of international state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/africa/quandary-in-south-sudan-should-it-lose-its-hard-won-independence.html|title= Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence?|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2017-01-23|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2011, with unilateral{{clarify|date=September 2017}} support from the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development ([[IGAD]]), the nation of [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|South Sudan]] was officially recognized{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an independent Sovereign, forged by an alliance of rebel groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/africa/10sudan.html|title= After Years of Struggle, South Sudan Becomes a New Nation|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2011-07-09|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of building this state, however, had begun in 2005 with the proclamation of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA), a militarist{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} agreement forged among warlords to establish a military dictatorship in South Sudan.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The United States, Britain, Norway, and the IGAD conceptualized and facilitated the process as the solution to the ongoing [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] of 1983 to 2005.&lt;ref name="Mamdani"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/opinion/can-african-union-save-south-sudan-from-genocide.html|title= Can the African Union Save South Sudan from Genocide?|last= Mamdani|first= Mahmood|date= 2017-01-08|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement rested on an assumption that the terms of a peace agreement should be determined solely by military leaders.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, in 2010, an attempt was made{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to include political leaders in the state-building process through the [[All South Sudanese Political Parties convention]], which ultimately resolved to create a transitional government with representation from all major political factions, with a goal of hosting free and fair elections within two years of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article36650|title= Final Communiqué of Southern Sudan Parties Conference on Referendum - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website= www.sudantribune.com|language= en|access-date= 2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transitional government never kept these terms, and South Sudan subsequently devolved into fierce ethnic conflict and civil war. Mahmood Mamdani asserts that this renewed violence was caused by the blatant disregard that South Sudan's rulers have shown for the peace treaties, due to a perception of reassurance through unconditional international support. The treaties have in effect become, as Jeffrey Herbst describes, unenforceable contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901048279|title= States and power in Africa : comparative lessons in authority and control|last= Ira,|first= Herbst, Jeffrey|isbn= 9780691164144|oclc= 901048279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) claims sovereignty over the [[Palestinian Territories]] whose legal statehood is somewhat widely recognized (though not by some major global powers), as well as representative status over the [[Palestinian people]], a claim that is universally recognized. However, it does not have sole jurisdiction over the areas it claims. In addition, many of those it aims to represent currently reside elsewhere, most notably in Arab countries such as [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]]. Nonetheless, the PLO and other Palestinian organisations have historically made great efforts to install institutions of a type commonly associated with states in the Palestinian territories - as well as in countries with large numbers of Palestinian residents. Examples include:

* [[Jordan]] after the [[Six-Day War]] (June 1967), where the installation of parallel structures of power and mechanisms for taxation and education led to largely independent Palestinian enclaves which formed a threat to the power and legitimacy of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Hashemite monarchy]]&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabber | first1 = F | year = 1973 | title = The Arab regimes and the Palestinian revolution, 1967-71 | url = | journal = Journal of Palestine Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi=10.1525/jps.1973.2.2.00p0049v}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lebanon]], where a similar process exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"/&gt;

Despite the break-down of the [[Oslo process]] of 1993-2000 and the ongoing construction of [[Israeli settlement]]s (1967 to present), the [[Palestinian National Authority]] continues to engage in state-building activities in its territories and has referred to the "State of Palestine" in official documents since 2013. In 2003 the United Nations Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515|UN Resolution 1515]], calling for the "establishment of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state". Despite this official acknowledgement of the legitimacy of PNA state-building by the international community, a 2011 report prepared by the London-based [[Overseas Development Institute]] found international assistance to have been "sporadic and fragmented".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7318.pdf |title = The Palestinian State-building Agenda |date = 2011 |access-date = 24 January 2016 |website = Overseas Development Institute |publisher = Overseas Development Institute |last = Rocha Menocal |first = Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the lack of consistent outside support, the report identified key challenges to Palestinian state-building at the international level, including the lack of horizon on "final status" negotiations, failed peace negotiations, the tightening of the [[Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories|occupation]], and the weak economic base, in addition to profound challenges at the domestic level, including:

* a lack of an internal political settlement
* weak linkages between ruling authorities and society at large
* weakened social cohesion
* gender inequality
* weak civil-society
* lack of capacity of formal PNA institutions
* (perceived) securitization of authority across the occupied Palestinian territory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A number of scholars have questioned whether the Palestinian Authority was ever in a position to build a viable state. Edward Said, Neve Gordon and Sara Roy – among others – have argued that the PNA was designed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an "occupation subcontractor", only strengthening the power asymmetries between occupier and occupied.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another strand of analysis, associated with Jamil Hilal and Mushtaq Khan (2004), portrays the PNA as a "transitional client quasi-state", stuck in a situation where core functions of the state remain in the hands of the Israeli state. They identify structural issues within the Oslo process and disunity and corruption prevalent among the Palestinian elite as key reasons for the failure of Palestinian state-building efforts.

[...] The state narrative of the Kingdom's history begins in the eighteenth century, a time of chaos akin to the Hobbesian state of nature. [...] The emergence of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) is introduced in Saudi literature as a 'corrective mechanism bringing the ''umma'' to the right path'. [...] The second Saudi state was born only six years after the demise of the first, during which time the land formerly ruled by the Saudi-Wahhabi alliance had 'returned to unbridled tribal rivalry and feuding'. [...] The second Saudi Kingdom ended in 1887 and was characterised by internal feuding, tribal rivalries, and civil war.

==Arrests==
Inspired by the growing momentum of the pro-democracy [[Arab Spring]], Emirati activists began to be more vocal in their opposition to the [[UAE government]] in early 2011. Bin Ghaith, an "outspoken economics professor", was arrested on 11 April for his call for "democratic and economic reforms".&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13043270 |title=UAE arrests democracy activists |author= |date=11 April 2011 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansoor, an engineer, blogger, and member of [[Human Rights Watch]], was arrested the same day for signing a petition in favor of an elected parliament,&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt; and Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq were detained for their online activities before the end of the month.&lt;ref name=AI1/&gt; Following their arrests, UAE government-controlled media reported that the five were "religious extremists" and [[Iran]]ian foreign agents.&lt;ref name=O /&gt;

==Trial, conviction, and pardon==
Their trial began on 14 June 2011 in [[Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; A Human Rights Watch spokesman criticized the "public relations campaign" of the UAE government against the defendants, stating that dozens of pro-government demonstrators were attending the trial to protest the five prisoners.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The government charged the prisoners with violating article 176 of the UAE Penal Code, which criminalizes insults to the nation's leadership;&lt;ref name=AI1/&gt; the prosecutor's case focused on their posts to an online pro-democracy forum, which had by then been shut down and replaced with a travel service.&lt;ref name=O/&gt; On 18 July, the UAE Five pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt; Amnesty International later condemned their trial as "fundamentally unfair" and "marred with irregularities", stating that the defendants had been "denied any meaningful opportunity to challenge the charges and the evidence against them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/actioncenter/actions/uaa11111.pdf |title='UAE Five' Risk Heavy Sentence for Insult |author= |date=11 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also described the trial as "grossly unfair".&lt;ref name=AJ /&gt;

On 3 October, the UAE Five refused to attend a session of their trial, demanding that the hearings be opened to the public and that they be allowed to question witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/10/2011102131053462460.html |title=UAE activists boycott 'unfair' trial |author= |date=3 October 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November, with the trial still in progress, the five began a [[hunger strike]] to protest their continued detention; Human Rights Watch reported that the five were in poor health.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; On 27 November, the panel of four judges sentenced bin Ghaith, Dalk, al-Khamis, and Khaleq to two years' imprisonment, and Mansoor to three years.&lt;ref name=AJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111128135953601809.html |title=UAE pardons jailed activists |author= |date=28 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the verdict, a pro-government protester reportedly assaulted a relative of one of the defendants despite the heavy security presence.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

The following day, however, the five received a presidential pardon and were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15922492 |title=Five jailed UAE activists 'receive presidential pardon' |author= |date=28 November 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of President Khalifa declined to comment to reporters on the reason for the pardon.&lt;ref name=AJ /&gt; Bin Ghaith told reporters that he was glad to be free, but that he felt that the trial had been "a sad moment for our homeland, a beginning of a [[police state]] that has tarnished the image of the UAE forever".&lt;ref name=AJ /&gt;

==Subsequent arrests==
===Ahmed Mansoor Al Shehhi===
{{main|Ahmed Mansoor}}
Ahmed Mansoor was arrested again on March 19, 2017, at his Ajman home, on charges of publishing false information, inciting hatred, and defaming the UAE online and "seeking to damage the relationship of the UAE with its neighbors". He was also accused of conspiring with a terrorist organization but was found innocent of that charge.&lt;ref name="monde"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2017/03/22/aux-emirats-arabes-unis-la-derniere-voix-libre-baillonnee_5099030_3218.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently charged with 10 years in prison and 1,000,000 Emirati Dirham (approximately USD $270,000) fine.&lt;ref name="National1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/courts/emirati-convicted-for-second-time-of-insulting-country-and-leaders-1.735523|title=Emirati convicted for second time of insulting country and leaders
|publisher=The National|date=May 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International criticized the United Arab Emirates for Mansoor's verdict and called the charge a "devastating blow to freedom of expression in the country" and called for the unconditional release of Mansoor.&lt;ref name="amnestry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/uae-activist-ahmed-mansoor-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-for-social-media-posts/|title=UAE: Activist Ahmed Mansoor sentenced to 10 years in prison for social media posts|publisher= Amnesty International|date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansoor received the [[Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders]] in 2015 prior to his imprisonment.&lt;ref name="monde"/&gt;

===Ahmed Abdul Khaleq===
{{main article|Ahmed Abdul Khaleq}}
Ahmed Abdul Khaleq was again arrested by authorities for his alleged ties to [[Al Islah (United Arab Emirates)|al-Islah]] in May 2012, a political organization with roots in the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and is listed as a terrorist organization in the UAE.&lt;ref name=AI2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/uae-bidun-blogger-forced-leave-country-raising-alarm-after-wave-arbitrary-arrests-2012-07-16 |title=UAE: Bidun blogger forced to leave country, raising alarm after wave of arbitrary arrests |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Khaleq was not an Emirati citizen (previously a [[bedoon]] and holds a Comorian passport), he was presented with the option of being deported or conviction and imprisonment. Khaleq opted to leave for Thailand, departing for [[Bangkok]] on 16 July, 2012.&lt;ref name=AI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=R167&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-uae-rights-activistbre86f0vp-20120716,0,433526.story |title=UAE stateless rights activist says expelled to Thailand |author=Rania El Gamal |date=16 July 2012 |work=The Chicago Tribune |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] criticized the arrest, calling the action an "unlawful expulsion" motivated by the government's desire to stifle dissent.&lt;ref name=R167&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-uae-rights-activistbre86f0vp-20120716,0,433526.story |title=UAE stateless rights activist says expelled to Thailand |author=Rania El Gamal |date=16 July 2012 |work=The Chicago Tribune |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">The '''Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act''' (UIDDA) is a [[Uniform Act | model statute]] adopted by a majority of U.S. states to establish a uniform process for obtaining [[Deposition (law) | depositions]] and [[Discovery (law) | discovery]] in concert with other participating states. In 2007 the [[Uniform Law Commission]] (then primarily referred to as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws) promulgated, and recommended all states enact, the UIDDA.
