'''Agnews Developmental Center''' was a psychiatric and medical care facility, located in [[Santa Clara, California]].

In 1885, the center, originally known as "The Great Asylum for the Insane",&lt;ref&gt;Context Magazine, [http://www.contextmag.com/setFrameRedirect.asp?src=/archives/200202/Feature0WhentheGoing.asp ''When the Going Gets Tough...'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017083947/http://www.contextmag.com/setFrameRedirect.asp?src=%2Farchives%2F200202%2FFeature0WhentheGoing.asp |date=October 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established as a facility for the care of the mentally ill. The main structure, a red brick edifice, was located on land near [[Agnew's Village, California|Agnew's Village]], which later became part of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. By the early twentieth century, Agnews boasted the largest institutional population in the South San Francisco Bay area, and was served by its own train station which stood at the west end of Palm Drive across Lafayette Street; the station building remained until vandalism and fire precipitated its demolition in the 1990s.

In 1926, the center was expanded to include a second campus about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} to the east in San Jose ({{coord|37|24|32|N|121|55|53|W}}).  Individuals with [[developmental disabilities]] were first admitted to a special rehabilitation program in 1965. Programs for the mentally ill were discontinued in 1972. Since then, the center has been used exclusively for the care and treatment of persons with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early years==
Prior to 1906, the Agnews State Hospital, constructed in 1885, was modeled after the [[Kirkbride Plan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkbridebuildings.com/blog/the-lost-kirkbrides-agnews-state-hospital|work=Kirkbride Buildings |title=The Lost Kirkbrides: Agnews State Hospital|date=November 14, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed by architect [[Theodore Lenzen]]. This building was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and Agnews became infamous as the site of the [[Santa Clara Valley]]'s greatest loss of life resulting from the quake.  The ''Daily Palo Alto'' reported: "The position of the people in Agnews is critical; a number of insane persons having escaped from the demolished asylum, are running at random about the country." 117 patients and staff were killed and buried in mass graves on the site. The main building and some others were irreparably damaged.

Following this disaster, Agnews was rebuilt in the [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] styles of [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]]—[[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]], in a layout resembling a college [[campus]] of two-story buildings. It re-opened circa 1911 as ''Agnews State Mental Hospital''. The facility was a small self-contained town, including a multitude of construction trade "shops", a farm which raised pigs and vegetable crops, a steam generating power plant for heating the buildings by steam, and even a fire department.

==West campus closure leads to controversial sale==
[[Image:Wfm sun agnews.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photograph of the Oracle campus at the former Agnews west campus]]

The original west campus was closed in 1998 as part of a plan to reduce and eventually close the center. When the west campus closed, the use of the land was the subject of local controversy.  In April 1997, it was announced the state would sell an {{convert|82.5|acre|ha|sing=on}} parcel of the campus to [[Sun Microsystems]] for its corporate headquarters and [[R&amp;D]] campus.  Some objected to the arranged sale of this prime public land to a profitable corporation at the peak of a local economic and real-estate boom, while others valued the presence of a prominent high-tech employer.  Also at issue was the preservation of and public access to historic Agnews Developmental Center buildings.  Sun agreed to restore four of the historic buildings (the auditorium, the clock tower, the superintendent's villa, and the administration building) and to keep some of the facilities available for public use.  An outdoor exhibit open to the public displays information and photographs regarding the center and its history.

In addition to the Sun deal, the [[Rivermark of Santa Clara|Rivermark]] [[master planned community]] was allocated {{convert|152|acre|ha}} for a variety of residential, retail, public school, and open space uses.

The Agnews site was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (under the name "Agnews Insane Asylum") on August 13, 1997.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2010; the campus continues to be used as an Oracle R&amp;D facility and conference center.

==East campus closure==
In March 2009, the last patient moved out of the east campus and the residential facility was closed. The east campus provided outpatient clinic services through April 2011.

In July 2011, the Regional Project of the Bay Area and the Community State Staff Administration moved to [[Campbell, California|Campbell]] and continued providing support to patients in the local area.

With the final sale of the land pending, the east campus was vacated and the land was turned over to the [[California Department of General Services|Department of General Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dds.ca.gov/Agnews/Index.cfm |title=Agnews Developmental Center |publisher= |accessdate=3 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629122541/http://www.dds.ca.gov/Agnews/Index.cfm |archivedate=29 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Unified School District purchased the property from the State of California for $80 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/53190|title=City of San Jose Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent to build a K-8, High School, and city park.

==In popular media==
The punk rock band [[Green Day]] recorded the music video for their 1994 song "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]" at Agnews.

'''Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.''' ('''AOSI''') is a U.S. public charity organized in 2003 under the laws of the State of [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name=PCAbout&gt;[http://www.pledgechallenge.org/about-plaintiffs/] ''USAID v. AOSI:'' About the Plaintiffs. Retrieved 25 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
AOSI does not have any employees.  AOSI promotes the values of open, democratic societies globally. AOSI coordinates, administers, and advises national and regional programs in [[Central Asia]] and elsewhere on a range of [[public health]], [[education]], and general [[civil society]] issues. It also educates the public about societies' attempts to become [[democracy|democratic]] [[Market economy|market economies]] after [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] or [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule.&lt;ref name=PCAbout/&gt;

In the United States it works with the [[U.S. Government|U.S. federal government]] on charitable projects that address challenges facing urban communities and centers. AOSI makes and receives grants in addition to cooperating with other charitable organizations to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name=PCAbout/&gt;

==Leadership==
[[Christopher Stone (criminal justice expert)|Chris Stone]] serves as Chair and President, Maija Arbolino serves as Member and Treasurer, and A. Nicole Campbell serves as Member and Secretary of AOSI.&lt;ref name=Guidestar/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In September 2005, AOSI [[lawsuit|sued]] the United States Agency for International Development and other [[U.S. Government]] agencies in response to the government extending an [[anti-prostitution pledge]] that was a component of [[Office of National AIDS Policy|HIV/AIDS policy]] during the [[George W. Bush administration]] to cover non-profit organizations based in the [[United States]]. The pledge required recipients of funding under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act to state that they had a policy opposing prostitution and prohibited them from engaging in speech or activity the government deemed inconsistent with an anti-prostitution policy. The requirement covered recipient organizations as a whole, and therefore restricted speech or activity that took place outside the government-funded program and was paid for with entirely private funds.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{Cite journal

As described by the [[online magazine]] ''[[Medical News Today]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At issue in the case is a requirement that public health groups receiving U.S. funds pledge their "opposition to prostitution" in order to continue their life-saving [[HIV]] [[public health|prevention]] work. Under this "pledge requirement," recipients of U.S. funds are forced to censor even their privately funded speech regarding the most effective ways to engage high-risk groups in HIV prevention.&lt;ref name="mednews"&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/43346.php] ''Medical News Today'' "Federal Court Holds "Anti-Prostitution Pledge Requirement" Violates First Amendment" (Main Category: HIV/AIDS, Article Date: 15 May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just prior to this case, the non-profit organization [[DKT International]] had brought a similar lawsuit, prevailing in [[United States district court|District Court]] but losing on appeal in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. The February 2007 ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution through affiliate organizations that did not receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;US Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_05-cv-01604/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_05-cv-01604-0.pdf DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604]. Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the backing of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], AOSI sued the United States Agency for International Development, the financial backers of its Central Asian drug rehabilitation programs.  AOSI's initial co-[[plaintiff]]s were the [[Open Society Institute]] and [[Pathfinder International]]. They were joined later in the litigation by InterAction and the [[Global Health Council]].  [[Lawyer]]s from the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] at [[New York University School of Law]] represented the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="pm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mednews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aclu"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/womensrights/gen/21210lgl20051109.html] American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU Foundation: ''Amicus Brief in Alliance For Open Society International, Inc., et al. v. United States Agency For International Development, et al. (11/9/2005)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brennan"&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/page/-/Justice/Pledge%20Decision%202008%20Q%20and%20A.Final.pdf] Brennan Center for Justice:Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID Questions and Answers About the August 8, 2008 Ruling Granting InterAction and Global Health Council a Preliminary Injunction&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Judge Victor Marrero, a federal judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from requiring AOSI and Pathfinder International to sign the anti-prostitution pledge.&lt;ref name="pm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mednews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aclu"/&gt; The government appealed to the [[US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. During the oral argument in the case, the government stated that it intended to issue regulations that would allow legally and physically separate affiliates of recipient organizations to engage in the prohibited speech.&lt;ref name="pm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aclu"/&gt;
The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Court of Appeals returned the case for trial to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the new guidelines but left the injunction in place.&lt;ref name="PCtimeline"&gt;[http://www.pledgechallenge.org/timeline/] ''USAID v. AOSI'' Timeline. Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the district court held that the new guidelines did not cure the constitutional problems with the requirement.&lt;ref name="brennan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The government appealed again to the Second Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the government again revised the affiliate guidelines.  In July 2011, the Second Circuit held that the requirement was unconstitutional and that the new affiliate guidelines did not cure the violation.  The Supreme Court granted review in January 2013.&lt;ref name="PCtimeline"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.]]'' that the requirement was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court explained that the requirement would "plainly violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]" if “enacted as a direct regulation of speech,” and that the question in the case was whether the government could “nonetheless impose that requirement as a condition on the receipt of federal funds.”  The Court noted that it had previously struck down “conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.”  The Court concluded that the requirement was just such a condition because it “compel[led] as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program,” and therefore that the requirement violated the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[John Roberts|Roberts, John]]|title=AGENCY FOR INT’L DEVELOPMENT v. ALLIANCE FOR

The '''Bhopal disaster''', also referred to as the '''Bhopal gas tragedy''', was a [[gas leak]] incident on the night of 2–3 December 1984 at the [[Union Carbide India Limited]] (UCIL) [[pesticide]] plant in [[Bhopal]], Madhya Pradesh, India. It is considered to be [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Industrial disasters|the world's worst]] [[List of industrial disasters|industrial disaster]].&lt;ref name="MandavilliUnfolding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="convictions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm|title=Bhopal trial: Eight convicted over India gas disaster |date=7 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 June 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607185745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8725140.stm| archivedate= 7 June 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 500,000 people were exposed to [[methyl isocyanate|methyl isocyanate (MIC)]] gas. The highly toxic substance made its way into and around the small towns located near the plant.&lt;ref name="Varma 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varma|first=Roli|author2=Daya R. Varma|title=The Bhopal Disaster of 1984|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology and Society|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death toll was 2,259. The [[government of Madhya Pradesh]] confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.&lt;ref name="rehabilitation1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mp.gov.in/bgtrrdmp/relief.htm |title=Madhya Pradesh Government : Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, Bhopal |publisher=Mp.gov.in |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020821/http://www.mp.gov.in/bgtrrdmp/relief.htm |archivedate=18 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.&lt;ref name="first3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.first14.com/bhopal-gas-tragedy-92-injuries-termed-minor-822.html |title=Bhopal Gas Tragedy: 92% injuries termed "minor" |accessdate=26 June 2010 |newspaper=First14 News |date=21 June 2010 |author=AK Dubey |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qmWBEWcb?url=http://www.first14.com/bhopal-gas-tragedy-92-injuries-termed-minor-822.html |archivedate=26 June 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005"/&gt;  The cause of the disaster remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. [[Union Carbide Corporation]] (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.

The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to [[Eveready Industries India|Eveready Industries India Limited]] (EIIL), which subsequently merged with [[McLeod Russel|McLeod Russel (India) Ltd]]. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. [[Dow Chemical Company]] purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases were filed in the [[District Courts of India|District Court]] of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times|title=Company Defends Chief in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/company-defends-chief-in-bhopal-disaster/ | date=3 August 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=U.S. Exec Arrest Sought in Bhopal Disaster |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/31/world/main5201155.shtml | date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by [[Law of India|Indian law]].

==The pre-event phase==
The UCIL factory was built in 1969 to produce the pesticide Sevin (UCC's brand name for [[carbaryl]]) using [[methyl isocyanate|methyl isocyanate (MIC)]] as an intermediate.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |title=The Bhopal Saga—Causes and Consequences of the World's Largest Industrial Disaster |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0FqO8XKy9NRZDNzTkZQeVJQbE0/edit?pli=1 |year=2005 |publisher=Universities Press |location=India |isbn=978-81-7371-515-0 |doi=10.13140/2.1.3457.5364}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MIC production plant was added to the UCIL site in 1979.&lt;ref name="UCCmanual1976"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methyl isocyanate |year=1976 |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |location=New York}} F-41443A-7/76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCCmanual1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carbon monoxide, Phosgene and Methyl isocyanate.

Methyl Isocyanate Unit |authors=Behl VK, Agarwal VN, Choudhary SP, Khanna S |location=Bhopal |publisher=Union Carbide India Limited, Agricultural Products Division |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical process employed in the Bhopal plant had [[methylamine]] reacting with [[phosgene]] to form MIC, which was then reacted with [[1-naphthol]] to form the final product, carbaryl. Another manufacturer, Bayer, also used this MIC-intermediate process at the chemical plant once owned by UCC at [[Institute, West Virginia]], in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kovel"&gt;Kovel (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201103181523|title=Bayer gives up fight to restart Institute MIC unit|author=Ward, Ken Jr.|date=18 March 2011|work=The Charleston Gazette|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bhopal plant was built, other manufacturers (including [[Bayer]]) produced carbaryl without MIC, though at a greater [[manufacturing cost]]. This "route" differed from the MIC-free routes used elsewhere, in which the same raw materials were combined in a different manufacturing order, with phosgene first reacting with naphthol to form a chloroformate ester, which was then reacted with methylamine. In the early 1980s, the demand for pesticides had fallen, but production continued, leading to build-up of stores of unused MIC where that method was used.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt; 

===Earlier leaks===
In 1976, two local trade unions complained of pollution within the plant.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/electronic_journals/asian_pacific_newsletter/archives/Documents/asian_pacific_newsletter2_2006.pdf |title=The Bhopal Disaster 1984&amp;nbsp;– working conditions and the role of the trade unions |format=PDF |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |journal=Asian Pacific Newsletter on Occupational Health and Safety |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021643/http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/electronic_journals/asian_pacific_newsletter/archives/Documents/asian_pacific_newsletter2_2006.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a worker was accidentally splashed with [[phosgene]] as he was carrying out a maintenance job of the plant's pipes. In a panic, he removed his [[gas mask]] and inhaled a large amount of toxic phosgene gas, leading to his death just 72 hours later.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006" /&gt; Following these events, the journalist, [[Rajkumar Keswani]] began investigating and published his findings in Bhopal's local paper ''Rapat,'' in which he urged "Wake up people of Bhopal, you are on the edge of a volcano". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/11/world/indian-journalist-offered-warning.html|title=INDIAN JOURNALIST OFFERED WARNING|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|access-date=2 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to be really well informed in minutes|last=The Week|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-09194-706-4|location=Croydon|pages=222–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1982, a phosgene leak exposed 24 workers, all of whom were admitted to a hospital. None of the workers had been ordered to wear protective masks. One month later, in February 1982, an MIC leak affected 18 workers. In August 1982, a chemical engineer came into contact with liquid MIC, resulting in burns over 30 percent of his body. Later that same year, in October 1982, there was another MIC leak. In attempting to stop the leak, the MIC supervisor suffered severe chemical burns and two other workers were severely exposed to the gases. During 1983 and 1984, there were leaks of MIC, chlorine, monomethylamine, phosgene, and [[carbon tetrachloride]], sometimes in combination.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006" /&gt;

==The leakage and its subsequent effects==

=== Liquid MIC storage ===
The Bhopal UCIL facility housed three underground 68,000 liters liquid MIC storage tanks: E610, E611, and E619. In the months leading up to the December leak, liquid MIC production was in progress and being used to fill these tanks. UCC safety regulations specified that no one tank should be filled more than 50% (here, 30 tons) with liquid MIC. Each tank was pressurized with inert nitrogen gas. This pressurization allowed liquid MIC to be pumped out of each tank as needed, and also kept impurities out of the tanks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.engr.utexas.edu/ethics/profresp/lesson2/engineers.cfm|title=UT Austin College of Engineering -- Ethics Modules :: Go Public|website=apps.engr.utexas.edu|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1984, tank E610 lost the ability to effectively contain most of its nitrogen gas pressure. It meant that the liquid MIC contained within could not be pumped out. At the time of this failure, tank E610 contained 42 tons of liquid MIC.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72JUj80ZTIwC|title=Wealth from Waste|last=Agarwal|first=S. K.|date=1 January 2005|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176488235|page=131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this failure, MIC production was halted at the Bhopal facility, and parts of the plant were shut down for maintenance. Maintenance included the shutdown of the plant's flare tower so that a corroded pipe could be repaired.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With the flare tower still out of service, production of carbaryl was resumed in late November, using MIC stored in the two tanks still in service. An attempt to re-establish pressure in tank E610 on 1 December failed, so the 42 tons of liquid MIC contained within still could not be pumped out of it.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===The release===
[[File:Bhopal Plant 7.JPG|thumb|Tank 610 in 2010. During decontamination of the plant, tank 610 was removed from its foundation and left aside.]]
[[File:Preparation of carbaryl as in Bhopal.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|[[Methylamine]] ('''1''') reacts with [[phosgene]] ('''2''') producing [[methyl isocyanate]] ('''3''') which reacts with [[1-naphthol]] ('''4''') to yield [[carbaryl]] ('''5''')]]

In early December 1984, most of the plant's MIC related safety systems were malfunctioning and many valves and lines were in poor condition. In addition, several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service as well as the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;  During the late evening hours of 2 December 1984, water was believed to have entered a side pipe and into Tank E610 whilst trying to unclog it, which contained 42 tons of MIC that had been there since late October.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;
The introduction of water into the tank subsequently resulted in a [[Thermal runaway|runaway]] [[exothermic reaction]], which was accelerated by contaminants, high ambient temperatures and various other factors, such as the presence of iron from corroding non-stainless steel pipelines.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The pressure in tank E610, although initially normal at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., had increased by a factor of five to 10 psi (34.5 to 69&amp;nbsp;kPa) by 11 p.m. Two different senior refinery employees assumed the reading was instrumentation malfunction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/world/the-disaster-in-bhopal-workers-recall-horror.html|title=THE DISASTER IN BHOPAL: WORKERS RECALL HORROR|last=Times|first=Stuart Diamond, Special To The New York|date=30 January 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., workers in the MIC area were feeling the effects of minor exposure to MIC gas, and began to look for a leak. One was found by 11:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., and reported to the MIC supervisor on duty at the time. The decision was made to address the problem after a 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. tea break, and in the meantime, employees were instructed to continue looking for leaks. The incident was discussed by MIC area employees during the break.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the five minutes after the tea break ended at 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the reaction in tank E610 reached a critical state at an alarming speed. Temperatures in the tank were off the scale, maxed out beyond  {{convert|25|°C|°F}}, and the pressure in the tank was indicated at 40 psi (275.8&amp;nbsp;kPa). One employee witnessed a concrete slab above tank E610 crack as the emergency relief valve burst open, and pressure in the tank continued to increase to 55 psi (379.2&amp;nbsp;kPa) even after atmospheric venting of toxic MIC gas had begun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct atmospheric venting should have been prevented or at least partially mitigated by at least three safety devices which were malfunctioning, not in use, insufficiently sized or otherwise rendered inoperable:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Patrick McClelland|title=BBC One Night In Bhopal 2004 TVRip d0x|date=31 December 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJg19W8x_Ls|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhopal.net/what-happened/that-night-december-3-1984/what-triggered-the-disaster/|title=What Triggered the Disaster? {{!}} International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal|website=bhopal.net|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A refrigeration system meant to cool tanks containing liquid MIC, shut down in January 1982, and whose freon had been removed in June 1984. Since the MIC storage system assumed refrigeration, its high temperature alarm, set to sound at {{convert|11|°C|°F}} had long since been disconnected, and tank storage temperatures ranged between {{convert|15|°C|°F}} and {{convert|40|°C|°F}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-15-22804|title=Remembering Bhopal: NES Workshop 2015|last=Jones|first=Tommy Ray|date=16 April 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A flare tower, to burn the MIC gas as it escaped, which had had a connecting pipe removed for maintenance, and was improperly sized to neutralise a leak of the size produced by tank E610
* A vent gas scrubber, which had been deactivated at the time and was in 'standby' mode, and similarly had insufficient [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] and power to safely stop a leak of the magnitude produced

About 30 metric tons of MIC escaped from the tank into the atmosphere in 45 to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name="Varma 2005" /&gt; This would increase to 40 metric tons within two hours time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thephoenixsun.com/archives/7118|title=The Phoenix Sun {{!}} Disaster Politics {{!}} Bhopal to Copenhagen|website=thephoenixsun.com|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gases were blown in a southeasterly direction over Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Bhopal Nightmare|episodelink=|series=Seconds from Disaster|serieslink=Seconds from Disaster|credits=Narrator: Ashton Smith|network=Nat Geo|date=10 October 2011|season=4|number=6|minutes=5:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UCIL employee triggered the plant's alarm system at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. as the concentration of gas in and around the plant became difficult to tolerate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Activation of the system triggered two siren alarms: one that sounded inside the UCIL plant, and a second directed outward to the public and the city of Bhopal. The two siren systems had been decoupled from one another in 1982, so that it was possible to leave the factory warning siren on while turning off the public one, and this is exactly what was done: the public siren briefly sounded at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. and was quickly turned off, as per company procedure meant to avoid alarming the public around the factory over tiny leaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|title=The Bhopal Disaster (India's Environment 1984-85)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528042900/http://www.cseindia.org/userfiles/THE%20BHOPAL%20DISASTER.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Patrick McClelland|title=BBC One Night In Bhopal 2004 TVRip d0x|date=31 December 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJg19W8x_Ls|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers, meanwhile, evacuated the UCIL plant, travelling upwind.

Bhopal's superintendent of police was informed by telephone, by a town inspector, that residents of the neighbourhood of Chola (about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the plant) were fleeing a gas leak at approximately 1 a.m.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Calls to the UCIL plant by police between 1:25 and 2:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. gave assurances twice that "everything is OK", and on the last attempt made, "we don't know what has happened, sir".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the lack of timely information exchange between UCIL and Bhopal authorities, the city's [[Hamidia Hospital]] was first told that the gas leak was suspected to be [[ammonia]], then [[phosgene]]. Finally, they received an updated report that it was "MIC" (rather than "methyl isocyanate"), which hospital staff had never heard of, had no antidote for, and received no immediate information about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Disaster One|title=Seconds From Disaster - Bhopal Nightmare|date=18 October 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOIFK0E1Pgs|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIC gas leak emanating from tank E610 petered out at approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the plant's public siren was sounded for an extended period of time, after first having been quickly silenced an hour and a half earlier.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTESCgAAQBAJ|title=An Invitation to Environmental Sociology|last=Bell|first=Michael Mayerfeld|last2=Ashwood|first2=Loka L.|date=1 July 2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452275789|page=164|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some minutes after the public siren sounded, a UCIL employee walked to a police control room to both inform them of the leak (their first acknowledgement that one had occurred at all), and that "the leak had been plugged."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most city residents who were exposed to the MIC gas were first made aware of the leak by exposure to the gas itself, or by opening their doors to investigate commotion, rather than having been instructed to [[shelter in place]], or to evacuate before the arrival of the gas in the first place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Acute effects===
[[File:Glutathione + Methylisocyanate Reaction.svg|thumb|Reversible reaction of [[glutathione]] (top) with [[methyl isocyanate]] (MIC, middle) allows the MIC to be transported into the body]]

The initial effects of exposure were coughing, severe eye irritation and a feeling of suffocation, burning in the respiratory tract, [[blepharospasm]], breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting. People awakened by these symptoms fled away from the plant. Those who ran inhaled more than those who had a vehicle to ride. Owing to their height, children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations, as methyl isocyanate gas is approximately twice as dense as air and hence in an open environment has a tendency to fall toward the ground.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

Thousands of people had died by the following morning. Primary causes of deaths were [[choking]], reflexogenic [[circulatory collapse]] and [[pulmonary oedema]]. Findings during [[autopsy|autopsies]] revealed changes not only in the lungs but also [[cerebral oedema]], [[tubular necrosis]] of the kidneys, [[Fatty liver|fatty degeneration of the liver]] and necrotising [[enteritis]].&lt;ref name="Sriramachari"&gt;Sriramachari (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stillbirth]] rate increased by up to 300% and [[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|neonatal mortality]] rate by around 200%.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

=== Gas cloud composition ===
Apart from MIC, based on laboratory simulation conditions, the gas cloud most likely also contained [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[methyl amine]], [[dimethylamine]], [[trimethylamine]] and [[carbon dioxide]], that was either present in the tank or was produced in the storage tank when MIC, chloroform and water reacted. The gas cloud, composed mainly of materials denser than air, stayed close to the ground and spread in the southeasterly direction affecting the nearby communities.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; The chemical reactions may have produced a liquid or solid [[aerosol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=30 September 2012|title=Bhopal atmospheric dispersion revisited|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=233–234|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.055|pmid=22819479|vauthors=Havens J, Walker H, Spicer T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immediate aftermath====
In the immediate aftermath, the plant was closed to outsiders (including UCC) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]], which subsequently failed to make data public, contributing to the confusion. The initial investigation was conducted entirely by the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) and the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. The UCC chairman and CEO [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], together with a technical team, immediately traveled to India. Upon arrival Anderson was placed under house arrest and urged by the Indian government to leave the country within 24 hours. Union Carbide organized a team of international medical experts, as well as supplies and equipment, to work with the local Bhopal medical community, and the UCC technical team began assessing the cause of the gas leak.

The health care system immediately became overloaded. In the severely affected areas, nearly 70 percent were under-qualified doctors. Medical staff were unprepared for the thousands of casualties. Doctors and hospitals were not aware of proper treatment methods for MIC gas inhalation.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

[[File:Bhopal gas disaster girl by pablo bartholomew.jpg|alt=The image of a deceased female child, victim of the Bhopal MIC gas leak|thumb|273x273px|''Bhopal gas disaster girl'', the burial of one iconic victim of the gas leak (4 December 1984)]]
There were mass funerals and cremations. Photographer [[Pablo Bartholomew|Pablo Bartholemew]], on commission with press agency [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho]], took an iconic color photograph of a burial on 4 December, ''Bhopal gas disaster girl.'' Another photographer present, [[Raghu Rai]], took a black and white photo. The photographers did not ask for the identity of the father or child as she was buried, and no relative has since confirmed it. As such, the identity of the girl remains unknown. Both photos became symbolic of the suffering of victims of the Bhopal disaster, and Bartholomew's went on to win the 1984 World Press Photo of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1985/world-press-photo-year/pablo-bartholomew|title=1985 Pablo Bartholomew WY|website=World Press Photo|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few days, trees in the vicinity became barren and bloated animal carcasses had to be disposed of. 170,000 people were treated at hospitals and temporary dispensaries, and 2,000 buffalo, goats, and other animals were collected and buried. Supplies, including food, became scarce owing to suppliers' safety fears. Fishing was prohibited causing further supply shortages.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Lacking any safe alternative, on 16 December, tanks 611 and 619 were emptied of the remaining MIC by reactivating the plant and continuing the manufacture of pesticide. Despite safety precautions such as having water carrying helicopters continually overflying the plant, this led to a second mass evacuation from Bhopal. The Government of India passed the "Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act" that gave the government rights to represent all victims, whether or not in India. Complaints of lack of information or misinformation were widespread. An Indian government spokesman said, "Carbide is more interested in getting information from us than in helping our relief work".&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Formal statements were issued that air, water, vegetation and foodstuffs were safe, but warned not to consume fish. The number of children exposed to the gases was at least 200,000.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Within weeks, the State Government established a number of hospitals, clinics and mobile units in the gas-affected area to treat the victims.

===Subsequent legal action===
[[File:BHOPAL (231583728).jpg|thumb|upright|Victims of Bhopal disaster march in September 2006 demanding the extradition of American [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] from the United States.|alt=Number of women pictured in black and white colour, sitting and protesting against Anderson and the company.]]
Legal proceedings involving UCC, the United States and Indian governments, local Bhopal authorities, and the disaster victims started immediately after the catastrophe. The Indian Government passed the Bhopal Gas Leak Act in March 1985, allowing the Government of India to act as the legal representative for victims of the disaster,&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; leading to the beginning of legal proceedings. Initial lawsuits were generated in the United States federal court system. On 17 April 1985, Federal District court judge [[John F. Keenan]] (overseeing one lawsuit) suggested that "'fundamental human decency' required Union Carbide to provide between $5 million and $10 million to immediately help the injured" and suggested the money could be quickly distributed through the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/120143461|title=19 Apr 1985, Page 56 - Arizona Republic at Newspapers.com|website=$5 million in relief offered to gas-leak victims|access-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCC, on the notion that doing so did not constitute an admission of liability and the figure could be credited toward any future settlement or judgement, offered a $5 million relief fund two days later.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Indian government turned down the offer.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

In March 1986 UCC proposed a settlement figure, endorsed by plaintiffs' U.S. attorneys, of {{Nowrap|$350 million}} that would, according to the company, "generate a fund for Bhopal victims of between {{Nowrap|$500–600 million}} over 20 years". In May, litigation was transferred from the United States to Indian courts by a U.S. District Court ruling. Following an appeal of this decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a "separate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in India".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

The Government of India refused the offer from Union Carbide and claimed US${{Nowrap|3.3 billion}}.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] told both sides to come to an agreement and "start with a clean slate" in November 1988.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; Eventually, in an out-of-court settlement reached in February 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay US${{Nowrap|470 million}} for damages caused in the Bhopal disaster.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The amount was immediately paid.

Throughout 1990, the [[Indian Supreme Court]] heard appeals against the settlement. In October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the original {{Nowrap|$470 million}}, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The Court ordered the Indian government "to purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptoms" and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also requested UCC and its subsidiary UCIL "voluntarily" fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimated {{Nowrap|$17 million}}, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster. The company agreed to this.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

===Post-settlement activity===

In 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable [[homicide]] case in which he was named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an [[extradition]] from the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

In 2004, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Indian government to release any remaining settlement funds to victims. And in September 2006, the Welfare Commission for Bhopal Gas Victims announced that all original compensation claims and revised petitions had been "cleared".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York City upheld the dismissal of remaining claims in the case of ''Bano v. Union Carbide Corporation'' in 2006. This move blocked plaintiffs' motions for class certification and claims for property damages and remediation. In the view of UCC, "the ruling reaffirms UCC's long-held positions and finally puts to rest—both procedurally and substantively—the issues raised in the class action complaint first filed against Union Carbide in 1999 by Haseena Bi and several organisations representing the residents of Bhopal".&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

In June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by [[negligence]]: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V. P. Gokhale, managing director; Kishore Kamdar, vice-president; J. Mukund, works manager; S. P. Chowdhury, production manager; K. V. Shetty, plant superintendent; and S. I. Qureshi, production assistant. They were each sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined [[Indian rupee|Rs.]]100,000 (US$2,124). All were released on bail shortly after the verdict.

US Federal class action litigation, ''Sahu v. Union Carbide and Warren Anderson'', was filed in 1999 under the [[Alien Tort Statute|U.S. Alien Torts Claims Act]] (ATCA), which provides for civil remedies for "crimes against humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pappu

==Long-term effects==
In 2018, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called it the "world’s worst industrial disaster."&lt;ref name="MandavilliUnfolding"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mandavilli |first1=Apoorva |title=The World’s Worst Industrial Disaster Is Still Unfolding |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-is-still-unfolding/560726/ |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term health effects===
Some data about the health effects are still not available. The [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) was forbidden to publish health effect data until 1994.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

A total of 36 wards were marked by the authorities as being "gas affected," affecting a population of 520,000. Of these, 200,000 were below 15 years of age, and 3,000 were pregnant women. The official immediate death toll was 2,259, and in 1991, 3,928 deaths had been officially certified. Ingrid Eckerman estimated 8,000 died within two weeks.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckerman |first=Ingrid |title=Chemical industry and public health. Bhopal as an example |year=2001 |publisher=Nordic School of Public Health |location=Gothenburg, Sweden |url=http://www.lakareformiljon.org/images/stories/dokument/2009/bhopal_gas_disaster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of Madhya Pradesh]] confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.&lt;ref name="rehabilitation1"/&gt;

Later, the affected area was expanded to include 700,000 citizens. A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.&lt;ref name="first3" /&gt;

A [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of 80,021 exposed people was registered, along with a control group, a cohort of 15,931 people from areas not exposed to MIC. Nearly every year since 1986, they have answered the same questionnaire. It shows [[mortality rate|overmortality]] and [[Disease#Morbidity|overmorbidity]] in the exposed group. [[Bias]] and [[confounding factor]]s cannot be excluded from the study. Because of migration and other factors, 75% of the cohort is lost, as the ones who moved out are not followed.&lt;ref name=Eckerman2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharma DC |journal=The Lancet |title=Bhopal study represents "missed opportunity" |year=2013 |volume=382 |issue=9908 |page=1870 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of clinical studies are performed. The quality varies, but the different reports support each other.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Studied and reported long term health effects are:
* Eyes: Chronic conjunctivitis, scars on cornea, corneal opacities, early cataracts
* Respiratory tracts: Obstructive and/or restrictive disease, pulmonary fibrosis, aggravation of TB and chronic bronchitis
* Neurological system: Impairment of memory, finer motor skills, numbness etc.
* Psychological problems: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
* Children’s health: Peri- and neonatal death rates increased. Failure to grow, intellectual impairment, etc.

Missing or insufficient fields for research are female reproduction, chromosomal aberrations, cancer, immune deficiency, neurological sequelae, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and children born after the disaster. Late cases that might never be highlighted are respiratory insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency (cor pulmonale), cancer and tuberculosis. Bhopal now has high rates of birth defects and records a [[miscarriage]] rate 7x higher than the national average. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A 2014 report in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' quotes a "spokesperson for the Bhopal Medical Appeal, which runs free health clinics for survivors" as saying "An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 survivors still struggle with serious medical conditions including nerve damage, growth problems, gynecological disorders, respiratory issues, birth defects, and elevated rates of cancer and tuberculosis."&lt;ref&gt;

===Health care===
The Government of India had focused primarily on increasing the hospital-based services for gas victims thus hospitals had been built after the disaster. When UCC wanted to sell its shares in UCIL, it was directed by the Supreme Court to finance a 500-bed hospital for the medical care of the survivors. Thus, Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) was inaugurated in 1998 and was obliged to give free care for survivors for eight years. BMHRC was a 350-bedded super speciality hospital where heart surgery and hemodialysis were done. There was a dearth of gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics. Eight mini-units (outreach health centres) were started and free health care for gas victims were to be offered until 2006.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The management had also faced problems with strikes, and the quality of the health care being disputed.&lt;ref name=BMHT2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhopal Memorial Hospital closed indefinitely|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/04/stories/2005070401510500.htm|work=The Hindu|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time line|url=http://www.bhopal.net/delhi-marchers/factsheets/BMHT%20sheet.pdf|publisher=Bhopal Memorial Hospital Trust|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406192139/http://www.bhopal.net/delhi-marchers/factsheets/BMHT%20sheet.pdf|archivedate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sambhavna Trust]] is a charitable trust, registered in 1995, that gives [[modern medicine|modern]] as well as [[ayurvedic]] treatments to gas victims, free of charge.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sambhavna"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sambhavna Trust |title=The Bhopal Medical appeal |url=http://www.bhopal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental rehabilitation===
When the factory was closed in 1986, pipes, drums and tanks were sold. The MIC and the Sevin plants are still there, as are storages of different residues. Isolation material is falling down and spreading.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The area around the plant was used as a dumping area for hazardous chemicals. In 1982 [[tubewell]]s in the vicinity of the UCIL factory had to be abandoned and tests in 1989 performed by UCC's laboratory revealed that soil and water samples collected from near the factory and inside the plant were toxic to fish.&lt;ref name="UCC1989"&gt;{{cite book |title=Presence of Toxic Ingredients in Soil/Water Samples Inside Plant Premises |location=USA |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other studies had also shown polluted soil and groundwater in the area. Reported polluting compounds include [[1-naphthol]], [[naphthalene]], [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], [[tar|tarry residue]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], toxic [[organochlorine]]s, volatile organochlorine compounds, [[chromium]], copper, nickel, lead, [[hexachloroethane]], [[hexachlorobutadiene]], and the pesticide [[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]].&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

In order to provide safe drinking water to the population around the UCIL factory, Government of Madhya Pradesh presented a scheme for improvement of water supply.&lt;ref name="GovMP" /&gt; In December 2008, the Madhya Pradesh High Court decided that the toxic waste should be incinerated at [[Ankleshwar]] in Gujarat, which was met by protests from activists all over India.&lt;ref name="Times of India 16 Dec 2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Carbide waste to go: HC |date=16 December 2008 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-16/india/27937330_1_carbide-waste-toxic-waste-direction-for-safe-disposal |work= The Times of India|accessdate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 2012, the Centre for incineration of toxic Bhopal waste agreed to pay {{INRConvert |250|m|nolink=yes}} to dispose of UCIL chemical plants waste in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-09/india/32140129_1_toxic-waste-gom-babulal-gaur | title=Centre to pay Rs 25 crore to dump Bhopal waste in Germany| date=9 June 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2012, Supreme court directed the Union and Madhya Pradesh Governments to take immediate steps for disposal of toxic waste lying around and inside the factory within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=J.|last=Venkatesan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3747020.ece |title=Supreme Court orders disposal of Bhopal toxic waste in six months |date=10 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. court rejected the lawsuit blaming UCC for causing soil and water pollution around the site of the plant and ruled that responsibility for remedial measures or related claims rested with the State Government and not with UCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-28/india/32456094_1_ucil-union-carbide-india-ucc| title=US court absolves Union Carbide of liability in Bhopal tragedy | date=28 June 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the state government invited various Indian architects to enter their "concept for development of a memorial complex for Bhopal gas tragedy victims at the site of Union Carbide".

===Occupational and habitation rehabilitation===
33 of the 50 planned work-sheds for gas victims started. All except one was closed down by 1992. 1986, the MP government invested in the Special Industrial Area Bhopal. 152 of the planned 200 work sheds were built and in 2000, 16 were partially functioning. It was estimated that 50,000 persons need alternative jobs, and that less than 100 gas victims had found regular employment under the government's scheme. The government also planned 2,486 flats in two- and four-story buildings in what is called the "widow's colony" outside Bhopal. The water did not reach the upper floors and it was not possible to keep cattle which were their primary occupation. Infrastructure like buses, schools, etc. were missing for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

===Economic rehabilitation===
Immediate relieves were decided two days after the tragedy. Relief measures commenced in 1985 when food was distributed for a short period along with ration cards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; [[Madhya Pradesh]] government's finance department allocated {{INRConvert|874|m}} for victim relief in July 1985.&lt;ref name="India1985_1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Press Institute of India|title=Data India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn9DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1985|publisher=Press Institute of India|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India1985_2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Press Institute of India|title=Data India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn9DAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1985|publisher=Press Institute of India|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow pension of {{INRConvert|200}}/per month (later {{INRConvert|750}}) were provided. The government also decided to pay {{INRConvert|1500}} to families with monthly income {{INRConvert|500}} or less. As a result of the interim relief, more children were able to attend school, more money was spent on treatment and food, and housing also eventually improved. From 1990 interim relief of {{INRConvert|200}} was paid to everyone in the family who was born before the disaster.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

The final compensation, including interim relief for personal injury was for the majority {{INRConvert|25|k}}. For death claim, the average sum paid out was {{INRConvert|62|k}}. Each claimant were to be categorised by a doctor. In court, the claimants were expected to prove "beyond reasonable doubt" that death or injury in each case was attributable to exposure. In 1992, 44 percent of the claimants still had to be medically examined.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

By the end of October 2003, according to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, compensation had been awarded to 554,895 people for injuries received and 15,310 survivors of those killed. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.&lt;ref name="broughton" /&gt;

In 2007, 1,029,517 cases were registered and decided. Number of awarded cases were 574,304 and number of rejected cases 455,213.

===Other impacts===
In 1985, [[Henry Waxman]], a California Democrat, called for a U.S. government inquiry into the Bhopal disaster, which resulted in U.S. legislation regarding the accidental release of toxic chemicals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BP, Bhopal and the humble Indian brinjal|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/BP-Bhopal-and-the-humble-Indian-brinjal/Article1-561254.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125081836/http://www.hindustantimes.com/BP-Bhopal-and-the-humble-Indian-brinjal/Article1-561254.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|accessdate=26 June 2010|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=22 June 2010|author=Dipankar De Sarkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of the disaster: overview==
There are two main lines of argument involving the disaster.
The "Corporate Negligence" point of view argues that the disaster was caused by a potent combination of under-maintained and decaying facilities, a weak attitude towards safety, and an undertrained workforce, culminating in worker actions that inadvertently enabled water to penetrate the MIC tanks in the absence of properly working safeguards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;

The "Worker Sabotage" point of view argues that it was not physically possible for the water to enter the tank without concerted human effort, and that extensive testimony and engineering analysis leads to a conclusion that water entered the tank when a rogue individual employee hooked a water hose directly to an empty valve on the side of the tank. This point of view further argues that the Indian government took extensive actions to hide this possibility in order to attach blame to UCC.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;

Theories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into the tank.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan"/&gt;

This water entry route could not be reproduced despite strenuous efforts by motivated parties.&lt;ref name="Weisman NYT Dec 1985 p.5"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven R. Weisman|title=Bhopal a Year Later: An Eerie Silence|publisher=The New York Times|date=5 December 1985|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCC claims that a "disgruntled worker" deliberately connecting a hose to a pressure gauge connection was the real cause.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;

Early the next morning, a UCIL manager asked the instrument engineer to replace the gauge. UCIL's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection; the investigation was totally controlled by the government, denying UCC investigators access to the tank or interviews with the operators.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt;

===Causes of the disaster: The "corporate negligence" argument===

This point of view argues that management (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production at the end of 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money— including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt; Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2006"/&gt;

'''Underinvestment'''

Underinvestment is cited as contributing to an environment.   In attempts to reduce expenses, $1.25 million of cuts were placed upon the plant which affected the factory's employees and their conditions. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kurzman argues that "cuts&amp;nbsp;... meant less stringent quality control and thus looser safety rules. A pipe leaked? Don't replace it, employees said they were told&amp;nbsp;... MIC workers needed more training? They could do with less. Promotions were halted, seriously affecting employee morale and driving some of the most skilled&amp;nbsp;... elsewhere".&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987"&gt;Kurzman (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were forced to use English manuals, even though only a few had a grasp of the language.&lt;ref name="Chouhan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chouhan TR |origyear=1994|year=2004 |title=Bhopal: the Inside Story — Carbide Workers Speak Out on the World's Worst Industrial Disaster. |location=US and India |publisher=The Apex Press and Other India Press |id=  and |display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1-891843-30-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassels"&gt;Cassels (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research highlights a gradual deterioration of safety practices in regard to the MIC, which had become less relevant to plant operations. By 1984, only six of the original twelve operators were still working with MIC and the number of supervisory personnel had also been halved. No maintenance supervisor was placed on the night shift and instrument readings were taken every two hours, rather than the previous and required one-hour readings.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987" /&gt; Workers made complaints about the cuts through their union but were ignored. One employee was fired after going on a 15-day hunger strike. 70% of the plant's employees were fined before the disaster for refusing to deviate from the proper safety regulations under pressure from the management.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzman1987" /&gt;

In addition, some observers, such as those writing in the Trade Environmental Database (TED) Case Studies as part of the Mandala Project from [[American University]], have pointed to "serious communication problems and management gaps between Union Carbide and its Indian operation", characterised by "the parent {{sic|companies}} hands-off approach to its overseas operation" and "cross-cultural barriers".&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;Mandala Project (1996), Trade Environmental Database (TED) Case Study 233. Volume 5, Number 1, January 1996 {{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/bhopal.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101080203/http://www1.american.edu/TED/bhopal.htm |archivedate=1 November 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adequacy of equipment and safety regulations'''

The factory was not well equipped to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working for four years and there was only one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eckerman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lepowski /&gt; The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with [[sodium hydroxide]] (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level.&lt;ref name=Lepowski/&gt; The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lepowski/&gt; Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski" /&gt; Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt; As MIC is water-soluble, [[deluge gun]]s were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski"&gt;Lepowski&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt;

According to the operators, the MIC tank pressure gauge had been malfunctioning for roughly a week. Other tanks were used, rather than repairing the gauge. The build-up in temperature and pressure is believed to have affected the magnitude of the gas release.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lepowski" /&gt; UCC admitted in their own investigation report that most of the safety systems were not functioning on the night of 3 December 1984.&lt;ref name="UCC1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhopal Methyl Isocyanate Incident. Investigation Team Report |location=Danbury, CT |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the MIC plant, following government guidelines, was "Indianized" by UCIL engineers to maximise the use of indigenous materials and products. Mumbai-based Humphreys and Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., were the main consultants, [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] fabricated the MIC storage tanks, and Taylor of India Ltd. provided the instrumentation.&lt;ref name=D&gt;D'Silva, The Black Box of Bhopal (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during civil action suits in India, it emerged that the plant was not prepared for problems. No action plans had been established to cope with incidents of this magnitude. This included not informing local authorities of the quantities or dangers of chemicals used and manufactured at Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kovel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerman2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;

'''Safety audits'''

Safety audits were done every year in the US and European UCC plants, but only every two years in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="varadarajan1985" /&gt; Before a "Business Confidential" safety audit by UCC in May 1982, the senior officials of the corporation were well aware of "a total of 61 hazards, 30 of them major and 11 minor in the dangerous phosgene/methyl isocyanate units" in Bhopal.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhopal Gas Tragedy 1984- ? A report from the Sambhavna Trust, Bhopal, India |year=1998 |publisher=Bhopal People's Health and Documentation clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the audit 1982, it was indicated that worker performance was below standards.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt; Ten major concerns were listed.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; UCIL prepared an action plan, but UCC never sent a follow-up team to Bhopal. Many of the items in the 1982 report were temporarily fixed, but by 1984, conditions had again deteriorated.&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985" /&gt; In September 1984, an internal UCC report on the West Virginia plant in the USA revealed a number of defects and malfunctions. It warned that "a runaway reaction could occur in the MIC unit storage tanks, and that the planned response would not be timely or effective enough to prevent catastrophic failure of the tanks". This report was never forwarded to the Bhopal plant, although the main design was the same.&lt;ref name="Lapierre"&gt;{{cite book |title=It Was Five Past Midnight in Bhopal |authors=Lapierre D, Moro J |year=2001 |publisher=Full Circle Publishing |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of the disaster: the "disgruntled employee sabotage" case===
Now owned by [[Dow Chemical Company]], Union Carbide maintains a website dedicated to the tragedy and claims that the incident was the result of sabotage, stating that sufficient safety systems were in place and operative to prevent the intrusion of water.&lt;ref name="ucs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Union Carbide Corporation Regarding the Bhopal Tragedy |url=http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |publisher=Bhopal Information Center |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904032258/http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |archivedate=4 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The impossibility of the "negligence" argument'''

According to the "Corporate Negligence" argument, workers had been cleaning out pipes with water nearby. This water was diverted due to a combination of improper maintenance, leaking and clogging, and eventually ended up in the MIC storage tank. Indian scientists also suggested that additional water might have been introduced as a "back-flow" from a defectively designed vent-gas scrubber. None of these theoretical routes of entry were ever successfully demonstrated during tests by the [[Central Bureau of Investigators]] (CBI) and UCIL engineers.&lt;ref name="Chouhan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985"&gt;[http://www.bhopal.net/oldsite/documentlibrary/unionreport1985.html The Trade Union Report on Bhopal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715082437/http://www.bhopal.net/oldsite/documentlibrary/unionreport1985.html |date=15 July 2009 }}, Geneva, Switzerland: ICFTU-ICEF, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varadarajan1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Varadarajan S |title=Report on Scientific Studies on the Factors Related to Bhopal Toxic Gas Leakage |publisher=Indian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research |location=New Delhi |year=1985|url=https://bhopalgasdisaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/csir-report-on-scientific-studies-december-1985.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCCreport1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bhopal Methyl Isocyanate Incident |year=1985 |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |location=Danbury, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Union Carbide commissioned analysis conducted by [[Arthur D. Little]] claims that the Negligence argument was impossible for several tangible reasons:&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988" /&gt;
# The pipes being used by the nearby workers were only 1/2 inch in diameter and were physically incapable of producing enough hydraulic pressure to raise water the more than 10 feet that would have been necessary to enable the water to "backflow" into the MIC tank.
# A key intermediate valve would have had to be open for the Negligence argument to apply. This valve was "tagged" closed, meaning that it had been inspected and found to be closed. While it is possible for open valves to clog over time, the only way a closed valve allows penetration is if there is leakage, and 1985 tests carried out by the government of India found this valve to be non-leaking.
# In order for water to have reached the MIC tank from the pipe-cleaning area, it would have had to flow through a significant network of pipes ranging from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, before rising ten feet and flowing into the MIC tank. Had this occurred, most of the water that was in those pipes at the time the tank had its critical reaction would have remained in those pipes, as there was no drain for them. Investigation by the Indian government in 1985 revealed that the pipes were bone dry.

===The argument for sabotage===
The Union Carbide commissioned Arthur D. Little report concludes that it is likely that a single employee secretly and deliberately introduced a large amount of water into the MIC tank by removing a meter and connecting a water hose directly to the tank through the metering port.&lt;ref name="Kalelkar1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Investigation of Large-magnitude Incidents: Bhopal as a Case Study |url=http://bhopal.bard.edu/resources/research.php?action=getfile&amp;id=180633 |vauthors=Kalelkar AS, Little AD |year=1988 |location=London |publisher=Presented at the Institution of Chemical Engineers conference on preventing major chemical accidents. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044210/http://bhopal.bard.edu/resources/research.php?action=getfile&amp;id=180633 |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCC claims the plant staff falsified numerous records to distance themselves from the incident and absolve themselves of blame, and that the Indian Government impeded its investigation and declined to prosecute the employee responsible, presumably because that would weaken its allegations of negligence by Union Carbide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2009 |work=Bhopal Information Center |publisher=Union Carbide Corporation |accessdate=4 April 2010 |quote=The Indian authorities are well aware of the identity of the employee [who sabotaged the plant] and the nature of the evidence against him. Indian authorities refused to pursue this individual because they, as litigants, were not interested in proving that anyone other than Union Carbide was to blame for the tragedy. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408133152/http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |archivedate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence in favor of this point of view includes:
# A key witness (the "tea boy") testified that when he entered the control room at 12:15 am, prior to the disaster, the "atmosphere was tense and quiet".
# Another key witness (the "instrument supervisor") testified that when he arrived at the scene immediately following the incident, he noticed that the local pressure indicator on the critical Tank 610 was missing, and that he had found a hose lying next to the empty manhead created by the missing pressure indicator, and that the hose had had water running out of it.
# This testimony was corroborated by other witnesses.
# Graphological analysis revealed major attempts to alter logfiles and destroy log evidence.
# Other logfiles show that the control team had attempted to purge 1 ton of material out of Tank 610 immediately prior to the disaster. An attempt was then made to cover up this transfer via log alteration. Water is heavier than MIC, and the transfer line is attached to the bottom of the tank. The Arthur D. Little report concludes from this that the transfer was an effort to transfer water out of Tank 610 that had been discovered there.
# A third key witness (the "off-duty employee of another unit") stated that "he had been told by a close friend of one of the MIC operators that water had entered through a tube that had been connected to the tank." This had been discovered by the other MIC operators (so the story was recounted) who then tried to open and close valves to prevent the release.
# A fourth key witness (the "operator from a different unit") stated that after the release, two MIC operators had told him that water had entered the tank through a pressure gauge.

The Little report argues that this evidence demonstrates that the following chronology took place:
* At 10:20pm, the tank was at normal pressure, indicating the absence of water.
* At 10:45pm, a shift change took place, after which the MIC storage area "would be completely deserted".
* During this period, a "disgruntled operator entered the storage area and hooked up one of the readily available rubber water hoses to Tank 610, with the intention of contaminating and spoiling the tank's contents."
* Water began to flow, beginning the chemical reaction that caused the disaster.
* After midnight, control room operators saw the pressure rising and realized there was a problem with Tank 610. They discovered the water connection, and decided to transfer one ton of the contents out to try and remove the water.
* The disaster then occurred, a major release of poisonous gas.
* The cover-up activities discovered during the investigation then took place.
* After over 30 years, S.P. Choudhary, former MIC Production Manager, broke the silence and told the truth about the disaster that it was not an accident but the result of a sabotage that claimed thousands of lives, a former official of the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) told the district and sessions court.
The theory of design defect was floated by the central government in its endeavour to do justice to the victims of the tragedy. Everyone else who was part of investigations into the case "just toed the line of the central government....
The government and the CBI suppressed the actual truth and saved the real perpetrators of the crime, the counsel, Anirban Roy told the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=21 July 2016|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bhopal-gas-tragedy-not-an-accident-but-sabotage-says-convicted-ucil-official/story-Q87kJ40p7pKS9sJd5udlmI.html|title=gas tradegy not an accident but sabotage, says convicted UCIL official}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=[[Times of India]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/Gas-tragedy-Counsel-cries-sabotage/articleshow/54504407.cms|title=Gas tragedy Counsel cries sabotage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, appearing for two accused S P Chaudhary and J Mukund, their advocate Anirban Roy told the district court on Monday that disgruntled plant operator M L Verma was behind the sabotage because he was unhappy with his seniors. Roy argued that the theory about defects in the plant causing the mishap was imaginary. He said truth had always been suppressed and it’s for the CBI to bring it out.
The counsel argued that there were discrepancies in the statements given by persons who were operating the plant at that time but the central agency chose not to investigate the case properly because it always wanted to prove that it was a mishap, and not sabotage. He alleged that Verma was unhappy with Chaudhary and Mukund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |website=[[Indian Express]] |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhopal-gas-tragedy-dow-chemical-1984-gas-tragedy-trial-madhya-pradesh-union-carbide-india-limited-4936270/ |title= Bhopal Gas tragedy: In court, defence names former employee as 'saboteur'|date=13 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Union Carbide actions==
The corporation denied the claim that the valves on the tank were malfunctioning, and claimed that the documented evidence gathered after the incident showed that the valve close to the plant's water-washing operation was closed and was leak-tight. Furthermore, process safety systems had prevented water from entering the tank by accident. Carbide states that the safety concerns identified in 1982 were all allayed before 1984 and had nothing to do with the incident.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Frequently Asked Questions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408133152/http://www.bhopal.com/faq.htm |archivedate=8 April 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company admitted that the safety systems in place would not have been able to prevent a chemical reaction of that magnitude from causing a leak. According to Carbide, "in designing the plant's safety systems, a chemical reaction of this magnitude was not factored in" because "the tank's gas storage system was designed to automatically prevent such a large amount of water from being inadvertently introduced into the system" and "process safety systems—in place and operational—would have prevented water from entering the tank by accident". Instead, they claim that "employee sabotage—not faulty design or operation—was the cause of the tragedy".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

'''Tactical response'''

The company stresses the immediate action taken after the disaster and its continued commitment to helping the victims. On 4 December, the day following the leak, Union Carbide sent material aid and several international medical experts to assist the medical facilities in Bhopal.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

'''Financial response'''

The primary financial restitution paid by UCC was negotiated in 1989, when the Indian Supreme Court approved a settlement of US$470 million ({{INRConvert|1055|c|year=1989}}). This amount was immediately paid by UCC to the Indian government. The company states that the restitution paid "was $120 million more than plaintiffs' lawyers had told U.S. courts was fair" and that the Indian Supreme Court stated in its opinion that "compensation levels under the settlement were far greater than would normally be payable under Indian law."&lt;ref name="irs" /&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, Union Carbide states on its website that it put $2 million into the Indian prime minister's immediate disaster relief fund on 11 December 1984.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; The corporation established the Employees' Bhopal Relief Fund in February 1985, which raised more than {{Nowrap|$5 million}} for immediate relief.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Chronology |accessdate=30 August 2012 |url=http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010924010814/http://www.bhopal.com/chrono.htm |archivedate=24 September 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Union Carbide, in August 1987, they made an additional {{Nowrap|$4.6 million}} in humanitarian interim relief available.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

Union Carbide stated that it also undertook several steps to provide continuing aid to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. The sale of its 50.9 percent interest in UCIL in April 1992 and establishment of a charitable trust to contribute to the building of a local hospital. The sale was finalised in November 1994. The hospital was begun in October 1995 and was opened in 2001. The company provided a fund with around {{Nowrap|$90 million}} from sale of its UCIL stock. In 1991, the trust had amounted approximately {{Nowrap|$100 million}}. The hospital catered for the treatment of heart, lung and eye problems.&lt;ref name="ucs" /&gt; UCC also provided a $2.2 million grant to [[Arizona State University]] to establish a vocational-technical center in Bhopal, which was opened, but was later closed by the state government.&lt;ref name="irs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhopal.com/irs.htm |publisher=Bhopal Information Center, UCC |title=Incident Response and Settlement |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103235052/http://www.bhopal.com/irs.htm |archivedate=3 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also donated $5 million to the [[Indian Red Cross]] after the disaster.&lt;ref name="irs" /&gt; They also developed a [[Responsible Care]] system with other members of the chemical industry as a response to the Bhopal crisis, which was designed to help prevent such an event in the future.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;

===Charges against UCC and UCIL employees===
UCC chairman and CEO Warren Anderson was arrested and released on bail by the Madhya Pradesh Police in Bhopal on 7 December 1984. Anderson was taken to UCC's house after which he was released six hours later on $2,100 bail and flown out on a government plane. These actions were allegedly taken under the direction of then chief secretary of the state, who was possibly instructed from chief minister's office, who himself flew out of Bhopal immediately.&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebhopalpost.com/index.php/2012/07/when-the-gas-leaked-arjun-flew-away-to-pray/|title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|publisher=The Bhopal Post| date=7 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120704/jsp/nation/story_15688988.jsp#.UBj6JmHaabs |title=When the gas leaked, Arjun flew away to pray|work=The Telegraph|date=3 July 2012|first=Rasheed |last=Kidwai|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Escapes on Bhopal disaster 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-10/india/28318396_1_warren-anderson-state-plane-chief-secretary|first=Suchandana|last=Gupta|title=Chief secretary told me to let Anderson go: Ex- Collector|work=The Times of India|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1987, the [[Indian government]] summoned Anderson, eight other executives and two company affiliates with [[homicide]] charges to appear in Indian court.&lt;ref name="nytimes88"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/17/business/india-acts-in-carbide-case.html|title=India Acts in Carbide Case|work=The New York Times|date=17 May 1988|accessdate=30 August 2012|author=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Union Carbide said the company is not under Indian jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="nytimes88" /&gt;

The area around the plant was used as a dumping ground for hazardous chemicals and by 1982 water wells in the vicinity of the UCIL factory had to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; UCC states that "after the incident, UCIL began clean-up work at the site under the direction of Indian central and state government authorities", which was continued after 1994 by the successor to UCIL. The successor, Eveready Industries India, Limited (EIIL), ended cleanup on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ucs" /&gt;

UCC's laboratory tests in 1989 revealed that soil and water samples collected from near the factory were toxic to fish. Twenty-one areas inside the plant were reported to be highly polluted. In 1991 the municipal authorities declared that water from over 100 wells was hazardous for health if used for drinking.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; In 1994 it was reported that 21% of the factory premises were seriously contaminated with chemicals.&lt;ref name="UCC1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Labunska"&gt;Labunska et al. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="down"&gt;Down to Earth (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1999, studies made by [[Greenpeace]] and others from soil, groundwater, [[Water well|well water]] and vegetables from the residential areas around UCIL and from the UCIL factory area show contamination with a range of toxic heavy metals and chemical compounds. Substances found, according to the reports, are [[1-Naphthol|naphthol]], [[naphthalene]], Sevin, tarry residues, [[1-naphthol|alpha naphthol]], mercury, [[organochlorines]], [[chromium]], copper, nickel, lead, hexachlorethane, [[hexachlorobutadiene]], pesticide HCH ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|BHC]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s and halo-organics.&lt;ref name="Labunska" /&gt;&lt;ref name="down" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stringer"&gt;Stringer et al. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srishti"&gt;Srishti (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contaminants were also found in breast milk of women living near the area.&lt;ref name=BMA /&gt;
Soil tests were conducted by Greenpeace in 1999. One sample (IT9012) from "sediment collected from drain under former Sevin plant" showed mercury levels to be at "20,000 and {{Nowrap|6 million}} times" higher than expected levels. Organochlorine compounds at elevated levels were also present in groundwater collected from (sample IT9040) a 4.4 meter depth "bore-hole within the former UCIL site". This sample was obtained from a source posted with a warning sign which read "Water unfit for consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/vdhara/www.BhopalPublications/Environmental%20Health/Greenpeace%20Bhopal%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author1=Labunska I |author2=Stephenson A |author3=Brigden K |author4=Stringer R |author5=Santillo D |author6=Johnston P.A. |year=1999 |title=The Bhopal Legacy.

In 2010, a British photojournalist who ventured into the abandoned [[Union Carbide]] factory to investigate allegations of abandoned, leaking toxins, was hospitalized in Bhopal for a week after he was exposed to the chemicals. Doctors at the [[Sambhavna clinic|Sambhavna Clinic]] treated him with oxygen, painkillers and anti-inflammatories following a severe respiratory reaction to toxic dust inside the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bhopal.org/bhopal-now-the-enduring-tragedy/|title=Bhopal Now: The Enduring Tragedy|last=|first=|date=|website=bhopal.org|language=en-GB|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/15480253|title=Interview: Jack Laurenson in Bhopal|last=Twilton|first=Richard|date=|website=Vimeo|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1999, a Hindi film dealing with the tragedy, ''[[Bhopal Express (film)|Bhopal Express]]'', was released. The film stars [[Kay Kay Menon]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]].

[[Amulya Malladi]]'s 2002 novel ''A Breath of Fresh Air'' relates the story of a mother and son who develop health issues as a result of exposure to gas at Bhopal. The book is based on Malladi's recollections of Bhopal during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Athitakis|first1=Mark|title=A Breath of Fresh Air|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-breath-of-fresh-air/Content?oid=2145552|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indra Sinha]] released ''[[Animal's People]]'' in 2007. The novel tells the story of a boy who is born with a spinal condition due to effects of the gas. The book was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].

In 2014, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, historical-drama ''[[Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain]]'' was released, starring [[Martin Sheen]] as Union Carbide CEO [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], [[Kal Penn]], and [[Mischa Barton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-bhopal-prayer-for-rain-review-20141114-story.html |author=Martin Tsai |title=Review 'Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain' an effective cautionary tale |work=Los Angeles Times |date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arundhati Roy]]'s 2017 novel ''[[The Ministry of Utmost Happiness]]'' which deals with many contemporary political issues in India also features several characters still dealing with the aftermath of the gas leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arundhati|last=Roy|title=The Ministry of Utmost Happiness|page=135|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]|year=2017|title-link=The Ministry of Utmost Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Since 1984, individual activists have played a role in the aftermath of the tragedy. The best-known is [[Satinath Sarangi]] (Sathyu), a [[Metallurgic engineering|metallurgic engineer]] who arrived at Bhopal the day after the leakage. He founded several activist groups, as well as [[Sambhavna Trust]], the clinic for gas affected patients, where he is the manager.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; Other activists include Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, who received the [[Goldman Prize]] in 2004, Abdul Jabbar and [[Rachna Dhingra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2004/Asia|title=Rashida Bee &amp; Champa Devi Shukla|work=Goldman Environmental Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2009/12/crusader-for-victims-truth-of-bhopal.html |title=An Indian Muslim's Blog: News, Views &amp; Urdu Poetry Website: Crusader for Victims: The Truth of Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its Aftermath-Part III |publisher=Anindianmuslim.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local activism===
Soon after the accident, representatives from different activist groups arrived. The activists worked on organising the gas victims, which led to violent repression from the police and the government.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Numerous actions have been performed: demonstrations, sit-ins, [[hunger strikes]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, marches combined with pamphlets, books, and articles. Every anniversary, actions are performed. Often these include marches around Old Bhopal, ending with burning an [[effigy]] of [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]].

===International activism===
Cooperation with international NGOs including [http://www.pan-uk.org/ Pesticide Action Network UK] and [http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/toxics/justice-for-bhopal/ Greenpeace] started soon after the tragedy. One of the earliest reports is the Trade Union report from ILO 1985.&lt;ref name="tradeunion1985"/&gt;

In 1992, a session of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights took place in Bhopal, and in 1996, the [https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45285.html "Charter on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights"] was adopted.

In 1994, the [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] (IMCB) met in Bhopal. Their work contributed to long term health effects being officially recognised.

Important international actions have been the tour to Europe and United States in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Media release – 23 April 2004 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/bhopal-victims-warn-u-s-gover/ |title=Bhopal Victims Warn U.S. Government and Dow Chemical of Impending Catastrophe |publisher=Greenpeace |date=23 April 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the marches to Delhi in 2006 and 2008, all including hunger strikes, and the Bhopal Europe Bus Tour in 2009.

===Activist organisations===
At least 14 different NGOs were immediately engaged.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt; The first disaster reports were published by activist organisations, [[Eklavya]] and the [[Delhi Science Forum]].

Around ten local organisations, engaged on long term, have been identified. Two of the most active organisations are the women's organisations—Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila-Stationery Karmachari Sangh and Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangthan.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

More than 15 national organisations have been engaged along with a number of international organisations.&lt;ref name="Eckerman2005" /&gt;

Some of the organisations are:
* [[International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal]] (ICJB), coordinates international activities.
* [[Bhopal Medical Appeal]], collects funds for the Sambhavna Trust.
* [[Sambhavna Trust]] or Bhopal People's Health and Documentation Clinic. Provides medical care for gas affected patients and those living in water-contaminated area.
* [[Chingari Trust]], provides medical care for children being born in Bhopal with malformations and brain damages.
* [[Students for Bhopal]], based in USA.
* [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]], provided medical information 1994–2000.

===Settlement fund hoax===

On 3 December 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the disaster, a man falsely claiming to be a Dow representative named Jude Finisterra was interviewed on [[BBC World News]]. He claimed that the company had agreed to clean up the site and compensate those harmed in the incident, by liquidating Union Carbide for {{Nowrap|US$12 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dow Does The Right Thing|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bbcbhopal|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923175638/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bbcbhopal|archivedate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dow|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810225225/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow|archivedate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow quickly issued a statement saying that they had no employee by that name—that he was an impostor, not affiliated with Dow, and that his claims were a hoax. The BBC later broadcast a correction and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=66&amp;ItemID=6795|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216065428/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=66&amp;ItemID=6795|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 December 2004|title=Corporate Responsibility|date=5 December 2004|publisher=Zmag.org|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jude Finisterra was actually [[Jacque Servin|Andy Bichlbaum]], a member of the activist prankster group [[The Yes Men]]. In 2002, The Yes Men issued a fake press release explaining why Dow refused to take responsibility for the disaster and started up a website, at "DowEthics.com", designed to look like the real Dow website, but containing hoax information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow/ |title=The Yes Men |publisher=The Yes Men |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810225225/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/dow |archivedate=10 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring of Bhopal activists===
The [[2012 Stratfor email leak|release of an email cache]] related to intelligence research organisation [[Stratfor]] was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] on 27 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/date/2011.html |title=Wikileaks GI release 2011 |publisher=Wikileaks |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827105410/https://www.wikileaks.org/gifiles/date/2011.html |archivedate=27 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed that Dow Chemical had engaged Stratfor to spy on the public and personal lives of activists involved in the Bhopal disaster, including the [[Yes Men]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69685">In [[medicine]], '''comorbidity''' is the presence of one or more additional [[disease]]s or disorders [[wikt:co-occur#Verb|co-occurring]] with (that is, [[wikt:concomitant#Adjective|concomitant]] or [[wikt:concurrent#Adjective|concurrent]] with) a primary disease or disorder; in the [[count noun|countable]] sense of the term, a '''comorbidity''' (plural '''comorbidities''') is each additional disorder or disease. The additional disorder may, also, be a [[emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral]] or [[mental disorder]].

__TOC__

== In medicine ==

In medicine, comorbidity describes the effect of all other diseases an individual patient might have other than the primary disease of interest.

The term can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter [[word sense|sense]] of the term causes some [[semantic field|overlap]] with the concept of [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. For example, in longstanding [[diabetes mellitus]], the extent to which [[coronary artery disease]] is an independent comorbidity versus a [[complications of diabetes mellitus|diabetic complication]] is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy|intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]]. In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because [[syndrome]]s and [[genetic association|associations]] are often identified long before [[pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even [[hypothesis|hypothesized]]). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided."&lt;ref name="pmid_15738496"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maj |first=M |year=2005 |title='Psychiatric comorbidity': an artefact of current diagnostic systems? |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=182–184 |pmid=15738496 |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.3.182 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.

Many tests attempt to standardize the "weight" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard.

The term "comorbid" has three definitions:
# to indicate a medical condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition in a patient (this is the older and more "correct" definition)
# to indicate a medical condition in a patient that causes, is caused by, or is otherwise related to another condition in the same patient (this is a newer, nonstandard definition and less well-accepted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1370/afm.983 |title=Defining Comorbidity: Implications for Understanding Health and Health Services |year=2009 |last1=Valderas |first1=Jose M. |last2=Starfield |first2=Barbara |last3=Sibbald |first3=Bonnie |last4=Salisbury |first4=Chris |last5=Roland |first5=Martin |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=357–63 |pmid=19597174 |pmc=2713155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charlson comorbidity index&lt;ref name="CharlsonMary"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(87)90171-8 |title=A new method of classifying prognostic comorbidity in longitudinal studies: Development and validation |year=1987 |last1=Charlson |first1=Mary E. |last2=Pompei |first2=Peter |last3=Ales |first3=Kathy L. |last4=MacKenzie |first4=C. Ronald |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=373–83 |pmid=3558716}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts the one-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as [[heart disease]], [[AIDS]], or [[cancer]] (a total of 22 conditions). Each condition is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of dying associated with each one. Scores are summed to provide a total score to predict mortality. Many variations of the Charlson comorbidity index have been presented, including the Charlson/Deyo, Charlson/Romano, Charlson/Manitoba, and Charlson/D'Hoores comorbidity indices.

Clinical conditions and associated scores are as follows:
*1 each: Myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer, chronic liver disease, diabetes.
*2 each: Hemiplegia, moderate or severe kidney disease, diabetes with end organ damage, tumor, leukemia, lymphoma.
*3 each: Moderate or severe liver disease.
*6 each: Malignant tumor, metastasis, AIDS.

For a physician, this score is helpful in deciding how aggressively to treat a condition. For example, a patient may have cancer with comorbid heart disease and diabetes. These comorbidities may be so severe that the costs and risks of cancer treatment would outweigh its short-term benefit.

Since patients often do not know how severe their conditions are, nurses were originally supposed to review a patient's chart and determine whether a particular condition was present in order to calculate the index. Subsequent studies have adapted the comorbidity index into a questionnaire for patients.

The Charlson index, especially the Charlson/Deyo, followed by the Elixhauser have been most commonly referred by the comparative studies of comorbidity and multimorbidity measures.&lt;ref name=ComorbidReview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharabiani|first=Mansour|author2=Aylin, Paul |author3=Bottle, Alex |title=Systematic review of comorbidity indices for administrative data|journal=Medical Care|date=December 2012|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1109–18|doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e31825f64d0|pmid=22929993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comorbidity–polypharmacy score (CPS)===
The comorbidity–polypharmacy score (CPS) is a simple measure that consists of the sum of all known comorbid conditions and all associated medications. There is no specific matching between comorbid conditions and corresponding medications. Instead, the number of medications is assumed to be a reflection of the "intensity" of the associated comorbid conditions. This score has been tested and validated extensively in the trauma population, demonstrating good correlation with mortality, morbidity, triage, and hospital readmissions.&lt;ref name=CPS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=DC|author2=Cook, CH|author3=Christy, JM |title=Comorbidity–polypharmacy scoring facilitates outcome prediction in older trauma patients|journal=J Am Geriatr Soc|date=August 2012|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1465–70|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04075.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPS2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Justiniano|first=CF|author2=Coffey, RA|author3=Evans, DC |title=Comorbidity–polypharmacy score predicts in-hospital complications and the need for discharge to extended care facility in older burn patients|journal=J Burn Care Res|date=Jan 2015|volume=36|issue=1|pages=193–196|doi=10.1097/bcr.0000000000000094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPS3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Justiniano|first=CF|author2=Evans, DC|author3=Cook, CH |title=Comorbidity–polypharmacy score: a novel adjunct in post-emergency department trauma triage|journal=J Surg Res|date=May 2013|volume=181|issue=1|pages=16–19|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2012.05.042|pmc=3717608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of interest, increasing levels of CPS were associated with significantly lower 90-day survival in the original study of the score in trauma population.&lt;ref name="CPS"/&gt;

===Elixhauser comorbidity measure===

The Elixhauser comorbidity measure was developed using administrative data from a statewide California inpatient database from all non-federal inpatient community hospital stays in California (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,779,167). The Elixhauser comorbidity measure developed a list of 30 comorbidities relying on the ICD-9-CM coding manual. The comorbidities were not simplified as an index because each comorbidity affected outcomes (length of hospital stay, hospital changes, and mortality) differently among different patients groups. The comorbidities identified by the Elixhauser comorbidity measure are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and include both acute and chronic conditions. van Walraven et al. have derived and validated an Elixhauser comorbidity index that summarizes disease burden and can discriminate for in-hospital mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e31819432e5 |title=A Modification of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Measures into a Point System for Hospital Death Using Administrative Data |year=2009 |last1=Van Walraven |first1=Carl |last2=Austin |first2=Peter C. |last3=Jennings |first3=Alison |last4=Quan |first4=Hude |last5=Forster |first5=Alan J. |journal=Medical Care |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=626–33 |pmid=19433995}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a systematic review and comparative analysis shows that among various comorbidities indices, Elixhauser index is a better predictor of the risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalisation.&lt;ref name="ComorbidReview"/&gt;

=== Diagnosis-related group ===

Patients who are more seriously ill tend to require more hospital resources than patients who are less seriously ill, even though they are admitted to the hospital for the same reason. Recognizing this, the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) manually splits certain DRGs based on the presence of secondary diagnoses for specific complications or comorbidities (CC).  The same applies to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) in the UK.

== Mental health ==

In [[psychiatry]], psychology, and mental health counseling, comorbidity refers to the presence of more than one diagnosis occurring in an individual at the same time. However, in psychiatric classification, comorbidity does not necessarily imply the presence of multiple diseases, but instead can reflect our current inability to supply a single diagnosis that accounts for all symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000086093 |title=Mutually Exclusive versus Co-Occurring Diagnostic Categories: The Challenge of Diagnostic Comorbidity |year=2005 |last1=First |first1=Michael B. |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=206–10 |pmid=16145276}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] Axis I, [[Major Depressive Disorder]] is a very common comorbid disorder.  The Axis II [[personality disorder]]s are often criticized because their comorbidity rates are excessively high, approaching 60% in some cases, indicating to critics the possibility that these categories of mental illness are too imprecisely distinguished to be usefully valid for diagnostic purposes and, thus, for deciding how treatment resources should be allocated.

The term 'comorbidity' was introduced in medicine by Feinstein (1970) to denote those cases in which a 'distinct additional clinical entity' occurred during the clinical course of a patient having an [[index disease]]. Although the term has recently become very fashionable in psychiatry, its use to indicate the concomitance of two or more psychiatric diagnoses is said to be incorrect because in most cases it is unclear whether the concomitant diagnoses actually reflect the presence of distinct clinical entities or refer to multiple manifestations of a single clinical entity. It has been argued that because "'the use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.3.182 |title='Psychiatric comorbidity': An artefact of current diagnostic systems? |year=2005 |last1=Maj |first1=Mario |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=182–4 |pmid=15738496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its artifactual nature, psychiatric comorbidity has been considered as a Kuhnian anomaly leading the DSM to a scientific crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/ppp.0.0211 |title=The Role of Comorbidity in the Crisis of the Current Psychiatric Classification System |year=2009 |last1=Massimiliano Aragona |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology |volume=16 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comprehensive review on the matter considers comorbidity as an epistemological challenge to modern psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jakovljević |first1=Miro |last2=Crnčević |first2=Željka |title=Comorbidity as an epistemological challenge to modern psychiatry |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A12-07.htm |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |date=June 2012 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inception of the term ==
Many centuries ago the doctors propagated the viability of a complex approach in the diagnosis of disease and the treatment of the patient, however modern medicine, which boasts a wide range of diagnostic methods and variety of therapeutic procedures, stresses specification. This brought up a question: How to wholly evaluate the state of a patient who suffers from a number of diseases simultaneously, where to start from and which disease(s) require(s) primary and subsequent treatment? For many years this question stood out unanswered, until 1970, when a renowned American doctor epidemiologist and researcher, [[Alvan Feinstein|A.R. Feinstein]], who had greatly influenced the methods of clinical diagnosis and particularly methods used in the field of clinical epidemiology, came out with the term of "comorbidity". The appearance of comorbidity was demonstrated by Feinstein using the example of patients physically suffering from rheumatic fever, discovering the worst state of the patients, who simultaneously suffered from multiple diseases. In due course of time after its discovery, comorbidity was distinguished as a separate scientific-research discipline in many branches of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(70)90054-8 |title=The pre-therapeutic classification of co-morbidity in chronic disease |year=1970 |last1=Feinstein |first1=Alvan R. |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=455–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of the term ===
Presently there is no agreed-upon terminology of comorbidity. Some authors bring forward different meanings of comorbidity and multi-morbidity, defining the former, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, connected to each other through proven pathogenetic mechanisms and the latter, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, not having any connection to each other through any of the proven till date pathogenetic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Лазебник Л. Б. Старение и полиморбидность // [http://old.consilium-medicum.com/media/consilium/05_12/993.shtml Консилиум Медикум, 2005, № 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Others affirm that multi-morbidity is the combination of a number of chronic or acute diseases and clinical symptoms in a person and do not stress the similarities or differences in their pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenfield |first1=Sheldon |last2=Apolone |first2=Giovanni |last3=McNeil |first3=Barbara J. |last4=Cleary |first4=Paul D. |title=The Importance of Co-Existent Disease in the Occurrence of Postoperative Complications and One-Year Recovery in Patients Undergoing Total Hip Replacement: Comorbidity and Outcomes after Hip Replacement |journal=Medical Care |year=1993 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=141–54 |pmid=8433577 |jstor=3765891 |doi=10.1097/00005650-199302000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the principle clarification of the term was given by H. C. Kraemer and M. van den Akker, determining comorbidity as the combination in a patient of 2 or more chronic diseases (disorders), pathogenetically related to each other or coexisting in a single patient independent of each disease's activity in the patient.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

These very researchers developed the first models of comorbidity.

Comorbidity is widespread among the patients admitted at multidiscipline hospitals. During the phase of initial medical help, the patients having multiple diseases simultaneously are a norm rather than an exception. Prevention and treatment of chronic diseases declared by the [[World Health Organization]], as a priority project for the second decade of the 20th century, are meant to better the quality of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1370/afm.1 |title=Comorbidity: Implications for the Importance of Primary Care in 'Case' Management |year=2003 |last1=Starfield |first1=B. |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=1 |pages=8–14 |pmid=15043174 |last2=Lemke |first2=KW |last3=Bernhardt |first3=T |last4=Foldes |first4=SS |last5=Forrest |first5=CB |last6=Weiner |first6=JP |issue=1 |pmc=1466556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68198-1 |title=Comorbidity and guidelines: Conflicting interests |year=2006 |last1=Van Weel |first1=Chris |last2=Schellevis |first2=François G |journal=The Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9510 |pages=550–1 |pmid=16488782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1994.03520080061045 |title=A Critical Appraisal of the Quality of Quality-of-Life Measurements |year=1994 |last1=Gill |first1=Thomas M. |journal=JAMA |volume=272 |issue=8 |pages=619–26 |pmid=7726894 |last2=Feinstein |first2=AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diacare.11.9.725 |title=Reliability and validity of a diabetes quality-of-life measure for the diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT).

In most of the carried-out, randomized, clinical researches the authors study patients with single refined pathology, making comorbidity an exclusive criterion. This is why it is hard to relate researches, directed towards the evaluation of the combination of ones or the other separate disorders, to works regarding the sole research of comorbidity. The absence of a single scientific approach to the evaluation of comorbidity leads to omissions in clinical practice. It is hard not to notice the absence of comorbidity in the taxonomy (systematics) of disease, presented in [[ICD-10]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Clinico-pathological comparisons ===
All the fundamental researches of medical documentation, directed towards the study of the spread of comorbidity and influence of its structure, were conducted till the 1990s. The sources of information, used by the researchers and scientists, working on the matter of comorbidity, were case histories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1996.03540180029029 |title=Persons with Chronic Conditions: Their Prevalence and Costs |year=1996 |last1=Hoffman |first1=Catherine |journal=JAMA |volume=276 |issue=18 |pages=1473–9 |pmid=8903258 |last2=Rice |first2=D |last3=Sung |first3=HY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/gerona/53A.6.M447 |title=Morbidity, Comorbidity, and Their Association with Disability Among Community-Dwelling Oldest-Old in Israel |year=1998 |last1=Fuchs |first1=Z. |last2=Blumstein |first2=T. |last3=Novikov |first3=I. |last4=Walter-Ginzburg |first4=A. |last5=Lyanders |first5=M. |last6=Gindin |first6=J. |last7=Habot |first7=B. |last8=Modan |first8=B. |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=53A |issue=6 |pages=M447–55 |pmid=9823749}}&lt;/ref&gt; hospital records of patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daveluy |first1=C. |last2=Pica |first2=L. |last3=Audet |first3=N. |title=Enquête Sociale et de Santé 1998 |edition=2nd |location=Québec |publisher=Institut de la statistique du Québec |year=2001 |url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/sante/e_soc-sante98.htm |access-date=2013-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126023327/http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca//publications/sante/e_soc-sante98.htm |archive-date=2013-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other medical documentation, kept by family doctors, insurance companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.20.2269 |title=Prevalence, Expenditures, and Complications of Multiple Chronic Conditions in the Elderly |year=2002 |last1=Wolff |first1=J.

The listed methods of obtaining medical information are mainly based on clinical experience and qualification of the physicians, carrying out clinically, instrumentally and laboratorially confirmed diagnosis. This is why despite their competence, they are highly subjective. No analysis of the results of postmortem of deceased patients was carried out for any of the comorbidity researches.

"It is the duty of the doctor to carry out autopsy of the patients they treat", said once professor [[:ru:Мудров, Матвей Яковлевич|M. Y. Mudrov]]. Autopsy allows you to exactly determine the structure of comorbidity and the direct cause of death of each patient independent of his/her age, gender and gender specific characteristics. Statistical data of comorbid pathology, based on these sections, are mainly devoid of subjectivism.

=== Research ===
The analysis of a decade long Australian research based on the study of patients having 6 widespread chronic diseases demonstrated that nearly half of the elderly patients with arthritis also had hypertension, 20% had cardiac disorders and 14% had type 2 diabetes. More than 60% of asthmatic patients complained of concurrent arthritis, 20% complained of cardiac problems and 16% had type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2009.088260 |title=Comorbid chronic diseases, discordant impact on mortality in older people: A 14-year longitudinal population study |year=2009 |last1=Caughey |first1=G.

A Canadian research conducted upon 483 obesity patients, it was determined that spread of obesity related accompanying diseases was higher among females than males. The researchers discovered that nearly 75% of obesity patients had accompanying diseases, which mostly included dyslipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

According to Russian data, based on the study of more than three thousand postmortem reports (n=3239) of patients of physical pathologies, admitted at multidisciplinary hospitals for the treatment of chronic disorders (average age 67.8 ± 11.6 years), the frequency of comorbidity is 94.2%.

The fourteen-year research conducted on 883 patients of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Werlhof disease), conducted in Great Britain, shows that the given disease is related to a wide range of physical pathologies. In the comorbid structure of these patients, most frequently present are malignant neoplasms, locomotorium disorders, skin and genitourinary system disorders, as well as haemorrhagic complications and other autoimmune diseases, the risk of whose progression during the first five years of the primary disease exceeds the limit of 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2009/963506 |title=Comorbidities of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A Population-Based Study |year=2009 |last1=Feudjo-Tepie |first1=M.

In a research conducted on 196 larynx cancer patients, it was determined that the survival rate of patients at various stages of cancer differs depending upon the presence or absence of comorbidity. At the first stage of cancer the survival rate in the presence of comorbidity is 17% and in its absence it is 83%, in the second stage of cancer the rate of survivability is 14% and 76%, in the third stage it is 28% and 66% and in the fourth stage of cancer it is 0% and 50% respectively. Overall the survivability rate of comorbid larynx cancer patients is 59% lower than the survivability rate of patients without comorbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9776943 |year=1998 |last1=Taylor |first1=VM |last2=Anderson |first2=GM |last3=McNeney |first3=B |last4=Diehr |first4=P |last5=Lavis |first5=JN |last6=Deyo |first6=RA |last7=Bombardier |first7=C |last8=Malter |first8=A |last9=Axcell |first9=T |title=Hospitalizations for back and neck problems: A comparison between the Province of Ontario and Washington State |volume=33 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=929–45 |pmc=1070294 |journal=Health services research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for therapists and general physicians, the problem of comorbidity is also often faced by specialists. Regretfully they seldom pay attention to the coexistence of a whole range of disorders in a single patient and mostly conduct the treatment of specific to their specialization diseases. In current practice urologists, gynecologists, ENT specialists, eye specialists, surgeons and other specialists all too often mention only the diseases related to "own" field of specialization, passing on the discovery of other accompanying pathologies "under the control" of other specialists. It has become an unspoken rule for any specialized department to carry out consultations of the therapist, who feels obliged to carry out symptomatic analysis of the patient, as well as to the form the diagnostic and therapeutic concept, taking in view the potential risks for the patient and his long-term prognosis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Based on the available clinical and scientific data it is possible to conclude that comorbidity has a range of undoubted properties, which characterize it as a heterogeneous and often encountered event, which enhances the seriousness of the condition and worsens the patient's prospects. The heterogeneous character of comorbidity is due to the wide range of reasons causing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.a2752 |title=Comorbidity and repeat admission to hospital for adverse drug reactions in older adults: Retrospective cohort study |year=2009 |last1=Zhang |first1=M. |last2=Holman |first2=C D.

== Causes ==
* Anatomic proximity of diseased organs
* Singular pathogenetic mechanism of a number of diseases
* Terminable cause-effect relation between the diseases
* One disease resulting from complications of another
* [[Pleiotropy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/TLD.0b013e318261c264 |title=How Can Comorbidity with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Aid Understanding of Language and Speech Disorders? |year=2012 |last1=Tomblin |first1=J.

The factors responsible for the development of comorbidity can be chronic infections, inflammations, involutional and systematic metabolic changes, iatrogenesis, social status, ecology and genetic susceptibility.

== Types ==
* Trans-syndromal comorbidity: coexistence, in a single patient, of two and/or more syndromes, [[pathogenetic]]ally related to each other.
* Trans-[[nosology|nosological]] comorbidity: coexistence, in a single patient, of two and/or more [[syndromes]], pathogenetically not related to each other.
The division of comorbidity as per syndromal and nosological principles is mainly preliminary and inaccurate, however it allows us to understand that comorbidity can be connected to a singular cause or common mechanisms of pathogenesis of the conditions, which sometimes explains the similarity in their clinical aspects, which makes it difficult to differentiate between nosologies.
* Etiological comorbidity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00363-2 |title=Causes and consequences of comorbidity |year=2001 |last1=Gijsen |first1=Ronald |last2=Hoeymans |first2=Nancy |last3=Schellevis |first3=François G. |last4=Ruwaard |first4=Dirk |last5=Satariano |first5=William A. |last6=Van Den Bos |first6=Geertrudis A.M. |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=661–74 |pmid=11438406}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by concurrent damage to different organs and systems, which is caused by a singular pathological agent (for example due to alcoholism in patients suffering from chronic alcohol intoxication; pathologies associated with smoking; systematic damage due to collagenoses).
* Complicated comorbidity: It is the result of the primary disease and often subsequent after sometime after its destabilization appears in the shape of target lesions (for example chronic [https://web.archive.org/web/20180409171729/http://www.dictionary.net/nephratony nephratony] resulting from diabetic nephropathy (Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease) in patients with type 2 diabetes; development of brain [[infarction]] resulting from complications due to [[hypertension|hypertensive]] crisis in patients suffering from hypertension).
* Iatrogenic comorbidity: It appears as a result of necessitated negative effect of the doctor on the patient, under the conditions of pre determine danger of one or the other medical procedure (for example, glucocorticosteroid [[osteoporosis]] in patients treated for a long time using systematic hormonal agents (preparations); drug-induced [[hepatitis]] resulting from chemotherapy against TB, prescribed due to the conversion of tubercular tests).
* Unspecified (NOS) comorbidity: This type assumes the presence of singular pathogenetic mechanisms of development of diseases, comprising this combination, but require a number of tests, proving the hypothesis of the researcher or physician (for example, erectile dysfunction as an early sign of general atherosclerosis (ASVD); occurrence of erosive-ulcerative lesions in the mucous membrane of the upper gastrointestinal tract in "vascular" patients).
* "Arbitrary" comorbidity: initial alogism of the combination of diseases is not proven, but soon can be explained with clinical and scientific point of view (for example, combination of coronary heart disease (CHD) and choledocholithiasis; combination of acquired heart valvular disease and psoriasis).

== Structure ==
There are a number of rules for the formulation of clinical diagnosis for comorbid patients, which must be followed by a practitioner. The main principle is to distinguish in diagnosis the primary and background diseases, as well as their complications and accompanying pathologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Пальцев |first1=М.А. |last2=Автандилов |first2=Г.Г. |last3=Зайратьянц |first3=О.В. |last4=Кактурский |first4=Л.В. |script-title=ru:Никонов Е.Л.

* Primary disease: This is the nosological form, which itself or as a result of complications calls for the foremost necessity for treatment at the time due to threat to the patient's life and danger of disability. Primary is the disease, which becomes the cause of seeking medical help or the reason for the patient's death. If the patient has several primary diseases it is important to first of all understand the combined primary diseases (rival or concomitant).
* Rival diseases: These are the concurrent nosological forms in a patient, interdependent in etiologies and pathogenesis, but equally sharing the criterion of a primary disease (for example, transmural myocardial infarction and massive thromboembolism of pulmonary artery, caused by phlebemphraxis of lower limbs). For practicing pathologist rival are two or more diseases, exhibited in a single patient, each of which by itself or through its complications could cause the patient's death.
* Polypathia: Diseases with different etiologies and pathogenesis, each of which separately could not cause death, but, concurring during development and reciprocally exacerbating each other, they cause the patient's death (for example, osteoporotic fracture of the surgical neck of the femur and hypostatic pneumonia).
* Background disease: This helps in the occurrence of or adverse development of the primary disease increases its dangers and helps in the development of complications. This disease as well as the primary one requires immediate treatment (for example, type 2 diabetes).
* Complications: Nosologies having pathogenetic relation to the primary disease, supporting the adverse progression of the disorder, causing acute worsening of the patient's conditions (are a part of the complicated comorbidity). In a number of cases the complications of the primary disease and related to it etiological and pathogenetic factors, are indicated as conjugated disease. In this case they must be identified as the cause of comorbidity. Complications are listed in a descending order of prognostic or disabling significance.
* Associating diseases: Nosological units not connected etiologically and pathogenetically with the primary disease (Listed in the order of significance).

== Diagnosis ==
There is no doubt in the significance of comorbidity, but how to evaluate (measure) it in a given patient?

=== Clinical example ===
Patient S., 73 years, called an ambulance because of a sudden pressing pain in the chest. It was known from the case history that the patient suffered from CHD for many years. Such chest pains were experienced by her earlier as well, but they always disappeared after a few minutes of sublingual administration of organic nitrates. This time taking three tablets of nitroglycerine did not kill the pain. It was also known from the case history that the patient had twice suffered during the last ten years from myocardial infarction, as well as from Acute Cerebrovascular Event with sinistral hemiplegia more than 15 years ago. Apart from that the patient suffers from hypertension, type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy, hysteromyoma, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis and varicose pedi-vein disease. It also came to knowledge that the patient regularly takes a number of antihypertensive drugs, urinatives and oral antihyperglycemic remedies, as well as statins, antiplatelet and nootropics. In the past the patient had undergone cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis more than 20 years ago, as well as the extraction of crystalline tumor due to cataract of the right eye 4 years ago. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at a general hospital diagnosed for acute transmural myocardial infarction. During the check-up moderate azotemia, mild erythronormoblastic anemia, proteinuria and lowering of left vascular ejection fraction were also identified.

=== Methods of evaluation ===
There are currently several generally accepted methods of evaluating (measuring) comorbidity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00585-1 |title=How to measure comorbiditya critical review of available methods |year=2003 |last1=Degroot |first1=V |last2=Beckerman |first2=H |last3=Lankhorst |first3=G |last4=Bouter |first4=L |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=221–9 |pmid=12725876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS): Developed in 1968 by B. S. Linn, it became a revolutionary discovery, because it gave the practicing doctors a chance to calculate the number and severity of chronic illnesses in the structure of the comorbid state of their patients. The proper use of CIRS means separate cumulative evaluation of each of the biological systems: "0" The selected system corresponds to the absence of disorders, "1": Slight (mild) abnormalities or previously suffered disorders, "2": Illness requiring the prescription of medicinal therapy, "3": Disease, which caused disability and "4": Acute organ insufficiency requiring emergency therapy. The CIRS system evaluates comorbidity in cumulative score, which can be from 0 to 56. As per its developers, the maximum score is not compatible with the patient's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5646906 |year=1968 |last1=Linn |first1=Bernard S. |last2=Linn |first2=Margaret W. |last3=Gurel |first3=Lee |title=Cumulative illness rating scale |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=622–6 |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1968.tb02103.x |url=http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cumulative-illness-rating-scale/#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G): This system is similar to CIRS, but for aged patients, offered by M. D. Miller in 1991. This system takes into account the age of the patient and the peculiarities of the old age disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Miller M.D., Towers A.

# The Kaplan–Feinstein Index: This index was created in 1973 based on the study of the effect of the associated diseases on patients suffering from type 2 diabetes during a period of 5 years. In this system of comorbidity evaluation all the present (in a patient) diseases and their complications, depending on the level of their damaging effect on body organs, are classified as mild, moderate and severe. In this case the conclusion about cumulative comorbidity is drawn on the basis of the most decompensated biological system. This index gives cumulative, but less detailed as compared to CIRS, assessment of the condition of each of the biological systems: "0": Absence of disease, "1": Mild course of the disease, "2": Moderate disease, "3": Severe disease. The Kaplan–Feinstein Index evaluates comorbidity by cumulative score, which can vary from 0 to 36. Apart from that the notable deficiency of this method of evaluating comorbidity is the excessive generalization of diseases (nosologies) and the absence of a large number of illnesses in the scale, which, probably, should be noted in the "miscellaneous" column, which undermines (decreases) this method's objectivity and productivity of this method. However the indisputable advantage of the Kaplan–Feinstein Index as compared to CIRS is in the capability of independent analysis of malignant neoplasms and their severities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4689292 |year=1973 |last1=Kaplan |first1=M. H. |last2=Feinstein |first2=A. R. |title=A critique of methods in reported studies of long-term vascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=160–74 |journal=Diabetes|doi=10.2337/diab.22.3.160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Using this method patient S's, age 73, comorbidity can be evaluated as of moderate severity (16 out of 36 points), however its prognostic value is unclear, because of the absence of the interpretation of the overall score, resulting from the accumulation of the patient's diseases''.
# Charlson Index: This index is meant for the long-term prognosis of comorbid patients and was developed by M. E. Charlson in 1987. This index is based on a point scoring system (from 0 to 40) for the presence of specific associated diseases and is used for prognosis of lethality. For its calculation the points are accumulated, according to associated diseases, as well as the addition of a single point for each 10 years of age for patients of ages above forty years (in 50 years 1 point, 60 years 2 points etc.). The distinguishing feature and undisputed advantage of the Charlson Index is the capability of evaluating the patient's age and determination of the patient's mortality rate, which in the absence of comorbidity is 12%, at 1–2 points it is 26%; at 3–4 points it is 52% and with the accumulation of more than 5 points it is 85%. Regretfully this method has some deficiencies: Evaluating comorbidity severity of many diseases is not considered, as well as the absence of many important for prognosis disorders. Apart from that it is doubtful that possible prognosis for a patient suffering from bronchial asthma and chronic leukemia is comparable to the prognosis for the patient ailing from myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction.&lt;ref name="CharlsonMary" /&gt; ''In this case comorbidity of patient S, 73 years of age according to this method, is equivalent to mild state (9 out of 40 points)''.
# Modified Charlson Index: R. A. Deyo added chronic forms of ischemic cardiac disorder and the stages of chronic cardiac insufficiency to this index in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0895-4356(92)90133-8 |title=Adapting a clinical comorbidity index for use with ICD-9-CM administrative databases |year=1992 |last1=Deyo |first1=R |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=613–9 |pmid=1607900 |last2=Cherkin |first2=DC |last3=Ciol |first3=MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Elixhauser Index: The Elixhauser comorbidity measure include 30 comorbidities, which are not simplified as an index. Elixhauser shows a better predictive performance for mortality risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalization.&lt;ref name="ComorbidReview" /&gt; 
# Index of Co-Existent Disease (ICED): This Index was first developed in 1993 by S. Greenfield to evaluate comorbidity in patients with malignant neoplasms, later it also became useful for other categories of patients. This method helps in calculating the duration of a patient's stay at a hospital and the risks of repeated admittance of the same at a hospital after going through surgical procedures. For the evaluation of comorbidity the ICED index suggests to evaluate the patient's condition separately as per two different components: Physiological functional characteristics. The first component comprises 19 associated disorders, each of which is assessed on a 4-point scale, where "0" indicates the absence of disease and "3" indicates the disease's severe form. The second component evaluates the effect of associated diseases on the physical condition of the patient. It assesses 11 physical functions using a 3-point scale, where "0" means normal functionality and "2" means the impossibility of functionality.
# Geriatric Index of Comorbidity (GIC): Developed in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ageing/31.4.277 |title=Geriatric Index of Comorbidity: Validation and comparison with other measures of comorbidity |year=2002 |last1=Rozzini |first1=R. |journal=Age and Ageing |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=277–85 |pmid=12147566 |last2=Frisoni |first2=GB |last3=Ferrucci |first3=L |last4=Barbisoni |first4=P |last5=Sabatini |first5=T |last6=Ranieri |first6=P |last7=Guralnik |first7=JM |last8=Trabucchi |first8=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Total Illness Burden Index (TIBI): Developed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cncr.22615 |title=Assessment of prognosis with the total illness burden index for prostate cancer |year=2007 |last1=Litwin |first1=Mark S. |last2=Greenfield |first2=Sheldon |last3=Elkin |first3=Eric P. |last4=Lubeck |first4=Deborah P. |last5=Broering |first5=Jeanette M. |last6=Kaplan |first6=Sherrie H. |journal=Cancer |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=1777–83 |pmid=17354226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Analyzing the comorbid state of patient S, 73 years of age, using the most used international comorbidity assessment scales, a doctor would come across totally different evaluation. The uncertainty of these results would somewhat complicate the doctors judgment about the factual level of severity of the patient's condition and would complicate the process of prescribing rational medicinal therapy for the identified disorders. Such problems are faced by doctors on everyday basis, despite all their knowledge about medical science. The main hurdle in the way of inducting comorbidity evaluation systems in broad based diagnostic-therapeutic process is their inconsistency and narrow focus. Despite the variety of methods of evaluation of comorbidity, the absence of a singular generally accepted method, devoid of the deficiencies of the available methods of its evaluation, causes disturbance. The absence of a unified instrument, developed on the basis of colossal international experience, as well as the methodology of its use does not allow comorbidity to become doctor "friendly". At the same time due to the inconsistency in approach to the analysis of comorbid state and absence of components of comorbidity in medical university courses, the practitioner is unclear about its prognostic effect, which makes the generally available systems of associated pathology evaluation unreasoned and therefore un-needed as well.

== Treatment of comorbid patient ==
The effect of comorbid pathologies on clinical implications, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of many diseases is polyhedral and patient-specific. The interrelation of the disease, age and drug pathomorphism greatly affect the clinical presentation and progress of the primary nosology, character and severity of the complications, worsens the patient's life quality and limit or make difficult the remedial-diagnostic process. Comorbidity affects life prognosis and increases the chances of fatality. The presence of comorbid disorders increases bed days, disability, hinders rehabilitation, increases the number of complications after surgical procedures, and increases the chances of decline in aged people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(88)90074-5 |title=Financial risk, hospital cost, and complications and comorbidities in medical non-complications and comorbidity-stratified diagnosis-related groups |year=1988 |last1=Muñoz |first1=Eric |last2=Rosner |first2=Fred |last3=Friedman |first3=Richard |last4=Sterman |first4=Harris |last5=Goldstein |first5=Jonathan |last6=Wise |first6=Leslie |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=933–9 |pmid=3129939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of comorbidity must be taken into account when selecting the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment plans for any given disease. It is important to enquire comorbid patients about the level of functional disorders and anatomic status of all the identified nosological forms (diseases). Whenever a new, as well as mildly notable symptom appears, it is necessary to conduct a deep examination to uncover its causes. It is also necessary to be remembered that comorbidity leads to polypragmasy (polypharmacy), i.e. simultaneous prescription of a large number of medicines, which renders impossible the control over the effectiveness of the therapy, increases monetary expenses and therefore reduces compliance. At the same time, polypragmasy, especially in aged patients, renders possible the sudden development of local and systematic, unwanted medicinal side-effects. These side-effects are not always considered by the doctors, because they are considered as the appearance of comorbidity and as a result become the reason for the prescription of even more drugs, sealing-in the vicious circle. Simultaneous treatment of multiple disorders requires strict consideration of compatibility of drugs and detailed adherence of rules of rational drug therapy, based on E. M. Tareev's principles, which state: "Each non-indicated drug is contraindicated"{{cite quote|date=February 2013}} and B. E. Votchal said: "If the drug does not have any side-effects, one must think if there is any effect at all".{{cite quote|date=February 2013}}

A study of inpatient hospital data in the United States in 2011 showed that the presence of a major complication or comorbidity was associated with a great risk of intensive-care unit utilization, ranging from a negligible change for acute myocardial infarction with major complication or comorbidity to nearly nine times more likely for a major joint replacement with major complication or comorbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Barrett ML, Smith MW, Elizhauser A, Honigman LS, Pines JM | title =  Utilization of Intensive Care Services, 2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #185 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = December 2014 | url =https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb185-Hospital-Intensive-Care-Units-2011.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco''' was a Peruvian doctor. Born in Bellavista ([[El Callao]], [[Peru]]) on 28 September 1913. During the [[Second World War]] he was assigned by the Swiss consulate to oversee the interests of Peruvian citizens living in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. During that time Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco issued visas that allowed some Jewish families to leave Germany.&lt;ref name = "HR1"&gt;Cfr. Rittler, Hildegard. ''Ángeles en el infierno'', Madrid: LID Editorial, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco was born on 28 September 1913 to Moises Pinto-Bazurco and Rosa, née Alcalde. Moises Pinto-Bazurco was a master in mathematics and an officer in the Peruvian navy. Rosa Alcalde was a founder of a transport passenger business in Lima.

In 1934 Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco travelled to Germany, contracted by the pharmaceutical company [[Bayer]] to study medicine.  Pinto-Bazurco participated in various activities at the Casa Peru in Munich, which was a Multi-Cultural centre frequented by mainly Peruvians, Latin Americans and locals to the region of [[Bavaria]], Germany.

That is where Pinto-Bazurco met his future wife Hildegard Rittler, native of [[Rosenheim]], Bavaria, with whom he had 3 children: Rosa, born in 1942; Oscar Aurelio, born in 1945 and Ernesto, born in 1946.

=== World War II ===

At the start of [[World War II]] many Latin-Americans immigrants in Germany fled to other countries. Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco decided to stay in Munich, serving gratitude to the country that allowed him to study medicine and realizing that during war times the demand for doctors would be high.

During the first years of World War II Pinto-Bazurco worked as a doctor in a Munich hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus). The Nazi regime denied his 3 marriage attempts to Hildegard Rittler suggesting that it wasn’t acceptable that German women would marry a Peruvian where they were so many German men with whom she could marry.&lt;ref name = "HR2"&gt;Cfr. Rittler, Hildegard. ''Cuando el amor vence la guerra'', {{ISBN|978-99-89909-75-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbour]], Peru broke its relations with countries under the Axis alliance and withdrew its diplomats from Germany. The Peruvian consulate in Munich was transferred to Switzerland.

On 17 February, Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on the accusations of spying in the favour of the allies, on the grounds that his father was a Navy officer for a nation that was in opposition to the Nazi regime and the fact that he was one of a few Peruvians that stayed after the war had started. He was first imprisoned in the Munich Police station and then he was transferred to a fort in the city of [[Laufen, Germany|Laufen]] very close to the Austrian border. He was liberated on 14 May of the same year without any arrest charges.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Diario El Comercio, 30 de agosto de 2009, pág. b5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swiss Consulate Post ===

As soon as Peruvians relations broke with Germany, the [[Swiss Confederation]] assumed representation of Peru in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Del Campo, Juan. ''El Tercer Reich visto por Torre Tagle'', Lima, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss consulate in Germany assigned Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco to represent the interests of Peruvian citizens living in Munich.

Under these circumstances, Pinto-Bazurco is wanted by some Jewish families who were in hiding and who asked Pinto-Bazurco for help to escape Nazi persecution. When he asked one of these Jewish families (they were escaping to Argentina) why they sought his help, they told him that the surname Pinto is of Sephardic Jewish origin.

Pinto-Bazurco granted the necessary documentation without asking for any payment or benefit in return. Furthermore, Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco took care of some Jewish families, who dared not go to a public hospitals for fear of being arrested by the Nazis.

When the Second World War ended, the Peruvian ship Rimac repatriated some Peruvians who had stayed during the war. Among them was the Pinto-Bazurco family. In Peru, Hildegard Rittler carried out peaceful activities and promoted the positives that German culture had to offer, earning her the German "Cross of Merit".  Hildegard Rittler wrote her testimonial about those years lived with Ernesto Pinto-Bazurco in the novels "Angels in Hell"&lt;ref name = "HR1" /&gt; and "When love conquers war".&lt;ref name = "HR2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">Food [[balance sheet]] shows the a brief picture of the pattern of the [[food supply]] of a country. For each food item, it sketches the primary commodity availability for human consumption i.e. the sources of supply and its utilization in terms of nutrient value.

A food balance sheet is a comprehensive compilation of a selected country's food supply during a specific time period. The food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how it is produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply). The total quantity produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed,  losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.

The food balance sheet covers production, trade, feed and seed, waste, other utilization, availability, quantities, calories, proteins, and fats. By combining these elements, one is able to detect the food security of a country, how reliant it is on imported crops/foodstuffs, and how it attributes to world exports.

According to Margaret Buchanan-Smith of the tatti [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, the food balance sheet is the most traditional and widely used method of translating "early warning data into [[food aid]] requirements."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Buchanan-Smith (2000) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3804&amp;title=drought-early-warning-system Role of Early Warning Systems in the Decision-Making Process] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== East African Community Regional Food Balance Sheet ==

The EAC Regional Food Balance has been developed by the EAC Secretariat in collaboration with EAC Partner States (relevant public and private sector organizations). It is developed further to the provisions of the EAC Food Security Action Plan.
 
The background behind its development is recognition of it being an important tool towards the regions efforts of managing the food security situation. In principle, the Regional Food Balance Sheet is expected to give accurate and reliable information about food availability in the current period. It is a departure from the known traditional food balance sheet which gave historical information.
 
The RFBS is therefore a powerful tool for use by Governments in determining adequacy of food supplies for purposes managing food security concerns. Where the RFBS posts food surplus, the immediate impact is to release funds that the Government would have tied up in securing food not knowing that the region has sufficient food. It also encourages Governments to come up with proactive trade policy measures to encourage flow of food from countries which the RFBS reveal as having surplus. It therefore leads to actualization of the objectives of the EAC Customs Union of free flow of goods within the EAC region.
 
The RFBS is a powerful tool for the private sector to use in planning exports and imports. First preference due to preferential duties is the EAC regional market, where the private sector has an advantage over other supplies coming from outside the EAC region. It enables the private sector to use the hedge of Common External Tariffs which is in favour of intra-EAC trade to exploit trade potential for the various products covered under the RFBS.  The RFBS is also a tool that the private sector will use to engage Governments whenever there are reported short fall in supplies as revealed by RFBS, cannot meet. In such a case, the RFBS data will be used to lobby for temporary stay of application of Common External Tariff for the products facing regional shortages.
 
The RFBS is a powerful tool for Relief Agencies to use in determining regional food security crisis and planning for relief supplies. It is also a useful tool for the Relief Agencies to use in sourcing food supplies from the region based on the revealed food availability.
 
The scope of the comprehensive EAC Regional Food Balance Sheet has been informed by the EAC Food Security priority products that are covered under the following components
a)      Cereals and Pulses
b)      Livestock (Meat, Dairy Products and Animal Fats)
c)      Fisheries
d)      Horticulture (Fruits, Vegetables and Roots and Tubers)
e)      Industrial Crops (Sugar and Sugar Products, Oil Crops and Vegetable Oils)

== Country Example: Ivory Coast ==

In [[Ivory Coast]], a developing country, food security is an issue. This is apparent under Ivory Coast's 2009 (the most recent statistics) food balance sheet. Cereals- including wheat, corn, rye, oats, etc.- are a large part of the Ivorian diet. 1834000 metric tons are imported, 1167000 metric tons are produced, while only 112000 metric tons are exported. 
[[Cocoa production in Ivory Coast]] is the largest cocoa industry in the world, accounting for 30% of the World's production as of 2009. While producing 1223000 metric tons, Ivorians export 1192000 metric tons, making cocoa a major cash crop.

'''Granulomatous prostatitis''' is an uncommon disease of the [[prostate]], an [[exocrine gland]] of the [[male reproductive system]]. It is a form of [[prostatitis]], i.e. [[inflammation]] of the prostate, resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), [[BCG vaccine|BCG]] vaccine, [[malacoplakia]] or systemic granulomatous diseases which involve the prostate.

== Pathogenesis  ==

Prostatic secretions escape into the stroma and elicit an inflammatory response.

=== Histopathology ===

Noticeable destruction of Acini, surrounded by epitheloid cells, giant cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells and dense fibrosis.

{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=October 2015}}
A '''group home''' is a private [[House|residence]] model of medical care for those with complex health needs. Traditionally, the model has been used for children or young people who cannot live with their families, people with chronic disabilities who may be adults or seniors, or people with dementia and related aged illnesses. Typically, there are no more than six residents, and there is at least one trained caregiver there 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|title=Group homes|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Group-homes.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some early "model programs", a house manager, night manager, weekend activity coordinator, and 4 part-time skill teachers were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Close, D.W. (1977). Community living for severely and profoundly retarded adults: A group home study. ''Education and Training of the Mentally Retarded'', 12(3): 256-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the term group home referred to homes of 8 to 16 individuals, which was a state-mandated size during deinstitutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimes.org/community-disability-deinstitutionalization|title=Community &amp; disability: Deinstitutionalization|author=Julie Ann Racio|publisher=American Society for Public Administration|year=2012|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential nursing facilities, also included in this article, may be as large in 2015 as 100 individuals, which is no longer the case in field such as [[intellectual disability|intellectual]] and [[developmental disability|developmental]] disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, K. (1982, May 12). Small group setting best for severely retarded, experts say. ''Syracuse Herald American''. Syracuse, NY via Syracuse University's Center on Human Policy 1971-1989 newspaper collection.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the severity of the condition requiring one to need to live in a group home, some clients are able to attend day programs and most clients are able to live normal lifestyles.

The group homes highlighted in news articles in the late 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Slackman, M. (1988, February 27). Immediate increase sought in group homes. Gannett Westchester Newspapers, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 2000s, have been cited internationally as a symbol or emblem of the community movement. Group homes were opened in local communities, often with site selection hearings, by state government and non-profit organizations including the international [[L'Arche]], the local chapters of the [[Arc of the United States]] (then Association for Retarded Children), [[United Cerebral Palsy]] local agencies, agencies belonging to state associations such as ACLAIMH (Association of Community Living Administrators in Mental Health), and NYSACRA (New York State Association of Community Residence Administrators) in New York, and new, non-profit organizations in the field of mental health. Group homes are one category in a broader array, spectrum, continuum, or services systems plan for residential community services or Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS).

Another context in which the expression “group home” is used is referring to [[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care communities]] and similar organizations, providing residential services as part of the [[foster care]] system. There is a considerable variety of different models, sizes and kinds of organizations caring for children and youth who cannot stay with their birth families.&lt;ref&gt;Babic, B., &amp; Pluto, L. (2007). Participation in residential child care in Germany. Scottish Journal of Residential Child Care, 6(2), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and typologies==
A group home in a local community is what the government and universities term a "small group home." Group homes always have trained personnel, and administration located both for the home and outside the home at office locations. Larger homes often are termed residential facilities, as are campuses with homes located throughout a campus structure.

K. C. Lakin of the University of Minnesota, a deinstitutionalization researcher, has indicated that a taxonomy of residential facilities for individuals with mental retardation includes program model, size and operator, and facilities also then vary by disability and age, among other primary characteristics. Prior residential facility classifications were described by Scheerenberger until the modern day classification by David Braddock on a state-by-state basis which includes individuals in residential settings of six or fewer, one categorical group.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, B. &amp; Lakin, K.C. (1986,  April). Classification of residential facilities for individuals with mental retardation. ''Mental Retardation'', 24(2): 107-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Rizzolo, M.C., Tanis, E., Haffer, L., Lulinski, A. &amp; Wu, J. (2013). ''State of the States in Developmental Disabilities 2013: The Great Recession and its Aftermath''. Denver, CO: Department of Psychiatry and Colemand Institute, University of Colorado, Department of Disability and Human Development, University of Illinois-Chicago, and American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, typologies of residential services in intellectual disabilities include new categories of [[supported living]], personal assistance services, individual and [[family support]], and [[supported employment]].

===Residents and services===
Residents of group homes usually have a disability, such as [[autism]], [[intellectual disability]], chronic or long-term mental/psychiatric disorder, or physical or even multiple disabilities because those are the non-profit and state-regional organizations which began and operated the homes. Some group homes were funded as transitional homes to prepare for independent living (in an apartment or return to family or marriage and employment), and others were viewed as permanent community homes. Society may prevent people with significant needs from living in local communities with social acceptance key to community development. The residents sometimes need continual or supported assistance in order to complete daily tasks, such as taking medication or bathing, making dinners, having conversations, making appointments, and getting to work or a day service.

Group homes were revolutionary in that they offered individuals life opportunities to learn to cook and prepare meals (e.g., individuals with severe and even "profound" disabilities), budget their personal allowance, select photos for their room or album, meet neighbors and "carry out civic duties," go grocery shopping, eat in restaurants, make emergency calls or inquiries, and exercise regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Dever, R (1989). A taxonomy of community living skills. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(5): 395-404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schleien, S., Ash, T., Kiernan, J. &amp; Wehman, P. (1981, Summer). Developing independent cooking skills in a profoundly retarded woman. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 2: 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietupski, J., Welch, J. &amp; Wacker, D. (1983). Acquisition, maintenance, and transfer of grocery item purchasing skills by moderately and severely handicapped students. ''Education and Training of the Mentally Retarded'', 18(4): 279-286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Den Pol, R., Iwata, B., Ivanic, M., Page, T., Neef, N., &amp; Whitley, F. Paul. (1981). Teaching the handicapped to eat in public places: Acquisition, generalization and maintenance of restaurant skills. ''Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis'', 14: 61-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Risley, R. &amp; Cuvo, A.J. (1980). Training mentally retarded adults to make emergency telephne calls. ''Behavior Modification'', 4(4): 513-525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some residents may also have behavioral problems that require a better daily routine, medical assessment for possible health care needs (e.g., pituitary problem, medication adjustment), environmental changes (e.g., different roommates), mental health counseling, specialist or physician consultation, or supervision; government may require a finding of involuntary care (i.e. dangerous to themselves or others) which is a hotly contested and disputed arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|title=Group home|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Group-homes.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who move from psychiatric hospitals (and intellectual disability institutions) also may need medications reduced, with psychiatric symptoms often only moderately addressed ("modest efficacy") in this manner with known side effects of long-term use. The community living movement has been very successful in the US and other countries, and is supported in 2015 by the ''UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities'' (UN, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations ENABLE. (2006). ''UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities''. NY, NY: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S. (2014). International Agenda on Disability and Human Rights. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. (pp. 279-296). London: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1970s this function was served by institutions, asylums, poorhouses, and [[orphanage]]s until long-term services and supports, including group homes were developed in the US. The primary frameworks in the US undergirding group homes are often termed social and functional competency-based (e.g., community participation, social role valorization, social and community acceptance, self-determination, functional home and community skills) and another, positive behavioral supports (which may be considered overly structured for homes and home life). Positive behavioral supports were developed, in part, to assist with "management problems" of the residential facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruininks, R., Kudle, M., Wieck, C. &amp; Hauber, F. (198, June). Management problems in community residential facilities. ''Mental Retardation'', 18: 125-130&lt;/ref&gt; Group home residents may be found in workplaces, day services, parks and recreation programs, schools, shopping centers, travel locations, and with family, neighbors, community workers, coworkers, schoolmates, and friends.

In addition, new laws required that schools serve children with what was often known as "special needs" or "exceptional children" adapting school and afterschool programs to meet the needs of the new population groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A., Brown, L., Pumpian, I., Baumgart, D., Nisbet, J., Schroeder, J. &amp; Loomis, R. (nd). Strategies for developing individualized recreation and leisure programs for severely handicapped students. Adapted from Brown et al, (1980). ''Curricular Strategies for Teaching Severely Handicapped Student Functional and Nonfunctional Skills in School and NonSchool Environments''. Vol. X. Madison, WI: Madison Metropolitan School District.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Biklen in his award winning "Regular Lives" highlighted 3 schools in Syracuse, New York integrating the severely disabled in conjunction with his new book, ''Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainstreaming''.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, D.J. (1988, September 1). Award-winning "Regular Lives" to be seen nationally on PBS. ''The Syracuse Record''. Syracuse, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential treatment facilities===
People who live in a group home offering support services may be [[Developmental disability|developmentally disabled]], recovering from [[Substance dependence|alcohol or drug addiction]] (e.g., who may have attended a youth drug court hosted by the judicial system), abused or neglected youths, youths with behavioral or emotional problems, and/or youths with criminal records (e.g., a person in need of supervision). Group homes or group facilities may also provide residential treatment for youth for a time-limited period, and then involve return of the youth to the family environment.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, K. &amp; Garfat, T. (2003). From front line to family home: A youth care approach to working with families. ''Child and Family Services'', 25(1/2): 39-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, drug, addictions and alcohol programs may be time-limited, and involve residential treatment (e.g., Afrocentric model for 24 women and children, as part of Boston Consortium of Services).&lt;ref&gt;Amaro, H., McGraw, S., Larson, M., Lopez, L., &amp; Nieves, R. (2004). Boston Consortium of Services for Families in Recovery: A trauma-informed intervention model for women's alcohol and drug addiction treatment. In: B. Veysey &amp; C. Clark, Responding to Physical and Sexual Abuse in Women with Alcohol and Other Drug and Mental Disorders. (pp. 95-119). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residential treatment for children with mental health needs====
Residential treatment centers and other organized mental health care for children with emotional needs, among our highest health and human service efforts, was reported at 440 organizations nationally in 1988, representing 9% of mental health organizations.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute on Mental Health. (1991, July). Residential treatment centers and other organized mental health care for children and youth: United States, 1988. ''Mental Health Statistical Note No. 198''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential treatment centers were considered largely inappropriate for many of the children who needed better community support services.&lt;ref&gt;Wellis, K. (1991, July). Placement of emotionally disturbed children in residential treatment: A review of placement criteria. ''American Journal of Orthopsychiatry'', 61(3): 339-347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stroul, B. (1996). ''Childrens' Mental Health: Creating System of Care in a Changing Society''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Restructuring of these systems was proposed to promote better prevention and [[family support]] for children in mental health systems &lt;ref&gt;Friedman, R. M. (1994). Restructuring of systems to emphasize prevention and family support. ''Journal of Clinical Child Psychology'', 23 (Supplement): 40-48-7.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to international initiatives in "individualized family support program".&lt;ref&gt;Lord, J. &amp; Ochoka, J. (1995). Outcomes of an individualized family support program. ''Journal of Leisurability'', 22(4): 22-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential treatment is one part of an array of community services which include therapeutic foster care, family support, case management, crisis-emergency services, outpatient and day services, and home-based services.&lt;ref&gt;Kutash, K. &amp; Rivera, V. (1996). "What Works in Children's Mental health Services? Uncovering Answers to Critical Questions." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, residential treatment was also compared to supported housing, also called [[supportive housing]] for its role in comprehensive service system developments, though often for adults who may need or desire services.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, S. (1990, April). The relationship between residential treatment and supported housing in a comimunity system of services. "Psychosocial Rehabilitation", 13(4): 105-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community resources and neighborhoods===
Group homes have a good community image, and were developed in the intellectual disability and mental health fields as a desirable middle class option located in good neighborhoods after a faulty start in poorer neighborhoods in the US. Group homes were often built in accordance with principle of [[normalization (people with disabilities)]], to blend into neighborhoods, to have access to shopping, banks, and transportation, and sometimes, universal access and design.&lt;ref&gt;Gothelf, C. (1987). The availability of community resources to group homes in New York City. (pp. 146-164). In: R.F. Antonak &amp; J. A. Mullick, ''Transitions in Mental Retardation Volume 3: The Community Imperative Revisited''. Norwood, NJ: ABLEX Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, B.L., Seltzer, G.B. &amp; Seltzer, M.M. (1977). Ch. 3: Small group home. As Close as Possible: Community Residences for Retarded Adults. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Group homes may be part of residential services "models" offered by a service provider together with apartment programs, and other types of "followalong" services.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). Ch. 3: From residential services to housing and support. ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (pp. 47-72). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in 2015, the homes and personnel continue to meet the challenges of a changing multicultural society, and changing and norms in areas such as gender expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Nutter, D. &amp; Reid, D. (1978). Teaching retarded women a clothing selection skill using community norms. ''Journal of Applied Behavor Analysis'', 11: 475-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halfway houses and intermediate care facilities===
A group home differs from a [[halfway house]], the latter which is one of the most common terms describing community living opportunities in mental health in the 1970s' medical and psychiatric literatures. Specialized halfway houses, as half was between the institution and a regular home, may serve individuals with addictions or who may now be convicted of crimes, though very uncommon in the 1970s. Residents are usually encouraged or required to take an active role in the maintenance of the household, such as performing chores or helping to manage a budget. In 1984, New York's state office in intellectual and developmental disabilities described its service provision in 338 group homes serving 3,249 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, J., Silver, E. &amp; Schwartz,  A.(1984, October). Service provision in New York's group homes. ''Mental Retardation'', 22(5): 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these homes were certified as intermediate care facilities (ICF-MRs) and must respond to stricter facility-based standards.

Residents may have their own room or share rooms, and share facilities such as laundry, bathroom, kitchen, and common living areas.  The opening of group homes in neighborhoods is occasionally opposed by residents who fear that it will lead to a rise in crime and/or a drop in property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenspress.com/archives/features/2003/0718/feature.htm |title=Southeast Queens PRESS - Feature |publisher=Queenspress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, repeated reviews since the 1970s indicate such views are unfounded, and the homes contribute to the neighborhoods. In the late 1970s, local hearings were conducted in states such as New York, and parents of children with disabilities (e.g., Josephine Scro in the ''Syracuse Post Standard'' on June 7, 1979), research experts, agency directors (e.g., Guy Caruso of the Onondaga County Arc, now at Temple University) and community-disability planners (late Bernice Schultz, county planner) spoke with community members to respond to their inquiries. The late Josephine Scro later became a director of a new family support agency in Syracuse, New York, to assist other families with children with disabilities with family supports in their own homes and local communities, too.&lt;ref&gt;"Retarded adult" home proposed for DeWitt.(1979, June 1). ''Syracuse Post-Standard'', Page 8-East.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. A. (1998). Innovations in family support: What are we learning? ''Journal of Child and Family Studies'', 7(4): 433-449.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foster care and family support for children===
A group home can also refer to family homes in which children and youth of the [[foster care]] system are placed, sometimes until foster families are found for them, sometimes for long-term care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.troubledteenministries.com |title=Troubled Teen Ministries |publisher=Troubled Teen Ministries |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.troubledteenministries.com/directory/programs/group-homes-for-troubled-teens.html |title=Group Homes for Troubled Teens |publisher=Troubledteenministries.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homes which are termed group foster care operate under other standards than those termed group homes, including different management systems and departments.

Unrelated children or sibling groups live in a home-like setting with either a set of house parents or a rotating staff of trained caregivers.  Specialized therapeutic or treatment group homes are available to meet the needs of children with emotional, intellectual, physical, medical and/or behavioral difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.adoption.com/group-home.html|title=Group Home|last=Adoption.com|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group homes for children provide an alternative to traditional foster care, though [[family support]] to the birth, adoptive, and foster families are often first recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Lakin, K.C., &amp; Hill, B. (1989). Permanency planning for children and youth: Out-of-home placement decisions. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(6):541-549.&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources state that, in comparison to other placement alternatives, this form of care is the most restrictive for youth in the foster care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.childsworld.ca.gov/pg1349.htm|title = Group Homes|date = 2007|access-date = February 10, 2016|website = Department of Social Services|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term group home is often confused with lock-down [[Treatment centres|treatment centers]], which are required to have eyes-on every so often due to behavioral and mental challenges of the children and youth they serve. There are also less restrictive forms of group homes, which often use the house parent model. Those organizations are due to their visual comparability to several foster families within a certain area as well as their connectedness to each other, the community and internally best described as [[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care communities]].

Group homes and foster homes have been compared and studied in national samples.&lt;ref&gt;Lakin, K.C., Bruininks, R., Chen, T., Hill, B. &amp; Andersen, D. (1993). Personal characteristics and competence of people with mental retardation living in foster homes and small group homes.

Behavioral Residential Treatment. 1992;7(5):341–354.&lt;/ref&gt; Group homes were studied as part of a national sample of community living for individuals with severe disabilities, and small group homes 6 or under were among the recommended options, often for adults.&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1987). ''Small Homes: Westport Associates''. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supportive community options for adults with disabilities===
Newer options of group living were often termed [[supported living]], [[supported housing]], individual and family supports, or early on, "individualized supportive living arrangements" (e.g., apartment programs).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1989). Individualized supportive living arrangements: Pride, North Dakota. In: S. Taylor, R. Bogdan &amp; J. Racino (Eds.), ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives for Community Living, Family Support, and Group Homes. (1986). ''News Digest''.

Boston, MA: Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Services, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; These developments often followed analyses of homes as homes,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S.  (1993). ''Housing, Support and Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; ordinary housing and support services, versus group treatment or facilities, an important critique during the 1980s and 1990s reform period. [[Independent living]] continued to be a primary framework representing another emblem of community living more often associated with personal assistance and live-in attendants, home health services, and the now termed allied health services of physical and occupational therapy, speech, cognitive therapy, and psychological counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Condeluci, A., Cooperman, S. &amp; Self, B.A. (1987). Independent living: Settings and supports. (pp. 301-347). In: M. Ylivasker &amp; E. Gobble, ''Community Re-Entry for Head Injured Adults''. Boston, MA: Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; However, leading psychiatric survivors examined independent living in the context of [[supportive housing]] and necessary support services which did not need to be congregated in housing.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, H. T. (1990, April). Independent living with support services: The goal and future for mental health consumers. "Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal", 13(4): 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group options for seniors with disabilities===
Perhaps the largest group of group homes (now termed community residential services or residential care by other managements) fall under the heading of residential care homes for seniors, or both seniors and individuals with disabilities. Residential care categories include over 43 separate regulated categories by state governments and now have the new assisted living growing in the US. Group facilities (e.g., funded as large as 100 individuals in a nursing facility or on old-style campus of over 12 wards on the outskirts of cities) or homes for seniors (e.g., room and board) are designed for seniors who cannot live on their own due to physical or mental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SeniorServiceMatch|title=Find a Group Home Facility Near You!|url=http://www.seniorservicematch.com/group-homes|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Group facilities, which may involve over half of the allotted beds or more (80%) funded by Medicaid, might also be found under [[Nursing home|Residential Care Home]], [[Assisted living|Residential Care Facility]] for the Elderly, or Assisted Living Facility. Alternative community options for these seniors are home health care, hospice care, specialized care (e.g., Alzheimer's), day care at senior centers, meals on wheels, transportation drivers, and other aging and disability options.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014), ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. NY, NY: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights==
In most countries, people can still [[suffrage|vote]] and attend [[university]] while in a group home. [[Internet]] usage in group homes, however, may be severely limited.  Trips to [[public library|public libraries]] may vary depending on the distance from the group home to the library. While 93% of the Canadian population has easy access to a public library,&lt;ref&gt;Schrader, Alvin M. and Brundin, Michael R. 2002. "National Core Library Statistics Program Statistical Report, 1999: Cultural and Economic Impact of Libraries on Canada." p.15&lt;/ref&gt; it is uncertain about the percentage of Canadian group home residents who actually have unrestricted access to a public library in lieu of watching television.

===Employment and the Americans with Disabilities Act===
Employment opportunities, where available, are encouraged for group home residents, depending on the home, operator, and characteristics of the residents. Since the 1970s, people with cognitive or mental health disabilities have been involved in community employment of all kinds and also have developed freestanding affirmative industries and supported employment services in conjunction with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M., Wehman, P., Kregel, J., Banks, P. D., &amp; Metzler, H. (1987). Employment outcomes for people with moderate and severe disabilities: An eight-year longitudinal analysis of supported competitive employment. ''JASH'', 12(3): 182-189.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, now revised in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;Blanck, P.  (2000). ''Employment, Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act: Issues in Law, Public Policy and Research''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights laws, still operational in states, govern employment applications for employment, and the employer is restricted from asking pre-employment questions on criminal arrests or discriminating on this basis (See, Human Rights Laws of the state of New York). However, unbeknownst to many communities and organizations, management rights, instead of human rights, have been inserted in contracts in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. &amp; Whittico, P. (1998). The promise of self-advocacy and community employment. In: Wehman, P. &amp; Kregel, J., ''More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities''. (pp. 47-69). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health and civil rights===
In the US it has been the position of state mental health commissioners that many people who are living independently should be placed in intensive treatment, as described in a mid-1980s article in the ''Community Mental Health Journal''. The authors held that only 12 of 3,068 individuals should be living independently (p.&amp;nbsp;199) based on their model predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Shern, D.L., Wilson, N., Ellis, R., Bartsch, D. &amp; Coen, A. (1986, Fall). Planning a continuum of residential service settings for the chronically mentally ill: The Colorado experience. ''Community Mental Health Journal'', 22(3): 190-202.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the continuum model has been critiqued as restrictive of rights, facility-based, and restrictive of community participation &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J. &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1987). ''The Nonrestrictive Environment: On Community Integration of Persons with Severe Disabilities''. Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a US Supreme Court decision recognizing the most integrated setting (Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, 2012).

Increasingly, concern has been voiced over the rise in community treatment orders, medical homes, invasive supervision in homes, in addition to decades of outcry over involuntary procedures in psychiatry in the US and restrictions on human rights. In this field, no viable recourse exists for reversing actions by personnel, including professional and medical malpractice, and the most successful programs are viewed as those that result in high compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, T. (2010, April). The rise and fall of assertive community treatment. ''[[International Review of Psychiatry]]'', 22(2): 130-137.&lt;/ref&gt; High medication usage is required, often against the law, and the situation worsens during any police-enforced confinement. Group homes in the non-profit sector are often operated by other than the providers involved in state or private, for-profit involuntary care.

===Nursing facility industry===
The nursing facility industry holds the position, often with its affiliated hospitals, that it decides on involuntary treatment of elders, which involves issues such as visitations. Nursing homes have had a very long history of reviews and complaints including to the federal level of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the US and have been the subject of major reform efforts. Today, a Red Cross ombudsman may be available in the homes, special needs units may be available to assist in areas such as bathing and eating, and in some cities, short term rehabilitation is provided for seniors at those sites instead of at community locations. Nursing facilities, unlike the small size standard of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for homes for individuals with intellectual disabilities, may have over 100 "institutional clients" on site and is reporting 2-3% restraint use.

==Education and training==
Group home personnel are considered in 2015 to be Direct Support Professionals &lt;ref&gt;Larson, S., Sedelzky, L., Hewitt, A., &amp; Blakeway, C., (2014). Community Support Services Workforce in the US. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. NY, NY: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; though paramount in this approach are maintaining a home atmosphere, routines, and community life. An abundance of literature in the 1980s and 1990s described the training needs of personnel,&lt;ref&gt;Gage, M., Fredericks, B., Johnson-Dorn, N. &amp; Linley-Southard, B. (1982). Inservice training for staffs of group homes and work activity centers serving developmentally disabled adults. ''TASH Journal'', 7(4): 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demchak, M.A. &amp; Browder, D. (1990, June). An evaluation of the pyramid model of staff training in group homes for adults with severe handicaps. ''Education and Training in Mental Retardation'', 25: 150-163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T., Parker, T., Taubman, M. &amp; Lovaas, O.I. (1992). Transfer of staff training from workshops to group homes: A failure to generalize across settings. ''Research in Developmental Disabilities'', 13:57-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zane, T., Sulzer-Azaroff, B., Handen, B., &amp; Fox, C.J. (1982). Validation of a competency-based training program in developmental disabilities. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 8: 21-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and today new expectations continue to occur as the homes become increasingly health care financed and more self-direction options become available.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (2011). Sef-directed services: Communities and long-term supports. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and professional helping skills===
Foundational in all helping professions are what are called "critical skill domains," which are congruent with a community support approach (e.g., values clarification, general fluency and flexibility of thought, perception and response, competence in academic content, verbal communications) (Cole &amp; Lacefield, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Cole, H. &amp; Lacefield, W. (1978, October). Skill domains critical to the helping professions. ''Personnel and Guidance Journal'', 57: 115-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, N. (1975, Spring). Learning through human encounters. ''Improving University and College Teaching'', 23(2): 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with the multicultural workforce, cultural awareness, even skills like using chopsticks, are desired in the adaptive skill domains &lt;ref&gt;Kaylanpur, M. &amp; Harry, B. (1999). ''Culture in Special Education: Building Reciprocal Family-Professional Relationships''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and comparisons between fast food and sit down restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Marholin, D., O'Toole, K., Touchette, P., Berger, P. &amp; Doyle, D. (1979). "I'll have a Big Mac, Large Fries, Large Coke, and Apple Pie"...or Teaching Adaptive Community Skills. ''Behavior Therapy'', 10: 236-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community volunteers and participation===
By the 1990s, greater emphasis was placed on community participation and belonging, in addition to welcoming support of the community and community members.&lt;ref&gt;Pace, S. &amp; Turkel, W. (1990, April). Participants, community volunteers and staff: A collaborative approach to housing and support. "Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal", 13(4): 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, several national research centers in the US were funded, in part, on the basis of community research studies in community participation &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Bogdan, R. &amp; Lutfiyya, Z. (1995). "The Variety of Community Experience: Qualitative Studies of Family and Community Life".  London: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1995). Baking bread together: A study of membership and inclusion. (pp. 117-139). In: S.J. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; Z.M. Lutfiyya, "The Variety of Community Experience: Qualitative Studies of Family and Community Life". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special population groups===
Education also occurs for special population groups or particular issues or needs; an example are the challenges gay men face in living with chronic illness &lt;ref&gt;Lipton, B. (2004). ''Gay Men Living with Chronic Illness and Disabilities: From Crisis to Crossroads''. London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; including HIV-AIDS which may be addressed in [[supported housing]] options. Attention is also paid to developing residential services which meet the preferences of persons with serious mental illness and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.S., Danley, K., Anthony, W.A., Martin, R., &amp; Walsh, D. (1994). The residential needs and preferences of persons with serious mental illness: A comparison of consumers and family members. ''The Journal of Mental Health Administration'', 21(1): 42-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent living and brain/head injury services===
Education and training in [[independent living]] from long-term care institutions (e.g., acute care facilities, long-term rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing or intermediate care facilities, community re-entry facilities) often involved changing from forced dependency to controlling and deciding one's own destiny called self-determination.  Life skills ranged from health and hygiene, parenting/child care, home maintenance, money management, activities of daily living, community awareness and mobility, legal awareness, social/interpersonal skills, and family involvement (Condeluci, Cooperman, &amp; Self, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Condeluci, A., Cooperman, S. .&amp; Self, B.A. (1987). Independent living: Settings and supports. (pp. 301-347). In: M. Ylivasker &amp; E. Gobble, ''Community Re-Entry for Head Injured Adults''. Boston, MA: Little, Brown, &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; These services may be called post-acute services, and involve other personnel models, such as life coaches (Jones, Patrick, Evans, &amp; Wuff, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, M., Patrick, P. D., Evans, R.W. &amp; Wuff, J.J. (1991). The life coach model of community re-entry. In: B. McMahon &amp; L. Shaw, ''Work Worth Doing''. Orlando, FL: Paul M. Deutsch.&lt;/ref&gt; Independent living training has also proved effective in addressing the needs and expectations of individuals who have sensory impairments (e.g., hearing or blindness).&lt;ref&gt;Iceman, D. &amp; Dunlop, W. (1984). Independent living skills training: A survey of current practices. ''Journal of Rehabilitation'', 50: 53-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost of residential services==
Residential services costs have been studied in depth in areas that relate to group homes, family care homes or community residential services, especially on deinstitutionalization, Medicaid home and community-based waiver development, and community development.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzolo, M., Friedman, C., Lulinski-Norris, A. &amp; Braddock, D. (2013). HCBS waivers: A nationwide study of states: Intellectual and developmental disabilities. ''American Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities'', 51(1): 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D. &amp; Johnson, D. (2005). Costs of family care for individuals with developmental disabilities. In: R. Stancliffe &amp; K. C. Lakin, ''Costs and Outcomes of Community Services for People with Intellectual Disabilities''. (pp. 63-89). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, V.J. &amp; Conroy, J. W. (1983). X. Client-Specific Costs. ''Third Year Comprehensive Report of the Pennhurst Longitudinal Study''. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential treatment, often provided in larger facilities, may be higher in reimbursement rates to the provider so treatment billings will be found for higher-cost professional services (e.g., behavioral health). Surprisingly, except for very small sizes, the larger, medicalized facilities bill the highest costs per individual (e.g., intermediate care facilities over 16 in the state of New York).&lt;ref&gt;American Association for Retired Persons. (2012). ''Across the States: Profiles of Long-Term Services and Supports''.(9th Edition). Washington, DC: Public Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual and family costs of services===
In relationship to the individual or family, residential services are expensive for low or middle-class families, and federal, state and local government often contribute to these costs. Medicaid-funded options may require use of assets, and Social Security Disability or Social Security are also part of payment plans. New options called family-directed and user-directed involve transfer of funds to homes and families, and continue to be in process in states. Early organizations provided information on their management and financing to help local communities replicate or begin their own homes and programs.&lt;ref&gt;Romer, L.T. (1987). ''Neighborhood Living Project Management and Finance Training Package''. Eugene, OR: University of Oregon, Center on Human Development, Cost:$5.00&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential care, assisted living, supported housing===
Residential care homes, run by the government or by the for-profit and non-profit industries, need not be low cost and/or low quality as many might initially guess, though traditional room and boards may be based primarily on a Social Security Disability payment and limited governmental personnel assistance. More expensive residential care homes now exist to offer a family-style, high quality, care option to the next class of senior care which is [[Assisted Living]] Facilities. These homes, operated often by the nursing care industry, are based on increasing need for assistance and decreasing independence. Unlike the proposals for upgraded community services in homes and communities for seniors with substantial needs, assisted living was primarily developed as facility types only; [[supported housing]] also was a new model as state initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Pynoos, J., Liebig, P., Alley, D., &amp; Nishita, C. (2004). Homes of choice: Towards more effective linkages between housing and support. In: J. Pynoos, P. Hollander Feldman, &amp; J. Ahrens, ''Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Opportunities and Options''. (pp. 5-39). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seniors, disability and aging===
There are various levels of residential care homes for seniors, which is the traditional medical system of assessments, which differs from developing person-centered plans and support services for persons who may have substantial health care needs&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, K. (2002). Beyond getting sick. In: J. O'Brien &amp; C.L. O'Brien, ''Implementing Person-Centered Planning''. (pp. 215-230). Toronto, Canada: Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and also from new managed Medicaid care plans. In addition, in some fields, the plan is for the individual to age in place in their group home setting. Personal care assistance is often associated with aging in place and [[independent living]] services; local governments have been reluctant to pay for other than limited services in the homes (one study stated up to 20 hours maximum, others 3–4 hours per week), in spite of a nationwide decades press toward our own governments. This position is similar to a governmental position to pay not for ordinary goods, but only for specialized services.

However, senior services of other kinds, including the senior centers,&lt;ref&gt;Beisgen, B. &amp; Kroitchman, M. (2003). ''Senior Centers: Opportunities for Successful Aging''. NY, NY: Springer Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; low cost meals, transportation, Veteran's health services and independent clubs, specialized day care (e.g., day care for older adult policies in Great Britain),&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C. (2001). ''Adult Day Services and Social Inclusion''. Aberdeen, UK: Robert Gordon University and London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Force, L. &amp; O'Malley, M. (1998). Adult day services. (pp. 294-315). In: M Janicki, A. J. Dalton, "Dementia, Aging and Intellectual Disabilities: A Handbook." Castleton, JY: Hamilton Printing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; local case managers, local Offices of the Aging (with Disability coordinators in some locations), and so forth are often available. Senior programs may also involve joint integration initiatives by aging and disability agencies resulting in leading programs such as social model day programs in Oneida County, New York, Rhode Island's Apartment Residence, Madison County Integration Program, and supported retirement programs in the state of Utah.&lt;ref&gt;Janicki, M. &amp; Keefe, R. (1992). "Casebook: Integration Experiences." Albany, NY: New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assisted living is a modernization effort (e.g., more choices or menus of services) in the nursing care fields which primarily resulted in modernization, to some extent,  of the large facility (i.e., nursing homes) or campus models. Large state initiatives can be found in Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults representing response to long-term criticism of a facility-based service industry.&lt;ref&gt;Pynoos, J., Feldman Hollander, P., &amp; Ahrens, J. (2004). "Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Options and Opportunities". (pp. 5-39). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent nursing industry schema, reflecting a provider network, for levels of care states:  "Assisted Living With no Assistance" (the most common use of "assisted living" involves little or no assistance, living at home with minimal amounts of [[home care]]), "Assisted Living with Assistance", and "Assisted Living - Memory Care". Memory care is for those dealing with memory loss, [[dementia]],  or Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memory Care Home Solutions|title=Mission|url=http://www.memorycarehs.org/|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the call nationwide is for caregiving services in the homes where aging parents often move to live with their adult children and their families. The provider sector desired are those that respect the wishes of the individual and the family, including for care at home through hospice. The ''New Politics of Old Age Policy'' (Robert Hudson, 2005/2010) calls for the government entertaining care credits or generous minimum benefits to assist US families to juggle paid and unpaid work in today's modernized world.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, R. (2005/2010). ''The New Politics of Old Age Policy'' (2nd edition). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as parents age, adults with disabilities who may be living at home will also need assistance that might not have been needed earlier (e.g., siblings, new home).

The multi-billion [[Indian rupee|rupee]] '''Gurgaon kidney scandal''' came to light in January 2008 when police arrested several people for running a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] [[racket (crime)|racket]] in [[Gurgaon]],&lt;ref name="toibusted"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-01-25/delhi/27776613_1_kidney-racket-transplant-racket-moradabad-senior-superintendent |title=Kidney racket busted in Gurgaon|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2008-01-25 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an industrial township near [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. Kidneys from most of the victims, who were the poor hailing from the nearby western [[Uttar Pradesh]],&lt;ref name="toibusted"/&gt; were transplanted into clients from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Greece.

=== The police raid  ===
On 24 January 2008, police teams from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh raided a residential building and a guest house owned by Amit Kumar.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/spilling-the-beans-how-the-kidney-racket-unfolded/58458-3.html|title=Spilling the Beans: How the kidney racket unfolded|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2008-02-10|work=Indo-Asian News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Gurgaon police, the scandal at a local clinic was going on for six to seven years. The donors were lured with offerings of about [[Rs.]] 30,000 for kidney removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-02-04/india/27746299_1_kidney-racket-amit-kumar-raut | title = Kidney racket: Women did con job for Amit Kumar | accessdate = 2008-01-08 | work=The Times Of India | first1=Mateen | last1=Hafeez}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, they were lured to the clinic on the pretext of job opportunities. They were instead asked for donating their kidneys for the fee and all those who resisted this were drugged against their will and subsequently operated upon.&lt;ref name="Guardian25Jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/india/story/0,,2246988,00.html |title=Indian police arrest suspected kidney snatching gang|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-01-25 |accessdate=2008-02-06|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haryana]] police, under whose jurisdiction the scandal happened, issued arrest warrants against Upendra Aggarwal, a general physician and an associate of Amit Kumar for his involvement in the scandal. However, at the time of the police raid, Kumar and his other accomplices escaped after the knowledge of possible arrests.&lt;ref name="sify06Jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14600655 |title=Kidney kingpin has network of overseas touts|publisher=[[Sify]]|date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid helped rescue five people and shifted them to a Gurgaon hospital.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt;

=== Aftermath of the raid ===
On 25 January 2008, the police detained a [[United States]]-based [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]] couple and three Greek nationals, two among them being patients receiving the transplants.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt;

The police revealed that Dr. Amit Kumar and his accomplices had performed 600 kidney transplants in the past decade.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sify06Jan"/&gt; Additionally, at least two hospitals were involved in the after care of patients.&lt;ref name=Commodity&gt;Scheper-Hughes, Nancy. The Last Commodity: Post-Human Ethics, Global (In)Justice, and the Traffic in Organs. Penang: Multiversity &amp; Citizens International, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Police, through the technology of fingerprinting, determined that Kumar went by many aliases and had been previously arrested at least four different times for illegal [[organ trade]] operations.&lt;ref name=Commodity /&gt; It was further revealed that Kumar, his brother Jeevan Kumar, Upendra Aggarwal and Saraj Kumar, an anesthesiologist were previously arrested thrice on charges of illegal human organ transplantation in [[Delhi]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]]. They were, however, released on bail.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt; On 7 January 2008 Kumar was arrested by [[Delhi Police]] but was released on a bribe of Rs. 20 [[lakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-31972520080215 | title = Delhi policeman arrested in kidney racket scandal | accessdate=2008-02-23 | work=Reuters | date=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeevan Kumar was later arrested on 17 February 2008 in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7250185.stm | title = India organ doctor associate held| accessdate = 2008-02-18 | work=BBC News | date=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Medical Association]], arranged a probe by its three-member committee, and further requested investigation by [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), India's higher investigation agency.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt; The Haryana police further uncovered 2 hospitals and 10 laboratories in Greater [[Noida]] and [[Meerut]], cities nearby to [[New Delhi]] for their alleged involvement in the scandal.&lt;ref name="ibnchronology"/&gt;

In the meanwhile, a Gurgaon court had issued arrest warrants for Amit Kumar and his brother, Jeevan Kumar Rawat. With growing suspicions that Kumar might have fled the country,&lt;ref name="cnnibnfled"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/kidney-kingpin-had-links-with-nepal-minister/58092-3.html |title=Kidney kingpin had links with Nepal minister|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Haryana]] police requested the CBI to alert the [[Interpol]]. Thereafter, [[Red corner notice]]s were issued for the Kumar siblings.&lt;ref name="HTredcorner"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=758d28b1-8cd9-4d58-9e7d-50a537de4846&amp;ParentID=2eb17c76-9611-4140-95c5-bda67188a18b&amp;MatchID1=4657&amp;TeamID1=5&amp;TeamID2=2&amp;MatchType1=2&amp;SeriesID1=1172&amp;PrimaryID=4657&amp;Headline=Red+Corner+notices+out+for+kingpin%2c+brother |title=Red Corner notices out for kingpin, brother|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=2008-02-01|last=Srivastava|first=Tushar|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrest of Amit Kumar ===
On 7 February 2008, Amit Kumar was arrested in the neighboring country of [[Nepal]]. He was hiding in a wildlife resort, about 35 miles from the Indo-Nepal border. He had a [[bank draft]] worth Rs. 936,000 along with a total of [[Euro|€]]145,000 and [[Dollar|$]]18,900 in cash.&lt;ref name="guardianarrest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2254932,00.html |title=Doctor arrested over Indian kidney racket|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-02-09|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|accessdate=2008-02-10 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the resort he made an unsuccessful attempt to bribe the Nepali policemen to let him go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080040741&amp;ch=2/9/2008%209:57:00%20AM | title = Amit Kumar tried to bribe Nepali cops: report | accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges filed against him by CBI are under sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon), sections 342 (wrongful confinement), sections 420 (cheating) and sections 120B (criminal conspiracy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200802101864.htm | title = Amit Kumar sent to CBI custody till Feb. 22 in kidney racket | accessdate=2008-02-10 | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | date=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent conviction ===
In March 2013, a [[CBI special court]] convicted five accused while acquitting another five in the case of a Gurgaon kidney transplant racket that was busted in 2008. Dr Upender Dublesh and Dr Amit Kumar, who was termed a "quack" in no uncertain terms by the court, got seven-year [[rigorous imprisonment]] (RI) besides a fine of over Rs. 60 lakh each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Punjab/Kidney-racket-Mastermind-doctors-get-7-yr-jail/Article1-1030875.aspx | title = Kidney racket: Mastermind doctors get 7-yr jail | accessdate=2013-03-23 | location=Panchkula, India | work=[[Hindustan Times]] | date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group has met on several occasions to establish a common knowledge base and to develop strategies for reducing dietary sodium consumption among Canadians. The process that Health Canada is following is patterned after that carried out by the [[Food Standards Agency]] in the UK – that is, no discussion of the science, but rather an immediate move to sodium reduction programs and policies.  The concerns over salt are chiefly based upon its ability to affect blood pressure.

==Debate==
There is some debate on the impact of sodium reduction upon [[blood pressure]].  The salt industry and some food and beverage producers emphasize the [[heterogeneous]] impact of sodium on individuals. For example, they observe that about 30% of normotensive individuals experience a drop in blood pressure, while about 20% of normotensive individuals experience an increase in blood pressure - the remaining population showing no effect.&lt;ref&gt;Luft, F.C., Rankin, L.I., Block, R. et al. ''Cardiovascular and humoral responses to extremes of sodium intake in normal black and white men,'' Circulation, 1979; 60: 697–706.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J.Z., Weinberger, M.H., Daugherty, S.A. et al. ''Heterogeneity of blood pressure responses to dietary sodium restriction in normotensive adults,'' Journal of Chronic Diseases, 1987; 40: 245–250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luft, F.C., McCarron, D.A., ''Heterogeneity of hypertension: the diverse role of electrolyte intake,'' Annual Review of Medicine, 1991; 42: 347–355.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, some argue that programs to reduce salt will not hold the same benefits for everyone and policies to arbitrarily promote salt reduction will discriminate against a certain segment of the population.  They argue that an across the board reduction in dietary sodium may not be the right approach &lt;ref&gt;Alderman, M.H., et al., ''Low urinary sodium associated with greater risk of myocardial infarction among treated hypertensive men,'' Hypertension, 25, 1144-1152, (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, M.H., et al., ''Dietary sodium intake and mortality: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I),'' Lancet, 351, 781-785, (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H., et al., ''Sodium intake and mortality in the NHANES II follow-up study,'' American Journal of Medicine, 119, 275, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H.W., Hallpern, S. M., and Alderman, M. H., ''Sodium Intake and Mortality Follow-Up in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III),'' J Gen Intern Med., {{doi|10.1007/s11606-008-0645-6}}, May 18, (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paterna S ; Gaspare P ; Fasullo S ; Sarullo FM ; Di Pasquale P., ''Normal-sodium diet compared with low-sodium diet in compensated congestive heart failure: is sodium an old enemy or a new friend?'' Clin Sci (Lond).  2008; 114(3):221-30 ({{ISSN|1470-8736}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paterna, S., et al., ''Medium Term Effects of Different Dosage of Diuretic, Sodium, and Fluid Administration on Neurohormonal and Clinical Outcome in Patients With Recently Compensated Heart Failure,'' American J. Cardiol 2009;103:93–102.&lt;/ref&gt; and the outcome may lead to unintended consequences for Canadian consumers.

On the other hand, groups concerned with [[cardiovascular]] health and [[nutrition]] emphasize the overall negative effects of high levels of [[sodium]] in the North American diet.  Based upon a study carried out in the US in 1991 on a total of 62 people, the presumption made is that most of the sodium Canadians consume (77%) comes from processed foods sold in grocery stores and in food service outlets. Only about 11% is added during preparation or at the table, with the remainder occurring naturally in foods.&lt;ref&gt;Mattes RD, Donnelly D. "Relative contributions of dietary sodium source." Journal of the American College of Nutrition 1991;10(4):383-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the individual benefits of reducing sodium intake are variable, it has been theorized that dietary sodium reduction could eliminate [[hypertension]] for over a million Canadians, with a resulting savings of at least 430 million dollars annually in direct high blood pressure management costs (although this has never been confirmed through clinical trials). In other words, while not all Canadians need to reduce their intake of dietary sodium, many have been urged to.  Moreover,theoretical estimates have projected that we may be better off because of a possible reduction of tax-supported health care.&lt;ref&gt;Joffres MR, Campbell NRC, Manns B, Tu K. Estimate of the benefits of a population-based reduction in dietary sodium additives on hypertension and its related health care costs in Canada. Canadian Journal of Cardiology 2007;23(6):437-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbandment==
In February 4, 2011, the Ottawa Citizen reported that the Health Canada Sodium Working Group had been disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/health/Sodium+reduction+panel+disbanded/4220182/story.html|title=Sodium reduction panel disbanded|author=Sarah Schmidt |date=February 4, 2011|publisher=Ottawa Citizen |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Group had been charged with tracking whether companies were reducing the level of salt in processed foods over the next five years. This follows actions in the United Kingdom to [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/20/food-standards-agency-nations-diet abolish the dietary mandate of the FSA] (Food Standards Agency) the government unit most actively involved in salt reduction advocacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Health Sciences Online''' ('''HSO''') is a [[non-profit]] [[online]] health information resource that launched in December 2008. The website hosts a virtual learning center providing [[weblinks]] to a collection of  more than 50,000 courses, references, textbooks, guidelines, lectures, presentations, cases, articles, images and videos, available in 42 different languages. The content includes [[medicine]], [[public health]], [[nursing]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[nutrition]], [[kinesiology]] and other [[health sciences]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hso.info/about/about.html About HSO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The website aims to provide quality educational resources to [[health care provider]]s in training and practice, especially in [[developing countries]], thus bridging the [[digital divide]] (the global imbalance in access to information technology). The underlying aim is to support the [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]] of [[public health]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank, E. A New Way to Train and Support the World's Health Workers.  Medscape J Med. 2008;10(9): 219.  Available at: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580140. Accessed June 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also intended to be useful for providers in industrialized countries.  The hope is to create revolutions in democratizing health sciences education.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, E.  Health Sciences Online: Eight+ Revolutions and Ten+ Brief Analyses.  Open Medical Journal. 2008; 1(4): 1-4.  Available at: www.cih.ubc.ca/media/1TOMEDEDUJ.pdf.  Accessed June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The four pillars of HSO are being comprehensive, authoritative, ad-free and free. The next step for HSO is to become an online health sciences learning centre, providing credentials and [[distance education]] degrees to help satisfy the great need for more and better-prepared [[health care professional]]s worldwide.

HSO is an official supporting organisation of  "Healthcare Information For All by 2015"

==History==
HSO was conceived of by Founder and Executive Director [[Erica Frank]], MD, MPH in 2001. A pilot of the site ran from 2006 until 2008, first only covering [[HIV/AIDS]], and then moving on to include the entire site. The pilot ran in 11 countries in [[North America]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] in order to assess the function, user interface, features, expectations, and needs of the users of HSO. The pilot was provided to health professionals at various levels of training and in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, E. [https://wiki.bc.net/atl-conf/download/attachments/17008277/Discover+Health+Sciences+Online.ppt?version=1 Discover Health Sciences Online] Seminar Presentation.  Accessed June 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding collaborators==
Founding collaborators include the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[World Bank]], the [[American College of Preventive Medicine]], the [[University of British Columbia]], and the [[World Medical Association]]. 

Funding has been obtained from the [[Government of Canada|Canadian]] and [[British Columbian government]]s, the [[World Health Organization]], [[NATO]]’s Science for Peace Program, the Annenberg Physician Training Program, the Ulrich and Ruth Frank Foundation for International Health, and others.  There has also been a large cadre of volunteers who have worked on the site’s development.

==Search engine==
HSO uses the Velocity Search Platform provided by [[Vivisimo]] to search all of its collected resources. In addition, [[Google Translate]] is used to provide results in 42 different languages.

==Resources==
HSO is a [[web portal]] for searching health sciences resources that have been selected by a core team of volunteers, including health providers and scientists from different countries. The resources have been selected based on guidelines produced by several groups that help in assessing the quality of online health information.&lt;ref&gt;Association of American Medical Colleges Peer Review Task Force.  Digital and Educational Peer Review. AAMC, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health Summit Working Group. Criteria for Assessing the Quality of Health Information on the Internet.

'''Interventional oncology''' (abbreviated '''IO''') is a subspecialty field of [[interventional radiology]] that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and cancer-related problems using targeted minimally invasive procedures performed under image guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey R, Vouche M, Sze DY, et al.

== Applications ==

Interventional oncology procedures are commonly applied to treat primary or [[metastatic]] cancer. Interventional oncology may be offered once traditional [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]] have failed or are not considered safe. IO treatments may be also offered in combination with any of the above oncological therapies in order to augment the therapeutic outcome in more complex or widespread (metastatic) cancer cases. There is an increase in the variety of applications of interventional oncological treatments for primary and metastatic cancer in different human body organs:
* [[Liver cancer]]: primary liver tumours known as [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] and liver metastases.&lt;ref name="sirweb" /&gt;
* [[Lung cancer]]: usually lung metastases or inoperable primary lung cancer.&lt;ref name="Pereira2012" /&gt;
* [[Kidney Cancer]]: usually small kidney tumours known as [[renal cell carcinoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsanos K, Mailli L, Krokidis M, et al. Systematic review and meta-analysis of thermal ablation versus surgical nephrectomy for small renal tumours. Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 2014 Apr;37(2):427-37. {{doi|10.1007/s00270-014-0846-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bone Cancer]]: for bone metastases located in the spine, pelvis and long bones.&lt;ref&gt;Kurup AN, Callstrom MR. Ablation of musculoskeletal metastases: pain palliation, fracture risk reduction, and oligometastatic disease. Tech Vasc Interv Radiol. 2013 Dec;16(4):253-61. {{doi|10.1053/j.tvir.2013.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Breast Cancer]]: for small tumours.
* [[Prostate Cancer]]: large inoperable tumours.
* [[Pancreatic cancer]]: inoperable advanced neoplasms.

== Milestones ==

== Procedures ==

Interventional oncology procedures are generally divided between [[diagnostic]] procedures that help obtain tissue diagnosis of suspicious neoplasms and therapeutic ones that aim to cure or palliate the tumour. Therapeutic interventional oncology procedures may be classified further into [[ablation]] techniques that destroy neoplastic tissues by delivery of some form of heat, cryo or electromagnetic energy and embolization techniques that aim to occlude the blood vessels feeding the tumour and thereby destroy it by means of [[ischemia]]. Both ablation and embolization techniques are minimally invasive treatment, i.e. they may be delivered through the skin (in a [[percutaneous]] way) without the need for any skin incisions or other form of [[open surgery]]. Hence, most treatments are nowadays offered as day case or [[outpatient]] appointments and patients may enjoy rapid recovery and minimal pain and discomfort with low rates of complications.&lt;ref&gt;Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe, "[http://cirse.org/?pid=1010 IR Procedures]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnostic techniques ===
* Fine needle aspiration: [[biopsy]] with a fine needle trying to obtain tissue diagnosis by examining the tumour cells.
* Core needle biopsy: similar to fine needle aspiration, only involving the use of larger needles to excise the tissue.
* Vacuum assisted biopsy: similar to core needle aspiration but using vacuum assistance to gather the sample. Vacuum assisted breast biopsy may provide a high diagnostic yield in case of breast tumours.

=== Ablation techniques ===
* Chemical Ablation: one of the earliest ablative techniques involving the injection of substances such as [[ethanol]] or [[acetic acid]] into a tumour to cause protein denaturation and [[cell death]].
* [[Radiofrequency ablation]]: tissue destruction through delivery of electricity that produces ionic friction.
* [[Irreversible electroporation]]: delivery of electrical fields to disrupt cellular membranes and cause cell death or [[apoptosis]] or enhance targeted drug delivery.
* [[Cryoablation]]: instant cell death by tissue freezing to temperatures as low as -20 Celsius.
* [[Microwave ablation]]: electromagnetic energy produces high frequency [[oscillation]] of water molecules leading to tissue [[coagulation]] by heat.
* [[High-intensity focused ultrasound]] (HIFU): targeted beam of focused [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves that accumulates high energy and burns the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Napoli A, Anzidei M, Marincola BC, et al. MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound for treatment of bone metastasis. Radiographics. 2013 Oct;33(6):1555-68. {{doi|10.1148/rg.336125162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Laser ablation (Interstitial laser therapy): tissue coagulation by a laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;Gangi A, Basile A, Buy X, et al. Radiofrequency and laser ablation of spinal lesions. Semin Ultrasound CT MR. 2005 Apr;26(2):89-97 {{PMID|15856810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Embolisation techniques ===
* [[Bland embolization]]: delivery of sub-millimiter microparticles through a catheter inserted in the groin and advanced into the liver under X-ray guidance to get access into the tumor vasculature.
* [[Transarterial chemoembolization]] (TACE): delivery of intra-arterial chemotherapy to the liver through a catheter in combination with embolic material to produce [[ischemia]].
* Drug eluting bead chemoembolization (DEB-TACE): delivery of microparticles that are themselves loaded with the chemotherapy agent – doxorubicin – and allow for prolonged elution into the tumour microvessels.&lt;ref&gt;Salem R, Lewandowski RJ. Chemoembolization and radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2013 Jun;11(6):604-11; quiz e43-4. {{doi|10.1016/j.cgh.2012.12.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selective internal radiation therapy]] (also known as SIRT or radioembolization): microspheres loaded with a radioactive isotope ([[Yttrium-90]]) are injected into the blood vessels feeding a tumour and deliver a lethal dose of radiation into the vessels feeding the tumour thereby causing cell death.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Adra DP, Gill RS, Axford SJ, et al. Treatment of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with yttrium-90 radioembolization: a systematic review and pooled analysis. Eur J Surg Oncol. 2015 Jan;41(1):120-7. {{doi|10.1016/j.ejso.2014.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intra-arterial chemotherapy: high dose chemotherapy is administered directly into the tumor-feeding arteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/intra-arterial-chemotherapy/ Cancer Treatment Center of America, Intra-Arterial chemotherapy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portal Vein Embolization|Portal vein embolization]] (PVE): delivery of bland embolic material into the portal vein of the hepatic lobe containing the tumor of interest to induce hypertrophy in the contralateral hepatic lobe for the purposes of improving outcomes from planned surgical resection.
* [[Radiation Lobectomy]]: injection of small radioactive beads loaded with [[yttrium-90]] into the hepatic artery feeding the hepatic lobe in which the tumor is located. This is done with the intent of inducing growth in the contralateral hepatic lobe, not dissimilarly from portal vein embolization. 

=== Palliative techniques ===

Interventional oncology has long been used to provide palliative care for patients. IO procedures can help reduce cancer-related pain and improve patients’ quality of life. Tumours can intrude into various ducts and blood vessels of the body, obstructing the vital passage of food, blood or waste. The interventional radiological treatment known as stenting can be used to re-open blockages, for example of the esophagus or bile ducts in cases of esophageal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma, respectively, considerably relieving the patient’s adverse symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Katsanos K, Ahmad F, Dourado R, Sabharwal T, Adam A. Interventional radiology in the elderly. Clin Interv Aging. 2009;4:1-15. Epub 2009 May 14. Review. {{PMC|2685220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

While the [[surgical resection]] of tumours is generally accepted to offer the best long-term solution, it is often not possible due the size, number or location of the tumour. IR therapies may be applied to shrink the tumour, making a surgical or interventional treatment possible. Some patient groups may also be too weak to undergo open surgery. IR treatments can be applied in these complex cases to provide effective and milder forms of treatment.
Interventional oncological techniques can also be used in combination with other treatments to help increase their [[efficacy]]. For example, IO techniques can be used to shrink large tumours making them easier to excise. Chemotherapeutic drugs can also be administered intra-arterially, increasing their potency and removing the harsh effects of system-wide application.
Patients can greatly benefit from IO treatments. The minimally invasive nature of the treatments means they cause less pain, fewer side effects and shorter recovery times. Many IO procedures can be performed on an [[outpatient]] basis, freeing up hospital beds and reducing costs.&lt;ref&gt;European Conference of Interventional Oncology, "[http://ecio.org/index.php?pid=8 What is IO?]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further considerations ==

=== Multidisciplinary approach ===

Cancer is a multifaceted disease group that requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Numerous studies have shown that cancer patients treated in multidisciplinary environments benefit greatly from the combined expertise. Interventional Radiologists are seen as playing a major role in multidisciplinary cancer teams where they provide innovative solutions to improve combined therapies and to treat complications.&lt;ref&gt;Adam A, Kenny LM. Interventional oncology in multidisciplinary cancer treatment in the 21(st) century. Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2015 Feb;12(2):105-13. {{doi|10.1038/nrclinonc.2014.211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patient selection ===

Proper patient selection is the key element for the success of any medical procedure and improper conduct can have fatal consequences. Patient selection protocols must be strictly followed before treating patients with IO procedures.

=== Radiation protection ===

IO treatments are carried out under image guidance. For this reason practitioners must have attained solid training in [[radiation protection]].

This article is about Islamic Hospitals from the 700s to the 1800s.

In Persian, Islamic Hospitals are known as ''[[bimaristan]]s.''&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Hospitals|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bimaristan]]'' can also be called ''maristan.''&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/search?s.q=islamic+hospitals&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;search-go=Search|title=BrillOnline Reference Works|date=2017|website=referenceworks.brillonline.com|publisher="Koninklijke Brill NV"|language=English|archive-url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/search?s.q=islamic+hospitals&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;search-go=Search|archive-date=2018-04-13|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian, “''bimar”'' translates to ''“''ill person''”'' and ''“stan”'' translates to “place''."''&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Therefore, Islamic Hospitals, ''[[bimaristan]]s'', and ''maristans'' are all synonyms that can be used interchangeably. Islamic Hospitals served many purposes. ''[[Bimaristan]]s'' served the purpose of being a designated place where medical treatment would be given to individuals in need.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Along with being a central place for medical treatment to be given, Islamic Hospitals also served the purpose of being a designated place where recovering individuals could go to help gain back their strength.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The individuals were typically recovering from accidents as well as sicknesses.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

Most Islamic Hospitals did not discriminate on who could be a patient; even wealthy individuals used the ''[[bimaristan]]s'' when they became ill when traveling instead of an outpatient facility or home care.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Islamic Hospitals were able to care for many diverse people who all had unique accidents, illnesses, injuries, and needs due to the different sections within the ''[[bimaristan]]s''. Patients were divided into these different sections based on their needs.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; Patients were also divided up to minimize the risk of spreading illnesses to other patients.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Not only were Islamic Hospitals used to provide care for individuals, they were also used to advance medical students’ knowledge in the [[medical field]], especially the most well-known ''[[bimaristan]]s'' located in [[Baghdad]], [[Damascus]], and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Islamic hospitals, books, and [[apprenticeship]]s are the main three ways medical students learned different types of medical information to make tremendous advances in Islamic Medicine.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Islamic Hospitals can best be understood by being viewed as a [[philanthropy]] because they gave [[public assistance]] to individuals who needed care.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Sayili, Aydin (December 2006). "The Emergence of the Prototype of the Modern Hospital in Medieval Islam". ''Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bimaristan]]s'' were able to provide these services at no costs due to ''[[waqf]]s, ''which were endowments that paid for the costs of creating [[bimaristan]]s as well as maintaining them''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;''

Islamic Hospitals were different than other hospitals because Muslims were led to form ''[[bimaristan]]s'' by [[Muhammad]], who taught that God would not create a disease without creating a cure.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Miller, Andrew C. (December 2006). "Jundi-Shapur, bimaristans, and the rise of academic medical centres," &lt;u&gt;Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.&lt;/u&gt; 99: 615-617.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile Hospitals were the first version of the ''[[bimaristan]]s''.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; According to tradition, the first Mobile Hospital was located in a tent to treat war victims from the Battle of the Ditch (627 CE).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Mobile Hospitals consisted of medications, food and water, doctors, and pharmacists to aid the patients.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; These services from the Mobile Hospital transitioned into the other Islamic Hospitals that were built as well. ''[[Bimaristan]]s'' were generally located in urban areas.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Though the Islamic realm was very large, [[Baghdad]], [[Damascus]], and [[Cairo]] housed the most well-known Islamic Hospitals.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The first six ''[[bimaristan]]s'' show major changes within Islamic hospitals in a short period of time.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;  The first ''[[bimaristan]]'', built in 706 in [[Damascus]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] named [[Al-Walid I|Al-Walid]], focused on treating individuals with [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Around the same period the second ''[[bimaristan]]'' was built in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The third and fourth Islamic Hospitals were built in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The third ''[[bimaristan]]'' was built in 805 by Caliph Harun al-Rashid.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; This Islamic Hospital in [[Baghdad]] was the first documented general hospital.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

[[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]], [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]], [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], and [[Tunakabuni|Mir Mu’min Husayni Tunikabuni]] were all students that trained at Islamic Hospitals in order to advance their knowledge in the medical field.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; These students were key players in the advancement of ''[[bimaristan]]s'' because of contributions to Islamic Medicine from their observations and writings.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] was an Islam philosopher, physician, and [[Alchemy|alchemist]], who trained well in the Greek science and is known for his ''Comprehensive Book of Medicine.''&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] was viewed as a mediator between Greek sciences and Arabs due to his translations of multiple documents that were tremendously important.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] was also an [[Optometry|optometrist]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Avicenna]] was a physician as well as a government official.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]'' constructed by [[Avicenna]] systemized medicine logically.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Like [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal]] was also an [[Optometry|optometrist]], who classified more than one hundred diseases of the eyes.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  [[Ibn al-Nafis]] was also a physician and an author,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; most known for his commentary on [[pulmonary circulation]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Lastly, [[Tunakabuni|Mir Mu’min Husayni Tunikabuni]] focused on how yogic breath control can control the humours.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; While all of these people did many different things, they all contributed to advancements in medicine.

== History of Hospitals ==
There is evidence that the beginning of the human study of medicine was around 3500 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobanovački|first=Dušanka|last2=Milovanović|first2=Ljiljana|last3=Slavković|first3=Anđelka|last4=Tatić|first4=Milanka|last5=Mišković|first5=Skeledžija Sanja|last6=Škorić-Jokić|first6=Svetlana|last7=Pećanac|first7=Marija|date=2012|title=Surgery before common era (B.C.E.)|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0354-73101202028D|journal=Archive of Oncology|volume=20|issue=1-2|pages=28–35|doi=10.2298/aoo1202028d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious priests and medicine men were the first medical practitioners. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], c. 3500 B.C.E., there were two kinds of medicine men–the "[[ashipu]]" who diagnosed the disease or injury, and the "asu" who practiced healing medicine and was practiced in herbal remedies.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Practices in this early period included bandaging and making plasters for wounds. Although many patients were treated in their home, the first houses of medicine were often placed near rivers, so the evil substances and spirits would be washed away.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; This tradition continues into the Greek and Roman periods, both societies placing their centers of healing near the ocean, a river or spring. Temples to gods and goddesses of healing were often used as healing centers, with spiritual and scientific remedies practiced there.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Ancient Indian medicine, or the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] tradition, encouraged the balance of body, mind and spirit between 3000 B.C.E. to about 800 B.C.E. They had knowledge of surgery and even the beginnings of plastic surgery were founded here.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian medicine was quite advanced for c. 2500 B.C.E. They had a solid understanding of anatomy because human dissection did not have the taboo much later Christian societies experienced.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; There are a few medical texts that have been preserved to the present that help us understand the medical practices of ancient Egypt. The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin-Smith papyrus]], written c. 17th century B.C.E. and probably based on much older knowledge, is a text on trauma surgery.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; It is suspected to be written based on military battles and battle wounds. Most medical practitioners were literate and often priests.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Once again, there is a connection between gods and medicine – the earliest recorded physician was [[Imhotep]], who lived c. 2725 B.C.E., and who was later lauded as a deity and called the god of medicine and healing.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The practice of combining religious centers and medical centers was continued through the Greek and Roman periods, as well as into the medical practices of Muslims and Christians.

Before Islamic hospitals, there were the “Ascelpia” in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and the “Xendodocheia” in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; These pre-Islamic healing centers were a mixture of spiritual healing and temples of faith. They offered cures via sacrifices to the gods and purgative drugs. These temples were worship sites for a healing god, usually the [[Greek god Asklepios]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56014667|title=Health in antiquity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|others=King, Helen, 1957-|isbn=0415220653|location=London|oclc=56014667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients would often come to the temple with an offering to the god and then sleep in the temple overnight, awaiting a visit from Asklepios in their dreams, sometimes in the form of a serpent which was said to have healing properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These [[Ascelpia medicine|ascelpia]] took the environment of their grounds into account as well as their healing rituals. Most of the ascelpia were centered on a spring or a fountain and were near a gymnasium or theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was encouraged by the medicine at the time, which focused on balance of the whole person, both of body and mind. There were no official schools of medicine at the time, most practitioners learned their art through apprenticeships or assisting a practitioner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even after the Christian conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], the Askelpian cult continued their practices and rituals well into the fourth century CE. Towards the end of the century, Theodosius outlawed any pagan traditions and the cult finally died.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Nigel|date=1990|title=HOSPICE TO HOSPITAL IN THE NEAR EAST: AN INSTANCE OF CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN LATE ANTIQUITY|jstor=44442549|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=64|issue=3|pages=446–462|last1=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Christening of Constantine, as well as the influx of refugees into cities as populations grew and land did not, the church became the center for healing. The term xendocheia began to be used, which came to mean a hostel for the poor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bishops became known as spiritual healers, or physicians of the soul.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One such bishop who was associated with an institution of healing was [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil of Caesarea]]. Saint Basil built a hostel for the poor and the ill and placed it in the care of a monastery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is described by fifth century historian Sozomen as “a storehouse of piety where disease is regarded in a religious light and sympathy put to the test.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similar to the Askelpian cults, the idea of healing through incubation (sleeping in the temple) was also practiced under Christian empires. Patients would sleep in specific rooms that housed relics of a saint and hoped for the saint to appear in their dreams.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The church was often charged with the care of the sick, although students were not allowed to study theology and medicine at the same time. Statute 590 stated that students of theology could not even reside in the same area as medical students, because “books of the craft of the world should not be read with books of holiness in one light.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These centers of health in antiquity helped shape the many new advances Islamicate scholars would pursue in medicine.

As for healing centers in the Islamicate world, the first [[bimaristan]]s were mobile centers that date back to the time of Muhammed. They were transported by beast of burden, primarily camels.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Before there were major towns and cities, the mobile bismaristans were able to travel to patients and the remote areas of the region.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== Notable Islamic Hospitals ==

=== Baghdad ===
The existence of hospitals, or [[bimaristan]]s, in [[Baghdad]] has been documented since the 9th century CE, with the first having most likely been established by the vizier of caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]]. By the end of the 10th century CE, five more bimaristans had been built in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

==== Al-Adudi Hospital ====
Among the most important of these was the Al-Adudi Hospital. The Al-Adudi Hospital was founded in 981 by the then ruler of Baghdad, [['Adud al-Dawla|Adud al-Dawlah]], and was also named after him. Within Baghdad, the Al-Adudi Hospital's location was decided upon by its administrator, Abu-Bakr al-Razi. He determined where it should be located by "hanging a piece of meat in several places for a few days and deciding in favor of the place where meat was found to be least infected."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_1_50/islamic_hospital.htm|title=Islamic Hospital|last=Syed|first=Ibrahim B.|date=|website=www.irfi.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Razi eventually decided to build the hospital along the [[Tigris|Tigris River]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At its inception, the Al-Adudi Hospital had twenty-five staff members, specializing in fields ranging from optics to surgery. In addition to these specialists, the Al-Adudi Hospital also served as a teaching hospital for new doctors. The Al-Adudi Hospital remained operational into the 12th century CE when, in 1184, it was described as "...being like an enormous palace in size."&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Ultimately, the Al-Adudi Hospital was destroyed in 1258 by [[Mongols]] led by [[Hulagu Khan]] in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cairo ===

==== Al-Fustat Hospital ====
One of the first Egyptian hospitals was the Al-Fustat Hospital, which was founded in 872 CE. It was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun|Ahmed Ibn-Tulum]] and was so named because of its location within [[Cairo]]. The Al-Fustat Hospital shared many common features with modern hospitals. Among these were bath houses separated by gender, separate wards and the safekeeping of personal items during a patient's convalescence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In addition to these practices, the Al-Fustat Hospital is the first to have offered treatment for mental disorders.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Beyond the practice of medicine, the Al-Fustat Hospital was also a teaching hospital and housed approximately 100,000 books. The Al-Fustat Hospital remained in operation for approximately 600 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another key feature of the Al-Fustat Hospital was that it offered all treatment for free. This was made possible by waqf revenue, which the Al-Fustat Hospital was likely the first to have been endowed with.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Near the Al-Fustat Hospital, Ibn-Tulum also established a pharmacy to provide medical care in emergencies.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==== Al-Mansuri Hospital ====
The Al-Mansuri Hospital was another hospital located in Cairo, and was completed in 1284 CE. Its founder, [[Al-Mansur Qalawun]], was inspired to establish a hospital after his own experience being hospitalized in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of Al-Mansur's vision for the hospital, treatment was free to make the hospital accessible to both the rich and the poor. Furthermore, "...upon discharge the patient was given food and money as a compensation for the wages he lost during his stay in the hospital."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Al-Mansuri Hospital was so accessible, in fact, that it treated roughly 4,000 patients every day. Like the Al-Fustat Hospital before it, the Al-Mansuri Hospital also treated mental patients and introduced music as a form of therapy. The Al-Mansuri also obtained the personal library of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] upon his death in 1258.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html|title=Islamic Medical Manuscripts: Bio-Bibliographies - I|last=|first=|date=13 December 2013|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al-Mansuri Hospital remained operational through the 15th century CE and still stands in Cairo today, though it is now known as "Mustashfa Qalawun."&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Damascus ===

==== Al-Walid Hospital ====
Damascus is credited with being the home of the first ever Islamic hospital, which was established between 706 and 707 CE. Founded by Walid ibn 'Abdulmalik, this hospital was meant to serve as a treatment center for both those with chronic illnesses, like [[leprosy]] and blindness, as well as the poor or impoverished.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This began with ibn 'Abdulmalik gathering lepers and preventing them from spreading the illness by providing them money. This was done to prevent them from begging strangers for money, thereby curtailing the spread of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.M.|first=Dunlop,|last2=G.S.|first2=Colin,|last3=N.|first3=Şehsuvaroǧlu, Bedi|title=Bīmāristān|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/bimaristan-COM_0123?s.num=3&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=islamic+hospitals|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish these objectives, separate wards existed for infectious diseases such as leprosy, and patients faced no cost to receive treatment. The Al-Walid Hospital has been compared to the Byzantine ''nosocomia'', which was a charitable institution tasked with treating "...the sick, the lepers, the invalid, and the poor."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==== Al-Nuri Hospital ====
The Al-Nuri Hospital was founded in Damascus nearly four and a half centuries after the Al-Walid Hospital, in 1156 CE. It was named after Nur al-Din Zanji. The Al-Nuri Hospital, which operated for some 700 years, was the same hospital where Al-Mansur Qalawun was treated and inspired to establish his own hospital in Cairo. The Al-Nuri Hospital, in addition to bringing about the Al-Mansuri hospital, was innovative in its practices as it became the first hospital to begin maintaining medical records of its patients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Al-Nuri Hospital was also a prestigious medical school, with one of its most noteworthy students being Ibn al-Nafis, who would later pioneer the theory of pulmonary circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The first few Islamic hospitals that arose in Baghdad, in the early 9th century, were to quarantine those who suffered from leprosy. At first, it was considered by many as a "leprosorium" due to its limited purpose; nonetheless, these hospitals still salaried doctors whose specialties were not solely limited to leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t445/e79?_hi=1&amp;_pos=1|title=Hospitals and Medical Institutions|last=Mossensohn|first=Miri Shefer|date=2018|website=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of these hospitals soon became diversified over time as newly built hospitals in Baghdad began to incorporate the knowledge from Islamic physicians, scientists such as the [[Al-Razi]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Al-Razi's hospital in Baghdad, had 24 physicians on staff; these physicians had diverse specialties, including, physiologists, occultists, surgeons, and bonesetters.

[[Madrasas]], in [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilizations]], were teaching institutions, some of which focussed on [[medicine]]. These madrasas were often closely linked with [[hospitals]] so that students could learn in the institutions and put their theoretical knowledge into practice in the hospitals.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html|title=Islamic Culture and Medical Arts|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=US Library of National Medicine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians were not exclusively Muslim; practicing physicians included [[Jews]], and [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hehmeyer|first=Ingrid|date=May 2007|title=Islam’s forgotten contributions to medical science|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/176/10/1467|journal=The Left Atrium|volume=10|pages=176–177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the major hospitals at [[Cairo]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Damascus]], students could visit patients often with the supervision of a practicing physician, in a system that is comparable to that of medical residents today.

The greatest contribution of the Islamic hospitals was the structure itself and how it functioned in Islamic culture. The first documented general hospital (hospitals that treated a multitude of [[Pathology|pathologies]], including mental illness) arose in Baghdad, in 805, built by vizier to the caliph, [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Although not much is known about this hospital due to poor documentation, the system of the general hospital itself set forth an example for the many other hospitals to come. Soon after, 34 new hospitals were built throughout the Islamic world with the number increasing annually. Islamic hospitals were even the first to specialize in treating convicts as the prison population was continually increasing.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodini|first1=Mohammad|date=June 2012|title=Medical Care in Islamic Medical Care in Islamic Tradition During the Middle Ages|url=http://www.webmedcentral.com/article_view/3549|journal=International Journal of Medicine and Molecular Medicine|volume=7|pages=2–14|accessdate=10 April 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly founded hospitals strived to be better than their preceding counterparts in the Islamic world. The purpose was to compete with European hospitals as well in order to attract more physicians and scholars. Many of these hospitals also contained a conjoined library typically filled with any possible writings that may be relevant to the medicine practiced in the hospitals.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagamia|first1=Husain|date=March 2003|title=Islamic Medicine History and Current Practice|url=https://www.ishim.net/ishimj/4/04.pdf|journal=International Institute of Islamic Medicine|pages=19–30|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function and Organization ==

In order to meet the demands of these specialties, Islamic hospitals were subdivided into departments for surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, mental illness, and systemic diseases. The systemic disease department was designated for general illnesses that did not fall into categories of other departments.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In some hospitals, they were further divided into subsections to address the needs of the patient depending on the symptoms. Examples include, but are not limited to, infections, fevers, and digestive issues. Hospital staff was not limited to physicians. Much like today's hospitals, they also relied on pharmacists, nurses, sanitary inspectors, supervising specialists, secretaries, and superintendents. The superintendents, or in Arabic, sa'ur, ensured that hospitals met certain standards in addition to managing the entire hospital institution.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Pharmacists produced drugs as means for treatment of the hospitals' patients; they relied on a knowledge of [[chemistry]], or [[Alchemy|Alchemia]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Before the 10th century, hospitals operated throughout the day and closed at night. Later hospitals operated on a 24 hour basis. Nonetheless, the practicing physicians worked a set amount of hours with their salaries prescribed by law; the physicians were paid generously enough so as to retain their talent. Chief of staff physician, [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]], was salaried 4.9 million [[Dirham]]; for comparison, a medical resident worked significantly longer hours salaried at 300 Dirham per month.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Islamic Hospitals attained their endowment through charitable donations or bequests, called waqfs. The legal documents establishing a waqf also set forth rules for how the hospital should be organized and operate in relation to the patient, stating that anyone can be admitted irrespective of race, gender, or citizenship.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Patients of all socioeconomic statuses would have had access to full treatment, that is, costs were borne by the hospital itself. An example was the [[#Al-Mansuri Hospital|Al-Mansuri Hospital]], in Cairo, built under the orders of the [[Mamluk|Mameluke]] ruler of Egypt, [[Al-Mansur Qalawun]]. Its maximum capacity was around 8000, and the annual endowment alone was said to be one-million Dirhams. The design was intended to accommodate various pathologies, for both men and women; as well as a pharmacy, a library, and lecture halls. The lecture halls were used for regular meetings on the status of the hospital, lecturing residents, and staff as well.

== Advancements in Medicine ==
With the development and existence of early Islamic hospitals, came the need for new ways in which to treat patients. While the institution of a complex hospital was still comparatively new, Islamic Hospitals brought forth many groundbreaking medical advancements in Islamic culture during this time, which eventually spread to the entire world. These revolutionary medical practices came not only from Islamic Hospitals, but also distinguished physicians of this era, in the form of surgeries, techniques, discoveries and cures for ailments, and the invention of countless medical instruments.

=== Al-Mawsili and Ibn Isa ===

Among the many developments stemming from Islamic Hospitals, were those designed to treat specific ailments, diseases, and anatomy. For example, a revolutionary treatment for [[cataract]]s was developed by al-Mawsili, a 10th century physician.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/17604/|title=The Notebook of the Oculists|date=1631|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice included a hollow syringe (which he developed) and removing the cataract through suction. Although this procedure has further developed throughout the centuries, the basic treatment remains the same even today.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/11-12/muslim-medicine-scientific-discovery-islam/|title=How Early Islamic Science Advanced Medicine|date=2016-11-15|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases of the eye were further expanded upon during this era by [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal|ʻAli ibn ʻIsa al-Kahhal or Ibn Isa]] (died c. 1038), who practiced and taught in the [[Al-'Adudi Hospital|Al-Adudi Hospital]] in [[Baghdad]]. He wrote and developed the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/17604/ ''Tadhkirat al-kaḥḥālīn'' (“The Notebook of the Oculist”)], which detailed more than 130 eye diseases based on anatomical location. The work was separated into three portions consisting of 1) Anatomy of the eye, 2) Causes, symptoms and treatments of diseases, and 3) Less apparent diseases and their treatments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This work was translated into Latin in 1497, and then into several other languages which allowed it to benefit the medical community for centuries to come.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Al-Zahrawi ===

Perhaps the largest contribution to Islamic surgical development, came from [[Al-Zahrawi|Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn al-‘Abbās al-Zahrāwī]], [[Al-Zahrawi|Abū al-Qāsim]], or [[Al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013). He contributed to advancements in surgery by inventing and developing over 200 medical instruments which constituted the first independent work on surgery.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abu-al-Qasim|title=Abū al-Qāsim {{!}} Muslim physician and author|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such instruments included tools like [[forceps]], [[Pincers (tool)|pincers]], [[scalpel]]s, [[catheter]]s, [[Cauterization|cauteries]], lancets, and [[Speculum (medical)|specula]], which were accompanied by detailed drawings of each tool.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Al-Zahrawi also wrote the ''At-Taṣrīf limanʿajazʿan at-Taʾālīf,'' or ''At-Taṣrīf'' (“The Method”), which was a 30-part text based on earlier authorities, such as the ''[[Paul of Aegina|Epitomae]]'' from the 7th-century Byzantine physician [[Paul of Aegina]]. It was largely composed of medical observations, including what is considered the earliest known description of [[Haemophilia|hemophilia]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The 30-volume encyclopedia also documented Zahrawi and his colleagues’ experiences with treatment of the ill or afflicted. Aside from the documentation of surgical instruments, the work included operating techniques, pharmacological methods to prepare tablets and drugs to protect the heart, surgical procedures used in midwifery, cauterizing and healing wounds, and the treatment of headaches.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although Zahrawi was somewhat disregarded by hospitals and physicians in the eastern [[Caliphate]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; (no doubt due to his Spanish roots, being near [[Córdoba, Spain]]), his advancement and documentation of medical tools and observations contained in his work had a vast influence on the eventual medical development in Christian Europe, when it was translated into Latin during the 12th century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Al-Razi (Rhazes) ===

The Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad underwent extreme intellectual and medical experimentation during the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among the many skilled physicians and intellectuals there was [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Rāzī,]] or in Latin, [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhazes]] (854-925). Rhazes served as chief physician in a hospital in [[Rey, Iran|Rayy, Iran]], before holding a similar position in the [[Baghdad]] hospital. He developed two significant works regarding advancements in medicine and philosophy. The ''Kitāb al-Manṣūrī'' and the ''[[Kitab al-Hawi|Kitāb al-ḥāwī]],'' (“Comprehensive Book”) which surveyed early Greek, Syrian, and Arabic medicine, and added his own judgement and commentary. He also wrote several minor treatises, perhaps the most famous being ''Treatise on Small Pox and Measles''. This treatise was translated into several modern languages as well as Latin and Byzantine Greek for teaching purposes and medical treatment of such infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Razi|title=al-Razi {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ibn Sina (Avicenna) ===

Although surgical developments and advancements made in the medieval Islamic period are of extreme importance, the largest and most wholesome contribution to the medical world stemming from Islamic medicine and hospitals came from the Baghdad firmament from [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]], or “[[Avicenna]]” in the West.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ibn Sina, who had already become a doctor by the age of 18, developed the ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb]]'' ([[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This work is largely known as one of the most famous medical works of all time. The ways in which Ibn Sina’s Canon of Medicine worked to bring together various disciplines and cultures, essentially revived Greek authors and philosophers and fostered new thought patterns to develop much of the future medical practices we see today. Ibn Sina did this by combining the medical developments of Greek physician and philosopher [[Galen]], with the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, as Islamic medicine recognized that many diseases are contagious, such as [[leprosy]], [[smallpox]], and [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] recognized [[tuberculosis]] as a contagious disease, among others which can be spread through soil and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hajar|first=Rachel|date=2013|title=The Air of History (Part V) Ibn Sina (Avicenna): The Great Physician and Philosopher |journal=Heart Views : The Official Journal of the Gulf Heart Association|volume=14|issue=4|pages=196–201|doi=10.4103/1995-705X.126893 |pmc=3970379|pmid=24696763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Canon of Medicine]] continued to be studied by European medical professionals and institutions even into the 18th century. This combination and rationalization of practical science, religion, and thought highlighted the pinnacle of Muslim medical scholarship, and the nature of the true developments which were made in the medical world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Legacy and Aftermath ==

Much of the legacy surrounding the Islamic influence on modern hospitals and science can be found in the discoveries, techniques, and practices introduced by scholars and physicians working in these hospitals between the tenth and nineteenth century.  This time period was extremely important to the advancement of modern medicinal practices, and is known as one the greatest periods of development. Many of these discoveries laid the foundation for medical development in Europe, and are still common practice in modern medicine. Among these discoveries in astronomy, chemistry, and metallurgy, scholars developed techniques for medicine such as the distillation and use of alcohol as an antiseptic, which is still being used in hospitals today. Not only did these discoveries lead to lasting improvements in medicine in the Muslim world, but through the influence of early Islamic and Arabian hospitals, medical institutions around the world were introduced to various new concepts and structures, increasing the efficiency and cleanliness which can still be found in modern day institutions.

Some of these influential concepts include the implementation of separate wards based on disease and gender, pharmacies, housing of medical records, and the education associated with practicing medicine. Prior to the Islamic era, most European medical care was offered by priests in sanatoriums and annexes to temples. Islamic hospitals revolutionized this by being operated secularly and through a government entity, rather than being solely operated by the church.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This introduction of government operated hospitals lead to not having any discrimination against people for any reason allowing the hospital to solely focus on their main goal of serving all people and working together to help everyone out.

'''Separate wards'''

Islamic hospitals also brought about the idea of separate wards or segments of the hospital that were separated by patient diagnostic.  When Islamic hospitals first brought this about, not only were the wards separated by diagnostic but by sex as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/neareast/exhibitions/exhitmedicine.html|title=Near East Collection: Muslim's Contributions to Medieval Medicine &amp; Pharmacology {{!}} Yale University Library|website=www.library.yale.edu|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hospitals today aren’t as strict and don’t separate by sex anymore, they still separate people by disease or problem.  By doing so, different wings could specialize in certain treatments specific to their patient.  This practice not only still exists today in modern hospitals but also lead to the advancement of treatments back then that now comprise the “[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]].”  This separation of diseases not only helped the timely treatment of patients but also helped the patients and physicians from getting sick with other diseases that surrounded them because they only had to worry about the prevention of one disease.  By separating patients, the specialization of certain wings and treatments really advanced the medicine and improved the efficiency of hospitals ultimately leading to how modern day hospitals are designed.

'''Medical Records'''

With Islamic hospitals advancing medicine so quickly, they needed a way to catalogue all of their findings which in the end lead to the first medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aboutislam.net/science/faith-science/hospitals-islamic-history/|title=Hospitals in Islamic History {{!}} About Islam|date=2018-01-19|work=About Islam|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This made hospitals more efficient as they were able to check records of other people with patients that had similar symptoms and hopefully treat them the same way they were able to with the other patients.  Not only did physicians keep medical records but they kept notes on patients and provided them for peer review as a way to not be held responsible for malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://explorable.com/islamic-medicine|title=Islamic Medicine - History of Medicine|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information also enabled physicians to start to notice patterns in patients more making the medicinal practices more accurate as everything is with more trials.  The efficiency gained from keeping records allowed hospitals to run more smoothly and treat patients faster.  This information also enabled physicians to start to notice patterns in patients more making the medicinal practices more accurate as everything is with more trials.   This keeping of records ultimately lead to the accumulation of the “[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]],” which is a book of medicine compiled by the Persian philosopher [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) that was completed in 1025.

'''Education and Qualification'''

Another legacy that vastly changed the way through which medical practices were developed, was the method of education and perpetuation of medical knowledge.  Islamic hospitals modernized the qualification of physicians and education leading to a license to practice medicine in hospitals. In 931 CE, Caliph [[Al-Muqtadir|Al –Muqtadir]] started the movement of licensing physicians by telling [[Sinan ibn Thabit|Siban Ibn- Thabit]] to only give physician licenses to qualified people.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-27|title=Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medicine_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world&amp;oldid=832723556|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeing as how one of the chief objectives of Islamic hospitals was the training of new physicians or students, senior physicians, and other medical officers would often hold instructive seminars in large lecture halls detailing diseases, cures, treatments, and techniques from class manuscripts.  Islamic hospitals were also the first to adopt practices involving medical students, accompanied by experienced physicians, into the wards for rounds to participate in patient care.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Hospitals|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hospitals doubling as schools not only provided hospitals with more fresh working hands but also helped in the advancement of medicine.  Education in hospitals during the Islamic period modernized hospitals today in that now before people can become doctors they must complete a period of residency in which students study at a hospital and job shadow licensed physicians for a number of years before they are fully able to become licensed physicians.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  This came at a time when much of Europe’s medical practices were much less advanced, and with the compilation and creation of [[Avicenna|Avicenna’s]] (Ibn Sina) medical textbook, the “[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]],” these groundbreaking Islamic discoveries were able to influence Europe and the rest of the world for centuries to come.

'''Pharmacies'''

One other lasting impression from the ninth century was the birth of [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]]. Due to the major chemistry advancements, actual medicine during this time period flourished and became highly developed to the point of needing a separate place to distribute medicine which came to be known as a pharmacy.  With the advancement of science and medicine, pharmacy became a specialized subject itself.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  This ultimately lead to pharmacy becoming its own established profession people could pursue.

'''Juklevatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipalities of [[Hemsedal]] (in [[Buskerud]] county) and [[Lærdal]] (in [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county), [[Norway]].  It is located {{convert|21|km}} east of [[Borgund, Sogn og Fjordane|Borgund]] in Lærdal, just to the south of the mountain [[Høgeloft]] in the [[Filefjell]] range.  The {{convert|3.07|km2|adj=on}} lake sits at an elevation of {{convert|1286|m}} above sea level.  It is located {{convert|5|km}} northeast of the lake [[Eldrevatnet]] and {{convert|10|km}} northeast of the lake [[Øljusjøen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Sogn_og_Fjordane/L%C3%A6rdal/Juklevatnet/|title=Juklevatnet|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is regulated by a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[dam]] which is part of a nearby power station.  The water flows into the lake Vesle Juklevatnet, then the river Jukleåni, and then into the lake [[Eldrevatnet]].

'''Keratic precipitate''' ('''KP''') is an [[Inflammatory cell|inflammatory]] cellular deposit seen on [[corneal endothelium]]. Acute KPs are white and round in shape whereas old KPs are faded and irregular in shape.  Mutton-fat KPs are large in shape and are greasy-white in color and are formed from [[macrophage]]s and [[epithelioid cell]]. They are indicative of inflammatory disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brightbill|first1=Frederick S.|title=Corneal Surgery: Theory, Technique and Tissue|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323048358|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbFyvZSx6W0C&amp;dq=Keratic+precipitate&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=11 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutton fat Kps are due to granulomatous iridocyclitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Radhika|title=Parson's Diseases of the Eye - E-Book|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9788131238196|page=616|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTJTBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Keratic+precipitate&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=11 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant called red KPs may be seen in hemorrhagic uveitis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10490">'''LegitScript''' is a verification and monitoring service for [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].&lt;ref name="NABP"&gt;http://www.nabp.net/ip.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only such service recognised by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]] (NABP) as adhering to its standards aside from the NABP's own [[VIPPS]] program.&lt;ref name="NABP"/&gt;

The NABP has written that it endorses LegitScript on behalf of the government agencies that license and regulate pharmacies and pharmacists in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions for use "by [[search engine]] advertising programs, [[Domain name registrar|Domain Name Registrars]], registries, [[Payment processor|payment processing companies]], [[social media]] companies, and other Internet platforms to ensure that Internet platforms operate in compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, and are not utilized in furtherance of the illicit sale of unregulated healthcare products".&lt;ref name="November 21, 2012 Letter from NABP to LegitScript"&gt;http://www.legitscript.com/download/NABP_Recognition_LegitScript_International_Internet_Pharmacy_Standards_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some EU government agencies have referred to LegitScript as the "appropriate authority" to which rogue Internet pharmacies should be reported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/health/illegal-medicine-seizures-rise-19-123638.html&lt;/ref&gt; LegitScript has also worked with the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] to monitor and investigate Internet pharmacy websites.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=6e179a4b6e9d90bb5696dbfbc2edd065&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
LegitScript was founded by John Horton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legitscript.com/johnhorton |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521035658/http://www.legitscript.com/johnhorton |archivedate=2011-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a [[White House]] aide on [[drug policy]] issues from 2002 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2008/07/22/news/top_stories/steriod_sales_report.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904100554/http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2008/07/22/news/top_stories/steriod_sales_report.txt |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horton continues to serve as the company's President and also serves on the NASCAR Appeals Panel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/04/30/diverse-group-compromises-appeals-panel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's main office was initially located in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsmb.org/pdf/NCIP_Newsletter_Rx-Beat_Vol4_Issue2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713035101/http://www.fsmb.org/pdf/NCIP_Newsletter_Rx-Beat_Vol4_Issue2.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is currently identified as being in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon.&lt;ref name="legitscript.com"&gt;http://www.legitscript.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company is identified by the [[Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies]] as a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safemedicines.org/2010/06/psm-profiles-the-alliance-for-safe-online-pharmacies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early operations==
In July 2008, LegitScript released a report about 150 websites that offer to sell [[anabolic steroid]]s over the Internet without requiring a prescription.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS37508+21-Jul-2008+PRN20080721&lt;/ref&gt;
This report was also featured in the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4D91739F935A15754C0A96E9C8B63&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on CNN's ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/podcasts/ac360/site/2008/06/26/cooper.podcast.wednesday.cnn&lt;/ref&gt; The report resulted in the termination of large underground steroids rings and controversy on pro-steroids forums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212100942 LegitScript Shuts Down 500 No-Prescription-Required Online Pharmacies], ''[[InformationWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt; LegitScript also released two reports analyzing [[Microsoft]] and Yahoo sponsored search results for Internet pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200932/4197/Bing-blasted-for-pushing-rogue-RX-advertisements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826093811/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200932/4197/Bing-blasted-for-pushing-rogue-RX-advertisements |archivedate=2010-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/43668-search-engines-facilitate-illegal-prescription-drug-sales&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Google]], [[Yahoo]] and Microsoft announced that they were updating their advertising policies related to Internet pharmacies, and would in the future require that Internet pharmacies be approved by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]]'s VIPPS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securingpharma.com/40/articles/501.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616031801/http://www.securingpharma.com/40/articles/501.php |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, LegitScript announced that it would be helping Google implement the new policy by monitoring all prescription drug and pharmacy ads for the search engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legitscript.com/blog/119&lt;/ref&gt; LegitScript states that it performs Google monitoring throughout North America, the EU, Russia and Asia for [[AdSense|Google ads]], and also identifies Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as clients.&lt;ref name="legitscript.com"/&gt;

==Domain name registrars==
In November 2008, LegitScript launched its registrar notification program and reported that it had shut down 500 "rogue" Internet pharmacies by notifying their [[ISP]]s and [[domain name registrar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/security/212100942&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the company released a report regarding over 7,000 websites displaying a forged pharmacy license, indicating that it worked with 11 different domain name registrars to shut down the websites.&lt;ref&gt;http://mobile.darkreading.com/9288/show/e853b3fa8f1f3b04bdbc4686e506d3cc&amp;t=10600f69af665211f08239e28542409b{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, the company stated that it had worked with registrars to shut down over 35,000 rogue Internet pharmacy websites in the previous four years.&lt;ref&gt;legitscript.com&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2013, several domain name registrars explicitly state in their [[terms of service]]s that they suspend and lock domain names identified as rogue Internet pharmacies by LegitScript, and outsource their abuse point-of-contact on Internet pharmacy issues to LegitScript.&lt;ref&gt;https://internetbs.net/en/domain-name-registrations/termsandconditions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pananames.com/support/legal.php?requestfor=customermasteragreement&amp;from=agree_page |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705025516/http://www.pananames.com/support/legal.php?requestfor=customermasteragreement&amp;from=agree_page |archivedate=2013-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has stated that it works with most domain name registrars, and, in late 2012, it began publishing data showing that the websites of rogue Internet pharmacies "cluster" around a small number of registrars that LegitScript says ignore abuse notifications.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.legitscript.com/2012/11/rogues-and-registrars-top-10-list-november-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; Several Internet pharmacy affiliate marketers have publicly discussed the importance of registering Internet pharmacy domain names with registrars that do not work with LegitScript.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/black-hat-seo/587025-legitscript-suspend-domain.html&lt;/ref&gt; In submitting abuse notifications to ICANN-accredited registrars, LegitScript has authority to act on the behalf of government regulators in some countries, such as Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legitscript.com/download/Japan_MHLW_Letter_to_ICANN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer protection==
In March 2010, [[consumer protection]] website [[SiteJabber]] announced that it would begin integrating LegitScript's legitimacy determinations into its Internet pharmacy ratings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sitejabber.com/blog/2010/03/11/sitejabber-legitscript-launch-partnership-to-improve-transparency-around-online-pharmacies/&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the [[WOT Services]] announced a similar initiative in which LegitScript Internet pharmacy legitimacy determinations would be integrated into its reputation rankings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mywot.com/en/blog/252-wot-and-legitscript-partner-to-protect-web-users-from-rogue-online-pharmacies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary supplements and designer drugs==
LegitScript maintains a Healthcare Product Legitimacy program that monitors whether "[[dietary supplements]] have been the subject of regulatory action, are considered unsafe, or are marketed as miracle cures"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.legitscript.com/services/products&lt;/ref&gt; and that is also endorsed by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]].&lt;ref name="November 21, 2012 Letter from NABP to LegitScript"/&gt; In its advertising policies for healthcare and medicines, [[Google]] indicates that it uses LegitScript's healthcare product legitimacy program to determine which supplements and [[designer drugs]] should be restricted from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=176031&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Internet pharmacy certification==
As of February 2013, LegitScript's website indicated that it had approved over 250 online pharmacy websites and documented over 48,000 "rogue" online pharmacy websites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legitscript.com&lt;/ref&gt; The program is also endorsed by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.&lt;ref name="November 21, 2012 Letter from NABP to LegitScript"/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5836">'''Louise Marie Zibold Reiss''' (February 23, 1920 &amp;ndash; January 1, 2011) was an American physician who coordinated what became known as the [[Baby Tooth Survey]], in which [[deciduous teeth]] from children living in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area who were born in the 1950s and 1960s were collected and analyzed over a period of 12 years. The results of the survey showed that children born after 1963 had levels of [[strontium-90]] in their teeth that were 50 times higher than those found in children born before the advent of widespread [[nuclear weapons testing]]. The findings helped convince U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] to sign the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]], which ended the above-ground testing of nuclear weapons that placed the greatest amounts of [[nuclear fallout]] into the atmosphere.

==Early life and education==
Born in the [[Queens]] borough of [[New York City]] on February 23, 1920, Reiss contracted [[poliomyelitis|polio]] as a child.&lt;ref name=SLPDObit&gt;Sorkin, Michael D. [http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/obituaries/article_bc5094d0-34b1-5c14-b4b0-fd8251cb7990.html "Louise Reiss: headed historic Baby Tooth Survey in St. Louis"], ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', January 7, 2011. Retrieved January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She originally planned to study art in college, but decided to switch to science after the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Retrieved January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBML&gt;[http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/bios/reiss.htm Louise X. Reiss], Women in Health Sciences, Bernard Becker Medical Library, [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. Retrieved January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned her medical degree at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (now part of the [[Drexel University College of Medicine]]) and performed her [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and [[residency (medicine)|residency]] at [[Philadelphia General Hospital]], where she met her future husband, the physician Eric Reiss.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The couple first moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]], then relocated to St. Louis after Eric Reiss received an appointment at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBML/&gt; Hired by the St. Louis city health department, Louise Reiss was involved in inoculating children with the [[polio vaccine]].&lt;ref name=SLPDObit/&gt;

==Baby Tooth Survey==
{{main|Baby Tooth Survey}}
In 1959, Reiss and her husband joined environmental scientist [[Barry Commoner]] and others to create the Greater St. Louis Citizens' Committee for Nuclear Information, which initiated the Baby Tooth Survey in conjunction with [[Saint Louis University]] and the [[Washington University School of Dental Medicine]] as a means of determining the effects of nuclear fallout on the human anatomy.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Louise Reiss led the project from 1959 to 1961.&lt;ref name=BBML/&gt; The research focused on detecting the presence of strontium-90, a [[carcinogenic|cancer-causing]] radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground before 1963. Due to its chemical similarity to [[calcium]], the radioactive strontium isotope is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth of children, as their growing bodies need calcium. Visiting local schools and organizations, Louise Reiss convinced parents to have their children send in their lost baby teeth, in return for which they were sent a button reading "I gave my tooth to science".&lt;ref name=SLPDObit/&gt; The team sent collection forms to area schools, and teeth were initially sent to the Reiss home, where they were sorted.&lt;ref name=SLPDObit/&gt; In all, some 320,000 teeth from children of various ages were collected before the project was ended in 1970.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The results of the thousands of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; the person on the other end of the phone said, "This is John Kennedy, can I talk to your mom?"&lt;ref name=SLPDObit/&gt; Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the [[United States Senate]] when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Pinecrest, Florida]], Reiss died at the age of 90 at her home on January 1, 2011, after suffering a [[myocardial infarction]] two months earlier.&lt;ref name=SLPDObit/&gt; She was survived by her son, [[Eric Reiss]], as well as by two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''MFDS''' is  the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, a government department in South Korea. This is former KFDA, Korean Food and Drug Administration.

'''MFDS''' is an examination offered by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]]. It stands for Membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery. The exam is one of the recognised gateways to further specialist training for dentists in the UK and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. If a [[dentist]] has this exam it indicates that he or she has undertaken additional study over and above qualifying level.

In order to be eligible to sit the MFDS exam a dentist must also have worked in both general dental practice AND a hospital (usually maxillofacial surgery) or community dental post. 

The [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] ceased offering the MFDS in 2008; amalgamating the MFDS with the MFGDP exam in order to create a single examination: the MJDF. The MJDF examines dentists on the skills and knowledge required in general practice while also providing a qualification route to specialist training.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9938">'''Mad studies''' is a field of scholarship, theory, and activism about the lived experiences, history, cultures, and politics about people who may identify as [[Mad Pride|Mad]], [[mentally ill]], [[Psychiatric survivors movement|psychiatric survivors]], consumers, service users, patients, [[Neurodiversity|neurodiverse]], and disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castrodale|first=Mark Anthony|date=2015|title=Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies|url=|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research|volume=17 |issue=3|pages=284–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mad studies originated from consumer/survivor movements organized in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and in other parts of the world. The methods for inquiry draw from a number of academic disciplines such as [[women's studies]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]] studies, indigenous epistemologies, [[queer studies]], psychological anthropology, and [[ethnography]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This field shares theoretical similarities to critical [[disability studies]], psychopolitics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cresswell &amp; Spandler|first=|date=2013|title=The Engaged Academic: Academic Intellectuals and the Psychiatric Survivor Movement|url=|journal=[[Social Movement Studies]]|volume=12 |issue=2|pages=138–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frankfurt School|critical social theory]]. The academic movement formed, in part, as a response to [[Recovery approach|recovery]] movements, which many mad studies scholars see as being "co-opted" by mental health systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins and scope ==
Richard A. Ingram, a senior research fellow in the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]] (2007), has been credited with coining the phrase "Mad Studies" at the First Regional Graduate/Undergraduate Student Disability Studies Conference at Syracuse University on May 3, 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Richard A.|date=|title=Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together|url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/IJ/article/view/1680/1327|journal=Intersectionalities|volume= 5| issue =  3 (Special Issue) Mad Studies: Intersections with Disability Studies, Social Work, and ‘Mental Health’|pages=11–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://player.fm/series/mentally-sound-radio-show/mentally-sound-show-9-131115-6dHUzEqRe4Rzci2m|title=Mentally Sound Radio Show #9|last=McGowan|first=Victoria|date=November 13, 2015|work=Mentally Sound Radio Show|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an academic article entitled "Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together," Ingram points to a number of theorists who created the intellectual groundwork for the field, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]], [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article, Peter Beresford names Canadian scholars at the forefront of this academic field: "Mad studies has been pioneered by Ryerson and [[York University|York]] Universities in Toronto, with key figures such as mental health survivors, activists and educators David Reville and Geoffrey Reaume and academics Kathryn Church and Brenda LeFrancois."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/07/mad-studies-voice-of-sanity-psychiatry|title=Mad studies brings a voice of sanity to psychiatry|last=Beresford|first=Peter|date=October 7, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Alex Gillis summarizes the spread of mad studies programs in a November 2015 article: "Soon after Ryerson and York launched mad studies courses in the early 2000s, similar courses began in Simon Fraser University’s department of sociology and anthropology, and more recently at Memorial University’s school of social work, Queen’s University’s school of kinesiology and health studies, and the history departments at Trent University and the University of Winnipeg. A few universities in England, Scotland and the Netherlands launched courses in the past two years, using Canadian courses as models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/mad-studies/|title=The Rise of Mad Studies|last=Gillis|first=Alex|date=November 3, 2015|work=University Affairs|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dimensions of this emerging field may include research on the "social construction of 'mental illness, normalizing imperatives of the state and medicine, rapidly expanding nosologies (categories of pathology) for mental illness, collusion(s) of pharmaceutical corporations and professional associations within psychiatry, connections between ecocide and mental stress, psychiatrization of nonhuman animals, representation(s) of madness in media, history of consumer/survivor movement(s), and the rise and fall of mental treatments within scientific, medical, and lay communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ashevilleradicalmentalhealth.wordpress.com/mad-studies/|title=Mad Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=Asheville Radical Mental Health Collective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">'''Mental health informatics''' is a branch of [[Health informatics|health or clinical informatics]] concerned with the use of information technology (IT) and information to improve mental health. Like health informatics, mental health informatics is a multidisciplinary field that promotes care delivery, research and education &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinfowiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Mental_health_informatics
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the technology and methodologies required to implement it.

Major areas of mental health informatics activity include:

* Terminology and coding systems such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|(DSM)]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2017/different-approaches-to-understanding-and-classifying-mental-disorders.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* Specific mental health assessment &lt;ref&gt;https://sdqinfo.org&lt;/ref&gt; and diagnostic &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawba.info&lt;/ref&gt; systems
* Study of the incidence of mental health in a public health and epidemiological context &lt;ref&gt;Ardis Hanson and Bruce Lubotsky Levin. Mental Health Informatics. Oxford University Press USA, 2013, 288 pp, {{ISBN|9780195183023}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integration of mental health function into electronic health record systems ([[Electronic health record|EHRs]]) and larger organisational systems
* Telehealth, [[telemedicine]] and [[telepsychiatry]]
* Special IT considerations for mental health systems, e.g., [[Information privacy|privacy]], [[security|Computer security]], [[safety|Safety-critical system]] and [[General Data Protection Regulation|data protection compliance]]
* Software development and usage skills relevant to mental health informatics.&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/python/Methods%20in%20Medical%20Informatics%20-%20Fundamentals%20of%20Healthcare%20Programming%20in%20Perl%2C%20Python%2C%20and%20Ruby%20%282010%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need for mental health informatics ==
The need for and application of health informatics in primary and secondary health care has been well established in developed countries for 20 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;Smith MF. Computer Systems in Healthcare: Management and Strategy. Kindle (2012) {{ISBN|978-1-301-36918-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of informatics in mental health has not become as pervasive, in spite of professional recognition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/policyandparliamentary/informaticscommittee.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthcareconferencesuk.co.uk/news/newsfiles/Netta_Hollings_61.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.omicsonline.org/scholarly/mental-health-informatics-journals-articles-ppts-list.php&lt;/ref&gt; the domain appearing well suited to computerisation &lt;ref&gt;Rotheray, S., D. Racey, L. Rodgers, S. McGilloway, V. Berry and T. Ford (2014). "Innovations in practice: Further evidence on the effectiveness of the strengths and difficulties added value score as an outcome measure for child and adolescent services." Child and Adolescent Mental Health 19(4): 270-273.DOI: 10.1111/camh.12059&lt;/ref&gt; and the need for quantified outcome evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Stringaris, A. and R. Goodman (2009). "Longitudinal outcome of youth oppositionality: Irritable, headstrong, and hurtful behaviors have distinctive predictions." Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry 48(4): 404-412.DOI: 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181984f30
&lt;/ref&gt; A major impediment may be societal stigma associated with mental disorders as well as increased sensitivity about protecting the privacy and confidentiality of records in mental health care. There also may be a professional reluctance to effect changes in established working patterns that the introduction of systems necessarily entails.&lt;ref&gt;http://sdq-dawba.dk/interview-goodman/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33770">[[File:STS-130 Endeavour flyaround 5.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[International Space Station]] in [[orbit]] around [[Earth]], February 2010. The ISS is in a '''micro-g environment'''.]]

The term '''micro-g environment''' (also '''µg''', often referred to by the term '''microgravity''') is more or less a synonym for ''[[weightlessness]]'' and ''zero-g'', but indicates that [[g-force]]s are not quite zero—just very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/myth.html |title=Space myths and misconceptions – space flight |journal=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |date=May 1993 |volume=15 |number=7 |page=38ff}}&lt;!-- alternate link: http://lab.machinecode.org/intricate/omni_magazine/Omni%20v15%20%237%20May%201993.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol for microgravity, ''µg'', was used on the insignias of [[Space Shuttle]] flights [[STS-87]] and [[STS-107]], because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in [[low Earth orbit]].

==Absence of gravity==
A "stationary" micro-g environment&lt;ref&gt;Depending on distance, "stationary" is meant relative to Earth or the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by [[attenuation]] to almost zero. This is the simplest in conception, but requires traveling an enormous distance, rendering it most impractical. For example, to reduce the gravity of the Earth by a factor of one million, one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometers from the Earth, but to reduce the gravity of the Sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3.7 billion kilometers. (On Earth the gravity due to the rest of the [[Milky Way]] is already attenuated by a factor greater than one million, so we do not need to move away further from its [[Galactic Center|center]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}). Thus it is not impossible, but it has only been achieved so far by four [[interstellar probe]]s ([[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]] of the [[Voyager program]], and [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11|11]] of the [[Pioneer program]]&lt;!-- [[New Horizons]] it's expected to do so in the near future--&gt;) and they did not return to Earth. To reduce the gravity to one thousandth of that on Earth's  surface, one needs to be at a distance of 200,000&amp;nbsp;km.

At a distance relatively close to Earth (less than 3000&amp;nbsp;km), gravity is only slightly reduced. As an object orbits a body such as the Earth, gravity is still attracting objects towards the Earth and the object is accelerated downward at almost 1g. Because the objects are typically moving laterally with respect to the surface at such immense speeds, the object will not lose altitude because of the curvature of the Earth. When viewed from an orbiting observer, other close objects in space appear to be floating because everything is being pulled towards Earth at the same speed, but also moving forward as the Earth's surface "falls" away below. All these objects are in free fall, not zero gravity.

Compare the [[Gravitational potential#Numerical values|gravitational potential at some of these locations]].

==Free fall==
What remains is a micro-g environment moving in [[free fall]], i.e. there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment. To prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect, objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself, while not necessarily in free fall, is accelerated as in free fall.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag. Alternatively free fall can be carried out in space, or in a vacuum tower or shaft.

Two cases can be distinguished: Temporary micro-g, where after some time the Earth's surface is or would be reached, and indefinite micro-g.

A temporary micro-g environment exists in a [[drop tube]] (in a tower or shaft), a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], e.g. with a [[sounding rocket]], and in an airplane such as used by [[NASA]]'s Reduced Gravity Research Program, aka the [[Vomit Comet]], and by the [[Zero Gravity Corporation]]. A temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts, for some experiments, for filming movies, and for recreational purposes.

A micro-g environment for an indefinite time, while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit, is most practical in an Earth orbit. This is the environment commonly experienced in the [[International Space Station]], [[Space Shuttle]], etc. While this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation, it is still quite expensive to operate in, mostly due to launch costs.

==Tidal and inertial acceleration==

Objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects:

*Effects depending on relative position in the spacecraft:
**Because the force of gravity decreases with distance, objects with non-zero size will be subjected to a [[tidal force]], or a differential pull, between the ends of the object nearest and furthest from the Earth. (An extreme version of this effect is [[spaghettification]].) In a spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the [[centrifugal force]] is also greater on the side of the spacecraft furthest from the Earth. At a 400&amp;nbsp;km LEO altitude, the overall differential in g-force is approximately 0.384 μ''g''/m. &lt;ref = name=conceptual&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tqpqB5LPxygC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=pFOiNIwm6m&amp;dq=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;f=true Conceptual Design and Flight Simulation of Space Stations
By Reinhold Bertrand&lt;/ref&gt;
** "Floating" objects in a spacecraft in LEO are actually in independent orbits around the Earth.  If two objects are placed side-by-side (relative to their direction of motion), they will be orbiting the Earth in different orbital planes.  Since all orbital planes pass through the center of the earth, any two orbital planes intersect along a line.  Therefore, two objects placed side-by-side (at any distance apart) will come together after one quarter of a revolution.  If they are placed so they miss each other, they will oscillate past each other, with the same period as the orbit. This corresponds to an inward acceleration of 0.128 μ''g'' per meter horizontal distance from the center at 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref = name=conceptual/&gt; If they are placed one ahead of the other in the same orbital plane, they will maintain their separation.  If they are placed one above the other (at different radii from the center of the Earth), they will have different potential energies, so the size, eccentricity, and period of their orbits will be different, causing them to move in a complex looping pattern relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chandler, David|title=Weightlessness and Microgravity|journal=The Physics Teacher|date= May 1991|pages=312–13|url=http://www.lcurve.org/writings/PT-WeightlessnessAndMicrogravity.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.2343327|bibcode=1991PhTea..29..312C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Gravity between the spacecraft and an object within it may make the object slowly "fall" toward a more massive part of it. The acceleration is 0.007 μ''g'' for 1000&amp;nbsp;kg at 1&amp;nbsp;m distance.
*Uniform effects (which could be compensated):
**Though very thin, there is some air at orbital altitudes of 185 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km. This atmosphere causes deceleration due to friction. This could be compensated by a small continuous thrust, but in practice the deceleration is only compensated from time to time, so the small g-force of this effect is not eliminated.
**The effects of the [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] are similar, but directed away from the Sun. Unlike the effect of the atmosphere, it does not reduce with altitude.

==Commercial applications==

===Metal spheres===
In a [[shot tower]] (now obsolete), molten metal (such as [[lead]] or [[steel]]) was dripped through a sieve into free fall. With sufficient height (several hundred feet), the metal would be solid enough to resist impact (usually in a water bath) at the bottom of the tower. While the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom, this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in [[shotgun]] shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.

===High-quality crystals===
While not yet a commercial application, there has been interest in growing [[crystal]]s in micro-g, as in a [[space station]] or automated artificial [[satellite]], in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.discovery.com/space/growing-crystals-in-zero-gravity-121227.htm Growing Crystals in Zero-Gravity]" News Article by [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent [[X-ray crystallography]].

== Health effects of the micro-g environment ==

===Space Motion Sickness===
[[File:Astronauts in weightlessness.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Six astronauts who had been in training at the Johnson Space Center for almost a year are getting a sample of a micro-g environment]]
[[Space adaptation syndrome|Space Motion Sickness]] (SMS) is thought to be a subtype of [[motion sickness]] that plagues nearly half of all astronauts who venture into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weerts|first=Aurélie P.|last2=Vanspauwen|first2=Robby|last3=Fransen|first3=Erik|last4=Jorens|first4=Philippe G.|last5=Van de Heyning|first5=Paul H.|last6=Wuyts|first6=Floris L.|date=2014-06-01|title=Space Motion Sickness Countermeasures: A Pharmacological Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2014/00000085/00000006/art00008|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=85|issue=6|pages=638–644|doi=10.3357/asem.3865.2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMS, along with facial stuffiness from headward shifts of fluids, headaches, and back pain, is part of a broader complex of symptoms that comprise Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Evidence/medicalConditions/Space_Motion_Sickness_(Space_Adaptation).pdf|title=Space Motion Sickness (Space Adaptation)|last=|first=|date=June 15, 2016|website=NASA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   SMS was first described in 1961 during the second orbit of the fourth manned spaceflight when the Cosmonaut, [[Gherman Titov]] aboard the [[Vostok 2]], described feeling disoriented with physical complaints mostly consistent with motion sickness.  It is one of the most studied physiological problems of spaceflight but continues to pose a significant difficulty for many astronauts.  In some instances, it can be so debilitating that astronauts must sit out from their scheduled occupational duties in space – including missing out on a spacewalk they have spent months training to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4270801&amp;page=1|title=Illness keeps astronaut from spacewalk|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2008|website=ABCNews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, astronauts will work through the symptoms even with degradation in their performance.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=32|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their experiences in some of the most rigorous and demanding physical maneuvers on earth, even the most seasoned astronauts may be affected by SMS, resulting in symptoms of severe [[nausea]], projectile [[vomiting]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], malaise (feeling sick), and [[headache]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These symptoms may occur so abruptly and without any warning that space travelers may vomit suddenly without time to contain the emesis, resulting in strong odors and liquid within the cabin which may affect other astronauts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Symptoms typically last anywhere from one to three days upon entering weightlessness, but may recur upon reentry to Earth’s gravity or even shortly after landing.  SMS differs from terrestrial motion sickness in that sweating and pallor are typically minimal or absent and gastrointestinal findings usually demonstrate absent bowel sounds indicating reduced [[gastrointestinal motility]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Pharmacology|last=Wotring|first=V. E.|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-3396-5|location=Boston|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the nausea and vomiting resolve, some central nervous system symptoms may persist which may degrade the astronaut’s performance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Graybiel and Knepton proposed the term “[[sopite syndrome]]” to describe symptoms of lethargy and drowsiness associated with motion sickness in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graybiel|first=A.|last2=Knepton|first2=J.|date=August 1976|title=Sopite syndrome: a sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=47|issue=8|pages=873–882|issn=0095-6562|pmid=949309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, their definition has been revised to include “…a symptom complex that develops as a result of exposure to real or apparent motion and is characterized by excessive drowsiness, lassitude, lethargy, mild depression, and reduced ability to focus on an assigned task.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262582074_Sopite_Syndrome_A_Revised_Definition|title=Sopite Syndrome: A Revised Definition (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these symptoms may pose a substantial threat (albeit temporary) to the astronaut who must remain attentive to life and death issues at all times.

SMS is most commonly thought to be a disorder of the vestibular system that occurs when sensory information from the visual system (sight) and the proprioceptive system (posture, position of the body) conflicts with misperceived information from the semicircular canals and the otoliths within the inner ear.  This is known as the ‘neural mismatch theory’ and was first suggested in 1975 by Reason and Brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2073893|title=Motion sickness|last=T.|first=Reason, J.|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|others=Brand, J. J.,|isbn=0125840500|location=London|oclc=2073893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the fluid shift hypothesis suggests that weightlessness reduces the hydrostatic pressure on the lower body causing fluids to shift toward the head from the rest of the body. These fluid shifts are thought to increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure (causing back aches), intracranial pressure (causing headaches), and inner ear fluid pressure (causing vestibular dysfunction).&lt;ref name="Heer 77–79"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heer|first=Martina|last2=Paloski|first2=William H.|title=Space motion sickness: Incidence, etiology, and countermeasures|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1566070206002141|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience|volume=129|issue=1–2|pages=77–79|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a multitude of studies searching for a solution to the problem of SMS, it remains an ongoing problem for space travel.  Most non-pharmacological countermeasures such as training and other physical maneuvers have offered minimal benefit.  Thornton and Bonato noted, “Pre- and inflight adaptive efforts, some of them mandatory and most of them onerous, have been, for the most part, operational failures.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common intervention is [[promethazine]], an injectable antihistamine with antiemetic properties, but sedation can be a problematic side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461433958|title=Space Pharmacology {{!}} Virginia E.

===Musculoskeletal effects===
In the space (or microgravity) environment the effects of unloading varies significantly among individuals, with sex differences compounding the variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ploutz-Snyder|first=Lori|last2=Bloomfield|first2=Susan|last3=Smith|first3=Scott M.|last4=Hunter|first4=Sandra K.|last5=Templeton|first5=Kim|last6=Bemben|first6=Debra|date=2014-11-01|title=Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Musculoskeletal Health|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=23|issue=11|pages=963–966|doi=10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|issn=1540-9996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in mission duration, and the small sample size of astronauts participating in the same mission also adds to the variability to the [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s that are seen in space.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narici|first=M.

Bone resorption leads to increased urinary levels of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]], which can subsequently lead to an increased risk of [[nephrolithiasis]].&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Scott M.|last2=Heer|first2=Martina|last3=Shackelford|first3=Linda C.|last4=Sibonga|first4=Jean D.|last5=Spatz|first5=Jordan|last6=Pietrzyk|first6=Robert A.|last7=Hudson|first7=Edgar K.|last8=Zwart|first8=Sara R.|title=Bone metabolism and renal stone risk during International Space Station missions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S8756328215003658|journal=Bone|volume=81|pages=712–720|doi=10.1016/j.bone.2015.10.002|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two weeks that the muscles are unloaded from carrying the weight of the human frame during space flight, whole muscle atrophy begins. Postural muscles contain more slow fibers, and are more prone to atrophy than non-postural muscle groups.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The loss of muscle mass occurs because of imbalances in protein synthesis and breakdown.  The loss of muscle mass is also accompanied by a loss of muscle strength, which was observed after only 2–5 days of spaceflight during the [[Soyuz 3|Soyuz-3]] and [[Soyuz 8|Soyuz-8]] missions.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Decreases in the generation of contractile forces and whole muscle power have also been found in response to microgravity.

To counter the effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system, aerobic exercise is recommended. This often takes the form of in-flight cycling.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A more effective regimen includes resistive exercises or the use of a penguin suit&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; (contains sewn-in elastic bands to maintain a stretch load on antigravity muscles), centrifugation, and vibration.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Centrifugation recreates Earth’s gravitational force on the space station, in order to prevent [[muscle atrophy]].  Centrifugation can be performed with centrifuges or by cycling along the inner wall of the space station.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Whole body vibration has been found to reduce bone resorption through mechanisms that are unclear.  Vibration can be delivered using exercise devices that use vertical displacements juxtaposed to a fulcrum, or by using a plate that oscillates on a vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elmantaser|first=M.|last2=McMillan|first2=M.|last3=Smith|first3=K.|last4=Khanna|first4=S.|last5=Chantler|first5=D.|last6=Panarelli|first6=M.|last7=Ahmed|first7=S.

Microgravity can also lead to height increases; in 2018 a Japanese astronout reported growing 2 centimetres in just three weeks of micro-gravity on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/japanese-astronaut-concerned-after-growing-3-5-inches-t-1821910135 |title=Japanese Astronaut Concerned After Growing 3.5 Inches Taller in Three Weeks - Update: He Was Wrong |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular effects ===
[[File:StationLIFE - Cardiovascular (January 2016).webm|thumb|569x569px|Astronaut Tracy Dyson talks about studies into cardiovascular health aboard the International Space Station.]]

When standing, some 'excess' fluid resides in vessels and tissues of the legs. In a micro-g environment, with the loss of a [[Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic gradient]], some fluid quickly redistributes toward the chest and upper body; sensed as 'overload' of circulating blood volume.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23924131_Current_status_and_future_direction_of_NASA's_Space_Life_Sciences_Program|title=Current status and future direction of NASA's Space Life Sciences Program (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the micro-g environment, the newly sensed excess blood volume is adjusted by expelling excess fluid into tissues and cells (12-15% volume reduction) and [[red blood cell]]s are adjusted downward to maintain a normal concentration (relative [[anemia]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the absence of gravity, venous blood will rush to the [[Atrium (heart)|right atrium]] because the force of gravity is no longer pulling the blood down into the vessels of the legs and abdomen, resulting in increased [[stroke volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin119/bul119_chap4.pdf|title=What Happens to the Human Heart in Space - Parabolic Flights Provide Some Answers|last=Aubert|first=Andre|date=August 2004|website=ESA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fluid shifts become more dangerous upon returning to a regular gravity environment as the body will attempt to adapt to the reintroduction of gravity.

Many studies on the physiological effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system are done in parabolic flights. It is one of the only feasible options to combine with human experiments, making parabolic flights the only way to investigate the true effects of the micro-g environment on a body without traveling into space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953694996|title=Cardiovascular system, red blood cells, and oxygen transport in microgravity|others=Gunga, Hanns-Christian,, Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller von,, Coriolano, Hans-Joachim Appell,, Werner, Andreas,, Hoffmann, Uwe,|isbn=9783319332260|location=Switzerland|oclc=953694996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabolic flight studies have provided a broad range of results regarding changes in the cardiovascular system in a micro-g environment.

Space Motion Sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; SMS threatens operational requirements, reduces situational awareness, and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006502642|title=The human body and weightlessness : operational effects, problems and countermeasures|last=William,|first=Thornton,|others=Bonato, Frederick,|isbn=9783319328294|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=1006502642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement, especially when astronauts return to earth.  This can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise. Loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing.  Additionally, bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones, and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  If this were to occur during critical phases of flight, a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result. Short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to Earth or a regular gravity environment. Steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume. This loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Millennium Villages Project''' is/was a demonstration project of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and [[Millennium Promise]] aimed at proving that its integrated approach to rural development can be used to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]]—eight globally endorsed targets that address the problems of poverty, health, gender equality, and disease—by 2015. 

Even though the website of the Millennium Village Project is still active, the project ended with final evaluation in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://millenniumvillages.org/about/monitoring-and-evaluation/|title=Millennium Villages {{!}} MVP End-line Evaluation|website=millenniumvillages.org|language=en|access-date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was initially scaled to progress for a decade from 2005. The project was divided into two phases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://millenniumvillages.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MVP_Harvests_2011.pdf|title=Harvests of Development in Rural Africa: The Millennium Villages After Three Years|last=|first=|date=|website=millenniumvillages|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from 2004-2010 for the first phase and 2011-2015 for the second phase. In the first phase, the project was focused at the following five stations: Agriculture(seed and fertilizer support, farmer training and storage expansion, crop diversification,etc.), health (installation of mosquito nets, vaccine supply and pest control, etc.), Education (Construction of schools, installation of water supply, etc.), infrastructure (sanitation, roads, etc.), business development (micro-credit, cooperative training, etc.). Main focus in the second phase of the MVP was to successfully enhance, strengthen, and complete of the programs that have started in Phase 1.  

By improving access to clean water, primary education, basic health care, [[sanitation]], and other science-based interventions such as improved seeds and fertilizer, Millennium Villages aims to ensure that communities living in extreme poverty have a real, sustainable opportunity to lift themselves out of the [[poverty trap]].&lt;ref&gt;

The first Millennium village was launched in 2005 in Sauri, Kenya. "This is a village that’s going to make history," is how Millennium Villages founder [[Jeffrey Sachs]] described Sauri in ''The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa'', a 2005 MTV documentary. "It’s a village that’s going to end extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa|publisher=MTV|date=2005|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUHf_kOUM74|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millennium Villages are divided into different types. There are the original core villages which include different agro-ecological zones covering 14 sites in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including: Sauri and Dertu, [[Kenya]]; Koraro, [[Ethiopia]]; [[Mbola, Tanzania|Mbola]], [[Tanzania]]; Ruhiira, [[Uganda]]; Mayange, [[Rwanda]]; Mwandama and Gumulira, [[Malawi]]; Pampaida and Ikaram, [[Nigeria]]; Potou, [[Senegal]]; Tiby and Toya, [[Mali]] and Bonsaaso, [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;In total the Millennium Villages Project reaches nearly 500,000 people in these countries. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are additional Millennium Villages which are following the Millennium Village program but which are not directly supported through [[The Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. These additional villages are located in Liberia, Cambodia, Jordan, Mozambique, Haiti, Cameroon and Benin.

The project was originally funded through a combination of World Bank loans and private contributions, including $50 million from [[George Soros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dugger |first=Celia |title=Philanthropist Gives $50 Million to Help Aid the Poor in Africa |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/us/13soros.html?_r=0 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322091346/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/us/13soros.html?_r=0 |archivedate=22 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially designed with a timeline of five years, the project was extended to ten years to allow more time to reach the intended goals. In her 2013 book about the project, ''The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty'', journalist [[Nina Munk]] quotes [[Sachs]] saying: "The main thing is to add another block of time to really get the income levels significantly raised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munk|first=Nina|title= The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=2013|page= 136|isbn=978-0385525817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==

In 2012, the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) committed $18.1m (£11.5m) over five years to fund a new Millennium Village in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Afua|title=Jeffrey Sachs fast-tracks new Millennium Village Project in Ghana|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/31/jeffrey-sachs-millennium-village-project-ghana|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2013, the Islamic Development Bank and the Earth Institute at Columbia University announced the expansion of an earlier partnership to work with African nations to support their efforts to end extreme poverty. Part of that partnership involved the Islamic Development Bank providing $104 million in interest-free loans to 8 countries towards ending extreme poverty, improving public health, and achieve more sustainable development. Of that sum, $29 million was to be used to scale-ups of the Millennium Villages Project in Mali, Senegal and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Development Bank And Earth Institute Partner To Meet Millennium Development Goals In Rural Africa|url=http://globalcenters.columbia.edu/nairobi/content/islamic-development-bank-and-earth-institute-partner-meet-millennium-development-goals-rural|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the Ugandan government announced it would scale up the Millennium Villages Project in the original region around the Ruhiira Millennium Village through $US 9.75 million of funding from the Islamic Development Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugandan Government Launches Scale-up of Millennium Villages Project|url=http://millenniumvillages.org/press-releases/ugandan-government-launches-scale-up-of-millennium-villages-project/|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the promised scale-up has not yet taken place.

In September 2013, the Rwandan government and the Millennium Villages Project announced a partnership to scale-up certain aspects of the Millennium Village approach, as part of Rwanda's Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme which addresses poverty nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rwanda to Scale Up Millennium Villages Approach Nationwide|url=http://millenniumvillages.org/press-releases/rwanda-to-scale-up-millennium-villages-approach-nationwide/|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Millennium Villages Project has provided lessons and techniques for Nigeria's development programs designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria Working With Earth Institute to Expand Anti-Poverty Program|url=http://millenniumvillages.org/press-releases/nigeria-working-with-earth-institute-to-expand-anti-poverty-program//|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guiding Principles ==
* Promote sustainable, scalable, community-led progress toward the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through the use of scientifically validated interventions—one village at a time
* Ensure African ownership of the Millennium Development Goals, and work in partnership with African governments and regional groups
* Increase capacity and community empowerment in Africa through training and knowledge sharing with local African governments, [[NGO]]s, and village communities.
* Partner with the public and private sectors, innovative NGOs, universities and leading experts, and the international donor community throughout Africa and the world to continually improve and coordinate development strategies.
* Transform rural sub-subsistence farming economies into small-scale enterprise development economies and promote diversified entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing ==

The Government of [[Japan]] (through its [[Human Security Trust Fund]]) and private philanthropic donors (through the Earth Institute at Columbia University) provided the financing for the first set of Millennium Villages, reaching some 60,000 people.

A core aspect of the Millennium Villages is that the poverty-ending investments in agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure can be financed by donors at an incremental cost of just $60 per villager per year—$250,000 per village per year.  The overhead costs of managing the project in each village is $50,000 per year.

On a per-person basis, the total village cost of $120 per person includes:
*$60 Donor funding through the Millennium Village program
*$30 Local and national governments (this is most likely to include funding for interventions themselves and the provision of agricultural and health extension workers in the villages)
*$20 Partner organizations (e.g., existing programs supported by official bilateral donors) and in-kind corporate giving (for example, [[Sumitomo Chemical]] Corporation recently agreed to donate insecticide-treated bednets for the Millennium Villages)
*$10 Village members, typically through in-kind contributions of their time and expertise

Critically, the external financing needs of $70 per capita are in line with the financial commitments made by the leaders of industrialized countries at the [[2005 G8 Summit|2005 Summit in Gleneagles]].  G8 countries promised to raise their development assistance to Africa to the equivalent of $70 per capita by 2010.

== Prospects for increasing village-based interventions ==

In a review of the project undertaken by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) crop yield increases of 85-350% were recorded as well as reductions in malaria incidence of over 50%.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2573&amp;title=can-project-funded-investments-rural-development-be-scaled-up-lessons-millennium-villages-project |title=Can project-funded investments in rural development be scaled-up? Lessons from the Millennium Villages Project |date=November 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220095704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2573&amp;title=can-project-funded-investments-rural-development-be-scaled-up-lessons-millennium-villages-project |archivedate=20 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While agricultural surpluses are able to be channelled into school meals programmes, helping to increase enrolment, improvements in health status are reported to increase labour productivity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

According to ODI policy conclusions, in order for wider scale, more sustainable implementation to be achieved, village projects need to identify shared goals, seeking evidence-based, cost-effective interventions by governments and implementing agencies.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; They will also need to focus on addressing upstream investments such as training facilities for front-line staff.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

==Critics==

When compared to the [[Ekwendeni]] village of the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC), the Millennium Villages obtain only similar achievements at far greater expense. This is a result of the Millennium Villages' use of [[artificial fertilizer]]s and [[Plant breeding|hybrids]] seeds (often of plants such as corn, which are [[Tropical agriculture|not indigenous]] to the area). SFHC, on the other hand, uses diverse legume crops to improve soil health: "The SFHC research project attempts to improve child nutritional status, household food security and soil fertility through use of different legume options which can improve the quality and quantity of food available within the household as well as provide organic inputs to improve soil fertility."&lt;ref&gt;Soils, Food, and Healthy Communities. Research Results (main page). http://soilandfood.org/research-results/&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rachel Bezner Kerr]], use of fertilizers and genetically modified seeds leads to dependence of the farmers on expensive products being marketed by large industrial companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/cheap-food/bourne-text/1 Critics to millennium villages]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the use of crop diversity to improve soil health is a low cost, and thus far more sustainable, solution. Note this comparison is only to one component of the Millennium Villages Project which works in many different sectors including agriculture, education, health, infrastructure and business development.

Journalist [[Nina Munk]] followed the progress of a group of Millennium Villages for several years, and in her 2013 book ''The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty,'' she said a basic flaw of the Millennium Villages program is that it is developed by academics living far away from the subject areas and with a poor understanding of local cultures, who do things such as promoting growing maize among people who have not historically eaten it or building a short-lived livestock market when there was no local demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/09/10/the-quest-to-end-poverty-nina-munk/ Anna Maria Tremonti, "The Quest to End Poverty: Nina Munk", CBC Radio, 2013-09-10]&lt;/ref&gt; But even in Ms. Munk's book teams of experts are described who are from the countries and regions who run the Millennium Villages on the ground. In addition, many notable academics and development experts who work for the project have a long history in working and living in Africa and other developing countries. The Millennium Villages describes itself as a community-led project that works with local leaders, regional officials and national governments in the decision-making process.

==Evaluations==
A rigorous evaluation of the MVP is impossible due to shortcomings in the project's evaluation design which include the "subjective choice of intervention sites, the subjective choice of comparison sites, the lack of baseline data on comparison sites, the small sample size, and the short time horizon".&lt;ref name="CD11"/&gt; A self-published assessment comparing villages three years into the project to how they were initially estimated large impacts on health, agricultural yield, and a variety of other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ciesin.columbia.edu/binaries/web/global/news/2010/mvp_midterm_report.pdf | title=Harvests of Development in Rural Africa: The Millennium Villages After Three Years | publisher=Millennium Villages | year=2010 | accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some of this may have been due to regional improvements unrelated to the MVP, an independent evaluation comparing the MV to surrounding areas finds the effects are much more modest.&lt;ref name="CD11"&gt;{{cite journal | title=When does rigorous impact evaluation make a difference? The case of the Millennium Villages |vauthors=Clemen M, Demombynes G | journal=Journal of Development Effectiveness | year=2011 | volume=3 | issue=3 | pages=305–339 | doi=10.1080/19439342.2011.587017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional independent evaluation found that while agricultural productivity increased, final household income was not increased by the MVP.&lt;ref name="wm13"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Can Big Push Interventions Take Small-Scale Farmers out of Poverty?

In 2012, the MVP published an assessment in the Lancet showing "reductions in poverty, food insecurity, stunting, and malaria parasitaemia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The effect of an integrated multisector model for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and improving child survival in rural sub-Saharan Africa: a non-randomised controlled assessment | author=Pronyk, A| journal=The Lancet | year=2012 | volume=379 | issue=9832 | pages=2179–2188 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60207-4|display-authors=etal | pmid=22572602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objections were raised to some of the conclusions in the assessment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Concerns about the Millennium Villages project report | author=Bumps, J. | journal=The Lancet |date=May 2012  | volume=379 | issue=9830 |page=1946 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors were forced to correct them subsequently: calculations of the under-5 child mortality rate were flawed and withdrawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Errors in a paper on the Millennium Villages project | author=Pronyk, P. | journal=The Lancet |date=May 2012  | volume=379 | issue=9830 |page=1946 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60824-1 | pmid=22617273}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the rate appears to have improved less in the MVP sites than in the surrounding regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cgdev.org/publication/new-transparency-development-economics-lessons-millennium-villages-controversy-working | title=The New Transparency in Development Economics: Lessons from the Millennium Villages Controversy | publisher=CGD | date=9 September 2013 | accessdate=3 February 2014 |author1=Clemens, M  |author2=Demombynes, G |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10684">'''Norman Tenner Adler''' (June 7, 1941 - September 11, 2016) through his research, teaching, writing, and academic administration, made major contributions to the modern study of [[biological psychology]] and in American [[higher education]], having helped develop the fields that are now labeled [[behavioral neurobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/series/6032 |title=Handbooks of Behavioral Neurobiology |publisher=Springer.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Adler's prominent experiments included an in depth analysis of mating performance of male rats and its relation to fertilization in the female, which led him to observe how behaviour could affect reproduction in species.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, N. (1975) Norman T. Adler. "American Psychologist", 30(1), 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; With his students and colleagues, he has worked at the interface between [[biology]] and behavior. They have stressed the importance of combining the study of physiological mechanisms controlling behavior with the functional/adaptive significance of behavior in an evolutionary context.&lt;ref&gt;http://cogsci.bme.hu/DoCS/oktatas/kurzusok/kogtudtort/Rozin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced in this approach by his undergraduate teachers at Harvard, especially Paul Rozin, Jerry Hogan, and Gordon Bermant, and his student colleagues like Don Pfaff with whom he has maintained scientific relationships over the years. His research was also impacted by Daniel Lehrman, and he worked closely with Lehrman's student, Barry Komisaruk, on [[hormones]] and [[neural functioning]].&lt;ref&gt;Komisaruk, B. R., Adler, N. T. and Hutchison, J R. (1973). Genital sensory field. Science, 181: 1295-1298&lt;/ref&gt; Adler is also a prominent figure in American higher education, especially the role of behavioral neuroscience in liberal arts education and religion in the college classroom.

==Early life and education==
A native of Chicago, where he attended public schools and received a Jewish education at the College of Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spertus.edu/aboutspertus/index.php&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In high school, Adler was interested in the career of a rabbi and a psychoanalyst, but didn't know which one to choose.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychologist., "Early Career Awards for 1974". American Psychological Association, 1975, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He became drawn towards science after taking biology with a teacher named Richard Boyajian, who motivated him to pursue a career in biology. During his years in Harvard college, he took a course in physiological psychology, which gave him the opportunity to acknowledge that there is in fact an area of study that can combine his interests in biology and psychology. Adler graduated from [[Harvard]] in 1962 with a major in Psychology and extensive coursework in biology. After College, he spent the next year traveling around the world under the auspices of Harvard's Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. He used the year to visit the European ethologists and study animal behavior and complex social systems in general ('The City' was the title of his summary essay from that year). To become familiar with the techniques of the classical ethologists, he spent time in Africa and other field sites. He also developed an early interest in comparative religion—but decided that the field of 'psychology of religion' was not yet ready to develop so stayed with biological psychology, which he felt was just beginning. At the latter part of his career, he has returned to the study of psychology and religion with his students and colleagues at Yeshiva University—profoundly impressed at the speed with which a dormant field 'took off'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religionnewsblog.com/18170/kashi-ashram&lt;/ref&gt; and with how important these issues were becoming on the American campus.

After the post-baccalaureate year of travel, Adler went to [[UC Berkeley]], where he was a graduate student of Frank Beach (one of the founders of the study of hormones and behavior), and received a Master's in zoology with Howard Bern ([[comparative endocrinology]]). He then went to [[UCLA]] for a post-doctoral year with C. H. Sawyer ([[neuroendocrinology]]). He began his work on the effects of copulatory behavior on reproductive physiology. By making behavior the 'independent variable' and physiology the 'dependent variable', he felt that the adaptive significance of behavior would perforce be recognized in the biological system.

==Career==

===Academic history===
He joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became the youngest tenured professor at the time. He is also widely known as the founder of the Biological Basis of Behavior Program at Penn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/bbb/node/11 |title=Biological Basis of Behavior Program &amp;#124; Biological Basis of Behavior Program |publisher=Psych.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the prototype of the integrative study of behavior from a biological perspective. This program became a national model and helped spur the development of behavioral neuroscience in the American undergraduate curriculum. For this work, he received the Dana Award for Pioneering Achievement in Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dana.org/uploadedFiles/About_Dana/dana_foundation_timeline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania now presents an annual "Norman Adler Lecture in the Biological Basis of Behavior" in his honor.

He has had a number of distinguished students in the field, including [[Martha McClintock]] at the University of Chicago, [[Elizabeth Adkins-Regan]] at Cornell University, [[Avery Gilbert]], Jack Yanovski, Stephen Zoloth at Northeastern, Penny Bernstein at Kent State University, Joseph Anisko, Rodney Pelchat, Karen Stewart, and James Toner.

He served as Dean of Penn's Undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, Dean of Yeshiva College for a decade, and was also Vice-Provost for Research and Graduate Education, and Professor of Psychology, at Northeastern University. He has also held visiting, teaching, or research appointments at University of Edinburgh, Drexel University Dept. of Engineering, and Swarthmore College.

He was University Professor of Psychology at Yeshiva University and Special Assistant to the Provost for Curriculum and Research Initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yu.edu/faculty/adler/page.aspx?id=9250&amp;ekmensel=468_submenu_0_link_1 |title=Yeshiva University: Faculty - Norman Adler |publisher=Yu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributions to higher education===
In addition to his work in behavioral neuroscience and its dissemination across American academics, he is an authority in American higher education, specializing in interdisciplinary and integrative learning. He initiated the Penn Reading Project in 1991 which has continued for over 20 years as an integrative introduction to liberal learning for college freshmen newly arriving on campus. Subsequently, Freshman Reading Projects have been adopted widely as part of the "[[first-year experience]]" at many college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.www.upenn.edu/themeyear/proof/penn-reading-project.html Penn Reading Project]&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, in 1992 Adler was inducted as an honorary member of the University of Pennsylvania's Philomathean Society—the oldest continually existing collegiate literary society in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philomathean.org/alumni/philograds/honorary-members/ |title=Philomathean Society Honorary Members |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently serves on the editorial board of Liberal Education, the journal of the American Association of Colleges and Universities; chairs a project for AACU’s section on ‘Big Questions: Faith and Reason on the College Campus’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacu.org/liberaleducation/le-sp07/le-sp07_featuresix.cfm |title=Liberal Education &amp;#124; Spring 2007 &amp;#124; Faith and Reason on Campus |publisher=Aacu.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project, citing data that there is a high level of spirituality among students in College because they continually question the "deeper" issues in their lives, the modern curriculum needs to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacu.org/liberaleducation/le-sp07/le-sp07_featuresix.cfm |title=Liberal Education &amp;#124; Spring 2007 &amp;#124; Faith and Reason on Campus |publisher=Aacu.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lectures widely and is a consultant to Universities and Foundations.

He has received numerous prizes and honors including two Guggenheim Fellowships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=a&amp;page=2 |title=All Fellows - John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |publisher=Gf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigma Xi]] National Lecture, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], Fellowship to Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral sciences, Lindback Award for Teaching Excellence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/notables/awards/lindback.html |title=Lindback Awards at Penn, University of Pennsylvania, University Archives |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was in the first group of recipients for the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Awards for Early Career Contributions to Psychology.

Operation Safety Net visits the unsheltered homeless directly where they sleep through walking teams of the formerly homeless and medical outreach staff. Most of OSN's work force are volunteers, but a dedicated office/case management staff support all the field work. Services are available year-round, 24-hours a day.  The work of OSN has evolved to include medical student education in the streets, housing, preventive health services, hospital consults, severe weather shelter and response, as well as extensive public education. OSN has received numerous national and international awards&lt;ref&gt;*Srikameswaran, Anita.

{{Family law}}

'''Paternity law''' refers to body of law underlying [[law|legal]] relationship between a [[father]] and his [[biology|biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]] [[child]]ren and deals with the rights and obligations of both the father and the child to each other as well as to others. A child's paternity may be relevant in relation to issues of [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[inheritance]] and rights to a [[putative father]]'s title or surname, as well as the biological father's rights to [[child custody]] in the case of separation or [[divorce]] and obligations for [[child support]].

Under common law, a child born to a [[marriage|married]] woman is presumed under [[common law]] to be the child of her husband by virtue of a "[[presumption of paternity]]" or [[presumption of legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Edward P.|title=The Presumption of Legitimacy|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/lbb/x650.htm|website=Law and the Physician|publisher=The Law, Science &amp; Public Health Law Site|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration of a possible [[non-paternity event]] (which may or may not include [[paternity fraud]]) these presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, for example, in disputed child custody and child support cases during divorce, [[annulment]] or [[legal separation]].

In the case of a father not married to a child's mother, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction:
* a man may accept the paternity of the child in what is called an '''acknowledgment of paternity''', '''voluntary acknowledgement of paternity''' or '''affidavit of parentage''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affidavit of Parentage|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/Parentage_10872_7.pdf|website=State of Michigan|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing Paternity Voluntarily|url=http://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/acknowledging-paternity|website=MassLegalHelp|publisher=Massachusetts Legal Services|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the mother or legal authorities can file a petition for a determination of paternity against a putative father, or&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Establishing and Contesting Paternity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_law/paternity.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=17 September 2017|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* paternity can be determined by the courts through [[estoppel]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parentage/Paternity|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-parentage.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, when paternity is in dispute or doubt, [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] may be used to conclusively resolve the issue.

==Overview==
{{see also|List of national legal systems}}

The legal process of determining paternity normally results in the naming of a man to a child's birth certificate as the child's legal father. A paternity finding resolves issues of legitimacy, and may be followed by court rulings that relate to child support and maintenance, custody and guardianship.

==Unmarried fathers==
Generally, under common law, a biological father has a legal obligation for the maintenance or [[child support|support]] of his biological offspring, whether or not he is legally competent to marry the child's mother.&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/06/us/court-tells-youth-to-support-child-he-fathered-at-age-13.html|title=Court Tells Youth to Support Child He Fathered at Age 13|publisher=New York Times (USA)|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In jurisdictions where there is no [[presumption of paternity]] there is a process for fathers to [[Recognition (family law)|recognise]] their children and become the legal father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers |url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf |website=The Child Welfare Information Gateway |accessdate=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Married fathers==
In the United States, where a child is conceived or born during wedlock, the husband is legally presumed to be the father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Jana|title=Marriage, Biology, and Paternity: The Case for Revitalizing the Marital Presumption|journal=Maryland Law Review|date=2006|volume=65|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mllr65&amp;div=21&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have a legal process for a husband to disavow paternity, such that a biological father can be named as the parent of a child conceived or born during a marriage. In most states, any claim of non-paternity by a husband must be heard by a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Paula|title=Disestablishing the Paternity of Non - Marital Children|url=http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/0111.pdf|website=CLASP|publisher=Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a parents litigate a divorce case without raising the issue of paternity, in most states they will be barred from disputing the husband's paternity in a later court proceeding. Depending upon state law, it may nonetheless be possible for a man claiming to be the child's biological father to commence a paternity case following the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glennon|first1=Theresa|title=Somebody's Child: Evaluating the Erosion of the Marital Presumption of Paternity|journal=West Virginia Law Review|date=1999|volume=102|page=547|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wvb102&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Where paternity of the child is in question, a party may ask the court to determine paternity of one or more possible fathers (called putative fathers), typically based initially upon sworn statements and then upon [[testimony]] or other [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rights of  Unmarried Fathers|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf|website=Child Welfare Information Gateway|publisher=Children's Bureau|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once paternity has been legally established, if the court finds that to do so would be contrary to the best interest of the child, in most U.S. states a court may deny DNA testing or decline to remove a husband from a child's birth certificate based upon DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strasser|first1=Mark|title=Legislative Presumptions and Judicial Assumptions: On Parenting, Adoption, and the Best Interest of the Child|journal=University of Kansas Law Review|date=1996|volume=45|page=49|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ukalr45&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful application to the court results in an order assigning paternity to a specific man, possibly including support responsibility and/or [[Contact (law)|visitation]] rights, or declaring that one or more men (possibly including the husband of the mother) are not the father of the child. A disavowal action is a legal proceeding where a putative father attempts to prove to the court that he is not the father; if successful, it relieves the former putative father of legal responsibility for the child.&lt;ref name=disavow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/LawSearch.aspx|title=Louisiana Civil Code article 186 et seq.|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it could be the case where several putative fathers are fighting to establish custody. In such case. In the United States, a state may legally bar a third party from disputing the paternity of a child born within an intact marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 US 110, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18282912377125168373|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paternity laws assign full parental responsibility to fathers even in cases of women lying about contraception, using deceit (such as [[oral sex]] followed by self-[[artificial insemination]]){{cn|date=January 2016}} or statutory rape by a woman ([[Hermesmann v. Seyer]]).&lt;ref name=boy /&gt;

==Paternity and inheritance rights==
If the context of inheritance rights, it will be the heirs of the deceased person who are attempting to dispute or establish paternity.  In some states, DNA testing will be dispositive to establish paternity.  In many jurisdictions, however, there are a variety of rules and time restrictions that can deny inheritance rights to biological children of a deceased father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beugge|first1=Charlotte|title=Rise in wills disputes over illegitimate children|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/10106145/Rise-in-wills-disputes-over-illegitimate-children.html|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahapatra|first1=Dhananjay|title=How legitimate is an illegitimate child’s right to property|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/How-legitimate-is-an-illegitimate-childs-right-to-property/articleshow/15788019.cms|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Times of India|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Meredith|title=Intestate Succession Rights and Children Born Out of Wedlock|url=https://civil.sog.unc.edu/intestate-succession-rights-and-children-born-out-of-wedlock/|website=UNC School of Government|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychiatric interview''' refers to the set of tools that a mental health worker (most times a psychiatrist or a psychologist but at times social workers or nurses) uses to complete a [[psychiatric assessment]].

The goals of the psychiatric interview are:
*Build [[rapport]].
*Collect data about the patient's current difficulties, past [[psychiatric history]] and [[medical history]], as well as relevant developmental, interpersonal and social history.
*Diagnose the [[mental health]] issue(s).
*Understand the patient's [[Personality psychology|personality]] structure, use of [[defense mechanisms]] and [[coping strategies]].
*Improve the patient's [[insight]].
*Create a foundation for a [[therapeutic alliance]].
*Foster healing.

The data collected through the psychiatric interview is mostly subjective, based on the patient's report, and many times can not be corroborated by objective measurements. As such, one the interview's goals is to collect data that is both valid and reliable. 

[[Validity (logic)|Validity]] refers to how the data compares to an ideal absolute truth that the interviewer needs to access and uncover. Challenges that might affect the interview validity include can be categorized as patient related factors and interviewer related factors. Patient's related factors include:
*Shame: the patient might feel ashamed to discuss some of his difficulties.
*Fear of being judged: while not ashamed the patient might be reluctant to discuss some of the issues that she thinks that she can be judged for.
*Lack of awareness: patient might have distorted recollection of past events with significant emotional valence.
*Cognitive deficits: the patient might have a memory deficit that might impair his ability to correctly recall past events.
*[[Secondary gain]]: the patient decided to misrepresent fact in order to gain a certain benefit (e.g. disability benefits) or avoid a certain penalty (e.g. [[insanity defense]]).
Interviewer related factors include:
*Powerful feelings of like or dislike that might affect the interviewer objectivity.
*Lack of experience: the interviewer lack the skills and knowledge necessary to explore a specific area of pathology.
*[[Diagnostic bias]]: the interviewer is invested in a specific psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. same patient might be diagnosed with schizophrenia by a schizophrenia researcher or bipolar disorder with psychotic features by a bipolar disorder researcher).

[[Reliability (statistics)|Reliability]] refers to how datasets collected by different interviewers or the same interview at different times compare with one another. Ideal reliability is when a dataset will be stable irrespective of changes in specifics of the data collection. 

Different interview techniques have been shown to result in variations in the validity and reliability of the collected data.  Open-ended question ("Tell me about your sleep.") have been shown to have better validity but less reliability than closed-ended questions("Do you have sleeping difficulties?")

'''Reinhard Karl''' (3 November 1946 &amp;ndash; 19 May 1982) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mountaineer]], photographer and writer.&lt;ref name="isbn3-7654-5152-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reinhard Karl |title=Erlebnis Berg: Zeit zum Atmen |publisher=Bruckmann Verlag GmbH |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=3-7654-5152-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Karl was born in [[Heidelberg]]. At the age of 14, he started working as a mechanic apprentice. Later on, he joined night classes to complete high school. When he was admitted to daily school, he left his work as a mechanic to continue his studies in Frankfurt. He later became a professional mountain photographer and also wrote several books. At the beginning of his career, climbing during weekends was his way to escape from his work as a mechanic, which he disliked.

He discovered his passion for mountains thanks to his readings; in his autobiography he specifically mentions ''Achttausend drüber und drunter'' by [[Hermann Buhl]] and a book on Everest's ascent by [[Edmund Hillary]]. His mother encouraged him by sending him to the Mountain Club in Heidelberg, where he met Hermann Kühn, partner in several ascents, including the Eiger's north face.

==Climbing experience==
Karl's career started with his first climbing experiences on [[Battert]], near [[Baden-Baden]]. He mastered several styles of climbing, ranging from alpine style in Europe and South America, free climbing and eight-thousanders.

===Alps===
He climbed several famous mountains and routes in the Alps, such as:&lt;ref name=HAA&gt;{{cite book|title=Karl, Reinhard - Personenmappe|publisher=Historisches-Alpen Archiv|url=http://www.historisches-alpenarchiv.org/data/dokumente/main/17/00127142_m.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the Bonatti pillar on [[Aiguille du Dru]]
*the Walker Spur on the [[Grandes_Jorasses#North_face|north face of the Grandes Jorasses]] (1968)
*the [[Eiger]] north face, after several failed attempts (1969)
*the north face onf [[Les Droites]], in the [[Mont Blanc massif]]
*the [[Gary Hemming|Hemming]]- [[Royal Robbins|Robbins]] on the west face of [[Aiguille du Dru]]
*the Pillar of Frêney on Mont Blanc

===Yosemite===
Karl visited Yosemite several times, where he experienced both [[Big wall climbing]] and [[free climbing]].&lt;ref name=HAA /&gt;
He climbed several big walls. In 1975, he climbed [[Half Dome]] north-west face and the Nose on [[El Capitan]], [[Salathé Wall (El Capitan)|Salathé Wall]] in 1977 and Son of Heart in 1978 on [[El Capitan]].
He also got in contact with American climbers spending their summers in Yosemite, such as [[Ron Kauk]] and [[John Bachar]], masters of [[bouldering]].

===Free Climbing===
After his experience at Yosemite, he applied his new vision of climbing in Battert crag.&lt;ref name=HAA /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1977, Karl and [[Helmut Kiene]] realised the first grade VII climbing with the free ascent of the Pumprisse on the [[Fleischbank]], on the [[Kaisergebirge]].

===Eight-thousenders===
Karl was the first German to reach the summit of [[Mount Everest]] (with oxygen) on 10 May 1978, with Oswald Olz. He was part, as photographer, of the [[Reinhold Messner#Ascent of Mount Everest|same expedition]] which saw [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Peter Habeler]] climb Mount Everest for the first time without supplemental oxygen.
Karl's second eight-thousander was [[Gasherbrum II]], in Karakorum, with Hans Schell in 1979.&lt;ref name=HAA /&gt;

===South-America===
In 1980 Karl's attempt, with Hans Martin Götz, to climb [[Cerro Torre]] failed when they spent the night at only 250 meters from the top.&lt;ref name=HAA /&gt;
Also his attempt to climb the ''Supercanaleta'' on [[Fitz Roy]] with Luis Fraga did not succeed.
His last mountain was Fitz Roy, which he climbed in 1982 with Peter Luthy on the south-west face (route ''Chouinard'') two weeks after the failed attempt on ''Supercanaleta''.

==Works==
Karl has also had an important part in documenting mountain climbing in his pictures and books.

His books are the following:
* ''Erlebnis Berg: Zeit zum Atmen'' (''Adventure Mountain: Time to breathe'')
* ''Yosemite – Klettern im senkrechten Paradies'' (''Yosemite - climbing the vertical paradise'')
* ''Berge auf Kodachrome'' (''Mountains on Kodachrome'')

==Death==
Karl died on 19 May 1982 in an ice avalanche at Camp II {{convert|6900|m|ft}} on [[Cho Oyu]], during his attempt to climb his third eight-thousander.

[[Salt]] consumption has been intensely studied for its role in human physiology and impact on human health. In particular, excessive dietary salt consumption over an extended period of time has been associated with [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], in addition to other adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="millen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://advances.nutrition.org/content/7/3/438.long | title=The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report: Development and Major Conclusions | author=Barbara E Millen, Steve Abrams, Lucile Adams-Campbell, Cheryl AM Anderson, J Thomas Brenna, Wayne W Campbell, Steven Clinton, Frank Hu, Miriam Nelson, Marian L Neuhouser, Rafael Perez-Escamilla, Anna Maria Siega-Riz, Mary Story, Alice H Lichtenstein | journal=Adv Nutr | year=2016 | volume=7 | pages=438–444 | doi=10.3945/an.116.012120|pmid=27184271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sodium Reduction: An Important Public Health Strategy for Heart Health | author=Mugavero KL, Gunn JP, Dunet DO, Bowman BA | journal=J Public Health Manag Pract | year=2014 | volume=20 | issue=101 | pages=S1-S5 | doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3182aa659c | pmid=24322810 | pmc=4450095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;

Common edible salt is composed of [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref name=Foodtech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodtechcanada.ca/siteimages/Salt%20reduction%20guide%20for%20the%20food%20industry.pdf |title=Salt reduction guide for the food industry |publisher=Foodtech Canada |accessdate=8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of salt on blood pressure ==

[[File:Automatische bloeddrukmeter (0).jpg|thumb|Automated blood pressure device]]

The human body has evolved to balance salt intake with need through means such as the [[renin–angiotensin system]]. In humans, salt has important biological functions. Relevant to risk of cardiovascular disease, salt is highly involved with the maintenance of [[body fluid]] volume, including [[osmotic balance]] in the blood, [[extracellular]] and [[intracellular]] fluids, and resting membrane potential.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bengt |title=Regulation of body fluids |journal=Annual Review of Physiology |volume=39 |pages=185–200 |year=1977 |last1=Andersson |pmid=322597 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.001153 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well known effect of sodium on blood pressure can be explained by comparing blood to a [[solution]] with its [[salinity]] changed by ingested salt. [[Artery walls]] are analogous to a [[selectively permeable membrane]], and they allow solutes, including sodium and chloride, to pass through (or not), depending on [[osmosis]].

Circulating water and [[solutes]] in the body maintain blood pressure in the blood, as well as other functions such as regulation of [[body temperature]]. When salt is ingested, it is dissolved in the blood as two separate ions – Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[water potential]] in blood will decrease due to the increase solutes, and blood [[osmotic pressure]] will increase. While the kidney reacts to excrete excess sodium and chloride in the body, [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]] causes blood pressure to increase.&lt;ref name="Blaustein"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=324293 |last1=Blaustein |first1=MP |year=1977 |pages=C165–73 |issue=5 |volume=232 |title=Sodium ions, calcium ions, blood pressure regulation, and hypertension: a reassessment and a hypothesis |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=324293 |doi=10.1152/ajpcell.1977.232.5.c165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DASH-Sodium study ===
{{Main article|DASH diet}}

The DASH-Sodium study was a sequel to the original [[DASH diet|DASH]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study. Both studies were designed and conducted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] in the United States, each involving a large, randomized sample.&lt;ref name="Karanja N 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karanja |first1=N. |last2=Erlinger |first2=T P |last3=Pao-Hwa |first3=L. |last4=Miller |first4=E. R |last5=Bray |first5=G. A |title=The DASH diet for high blood pressure: from clinical trial to dinner table |journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=745–53 |year=2004 |pmid=15478706 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.71.9.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the original study was designed to test the effects of several varying nutrients on blood pressure, DASH-Sodium varies only in salt content in the diet.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sacks |first1=Frank M. |last2=Svetkey |first2=Laura P. |last3=Vollmer |first3=William M. |last4=Appel |first4=Lawrence J. |last5=Bray |first5=George A. |last6=Harsha |first6=David |last7=Obarzanek |first7=Eva |last8=Conlin |first8=Paul R. |last9=Miller |first9=Edgar R. |title=Effects on Blood Pressure of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2001 |pmid=11136953 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants were pre-hypertensive or at stage 1 hypertension, and either ate a DASH-Diet or a diet reflecting an "average American Diet". During the intervention phase, participants ate their assigned diets containing three distinct levels of sodium in random order. Their blood pressure is monitored during the control period, and at all three intervention phases.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt;

The study concluded that the effect of a reduced dietary sodium intake alone on blood pressure is substantial, and that the largest decrease in blood pressure occurred in those eating the DASH eating plan at the lowest sodium level (1,500 milligrams per day).&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt; However, this study is especially significant because participants in both the control and DASH diet group showed lowered blood pressure with decreased sodium alone.&lt;ref name="Karanja N 2004"/&gt;

In agreement with studies regarding salt sensitivity, participants of African descent showed high reductions in blood pressure. See [[Salt and cardiovascular disease#Sodium sensitivity|sodium sensitivity]] below.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt;

== Hypertension and cardiovascular disease ==

There has been strong evidence from [[epidemiological studies]], human and animal intervention experiments supporting the links between high rate of salt intake and hypertension.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cappuccio"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cappuccio |first1=F.

More data is needed to support the conclusions of observational studies which suffer from design flaws.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; Many of these studies are not large enough, nor last long enough to provide conclusions on clinical outcomes for the effect of dietary sodium intake on morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; Previous mixed results and inconclusive interpretation of non-experimental studies may also root from the way sodium is measured in the study.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; The study by Cook and colleagues itself was unable to isolate only a change in sodium. The techniques to reduce sodium included keeping a food diary and reading labels. Cook and colleagues listed other effects of those techniques, including a reduction in fat and calories per day (11g, 200cal), and weight loss of 1 to 3 pounds.&lt;ref name="tohp1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Feasibility and Efficacy of Sodium Reduction in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase I|journal=Hypertension|year=1993 | doi=10.1161/01.hyp.22.4.502|volume=22|pages=502–512}}.

=== Current trends and campaigns ===

The [[World Health Organization]] issued a 2014 fact sheet to encourage reducing global salt consumption by 30% through 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs393/en/ | title=Salt reduction | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | work=Fact sheet | date=September 2014 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] began an initiative encouraging Americans to reduce their consumption of salty foods.&lt;ref name="cdc-init"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/sodiumreductioninitiative.pdf | title=CDC’s Sodium Reduction Initiative: Saving Lives and Money | publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=December 2015 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]] defined a daily sodium consumption limit should be 1500 milligrams (contained in less than 0.75 [[teaspoon]] of table salt).&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Shaking-the-Salt-Habit_UCM_303241_Article.jsp#.V1nWYNQrJkg | title=Shaking the Salt Habit | publisher=American Heart Association | date=2016 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Health Canada]] report, Canadians in all age groups are consuming 3400&amp;nbsp;mg per day of sodium, more than twice as much as needed.&lt;ref name="hc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/sodium/index-eng.php | title=Sodium in Canada | publisher=Health Canada | work=Food and Nutrition | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that the average daily sodium intake for Americans over 2 years of age is 3436&amp;nbsp;milligrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/Sodium_Fact_Sheet.pdf | title=Sodium: The facts | publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=April 2016 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of sodium consumed by North Americans is from processed and restaurant foods, while only a small portion is added during cooking or at the table.&lt;ref name="cdc-init"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=RD |last2=Donnelly |first2=D |title=Relative contributions of dietary sodium sources |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–93 |year=1991 |pmid=1910064 |doi=10.1080/07315724.1991.10718167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], half of the member states legislated change in the form of taxation, mandatory nutrition labeling, and regulated nutrition and health claims to address overconsumption of sodium&lt;ref name="kloss"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352364615000024 | title=Sodium intake and its reduction by food reformulation in the European Union — A review | author=Kloss L, Meyer JD, Graeve L, Vetter W | journal=Nutrition &amp; Food Science Journal (NFS Journal) | year=2015 | volume=1 | pages=9–19 | doi=10.1016/j.nfs.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a 2012 EU Salt Reduction Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/nutrition_physical_activity/docs/salt_report1_en.pdf | title=Survey on Members States’ Implementation of the EU Salt Reduction Framework | publisher=[[European Commission]] | date=2012 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate about sodium as a health problem ===

Despite few claims to the contrary, most physicians and clinical scientists, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] recommend that consumers use less salt in their diets, mainly to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and associated cardiovascular diseases in adults and children.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/index.htm | title=Salt | publisher=US Centers for Disease Control | work=National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention | date=1 June 2016 | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/050622 | title=EFSA provides advice on adverse effects of sodium | publisher=European Food Safety Authority | date=22 June 2005 | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited group of researchers has cast doubts on the generally accepted theory that lowering sodium intake will improve the health of a given population.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than create drastic salt policies based on conflicting data, Alderman and his colleague Hillel Cohen propose that the government sponsor a large, controlled clinical trial to see what happens to people who follow low-salt diets over time. Appel responds that such a trial "cannot and will not be done," in part because it would be so expensive. But unless we have clear data, evangelical antisalt campaigns are not just based on shaky science; they are ultimately unfair. "A great number of promises are being made to the public with regard to this enormous benefit and lives saved," Cohen says. But it is "based on wild extrapolations."&lt;ref&gt;"It is Time to End the War on Salt: The zealous drive by politicians to limit our salt intake has little basis in science."''Scientific American'' Jul 8, 2011. Melinda Wenner Moyer. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Taken together, our current findings refute the estimates of computer models of lives saved and health care costs reduced with lower salt intake. They do also not support the current recommendations of a generalized and indiscriminate reduction of salt intake at the population level. However, they do not negate the blood pressure-lowering effects of a dietary salt reduction in hypertensive patients."&lt;ref&gt;"Fatal and Nonfatal Outcomes, Incidence of Hypertension, and Blood Pressure Changes in Relation to Urinary Sodium Excretion" ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''. Stolarz-Skrzypek, et al. May 4, 2011. [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=899663]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The traditional Japanese diet is very high in salt intake and yet, the Japanese had the highest rate of longevity in the world, and low rates of cardiovascular disease. ". . .we have found that the Japanese dietary pattern is associated with lower CVD mortality, despite the fact that the Japanese dietary pattern appeared to be related to higher sodium intake and high prevalence of hypertension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shimazu Taichi | year = | title = Dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japan: a prospective cohort study | url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/600.full | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 600–609 | doi=10.1093/ije/dym005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse cardiovascular effects===
Some studies have shown that salt consumption has been found to increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[arterial stiffness]] and [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;&lt;ref name="susic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Susic|first1=D|last2=Frohlich|first2=ED|title=Salt consumption and cardiovascular, renal, and hypertensive diseases: clinical and mechanistic aspects.|journal=Current Opinion in Lipidology|date=February 2012|volume=23|issue=1|pages=11–6|doi=10.1097/MOL.0b013e32834d9c52|pmid=22123673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of low salt consumption===
In the majority of studies, reducing sodium intake lowers the risk of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disorders.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;&lt;ref name=susic/&gt;

In a few studies, both high (more than 7 g/day) and low salt intake (less than 3 g/day) were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease&lt;ref name="mente_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mente Andrew | year = | title = Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events in individuals with and without hypertension: a pooled analysis of data from four studies | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30467-6/abstract | journal = The Lancet | volume =  388| issue = | pages =  465–75| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30467-6 |display-authors=etal | pmid=27216139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased mortality.&lt;ref name="graudal_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graudal N., Jürgens G., Baslund B., Alderman M.H. | year = | title = Compared with usual sodium intake, low- and excessive-sodium diets are associated with increased mortality: a meta-analysis | journal = Am.

== Sodium sensitivity ==

A diet high in sodium increases the risk of hypertension in people with sodium sensitivity, corresponding to an increase in health risks associated with hypertensions including cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morimoto |first1=A |last2=Uzu |first2=T |last3=Fujii |first3=T |last4=Nishimura |first4=M |last5=Kuroda |first5=S |last6=Nakamura |first6=S |last7=Inenaga |first7=T |last8=Kimura |first8=G |title=Sodium sensitivity and cardiovascular events in patients with essential hypertension |journal=The Lancet |volume=350 |pages=1734–7 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)05189-1 |issue=9093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there is no universal definition of sodium sensitivity; the method to assess sodium sensitivity varies from one study to another. In most studies, sodium sensitivity is defined as the change in mean blood pressure corresponding to a decrease or increase of sodium intake. The method to assess sodium sensitivity includes the measurement of circulating fluid volume and peripheral vascular resistance. Several studies have shown a relationship between sodium sensitivity and the increase of circulating fluid volume or peripheral vascular resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedler |first1=B |last2=Wiersbitzki |first2=M |last3=Gruska |first3=S |last4=Wolf |first4=E |last5=Luft |first5=FC |title=Definitions and characteristics of salt-sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure: should the diagnosis depend on diastolic blood pressure? |journal=Clinical and experimental hypertension.

A number of factors have been found to be associated with sodium sensitivity. Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race, gender, and age.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in humans |journal=Hypertension |volume=27 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=481–90 |year=1996 |pmid=8613190 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.27.3.481}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly more salt sensitive than Caucasians.&lt;ref name="Sebastian A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris Jr |first1=RC |last2=Sebastian |first2=A |last3=Forman |first3=A |last4=Tanaka |first4=M |last5=Schmidlin |first5=O |title=Normotensive salt sensitivity: effects of race and dietary potassium |journal=Hypertension |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=1999 |pmid=9931076 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.33.1.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are found to be more sodium sensitive than men; one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight, as women weigh less than men on average.&lt;ref name="Sebastian A 1999"/&gt; Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

The difference in genetic makeup and family history has a significant impact on salt sensitivity, and is being studied more with improvement on the efficiencies and techniques of genetic testing.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; In both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, those with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype are more likely to have sodium sensitivity than people with haptoglobin 2-1 or 2-2 phenotypes. More specifically, haptoglobin 2-2 phenotypes contribute to the characteristic of sodium-resistance in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |last2=Miller |first2=JZ |last3=Fineberg |first3=NS |last4=Luft |first4=FC |last5=Grim |first5=CE |last6=Christian |first6=JC |title=Association of haptoglobin with sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure |journal=Hypertension |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=443–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3653973 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.10.4.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, prevalence of a family history of hypertension is strongly linked with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.

The influence of physiological factors including renal function and insulin levels on sodium sensitivity are shown in various studies.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; One study concludes that the effect of renal failure on sodium sensitivity is substantial due to the contribution of decreasing the Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koomans, HA |last2=Roos |first2=JC |last3=Boer |first3=P |last4=Geyskes |first4=GG |last5=Mees |first5=EJ |pmid=7040224 |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in chronic renal failure.

== Potassium and hypertension ==

[[File:2009-07-22-salzverkostung-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Different salts contain different minerals contents]]

Possible mechanisms by which high intakes of dietary potassium can decrease risk of hypertension and instances of cardiovascular disease have been proposed but not extensively studied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7733391 |last1=Young |first1=DB |year=1995 |pages=R825–37 |issue=4 Pt 2 |last2=Lin |volume=268 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |first2=H |last3=McCabe |first3=RD |title=Potassium's cardiovascular protective mechanisms |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=7733391}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have found a strong inverse association between long-term adequate to high rates of potassium intake and the development of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The recommended dietary intake of potassium is higher than that of sodium.&lt;ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AW Caggiula |last2=Wing |first2=RR |last3=Nowalk |first3=MP |last4=Milas |first4=NC |last5=Lee |first5=S |last6=Langford |first6=H |title=The measurement of sodium and potassium intake |pmid=4036845 |date=1985-09-01 |pages=391–8 |issue=3 |volume=42 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4036845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the average absolute intake of potassium of studied populations is lower than that of sodium intake.&lt;ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985"/&gt; According to Statistics Canada, Canadians' potassium intake in all age groups are lower than recommended, while sodium intake greatly exceed recommended intake in every age group.&lt;ref&gt;2004 Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition.http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2006004/article/sodium/4148995-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that the ratio of potassium to sodium intake accounts for the large difference in the occurrence of hypertension between primitive cultures eating diets made up of mostly unprocessed foods and Western diets which tend to include highly processed foods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Salt substitutes==
{{Main article|Salt substitute}}

The growing awareness of excessive sodium consumption in connection with hypertension and cardiovascular disease has increased the usage of salt substitutes at both a consumer and industrial level.&lt;ref name="meat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desmond |first1=E |title=Reducing salt: A challenge for the meat industry |journal=Meat Science |volume=74 |pages=188–96 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.04.014 |pmid=22062728 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a consumer level, salt substitutes, which usually substitute a portion of sodium chloride content with [[potassium chloride]], can be used to increase the potassium to sodium consumption ratio.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; This change has been shown to blunt the effects of excess salt intake on hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=millen/&gt;&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; It has also been suggested that salt substitutes can be used to provide an essential portion of daily potassium intake, and may even be more economical than prescription potassium supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sopko |first1=J. A. |title=Salt substitutes as a source of potassium |journal=JAMA |volume=238 |pages=608–10 |year=1977 |doi=10.1001/jama.238.7.608 |issue=7 |pmid=577961 |last2=Freeman |first2=RM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the food industry, processes have been developed to create low-sodium versions of existing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sofos |first1=John N. |title=Influence of Sodium Tripolyphosphate on the Binding and Antimicrobial Properties of Reduced NaCl-Comminuted Meat Products |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=50 |pages=1379–83 |year=1985 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1985.tb10481.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A Engstrom |last2=Tobelmann |first2=RC |last3=Albertson |first3=AM |title=Sodium intake trends and food choices |pmid=9022569 |date=1997-02-01 |pages=704S–707S |issue=2 |volume=65 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9022569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[meat industry]] especially have developed and fine-tuned methods to decrease salt contents in processed meats without sacrificing consumer acceptance.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; Research demonstrates that salt substitutes such as potassium chloride, and synergistic compounds such as [[phosphates]], can be used to decrease salt content in meat products.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

There have been concerns with certain populations' use of potassium chloride as a substitute for salt as high potassium loads are dangerous for groups with [[diabetes]], [[Nephropathy|renal diseases]], or heart failure.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; The use of salts with minerals such as natural salts have also been tested, but like salt substitutes partially containing potassium, mineral salts produce a bitter taste above certain levels.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

A '''source document''' is a document in which data collected for a clinical trial is first recorded. This data is usually later entered in the [[Case Report Form|case report form]]. The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH-GCP) guidelines define source documents as "original documents, data, and records."&lt;ref name=ich&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline for good clinical practice. |page=7 |publisher=[[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|ICH-GCP]] |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source documents contain source data, which is defined as "all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial."&lt;ref name=ich/&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not define the term "source document".

'''The Leprosy Mission''' is an international [[Christian]] charity working towards the eradication of the causes and consequences of [[leprosy]].  It is active in over 50 countries around the world.

The Leprosy Mission is a member of [http://www.ilep.org.uk/ ILEP] (International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations) and [[Global Connections]], a network of mission and [[international development|development]] agencies.

==History==
In December 1869, [[Wellesley Bailey]], a young Irishman who was working as a teacher in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] in [[India]],&lt;ref name="ccf1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davey|first1=Cyril|title=Caring comes first : the story of the Leprosy Mission|date=1987|publisher=Marshall Pickering|location=Basingstoke|isbn=9780551014343}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} came across a row of huts inhabited by men and women with serious disabilities and physical deformities.  A colleague explained that they were suffering from leprosy.  Bailey was shocked by what he saw. Afterwards he wrote:'I almost shuddered, yet I was at the same time fascinated, and I felt that if there was ever a Christlike work in the world it was to go amongst these poor sufferers and bring them the consolation of the gospel.'&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|23}}

On returning to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1874, Wellesley Bailey and his wife Alice began to hold meetings in [[Dublin]] to tell friends about their experiences of people affected by leprosy in India, and to raise money'.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|27}}  And so The Leprosy Mission, or The Mission to Lepers as it was known then, was born.&lt;ref&gt;An Inn Called Welcome: The story of the Mission to Lepers 1874-1917, A. Donald Miller, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1874-1893''' – The Baileys travel extensively in India to see the need of people affected by leprosy and to encourage support work.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;

'''1891''' – Wellesley Bailey visits [[Mandalay]], [[Burma]], to open the first TLM home for leprosy-affected people outside India.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|43}}

'''1917''' – The Mission has extended its work throughout India and the [[Far East]] and now has 87 programmes in 12 countries, with support offices in eight countries.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|59}}

'''1940s''' – In South India, [[Paul Brand]] pioneers medical research and reconstructive surgery on leprosy deformities in hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Fingers for God, Dorothy Clarke Wilson, Hodder and Stoughton, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1940s-50s''' – The first effective cure for leprosy, [[Dapsone]], is introduced. Over the next 15 years, millions of patients are successfully treated.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|95}}

'''1950s''' – The Mission’s work is extended into [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|84}}

'''1954''' – [[World Leprosy Day]] is founded by Raoul Follereau, a French writer, to make sure that people everywhere know that leprosy still exists and is completely curable. It is usually held each year on the last Sunday in January.

'''1960s''' – Leprologists work to discover new drugs that are effective against leprosy as many people are discovered to have Dapsone-resistant leprosy.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;

'''1965''' – The Mission changes its name from 'The Mission to Lepers' to the Leprosy Mission to avoid the negative connotations of the word ‘leper.’&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|100}}

'''1970s''' – TLM begins to extend its work to people's homes and communities, rather than just hospitals and asylums.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|107}}

'''1980''' – [[Vincent Barry]] and his team win the 1980 [[UNESCO Science Prize]] for their discovery of anti-leprosy drug [[clofazimine]], developed with the assistance of The Leprosy Mission.

'''1981''' – [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends a new combination drug treatment for leprosy, [[leprosy#Treatment|MDT]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/lep/mdt/en/&lt;/ref&gt; (Multi Drug Therapy). People are cured in as little as six months.

'''1990s''' – As many more people are cured, caring for people with lasting disabilities through social, economic, and physical rehabilitation becomes increasingly important.

==Where The Leprosy Mission works==
TLM is a global network; the organisation works with governments, communities, local churches, partner health organisations, WHO, and other non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/abouttlm/mission.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502111321/http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/abouttlm/mission.html |archivedate=2009-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It runs leprosy projects and has staff in 28 countries in Africa, South Asia and East Asia Pacific.&lt;ref name="leprosymission.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113142357/http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large percentage of TLM's work is focused on [[TLMIndia|India]], where the prevalence of leprosy is still high.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/lep/situation/se_asia/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

Support offices, which raise funds for TLM's work and invest in the development of the field projects, operate in 26 countries, including Europe, the US, Canada,  Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="leprosymission.org"/&gt;

The international office is based in [[London]].

==What The Leprosy Mission does==
===Hospitals and healthcare===
The Leprosy Mission runs 14 hospitals in [[TLM India|India]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/south_asia/leprosy_india.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although these hospitals were initially established to care exclusively for people with leprosy, they have now been developed into community hospitals, providing a wide range of health care services.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is becoming more common for people who have leprosy to be treated on the same wards as those with general medical conditions. This helps to break down the [[leprosy stigma|stigma]] of leprosy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Historically, people have been very fearful of contracting leprosy, believing it to be highly [[infectious disease|contagious]] when this is not the case.&lt;ref name=ccf1987 /&gt;{{rp|175}}

'''Reconstructive surgery''': Leprosy attacks the [[nerves]], and if not treated quickly people can lose sensation in their hands and feet leading to injury and disability.&lt;ref&gt;The Gift of Pain, Dr Paul Brand and Philip Yancey, Zondervan, 1997, p90&lt;/ref&gt; The Leprosy Mission provides [[reconstructive surgery]] for leprosy-affected people,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/abouttlm/inaction.html&lt;/ref&gt; restoring movement to hands and feet. Dr [[Paul Brand]] pioneered tendon transfer surgery which is still used by TLM doctors today.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Fingers for God: The true story of a surgeon's quest for an end to the ravages of leprosy, Dorothy Clarke Wislon, Hodder and Stoughton, 1965, p103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and education===
Leprosy is found predominantly in [[developing countries]] and areas where [[poverty]] is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/lep/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Because leprosy can cause disability, and because stigma is so often attached to the disease, leprosy can make poor people poorer.

Along with essential healthcare, The Leprosy Mission provides training and education for leprosy-affected people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Children whose parents have leprosy, or who have had leprosy themselves, can benefit from school scholarship programmes. TLM pays for the child's schooling, allowing them to gain an education that they otherwise may have missed out on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

TLM has six [[vocational training]] centres in [[TLM India|India]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Here, teenagers and young adults can learn a skill like tailoring, car mechanics, or IT.

At other projects in Africa and other parts of [[Asia]], TLM provides skills training through workshops or one-to-one teaching to enable people to learn a trade&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/africa/leprosy_nigeria.html&lt;/ref&gt; with the hope that, in the long term, they will be better equipped to provide for themselves and their families.

===Disability care and prevention===
Once a leprosy-affected person has lost feeling in their limbs or hands or feet, holding a hot cup, stepping on a nail, or getting too close to a fire, can cause injuries they may not notice.  Then the wound may become [[infection|infected]] because [[bacteria]] get in.&lt;ref&gt;The Gift of Pain, Dr Paul Brand and Philip Yancey, Zondervan, 1997, p95&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of its projects, The Leprosy Mission teaches what's called 'self-care'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Physiotherapists]] and prevention of disability advisers are on-hand to demonstrate how washing, soaking and oiling skin daily can help prevent infection.  This process can also ensure that small cuts do not develop into larger, more difficult-to-treat, ulcers.

===Community development and income generation===

The Leprosy Mission provides [[microcredit]] loans to those leprosy-affected people in need of economic assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/africa/leprosy_drcongo.html&lt;/ref&gt; These loans enable people to set up a small business, such as small shops, animal breeding, tailoring or petty trading.

Low Cost Houses are a way of improving the living conditions of leprosy-affected people. The Leprosy Mission provides the materials.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The community, or a group of volunteers, provides the manpower to complete the building project. TLM often works with international charity [[Habitat for Humanity]] to develop housing projects such as these.

In some countries where TLM works, savings groups (or self-help groups) have been established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leprosymission.org/web/pages/worldwide/africa/leprosy_sudan.html&lt;/ref&gt; The members of these groups are encouraged to save a small amount of money each week. The money is then placed into a kitty. The kitty can then be used by the group as a whole - to set up a group business or a community project - or members can apply for an individual loan from the group.

===Advocacy===
Advocating for people's [[human rights]] is another aspect of The Leprosy Mission's work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When necessary, TLM will lobby governments in countries where there is any remaining anti-leprosy legislation, keeping up the pressure until the [[law]]s are repealed.

TLM educates people about leprosy, explaining that it's not highly contagious, that it's not a [[curse]] from the gods and that it can be cured. This is an effective way of reducing negative attitudes and encouraging greater acceptance of leprosy-affected people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

TLM also encourages leprosy-affected people to speak out for themselves and their rights.

==The Leprosy Mission England and Wales==
This is a regional office, based in [[Peterborough]]. It is part of TLM's global network, raising money and providing support to projects in many of the countries where TLM works.

===Campaigns===
In June 2015, The Leprosy Mission England and Wales launched their Feet First campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leprosymission.org.uk/get-involved/feet-first.aspx |title=Feet First |publisher=The Leprosy Mission England and Wales |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By encouraging members of the British public to take on the Barefoot Challenge and go about their lives barefoot for one day, the charity aimed to transform the lives of some of the world's poorest and most marginalised people in [[Mozambique]]. Those that took on the challenge were encouraged to share their photos on social media and nominate three friends to also take part. All funds raised during the challenge up until 31 August 2015 were doubled by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dial2donate.org/go-barefoot-for-leprosy/ |title=Go barefoot for leprosy |publisher=Dial2Donate |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Leprosy Mission Northern Ireland==
TLM Northern Ireland's office is based in Lisburn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tlm-ni.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of TLM's support here comes from local churches.

==The Leprosy Mission Scotland==
TLM Scotland's offices are based in Stirling. The organisation is led by CEO Linda Todd, and staffed by a combination of paid staff and volunteers. This regional office raises funds for many TLM projects around the world, and raises awareness of leprosy and TLM's work in Scotland.

TLMS support seven of TLM International's implementing countries on their work. These countries are Nigeria, South Sudan, Angola, Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tlmscotland.org.uk/country/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Leprosy Mission Scotland seeks to educate, inspire and enable people, their churches, schools, community groups and governmental bodies, to uphold and support people affected by leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tlmscotland.org.uk/index.php#sthash.OIJMFjpY.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

==effect:hope (The Leprosy Mission Canada)==
effect:hope's office is based in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], near [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. This office operates in partnership with The Leprosy Mission International but is independent. Its programmes serve people living with [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]] like leprosy, Buruli ulcer, and Lymphatic Filariasis. Programme countries include [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Kenya]], [[DR Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Liberia]], [[Nepal]], and [[Nigeria]]. Also, effect:hope raises awareness of leprosy and other disease of poverty in Canada and educates Canadians about [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]]. effect:hope also has a special program for churches to participate in [[World Leprosy Day]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leprosy.ca/worldleprosyday&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;effecthope.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==TLM Trading==
This is TLM's trading arm, sourcing and selling many goods made by leprosy-affected or disability-affected people.

==The Leprosy Mission Trust India==
The Leprosy Mission was founded in 1874 as ‘The Mission to Lepers’ by [[Wellesley Bailey]], in Ambala, [[India]]. Subsequently in 1973, The Leprosy Mission Trust India (TLMTI) was registered as a Society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. TLMTI is the largest leprosy-focused non-governmental organisation in India and is headquartered in New Delhi, India. The organisation works with people affected by leprosy and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), people with disabilities, and marginalised communities, especially women.

TLMTI has a diverse set of programmes – Healthcare, Sustainable Livelihood, Community Empowerment, Advocacy, and Research and Training. These programmes are implemented through 14 hospitals, six vocational training centres, five residential facilities for the care of elderly persons affected by leprosy and having leprosy-related disabilities, eight community development projects, a molecular biology research laboratory, advocacy and communication, and research and training functions, spread across 10 states of India.

'''Transient synovitis of the hip''' (also called '''toxic synovitis'''; see below for more synonyms) is a [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting condition]] in which there is an [[inflammation]] of the inner lining (the [[synovium]]) of the [[joint capsule|capsule]] of the [[hip joint]]. The term '''irritable hip''' refers to the [[syndrome]] of acute [[hip pain]], joint stiffness, limp or non-weightbearing, indicative of an underlying condition such as transient synovitis or orthopedic infections (like [[septic arthritis]] or [[osteomyelitis]]).&lt;ref name="limpchild"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer SU, Beattie TF |title=The limping child: epidemiology, assessment and outcome |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1029–34 |date=Nov 1999 |pmid=10615981 |doi= 10.1302/0301-620X.81B6.9607|url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10615981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In everyday clinical practice however, irritable hip is commonly used as a synonym for transient synovitis.  It should not be confused with [[sciatica]], a condition describing hip and lower back pain much more common to adults than transient synovitis but with similar signs and symptoms.

Transient synovitis usually affects children between three and ten years old (but it has been reported in a 3-month-old infant and in some adults&lt;ref name="adult"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quintos-Macasa AM, Serebro L, Menon Y |title=Transient synovitis of the hip in an adult |journal=South Med J |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=184–5 |date=Feb 2006 |pmid=16509560 |doi= 10.1097/01.smj.0000199746.29009.4c|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&amp;volume=99&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

General Practice Notebook. Retrieved December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact cause is [[idiopathic|unknown]]. A recent [[viral infection]] (most commonly an [[upper respiratory tract infection]]) or a trauma have been postulated as precipitating events, although these are reported only in 30% and 5% of cases, respectively.&lt;ref name=GPNotebook/&gt;

Transient synovitis is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]].&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; The diagnosis can be made in the typical setting of pain or limp in a young child who is not generally unwell and has no recent [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. There is a limited [[range of motion]] of the hip joint. Blood tests may show mild inflammation. An [[ultrasound scan]] of the hip joint can show a fluid collection ([[effusion]]). Treatment is with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and limited weight-bearing. The condition usually clears by itself within seven to ten days,&lt;ref name="fpnotebook"/&gt; but a small group of patients will continue to have symptoms for several weeks. The recurrence rate is 4–17%, most of which is in the first six months.&lt;ref name=eMedicine&gt;{{eMedicine|ped|1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms and signs==
Transient synovitis causes pain in the hip, [[thigh]], [[groin]] or [[knee]] on the affected side.&lt;ref name=fpnotebook/&gt; There may be a [[limp]] (or abnormal [[Crawling (human)|crawling]] in infants) with or without pain. In small infants, the [[presenting complaint]] can be unexplained crying (for example, when changing a [[diaper]]). The condition is nearly always limited to one side.&lt;ref name=fpnotebook/&gt; The pain and limp can range from mild to severe.

Some children may have a slightly raised temperature; high [[fever]] and general [[malaise]] point to other, more serious conditions. On [[clinical examination]], the child typically holds the hip slightly bent, turned outwards and away from the middle line ([[flexion]], [[external rotation]] and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]]).&lt;ref name="GPNotebook"/&gt; Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and [[internal rotation]]. The hip can be tender to [[palpation]]. The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found to be normal.&lt;ref name=eMedicine/&gt;
===Complications===
In the past, there have been speculations about possible complications after transient synovitis. The current consensus however is that there is no proof of an increased risk of complications after transient synovitis.&lt;ref name="follow-up"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattick A, Turner A, Ferguson J, Beattie T, Sharp J |title=Seven year follow up of children presenting to the accident and emergency department with irritable hip |journal=J Accid Emerg Med |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=345–7 |date=Sep 1999 |pmid=10505915 |pmc=1347055 |doi= 10.1136/emj.16.5.345|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such previously suspected complication was [[coxa magna]], which is an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to subluxation of the femur.&lt;ref name=eMedicine/&gt;&lt;ref name=coxa&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharwood PF |title=The irritable hip syndrome in children. A long-term follow-up |journal=Acta Orthop Scand |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=633–8 |date=Dec 1981 |pmid=7331801 |doi=10.3109/17453678108992159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient synovitis could cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head ([[Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease]]), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.&lt;ref name=Perthes&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kallio P, Ryöppy S, Kunnamo I |title=Transient synovitis and Perthes' disease. Is there an aetiological connection? |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=808–11 |date=Nov 1986 |pmid=3782251 |doi= |url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3782251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
There are no set standards for the diagnosis of suspected transient synovitis, so the amount of investigations will depend on the need to exclude other, more serious diseases.

Inflammatory parameters in the blood may be slightly raised (these include [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], [[C-reactive protein]] and [[white blood cell count]]), but raised inflammatory markers are strong predictors of other more serious conditions such as septic arthritis.&lt;ref name="Septic2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kocher2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kocher MS, Mandiga R, Zurakowski D, Barnewolt C, Kasser JR |title=Validation of a clinical prediction rule for the differentiation between septic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in children |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=86-A |issue=8 |pages=1629–35 |date=Aug 2004 |pmid=15292409 |doi= |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15292409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[X-ray]] imaging of the hip is most often unremarkable. Subtle radiographic signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, widening of the [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] joint space, lateral displacement of the femoral epiphyses with surface flattening ([[Waldenström sign]]), prominent [[Internal obturator muscle|obturator]] shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for radiographic examination is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, [[slipped upper femoral epiphysis]] or bone tumours (such as [[osteoid osteoma]]). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.&lt;ref name=BMJ2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gough-Palmer A, McHugh K |title=Investigating hip pain in a well child |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7605 |pages=1216–7 |date=Jun 2007 |pmid=17556478 |pmc=1892599 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39188.515741.47 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ultrasound scan]] of the hip can easily demonstrate fluid inside the joint capsule ([[Fabella sign]]), although this is not always present in transient synovitis.&lt;ref name=GPNotebook/&gt;&lt;ref name=BestBETs&gt;Nicola Wright, Vince Choudhery.

===Differential diagnosis===
Pain in or around the hip and/or limp in children can be due to a large number of conditions. [[Septic arthritis]] (a bacterial infection of the joint) is the most important [[differential diagnosis]], because it can quickly cause irreversible damage to the hip joint.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; Fever, raised inflammatory markers on [[blood test]]s and severe symptoms (inability to bear weight, pronounced muscle guarding) all point to septic arthritis,&lt;ref name=Septic2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caird MS, Flynn JM, Leung YL, Millman JE, D'Italia JG, Dormans JP |title=Factors distinguishing septic arthritis from transient synovitis of the hip in children. A prospective study |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=1251–7 |date=Jun 2006 |pmid=16757758 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.E.00216 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kocher2004/&gt; but a high index of suspicion remains necessary even if these are not present.&lt;ref name=fpnotebook/&gt; [[Osteomyelitis]] (infection of the bone tissue) can also cause pain and limp.

[[Bone fracture]]s, such as a [[toddler's fracture]] (spiral fracture of the [[tibia|shin bone]]), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. [[Soft tissue]] [[injury|injuries]] can be evident when [[bruises]] are present. [[Muscle]] or [[ligament]] injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, it is important not to miss a [[slipped upper femoral epiphysis]]. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head ([[Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease]]) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.&lt;ref name=LCP&gt;{{eMedicine|radio|387|Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurological]] conditions can also present with a limp. If [[Hip dysplasia (human)|developmental dysplasia of the hip]] is missed early in life, it can come to attention later in this way. Pain in the groin can also be caused by diseases of the organs in the [[abdomen]] (such as a [[psoas abscess]]) or by [[testicle|testicular]] disease. Rarely, there is an underlying [[rheumatology|rheumatic]] condition ([[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], [[Lyme disease|Lyme arthritis]], [[Septic arthritis|gonococcal arthritis]], ...) or [[bone tumour]].

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of rest, non-weightbearing and [[painkillers]] when needed. A small study showed that the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] [[ibuprofen]] could shorten the disease course (from 4.5 to 2 days) and provide pain control with minimal side effects (mainly [[gastrointestinal disturbance]]s).&lt;ref name=Kermond2002&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermond S, Fink M, Graham K, Carlin JB, Barnett P |title=A randomized clinical trial: should the child with transient synovitis of the hip be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=294–9 |date=Sep 2002 |pmid=12192353 |doi= 10.1067/mem.2002.126171|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196064402000422}}&lt;/ref&gt; If fever occurs or the symptoms persist, other diagnoses need to be considered.&lt;ref name=eMedicine/&gt;

[[File:Fluzone.jpg|thumb|Influenza Vaccine]]'''Vaccine efficacy''' is the percentage reduction of disease in a vaccinated group of people compared to an unvaccinated group, using the most favorable conditions. Vaccine efficacy was designed and calculated by Greenwood and Yule in 1915 for the cholera and typhoid [[vaccine]]s. It is best measured using [[blind experiment|double- blind]], randomized, clinical controlled trials, such that it is studied under “best case scenarios.” &lt;ref name="wienburg"&gt;(Weinburg, G., &amp; Szilagyi, P. (2010). Vaccine Epidemiology: Efficacy, Effectiveness, and the Translational Research Roadmap. Journal of Infectious Diseases, 201(11), 1607-1610.)&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccine effectiveness differs from vaccine efficacy in that vaccine effectiveness shows how well a vaccine works when they are always used and in a bigger population whereas vaccine efficacy shows how well a vaccine works in certain, often controlled, conditions. Vaccine efficacy studies are used to measure several possible outcomes such as disease attack rates, hospitalizations, medical visits, and costs.

==Vaccine Efficacy Formula==
The outcome data (vaccine efficacy) generally are expressed as a proportionate reduction in disease attack rate (AR) between the unvaccinated (ARU) and vaccinated (ARV) studies can be calculated from the relative risk (RR) of disease among the vaccinated group with use of the following formulas.
The basic formula&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1985/Vol63-No6/bulletin_1985_63%286%29_1055-1068.pdf Orenstein WA, Bernier RH, Dondero TJ, Hinman AR, Marks JS, Bart KJ, et al. Field evaluation of vaccine efficacy]. ''Bull World Health Organ'' 1985;63(6):1055-68 {{PMID|3879673}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is written as:&lt;math display="block"&gt;VE = \frac{ARU - ARV}{ARU} \quad(\times 100),&lt;/math&gt;with
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;VE&lt;/math&gt; = Vaccine efficacy,
* &lt;math&gt;ARU&lt;/math&gt; = Attack rate of unvaccinated people,
* &lt;math&gt;ARV&lt;/math&gt; = Attack rate of vaccinated people.
An alternative, equivalent formulation of vaccine efficacy &lt;math display="block"&gt;VE = 1 - RR,&lt;/math&gt;where  &lt;math&gt;RR&lt;/math&gt; is the relative risk of developing the disease for vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people.

==How it's tested==
Vaccine efficacy differs from [[Vaccine#Effectiveness|vaccine effectiveness]] in the same way that an [[Randomized controlled trial#By hypothesis (superiority vs. noninferiority vs. equivalence)|explanatory clinical trial differs from an intention to treat trial]]: vaccine efficacy shows how effective the vaccine could be given ideal circumstances and 100% vaccine uptake; vaccine effectiveness measures how well a vaccine performs when it is used in routine circumstances in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectivenessqa.htm#studies-differ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). Flu Vaccine Effectiveness: Questions and Answers for Health Professionals. How do vaccine effectiveness studies differ from vaccine efficacy studies? 2011. Last updated: October 12, 2011. Last viewed: December 15, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since vaccine efficacy is based on a population that are placed in certain controlled environment, this study becomes more effective. If the criteria changed, such as if it was based on a larger population that wasn’t as restricted and in a more [[natural environment]], that would be the vaccines effectiveness. What makes the vaccine efficacy applicable is that it also shows the [[Attack rate|disease attack rates]] as well as a tracking of vaccination status. Vaccine effectiveness is a lot more easily tracked than the vaccine efficacy considering the difference in environment; however, the vaccine efficacy is more expensive and very difficult to conduct. Because the trial is based on people who are taking the vaccination and people who aren’t, there is a risk for disease, and optimal treatment is needed for those who become infected. 
The advantages of a vaccine efficacy have control for all biases that would be found with randomization, as well as prospective, active monitoring for disease attack rates, and careful tracking of vaccination status for a study population there is normally a subset as well, laboratory confirmation of the infectious outcome of interest and a sampling of vaccine immunogenicity. The major disadvantages of vaccine efficacy trials are the complexity and expense of performing them, especially for relatively uncommon infectious outcomes of diseases for which the sample size required is driven up to achieve clinically useful statistical power.

==Risks To Be Considered==
Vaccine efficacy is calculated on a population basis.  It is therefore relatively easy to misunderstand its application.

==Cases Studied==
The NEJM did a study on the  A flu efficacy Influenza virus. A total of 1952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007.  Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008, with the circulation of influenza types:
* A (H3N2) (about 90%)
* B (about 9%). 
Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza, as measured by isolating the virus in culture, identifying it on real-time [[polymerase chain reaction|polymerase-chain-reaction]] assay, or both, was 68 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 46 to 81) for the [[inactivated vaccine]] and 36 percent (95 percent CI, 0 to 59) for the live attenuated vaccine. In terms of relative efficacy, there was a 50 percent (95 percent CI, 20 to 69) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza among subjects who received inactivated vaccine as compared with those given live attenuated vaccine. subjects were placed in a healthy adult population. The efficacy against the influenza A virus was 72 percent and for the inactivated was 29 percent with a relative efficacy of 60 percent. The [[influenza vaccine]] is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is as close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.&lt;ref name="Crislip"&gt;(Crislip, M. (2009, October 9). Flu Vaccine Efficacy. Retrieved from http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/flu-vaccine-efficacy)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been drifting in:
2058 people were vaccinated in October and November 2005. Influenza activity was prolonged but of low intensity; type A (H3N2) was the virus that was generally going around the population, which was very alike to the vaccine itself . The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], -171% to 70%) for the virus identification end point (virus isolation in cell culture or identification through polymerase chain reaction) and 54% (95% CI, 4%-77%) for the primary end point (virus isolation or increase in serum antibody titer). The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine for these end points were 8% (95% CI, -194% to 67%) and 43% (95% CI, -15% to 71%).&lt;ref name="Crislip"/&gt;

==Conclusions==
With serologic end points included, efficacy was demonstrated for the inactivated vaccine in a year with low influenza attack rates. Influenza vaccines are effective in reducing cases of influenza, especially when the content predicts accurately circulating types and circulation is high. However, they are less effective in reducing cases of influenza-like illness and have a modest impact on working days lost. There is insufficient evidence to assess their impact on complications.

'''Victoria''' is an articulated 3D female figure developed and sold by [[DAZ 3D]]. There have been several "generations" of the figure, all bearing the same name.

The figure was originally created as one of two standard characters which also included the male character "Michael" ("Stephanie" being a full body female morph of Michael).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=D.|title=Intelligent Design|journal=Video Systems|date=1 February 2006|page=52|issn=0361-0942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being poseable, using preset morph dials the figure can be manipulated into a variety of different aesthetic and ethnic female forms.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oberbeck|first=Steven|title=Draper company gives boost to animators; DAZ program a boon to digital animators; Draper company's program aids animator|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=3 April 2005|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure comes pre-rigged with standardized features, and earlier versions can be exported to a variety of 3D modeling/animation applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Jeffrey|title=Game Developers Conference 2008 Product Roundup|journal=Game Developer|date=1 April 2008|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Victoria 1 was released by then-Zygote in February 1999 and was the first named medium-resolution figure for use with [[Poser]]. She was originally released as 'The Millennium Woman', but the resulting colloquial shortening to "Millie"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocs.com/poser/terms.htm |title=Terms &amp; Definitions |last=Hoagland |first=John |website=JCH Digital Designs |access-date=16 June 2017 |quote=Also called "Millenium Woman" or "Millie", this new Poser female model was developed by Zygote, Inc. and then further developed (and sold) by DAZ Studios.}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to Zygote renaming her as Victoria.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Zygote also sold an anime-morphed character for Victoria named Aiko,{{Disputed inline|Aiko morph|date=May 2018}} and each successive generation of Victoria has so far had an accompanying Aiko (whose facial morphs can vary between anime and a less exaggerated Asian).

Victoria 2 was the next step in the figure development, refining the rigging and coming with as a reduced polygon version. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Released in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://docs.daz3d.com/doku.php/public/read_me/index/83/start | title =Victoria 2.0 | publisher = [[DAZ 3D]] | access-date = 9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; V2 contained more body shaping features and a wider range of facial expressions but was rigged to be compatible with V1's clothing and accessories. From this point forward, the Stephanie character (following the Generation numbering) was no longer a remorphed Michael but a character based on (and requiring) Victoria.{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Original research: Stephanie 3 was still a standalone figure, Stephanie 4 requires Victoria 4, later versions of Stephanie require the matching version of Genesis.--&gt; Victoria 2's eyebrows were separately transmapped objects.

Victoria 3, released in 2002 yet again raised the poly count and resculpted the face, leaving out transmapped eyebrows in favor of painting them directly onto the face texture, but was no longer backwards compatible to Victoria 2's rigging, textures or clothing. This generation was the first to have both the male and female figures be modeled from the same base "unimesh," allowing Victoria 3 and Michael 3 to easily share poses, texture maps and even morph targets. This was also the first figure for which neither Victoria nor Michael had genitals modeled on the body mesh; V3 provided a fine enough poly count in the region to make it possible for third party morphers to design their own while Michael 3's genitals were a parented prop (which continued with the next generation). This figure has an even higher density of polygons (74,510 polygons compare to 28,989 polys for V1 and V2 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria 3.0 Base|publisher=DAZ 3D|url=http://www.daz3d.com/i/shop/itemdetails/?item=1098 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114113637/http://www.daz3d.com/i/shop/itemdetails/?item=1098 |archivedate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with improvement in rigging over the previous millennium figures.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Victoria 3 was the first of [[DAZ 3D]] figures to support morph injection poses, which allowed users to apply morphs from the Pose Library rather than manually selecting body parts and loading morph target files. Victoria 3's eyebrows were not transmapped but textures painted onto the face texture.

The fourth and final standalone generation of Victoria was released in late 2006, which included a new body shape and added several technical improvements to the figure.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} As with V3, V4's proportions and rigging were not designed to be backwards compatible. The mesh for Victoria 4.0 was developed using Luxology's [[modo (software)|modo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Releases: Industry’s Leading Developers of Pre-Built 3D Content Flock to modo|publisher=Luxology LLC|url=http://www.luxology.com/press/release/022107_Lux_3dmodel_makers.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320212731/http://www.luxology.com/press/release/022107_Lux_3dmodel_makers.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 March 2007|accessdate=6 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporting an almost mannequin-like appearance, Victoria 4's head nevertheless contains enough polys to make photorealistic, real-person likenesses possible.

Version 4.1 was released in April 2007 and included a separate rigged eyeBrow prop and improved on the capability to load multiple sets of morphs into the character without causing conflicts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://docs.daz3d.com/doku.php/artzone/pub/faq/content/victoria_4/start | title =FAQ : Victoria 4.1 | publisher = [[DAZ 3D]] | access-date = 9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 4.2 was released in February 2008 which added a set of built-in male morphs and further technical improvements.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As Stephanie and Aiko had been characters for Victoria's base figure, Victoria 5 was released near the end of 2011 as a character for DAZ Studio's Genesis Female rather than a standalone figure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiki.daz3d.com/doku.php/public/read_me/index/13439/start | title =Victoria 5 | publisher = [[DAZ 3D]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was not initially compatible with Poser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.smithmicro.com/2011/08/11/poser-3d/support-for-3rd-party-character-systems-in-poser/ | title =Support for 3rd party character systems in Poser | publisher =[[Smith_Micro_Software|Smith Micro]] |date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria 5 is rigged to support V4's texture maps and DAZ Studio's cloth fitting allows her to wear Victoria 4's clothing, but due to having a different mesh she cannot use the same morph targets as Victoria 4. During the beta testing phases of [[DAZ Studio]] 4, there was released information briefly regarding the preparation of Victoria 5 as a part of Genesis.

The '''Walkers are Welcome''' scheme is a community-led initiative operating in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The scheme promotes towns and communities as 'walker-friendly', based on a number of criteria, aiming to benefit local economies by attracting tourism.

==Overview==
The scheme was first proposed in Summer 2006 by a local walkers group in the [[Yorkshire]] town of [[Hebden Bridge]] and formerly launched on 18 February 2007. Since then, it has expanded rapidly and more than ninety towns and villages have been granted Walkers are Welcome status.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Walkers are Welcome Towns Network claims that the scheme helps strengthen a town’s reputation as a destination for visitors, and also brings benefits to the local economy, encouraging the towns to view walkers as "economic assets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Walkers are Welcome logo is widely used in towns with the status.  [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] versions of the logo are in use in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Cornwall]].

==Organisation==
The scheme is run by the towns and villages themselves, who are all members of the Walkers are Welcome Towns Network.  The Network operates through a committee that meets every six to eight weeks as well as an annual conference.

The scheme is different from most official accreditation schemes in being managed through [[peer review]], rather than through a top-down agency.  Direct community engagement is considered essential to the scheme’s success.

The current patron is the [[Ramblers|Ramblers Association]] vice-president Kate Ashbrook.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives and criteria for inclusion==
The main aim of the campaign is to get towns to be more supportive of hikers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = 5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towns and villages wishing to receive Walkers are Welcome status are required to meet six criteria.  These are:
* Demonstration of popular local support for the concept.
* Formal endorsement by local council.
* Action to maintain facilities for walkers in good condition.
* Adequate marketing of the Walkers are Welcome status.
* Encouragement of use of public transport.
* Procedures in place to demonstrate sustainability of local interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17261">{{short description|Planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources}}
'''Water resource management''' is the activity of planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of [[water resources]]. It is a sub-set of [[water cycle management]]. Ideally, water resource management planning has regard to all the competing demands for [[water]] and seeks to allocate water on an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands. As with other [[resource management]], this is rarely possible in practice.

==Overview==
[[Image:Earth water distribution.svg|thumb|290px| Visualisation of the distribution (by volume) of water on Earth. Each tiny cube (such as the one representing biological water) corresponds to approximately {{convert|1000|km3}} of water, with a mass of approximately [[orders of magnitude (mass)#1012 to 1017 kg|1 trillion tonnes]] (2000 times that of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] or 5 times that of [[Lake Kariba]], arguably the heaviest man-made object). The entire block comprises 1 million tiny cubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html USGS - Earth's water distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Water is an essential resource for all life on the planet. Of the water resources on [[Earth]] only three percent of it is fresh and two-thirds of the [[freshwater]] is locked up in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s. Of the remaining one percent, a fifth is in remote, inaccessible areas and much seasonal rainfall in [[monsoon]]al deluges and floods cannot easily be used. As time advances, water is becoming scarcer and having access to clean, safe, [[drinking water]] is limited among countries. At present only about 0.08 percent of all the world’s fresh water&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Carolyn [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Impact-Climate-Change-Challenge-Twenty-first/dp/1847731163 The Impact of Climate Change: The World's Greatest Challenge in the Twenty-first Century] 2008, New Holland Publishers Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;  is exploited by mankind in ever increasing demand for [[sewage treatment|sanitation]], [[drinking water|drinking]], [[manufacturing]], [[water sports|leisure]] and [[agriculture]]. Due to the small percentage of water remaining, optimizing the fresh water we have left from [[natural resources]] has been a continuous difficulty in several locations worldwide.

Much effort in water resource management is directed at optimizing the [[water use|use of water]] and in minimizing the [[environmental impact]] of water use on the natural environment. The observation of water as an integral part of the [[ecosystem]] is based on integrated water resource management, where the quantity and quality of the ecosystem help to determine the nature of the natural resources.

As a limited resource, water supply sometimes supposes a challenge. This fact is assumed by the project [http://desafioglobal.org/ DESAFIO] (the acronym for ''Democratisation of Water and Sanitation Governance by Means of Socio-Technical Innovations''), which has been developed along 30 months and funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration. This project faced a difficult task for developing areas: eliminating structural social inequity in the access to indispensable water and public health services. The [http://desafioglobal.org/ DESAFIO] engineers worked on a water treatment system run with solar power and filters which provides safe water to a very poor community in the state of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00466|title=Extend access to water with the help of technology. [Social Impact]. DESAFIO. Democratization of Water and Sanitation Governance by Means of Socio-Technical Innovation (2013-2015). Framework Programme 7 (FP7).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful management of any resources requires accurate knowledge of the resource available, the uses to which it may be put, the competing demands for the resource, measures to and processes to evaluate the significance and worth of competing demands and mechanisms to translate policy decisions into actions on the ground.
 
For water as a resource, this is particularly difficult since sources of water can cross many national boundaries and the uses of water include many that are difficult to assign [[Commodification of nature|financial value]] to and may also be difficult to manage in conventional terms. Examples include rare species or ecosystems or the very long term value of ancient [[groundwater]] reserves.

==Agriculture==
[[Agriculture]] is the largest user of the world's freshwater resources, consuming 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Q. R., &amp; Hussey, K. (2011). Water Resources . New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[world population]] rises it consumes more food (currently exceeding 6%, it is expected to reach 9% by 2050), the industries and [[urban development]]s expand, and the emerging [[biofuel]] crops trade also demands a share of freshwater resources, [[water scarcity]] is becoming an important issue. An assessment of water resource management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the [[International Water Management Institute]] in [[Sri Lanka]] to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population or not .&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life is A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all their demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water.

The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's [[food production]] and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. Regarding food production, the [[World Bank]] targets agricultural food production and water resource management as an increasingly [[global issue]] that is fostering an important and growing debate.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2006 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options |title=Reengaging in Agricultural Water Management: Challenges and Options |accessdate=2011-10-30|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the book ''Out of Water: From abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems'', which laid down a six-point plan for solving the world's water problems. These are: 1) Improve data related to water; 2) Treasure the environment; 3) Reform [[water governance]]; 4) Revitalize agricultural water use; 5) Manage urban and industrial demand; and 6) Empower the poor and women in water resource management. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase [[agricultural productivity|productivity]] to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing water in urban settings==
As the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth increases greatly due to technological advances, [[urbanization]] in modern times occurs because of economic opportunity. This rapid urbanization happens worldwide but mostly in new rising economies and [[developing countries]]. Cities in Africa and Asia are growing fastest with 28 out of 39 [[megacities]] (a city or urban area with more than 10 million inhabitants) worldwide in these developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.global-economic-symposium.org/knowledgebase/knowledgebase?search-for-keywords-category.detailed:record:str=True&amp;search-for-keywords-category.index:record:str=portal_type&amp;search-for-keywords-category|publisher=Global Economic Symposium|title=GES knowledgebase|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of megacities will continue to rise reaching approximately 50 in 2025. With [[developing economies]] [[water scarcity]] is a very common and very prevalent issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Escolero, O., Kralisch, S., Martínez, S.E., Perevochtchikova, M.,|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427|doi=10.18268/bsgm2016v68n3a3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global freshwater resources dwindle in the eastern hemisphere either than at the poles, and with the majority of urban development millions live with insufficient fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=K.W.F|title=Intensive Use of Groundwater:: Challenges and Opportunities|year=2003|publisher=A.A. Balkema Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by [[water pollution|polluted]] freshwater resources, [[overexploitation|overexploited]] [[groundwater]] resources, insufficient harvesting capacities in the surrounding rural areas, poorly constructed and maintained water supply systems, high amount of informal water use and insufficient technical and water management capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mund|first=Jan-Peter|title=Capacities for Megacities coping with water scarcity|url=http://www.worldwaterweek.org/documents/WWW_PDF/2010/tuesday/T5/mund_Capacities_for_Megacities.pdf|publisher=UN-Water Decade Programme on Capacity Development|accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the areas surrounding urban centres, [[agriculture]] must compete with industry and municipal users for safe [[water supplies]], while traditional water sources are becoming [[water pollution|polluted]] with [[urban runoff]]. As cities offer the best opportunities for selling produce, farmers often have no alternative to using polluted water to [[irrigate]] their crops. Depending on how developed a city’s [[wastewater treatment]] is, there can be significant health hazards related to the use of this water. Wastewater from cities can contain a mixture of pollutants. There is usually wastewater from kitchens and toilets along with [[rainwater runoff]]. This means that the water usually contains excessive levels of nutrients and salts, as well as a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. [[Heavy metals|Heavy metal]]s may also be present, along with traces of [[antibiotics]] and [[endocrine disruptor]]s, such as oestrogens.

Developing world countries tend to have the lowest levels of wastewater treatment. Often, the water that farmers use for irrigating crops is contaminated with pathogens from [[sewage]]. The pathogens of most concern are bacteria, viruses and [[parasitic worms]], which directly affect farmers’ health and indirectly affect consumers if they eat the contaminated crops. Common illnesses include [[diarrhoea]], which kills 1.1 million people annually and is the second most common cause of [[infant death]]s. Many [[cholera]] outbreaks are also related to the reuse of poorly treated wastewater. Actions that reduce or remove contamination, therefore, have the potential to save a large number of lives and improve livelihoods. Scientists have been working to find ways to reduce contamination of food using a method called the 'multiple-barrier approach'.

This involves analysing the food production process from growing crops to selling them in markets and eating them, then considering where it might be possible to create a barrier against contamination. Barriers include: introducing safer irrigation practices; promoting on-farm wastewater treatment; taking actions that cause pathogens to die off; and effectively washing crops after harvest in markets and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Ilic, S., Drechsel, P., Amoah, P. and LeJeune, J. [http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-151781-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html Chapter 12, Applying the Multiple-Barrier Approach for Microbial Risk Reduction in the Post-Harvest Sector of Wastewater-Irrigated Vegetables]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Decision Support System (UDSS) ===
Urban [[Decision support system|Decision Support System]] (UDSS)  – is a wireless device with a mobile app that uses sensors attached to water appliances in urban residences to collect data about water usage and is an example of [[data-driven urban water management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggimann|first1=Sven|last2=Mutzner|first2=Lena|last3=Wani|first3=Omar|last4=Mariane Yvonne|first4=Schneider|last5=Spuhler|first5=Dorothee|last6=Beutler|first6=Philipp|last7=Maurer|first7=Max|title=The potential of knowing more – a review of data-driven urban water management|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2017|volume=51|issue=5|pages=2538–2553|doi=10.1021/acs.est.6b04267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed with a European Commission investment of 2.46 Million Euros&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://issewatus.eu|title=Integrated Support System for Efficient Water Usage and Resources Management|website=issewatus.eu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the water consumption behaviour of households. Information about every mechanism – dishwashers, showers, washing machines, taps – is wirelessly recorded and sent to the UDSS App on the user’s mobile device. The UDSS is then able to analyse and show homeowners which of their appliances are using the most water, and which behaviour or habits of the households are not encouraged in order to reduce the water usage, rather than simply giving a total usage figure for the whole property, which will allow people to manage their consumption more economically. The UDSS is based on university research in the field of [[Management science|Management Science]], at [[Loughborough University]] School of Business and Economics, particularly Decision Support System in household water benchmarking, led by [http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/sbe/staff/profiles/yanglili/yang-lili.html Dr Lili Yang], (Reader)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiaomin|last2=Yang|first2=Shuang-Hua|last3=Yang|first3=Lili|last4=Chen|first4=Xi|date=2015-01-01|title=A Benchmarking Model for Household Water Consumption Based on Adaptive Logic Networks|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705815026685|journal=Procedia Engineering|series=Computing and Control for the Water Industry (CCWI2015) Sharing the best practice in water management|volume=119|pages=1391–1398|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of water resources==
One of the biggest concerns for our water-based resources in the future is the sustainability of the current and even future water resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsly, N., &amp; Pearce, G. (2010). Towards Sustainable Water Resources Management: Bringing the Strategic Approach up-to-date. Irrigation &amp; Drainage Systems, 24(3/4), 191-203.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[water scarcity|water becomes more scarce]], the importance of how it is managed grows vastly. Finding a balance between what is needed by humans and what is needed in the environment is an important step in the sustainability of water resources. Attempts to create sustainable freshwater systems have been seen on a national level in countries such as [[Australia]], and such commitment to the environment could set a model for the rest of the world.

The field of water resources management will have to continue to adapt to the current and future issues facing the allocation of water. With the growing uncertainties of global [[climate change]] and the long term impacts of management actions,the decision-making will be even more difficult. It is likely that ongoing climate change will lead to situations that have not been encountered. As a result, alternative management strategies are sought for in order to avoid setbacks in the allocation of water resources.

The '''World Conference on Women, 1980''' or the '''Second World Conference on Women''' took place between 14 and 30 July 1980 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark as the mid-decade assessment of progress and failure in implementing the goals established by the [[World Plan of Action]] at the 1975 inaugural conference on women. The most significant event to come out of the conference was that the formal signing of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] took place during the opening ceremony of the conference. Marred by conflict and politicization of international and national events which had little to do with women's issues, the conference was viewed by some participants as a failure. They were able to secure passage of a modified [[World Programme of Action]] to expand on previous targets to improve women's status, and established a follow-up conference for the end of the decade.

==History==
The 1980 Conference held from 14 and 30 July in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} was the direct result of the [[First World Conference on Women]], which had been held in Mexico City in 1975, establishing the [[World Plan of Action]] and [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} These documents took the United Nations themes—Development, Equality, and Peace—of their path for women and created guidelines for nations to reach long-term objectives to improve the lives of women. When they were adopted, the UN established 1975 to 1985 as the Decade for Women and put in motion a plan for subsequent conferences to evaluate progress being made.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|pp=42–43}} The format of the conference was the same, with the official session made up of delegates representing their governments and the Tribune, representing NGOs.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=53}}

As with the previous conference, the Copenhagen conference was beset by the [[geopolitical]] divides of the [[Cold War]] and whether economics, racism, or [[sexism]] was the more important factor in the subordination of women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}} Initially planned to occur in [[Tehran]], the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 and the [[Iran hostage crisis]], escalated the political backdrop as did the continuing tensions of [[Middle-East conflict|conflict in the Middle East]]. [[Palestinian women]], [[refugee]]s, and [[Apartheid]] became topics that were added to the agenda and ensured that the event would be [[politicized]] by the various participants, rather than remaining focused on women's issues.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}}{{sfn|Malone|1980}} To that end, the [[United States Congress]] issued instructions to its delegates that they would not approve any resolution which attempted to make what should be an apolitical conference into an indictment of government policy or any resolution which mentioned the word "[[Zionism]]".{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=7}} [[Saudi Arabia]] and South Africa boycotted the convention altogether.{{sfn|Malone|1980}} Having to hastily relocate the conference to Denmark, also impacted the accommodations available, in that there was no space large enough to accommodate the entire Tribune, which meant that rather than the entire group participating in exchange to create unity, the group was splintered into small venues.{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=533}}

===Official conference===
The Conference was the mid-point review of the decade and the conference president was [[Lise Østergaard]], Cultural Minister of Denmark.{{sfn|Fraser|Tinker|2004|p=33}}{{sfn|''The Ottawa Journal''|1980|p=14}} The Secretary-General of the conference was [[Lucille Mathurin Mair|Lucille Mair]], a Jamaican academic and single mother, whose primary focus was on the development theme of the triad.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} Discussion on the [[New International Economic Order]] subverted the discussion from being about what women needed to what the various governments needed from women or for women to reach their national goals.{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=534}} At one point, it was suggested that if Westernized nations would provide more funding for [[economic development]], discrimination against women would vanish.{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=197}}{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=132}} Partisan political issues, such as insertion of the socialist economic system into the section dealing with the historical perspective on women, the repeated interruption of Israeli delegates with Muslim drummers and singers, and a storming of the conference by women protesting the [[1980 Bolivian coup d'état|Bolivian coup d'état]] were just some of the manifestations of the divides.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|''The Ottawa Journal''|1980|p=14}}

One hundred forty-five states with around 1500 delegates participated in the official session,{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=195}}{{sfn|Wood|1980|p=17}} including delegates like: {{ill|Aleksandra Pavlovna Biryukova|ru|Бирюкова, Александра Павловна}} of the USSR; [[Shirley Field-Ridley]] of [[Guyana]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=147}} [[Ana Sixta González de Cuadros]] of [[Colombia]]; [[Helga Hörz]] of [[East Germany]]; {{ill|Maïmouna Kane|fr}} of [[Senegal]]; [[Sheila Kaul]] of [[India]]; [[Ifigenia Martínez y Hernández|Ifigenia Martínez]] of [[Mexico]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=125}} {{ill|Gabriele Matzner-Holzer|de}} of [[Austria]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=147}} [[Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika]] of [[Zambia]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=125}}  [[Elizabeth Anne Reid]] of Australia;{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=198}} [[Ginko Sato]] of Japan;{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=147}} [[Umayya Toukan]] of [[Jordan]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=125}} [[Sarah Weddington]], who headed the US delegation, among many others.{{sfn|Malone|1980}}

After opening remarks by [[Kurt Waldheim]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Queen Margrethe II|Queen Margrethe II of Denmark]] welcomed participants and expressed her hope that the conference would prove productive.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=120–121}} [[Anker Jørgensen]], Danish Prime Minister spoke briefly, followed by opening remarks by Lise Østergaard, followed by the general discussion.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=122}} Debates were strongly affected by [[post-colonial]] and socialist claims of women's advancement in centrally planned economies in which the state had an obligation to prevent and an accountability for discrimination against women.{{sfn||Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=85–86}} Having established mechanisms in the previous conference to gather data on the status of women, review of the statistical data showed that women's security had dwindled over the preceding five-year period. Among the documentation were statistics showing that while women put in two-thirds of all working hours, they received only one-tenth of the income, owning one-hundredth of its assets. [[Economic stagnation]] and industrialization in the period had led to significant increases in unemployment and benefits for women.{{sfn|''The Santa Cruz Sentinel''|1980|p=16}} Jobs which were available confined women to insecure, low-paid, and sex-stereotyped jobs and as much of their labor was toward unpaid production, it was still invisible in compiled economic reports.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=128}} Decreased earnings had elevated health concerns. While literacy rates for middle class women increased, overall illiteracy among women increased.{{sfn|''The Santa Cruz Sentinel''|1980|p=16}} One of the most contentious issues discussed was the situation of households headed by women. Many officials denied that there could be such a thing, as legally in their countries women were not allowed to be the head of a household.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} On the other hand, one of the most memorable moments was when the delegates signed the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) on 17 July.{{sfn|Wood|1980|p=17}}

The first committee, under the chair Maïmouna Kane, with vice-chairs, [[Rafidah Aziz]] of [[Malaysia]], [[Maria Groza]] of [[Romania]], and [[Leónidas Páez de Virgili]] of [[Paraguay]], with Rapporteur {{ill|Marijke van Hemeldonck|de}} of [[Belgium]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=125}} discussed the effects of Apartheid and the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] on women; the progress and obstacles in attaining the objectives of the World Plan of Action; and the proposal for the World Programme of Action for the second-half of the [[Internationa Women's Year|Decade for Women]].{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=146}} Of major concern was labor insecurity, caused either by the introduction of technologies which replaced women laborers or by the [[Informal sector|informal nature]] of many jobs open to women in developing countries. The committee discussed that more effort should be made to retrain laborers when their positions were eliminated by technological advances and that legal protections should be enacted. Also of grave concern was education of women to not only eliminate illiteracy but to make them aware of social and political processes and how they could be part of decision-making mechanisms.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=148}} Apartheid and racism were condemned by the committee, as was the Zionist policy of Israel which was linked to racism. The discussion on the Palestinian right to self-determination was endorsed, though it was noted that when the Palestinian people as a whole were denied basic human rights, discussing the rights of only women was futile.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=150–152}} Various draft resolutions, including resolutions to improve education and training, address women with disabilities, provide support for women migrants and refugees, provide economic security for elderly women, and to address violence against women.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=153–154}} With modifications, the committee recommended approval of the Programme and accepted CEDAW with few reservations.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=157}}

The second committee, under the chair Sheila Kaul, with vice-chairs, [[Nermin Abadan Unat|Nermin Abadan-Unat]] of [[Turkey]], [[María de Lourdes Castro e Silva de Vincenzi]] of [[Brazil]], and [[Chavdar Kyuranov]] of [[Bulgaria]], with Rapporteur Ali Benbouchta of [[Morocco]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=125}} discussed an agenda identical to the first committee's focal points.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=160}} Apartheid was rejected and the committee recommended that with its eradication, women in South Africa and bordering refugee states should be compensated with the means to reconstruct their societies in ways that created avenues for women's participation.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=162–163}} With regard to the review of the Programme, the committee noted that without change in socio-economic systems, equality for women remained elusive. It was noted that globalization led to an increasing need to pursue paths for disarmament, peace and international cooperation.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=164}} It was also noted that regional systems needed to be fully integrated to allow women's participation but additionally new programs organized specifically for women should be explored.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=166}} The situation of refugee women, their vulnerabilities to exploitation and violence and the need to protect their human rights.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=169–170}} On the question of Palestinian women, the committee recognized that material assistance would do little to stop insecurity unless Israel ended its colonization, returned land to its owners and worked toward a durable peace.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=172}} The committee examined several draft resolutions regarding peace initiatives, refugees, water insecurity, and adding women to census figures,{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=173–174}} as well as draft resolutions on health and welfare, [[Deadbeat parent|protecting families from defaulted support obligations]], drug trafficking and [[forced disappearance]], and integrating women into the UN system and programs.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|pp=175–177}} With modifications, the committee recommended approval of the Programme.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=191}}

===Tribune===
The planning of the 1980 Tribune, or Forum as it was called in Copenhagen,{{sfn|Garner|2007|p=212}} was led by [[Edith Ballantyne]], the executive secretary of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) and president of the United Nations Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO). [[Elizabeth Palmer (activist)|Elizabeth Palmer]], a representative of the [[YWCA]] chaired the actual Forum,{{sfn|Winslow|1995|pp=144-145}} which was hosted at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Copenhagen University Amager Campus]].{{sfn|Garner|2007|pp=222–223}} The success of developing transnational networks of women was evident in the expansion of attendees at the NGO Tribune from 6000 participants in Mexico City to around 8000 in Copenhagen.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=84}} Many complained of the inadequacy of the forum facilities, including the fact that child care had not been considered.{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=532}}{{sfn|Schroeder|1980|p=13}}{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=8}} The forum was split into small sessions consisting of around 200 meetings per day. Because of the lack of translators, and the fact that conferences were labeled as of concern to developed or developing nations, in-depth discussion was difficult and often barely touched the surface of issues.{{sfn|Garner|2007|p=212}}{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=533}}{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=8}} [[Peggy Antrobus]] and [[Charlotte Bunch]], with sponsorship from the [[University of the West Indies]]' Women and Development Department and the [[Asian Pacific Centre for Women and Development]] (APCWD), recently relocated from Tehran to [[Bangkok]], organized an orientation video ''Feminist Strategies for the Decade'' which was shown daily.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}}{{sfn||Crocombe|2007|p=547}} [[Irene Tinker]]{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=7}}

The politicization of the official conference also influenced the NGO Tribune, resulting in tensions and displays of nationalism, such as{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=196}} Iranian women holding a news conference to celebrate their revolution by calling for the use of the [[hijab]] as a protest against [[colonialism]] and Ukrainian women protesting for independence.{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} When [[Nawal El Saadawi]] of Egypt presented a paper on [[female circumcision]], western feminists were advised that the issue was a developing world problem and not their concern.{{sfn|Dullea|1980|p=14}} Lesbians attendees hosted five workshops, which were well attended and less controversial than at the 1975 conference.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=8}} Some of the prominent women attendees were [[Shulamit Aloni]] of Israel;{{sfn|Schroeder|1980|p=13}} [[Marie Assaad]] of [[Egypt]];{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=197}} [[Charlotte Bunch]], US lesbian activist;{{sfn|Bunch|2012}} [[Phyllis Chesler]] a US expert on refugees;{{sfn|Schroeder|1980|p=13}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|''The Telegraph''|2006}} [[Natalia Malakhovskaia]], Soviet exile; [[Marie-Angélique Savané]] of [[Senegal]].{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=197}} As they had in Mexico City, the members of the Forum continued the tradition of presenting their additions to the Programme of Action at the official session. A group of women led by [[Domitila Barrios de Chungara]] were met by police and barred from entering the plenary meeting until Lucille Mair met with them and allowed the recommendations to be presented.{{sfn|Fraser|Tinker|2004|p=94}}

==Outcomes==
The most significant outcome of the conference was the official signing of CEDAW by the delegates at the opening ceremony.{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} The conference adopted the official [[35/136 United Nations General Assembly Resolution|World Programme of Action]] with a vote of with ninety-four favorable votes, twenty-two abstentions, and four opposed—Australia, Canada, [[Israel]] and the United States.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=7}} It included sections to create women's bureaus or agencies, defined the roles of NGO and [[grassroots]] organizations, and established target issues countries were to monitor. Those issues included [[child care]], [[single parent|households headed by women]], [[Economic migrant|migrants]], rural women, unemployment, and youth.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} The Programme also included a section regarding water insecurity,{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=533}} but the most significant changes to the previous Plan of Action were sections devoted to ensuring equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} The Conference established the [[World Conference on Women, 1985|Third World Conference on Women]] for the end of the decade to be hosted in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] in 1985 with a back up location in Tokyo.{{sfn|Fulton|1981|p=194}}

The conference was seen by those who rejected the Programme as having been a failed process. Rather than a serious discussion of the inequalities between men and women, the conference had limited discussion to politicizing international events, ideological principals and controversies, which obscured the real needs of women to participate in decision-making and economic development, and benefit equally in family matters, health, education and employment.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=197}} Multiple countries which had abstained from voting expressed disappointment that the process, rather than dealing with women's issues, had duplicated work better suited for the General Assembly.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1980|p=204}}

Overall, the conference and forum conference were marred by conflict and politicization of international and national events which had little to do with women's issues. The official agenda was obscured by nationalist causes pitting the developing countries of the South and the developed countries of the North against each other.{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} The question for continued participation in the conferences left many asking if the focus could be shifted away from political issues and return to the problems related to women: aging; credit for economic development; double duties between work and family; fertility versus infertility; shortage of heat and inadequate water, support systems and lack of them; women’s health;{{sfn|Tinker|1981|p=532}} and violence against women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=216}}

[[Zimbabwe]] sent six athletes across two different sports to the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.

==Disability classifications==
{{main article|Disability sport classification}}
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five [[Summer Paralympic Games#Disability categories|disability categories]]; [[amputation]], the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; [[cerebral palsy]]; [[wheelchair]] athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; [[visual impairment]], including [[blindness]]; [[Les Autres sport classification|Les autres]], any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example [[dwarfism]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=class1&gt;{{cite web |title=Paralympics categories explained |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=3 September 2008 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/03/2354016.htm?site=paralympics/2008 |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=class2&gt;{{cite news |title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=6 October 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[Paralympic Games#Summer sports|Paralympic sport]] then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|athletics]], divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|swimming]], group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.&lt;ref name=class3&gt;{{cite news |title=A-Z of Paralympic classification |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=28 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7586684.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and support ==
Funding issues proved a major challenge for Zimbabwe's participation at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. This was in part a result of only  220,000 of the 2.5 million tickets to watch the Games in Rio being sold a month ahead of the Games.  The NPC had been promised US$8,000 to cover the team's travel to Rio.  Less than a month prior to the Games, they were informed they would get only US$6,000 and this money would not be delivered until after the conclusion of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympics/paralympics-vital-for-breaking-down-social-barriers-for-disabled-people-say-african-athletes-a7203011.html|title=Paralympics vital in 'breaking down barriers' for disabled people in Africa|last=Cullum|first=Barney|date=August 21, 2016|website=Independent|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amid-financial-woes-paralympic-games-see-weak-ticket-sales-1471303984|title=Amid Financial Woes, Paralympic Games See Weak Ticket Sales|last=Kiernan|first=Paul|date=2016-08-16|last2=Troianovski|first2=Anton|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|last3=Parkin|first3=Benjamin|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medals ==
Zimbabwe finished the 2016 Games ranked fourth all time for total medals won by African countries, with 23 gold, 26 silver and 20 bronze medals for a total of 69 medals. They were ahead of fifth ranked Algeria who had 19 gold, 13 silver and 25 bronze medals for 57 all time. They were behind third ranked Tunisia who had 74 all time, of which 32 were gold, 28 silver and 14 bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsvideo.su/video/5119954|title=All-Time Africa Paralympics Medal Table – CCTV Africa|website=newsvideo.su|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowing made a commitment to developing the sport in Africa, with three countries getting four totals bearths to the Rio Games: Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Only the South African boat in the LTAMix4+ made it through to the finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/rowing-five-things-we-learned-rio-2016|title=Rowing: Five things we learned from Rio 2016|website=www.paralympic.org|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe was granted a Bipartite Commission invitation for a team of four rowers plus a [[coxswain]], to compete in the LTA4+, mixed coxed fours event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pavitt|first1=Michael|title=Eight bipartite rowing berths awarded for Rio 2016 Paralympics|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1037883/eight-bipartite-rowing-berths-awarded-for-rio-2016-paralympics|website=insidethegames.biz|accessdate=7 June 2016|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
