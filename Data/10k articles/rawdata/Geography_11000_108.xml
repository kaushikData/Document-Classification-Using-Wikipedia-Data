==Final round==
The 10 Finalists in this year's Final round were Nicholas Monahan from [[Idaho]], Karan Menon from [[New Jersey]], Sojas Wagle from [[Arkansas]], Abhinav Karthikeyan from [[Maryland]], Patrick Taylor from [[Iowa]], Lucy Chae from [[Massachusetts]], Shreyas Varathan from [[Minnesota]], Kapil Nathan from [[Alabama]], Shreyas Varathan from [[Minnesota]], Shriya Yarlagadda from [[Michigan]], and Tejas Badgujar from [[Pennsylvania]]. This years finals had many new changes including a 45-second oral response, a series of 3 questions asked at the [[US Botanical Gardens]], and lightning rounds, where a finalist would get 3 questions in a row, with only 6 seconds to answer each. In one of these rounds, Karan, the state champion of [[New Jersey]] was asked "The [[Mesabi range]] contains a large deposit of what metal-bearing mineral?" Karan's answer of [[taconite]] was originally marked wrong (the given answer was iron ore), but later he would object and prove to the judges that his answer was correct. Shriya Yarlagadda, from [[Michigan]] maintained a perfect score throughout most of the competition. In the end, the top 2 students were Karan of [[New Jersey]] and Shriya of [[Michigan]]. Karan got a perfect score of 7/7 in the championship round, while Shriya only missed the first question. "[[Mariupol]], a city located at the mouth of the [[Kalmius River]], is located on what sea that is an arm of the [[Black Sea]]?" Answer: "[[Sea of Azov]]." The final question that clinched the win for Karan was "If completed, the proposed [[Grand Inga Dam]] would become the world’s largest hydropower plant. This dam would be built near [[Inga Falls]] on which [[Africa]]n river?" Answer: "[[Congo River]]." The Third place winner was Sojas Wagle of [[Springdale, Arkansas]], who won $10,000 in scholarships. Finishing in 4th place was Tejas Badgujar of [[Allison Park, Pennsylvania]].

The '''A345''' is a secondary [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[Wiltshire]], England running from [[Salisbury]] to [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]]. The road is a main south-north link across [[Salisbury Plain]], which is renowned for its rich archaeology, and passes many ancient points of interest along its way.

==Route==

The road begins in [[Salisbury]] at the Castle roundabout and travels north out of the city, passing close to [[Old Sarum]] castle, taking a predominantly straight line to [[Boscombe Down]] and then [[Amesbury]] before meeting the [[A303 road|A303]] at Countess roundabout where it shares Countess Services with the major road. At this point it passes within {{convert|2|mi|km}} of the [[World Heritage Site]] at [[Stonehenge]]. Continuing north, the road passes near to [[Woodhenge]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] [[Royal School of Artillery]] base at [[Larkhill]].  This part of the route can be hazardous as there are often [[tanks]] crossing and the road is susceptible to [[subsidence]]. The next significant places are [[Netheravon]], and then [[Upavon]] where the road briefly separates into a one-way system around the village, running concurrently with the [[A342 road|A342]] to [[Devizes]].  From here the A345 goes to [[Pewsey]], where the [[Pewsey White Horse]] is best viewed, and then continues on to [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]], ending at a roundabout leading to the High Street which is the A4 road.

== History ==

Originally the A345 extended north from Marlborough to a junction with the [[A419 road|A419]] at Commonhead, south east of [[Swindon]].  From there it went through Swindon to meet the A419 again at [[Blunsdon]].

When the [[M4 motorway]] was opened, the section from Marlborough to the motorway junction 15 became a northern extension of the [[A346 road|A346]].  From the motorway to Commonhead, the road became part of the A419, and the route through Swindon was renumbered [[A4259 road|A4259]] and [[A4311 road|A4311]].

Between Amesbury and Durrington a {{convert|0.8|mi|km}} section of the A345 was realigned further east away from the Woodhenge [[scheduled monument]] in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A345 that was|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=File:Old_roads_007.jpg|publisher=The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=Robbie George|date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; crossing to a further west alignment and incorporating a new roundabout at its junction with the [[A3028 road|A3028]]. 

The southern terminus was originally further south along Castle Street at Salisbury market square, but with the opening of the Salisbury Inner Ring Road in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=193|title=Wiltshire Community History - Salisbury|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Wiltshire Council|access-date=|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southern section was declassified.

'''Anjajavy Forest''' is an element of the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] situated on the [[Indian Ocean]] of northwest [[Madagascar]].  The Anjajavy Forest surrounds the village of Anjajavy and provides a habitat for many [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name="Garbutt"&gt;Nick Garbutt, C. Michael Hogan, Hilton Hastings, Wendy Pollecutt,  Tahiana Andriaharimalala, ''Anjajavy, the village and the forest'', Lumina Technologies, May 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It covers roughly fifty square kilometres, and occupies a continuous portion of the peninsula upon which [[Anjajavy village]] lies. The peninsula is bounded by [[Majajamba Bay]] to the south and [[Narinda Bay]] to the north.  Anjajavy Forest has much in common with other dry deciduous forests rising out of the [[tsingy]] [[limestone]] formations of western [[Madagascar]].  It is due to the presence of expansive tsingy [[outcrop]]s as well as the remoteness of this part of Madagascar from the population center of the country at [[Antananarivo]] that the forest here has been less disturbed than many other forests in the country.  For example, the central highland [[plateau]], readily accessible from the population center,  has been decimated by decades of [[slash-and-burn]] farming by indigenous peoples, leading to massive [[desertification]] and [[erosion]].  The incidence of species [[endemism]] in the western dry forests is very high, including ten of the fourteen known [[lemur]] [[genus|genera]], five of the eight [[tenrec]] genera and 16 of the 17 [[Chiroptera]] genera of Madagascar represented.&lt;ref name="Garbutt"/&gt;  There are a variety of [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s present within the Anjajavy Forest.
				
Like most of Madagascar's dry deciduous forests, the upper canopy is composed of trees which shed their leaves in the winter months (May through September), including at least two species of [[Adansonia|baobab]]s endemic to the western part of the island.  Trees here have adapted to the warm [[arid]] climate by [[deciduous|shedding leaves]] in the dry season to reduce [[evapotranspiration]], and some species such as the [[Adansonia|baobab]] store large amounts of water in their bulbous trunks.

There is a very high rate of species endemicity in all the western dry deciduous forests of Madagascar, for both [[flora]] and [[fauna]]; this rate is thought to be higher than for the eastern [[rainforest]]s, although the [[biodiversity]], while extremely high, is slightly less than the eastern counterparts.  Geologically the tsingy formations have numerous [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] caverns (used by early tribesmen) and [[karst]] formations, which provide [[aquifer|underground water storage]].

==Flora==
The [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] contains numerous species of deciduous trees, including at least two species of baobab, ''[[Adansonia rubrostipa]]'' and ''[[Adansonia madagascariensis]]''.  In addition, trees such as ''[[Grewia ciclea]]'' (Malagasy name, andilambarika) and ''[[Terminalia catappa]]'' (Malagasy name: antafana) occur.  The latter tree provides a favourite food supply to the [[Coquerel's lemur]], with both fruits and leaves being appealing.

Some of the common shrubs found in the Anjajavy forest are ''[[Vepris ampody]]'' (Malagasy name: ampoly) and ''[[Rhizorphora mucronata]]'' (Malagasy name: honkovavy).  There are also abundant [[liana]]s (vines) as well as numerous herbs, including the Madagascar vanilla (''[[Vanilla madagascariensis]]'', whose Malagasy name is vahimatso).

The dry forest verges on [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]s in the vicinity of several coastal estuaries at the western verge of the Anjajavy Forest, where small streams discharge into the Indian Ocean.

==Mammals==
[[File:Coquerel'sPropithecus.jpg|thumb|250px|Coquerel's sifaka in the wild, Anjajavy Forest]]

Lemurs are a noted species in the Anjajavy Forest, since they are abundant in the trees and even sometimes on the forest floor . The most frequently seen [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] species&lt;ref&gt;Russell Mittermeier et al., ''Lemurs of Madagascar'', Conservation International (2006) {{ISBN|1-881173-88-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Coquerel's sifaka]] and the [[common brown lemur]] both of which are completely wild but show no fear of humans and can be approached very closely in the Anjajavy le Lodge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anjajavy.com Anjajavy le Lodge]&lt;/ref&gt; gardens. Other, nocturnal lemurs of the Anjajavy Forest include three species of mouse lemur (''Microcebus'' spp.), one species of sportive lemur (''Lepilemur'' sp.) and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius). Since none of these nocturnal lemur populations have been researched by specialists, it is possible that some may represent new, undescribed species.

Lemurs of the Anjajavy Forest are: 
* Milne Edward sportive lemur 	(''[[Lepilemur edwardsi]]'')
* Coquerel's sifaka	(''[[Propithecus coquereli]]'')
* Fat-tailed dwarf lemur	(''[[Cheirogaleus medius]]'')
* Golden brown mouse lemur	(''[[Microcebus ravelobensis]]'')
* Danfoss mouse lemur	(''[[Microcebus danfossi]]'')
* Gray mouse lemur	(''[[Microcebus murinus]]'')
* Common brown lemur	(''[[Eulemur fulvus]]'')

The tsingy caves provide special habitat for the bats of this region, offering cool shelter.  Probably the most common member of the chiroptera family locally is the [[Commerson's leaf-nosed bat]] (''Hipposideros commersoni'').  The cave explorers will also sight Tiavato bats (''[[Paremballonura tiavato]]'') in flight and some hanging from the ceiling on stalactite formations of the limestone cave interiors. A cruise on the mangrove before sunset often shows skies with many Madagascar flying foxes (''[[Pteropus rufus]]''). 	

Also seen in the Anjajavy Forest area is the endangered [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]] (''[[Cryptoprocta ferox]]''), the largest mammalian carnivore in Madagascar.  Other nocturnal mammals occur in the forest here, like two species of tenrecs: greater hedgehog (''[[Setifer setosus]]'') and (''[[Tenrec ecaudatusalso]]'') and the elusive Malagasy civet (''[[Fossa fossana]]'').

==Birds==

There is abundandant birdlife present in the Anjajavy Forest. One of the most emblematic is the [[Madagascar fish eagle]], which has four breeding pairs in the Anjajavy Forest according to Garbutt and Hogan.  This very large bird of prey is endemic to western Madagascar, and the species is [[critically endangered]], with an estimated 99 breeding pairs estimated in total existence.

According to Anjajavy le Lodge continuous nature inventory&lt;ref&gt;Anjajavy le Lodge continuous nature inventory. [https://www.inaturalist.org/check_lists/173271-Anjajavys-reserve-Check-Lis Anjajavy reserve Check List on www.inaturalist.org] t&lt;/ref&gt; bird species frequenting the Anjajavy Forest are:

The epithet "'''Bavarian Geographer'''" ({{lang-la|Geographus Bavarus}}) is the conventional name for the [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] author of a Latin [[medieval]] text containing a list of the tribes in central-eastern Europe, headed {{lang|la|Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii}} ({{Language with name/for||Latin|''Description of cities and lands north of the [[Danube]]''}}).

The name "Bavarian Geographer" was first bestowed (in its French form, "{{lang|fr|Géographe de Bavière}}") in 1796 by Polish count and scholar [[Jan Potocki]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Potocki. ''Fragments historiques et geographiques sur la Scythie, Sarmatie, et les Slaves''. Brunsvic, 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now also used at times to refer to the document itself.

The short document, written in [[Latin]], was discovered in 1772 in the [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Munich]] by [[Louis XV]]'s ambassador to the Saxon court, Comte [[Louis-Gabriel Du Buat-Nançay]].&lt;ref&gt;Le comte du Buat. ''Histoire ancienne des peuples de l'Europe''. T. 11. Paris, 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been acquired by the [[Wittelsbach]]s with the collection of the antiquarian [[Hermann Schädel]] (1410–85) in 1571. The document was much discussed in the early 19th-century historiography, notably by [[Nikolai Karamzin]] and [[Joachim Lelewel]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Lelewel. ''Winulska Sławiańszczyzna z Geografa bawarskiego'', Tygodnik Wileński, nr 47, z dn. 8 paźdzernika 1816, s. 333, i w nastęnych numerach 48–50. Also: Joachim Lelewel, ''Geographe du Moyen Age III'', Bruxelles 1852, s.21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The document contains a list of the tribes in [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] [[Europe]] east of the [[Elbe]] and north of the [[Danube]] to the [[Volga]] rivers  to the Black and Caspian Sea (most of them of [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] origin, with ''[[Rus' (people)|Ruzzi]]'', and others such as ''[[Bulgars|Vulgarii]]'', etc.). Absent on the list are [[Polans (western)|Polans]], [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]] and  [[Mazovians|Masovians]], tribes first of whom are believed to have settled along the shores of the [[Warta]] river during the 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Buko: Archeologia Polski wczesnośredniowiecznej: odkrycia, hipotezy, interpretacje. Warszawa, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as well [[Dulebes]], [[Volhynians]] and [[White Croats]], but instead mentioning several unknown tribes hard to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koncha |first=S. |title=Bavarian Geographer On Slavic Tribes From Ukraine |url=http://ukrbulletin.univ.kiev.ua/Visnyk-16-en/Koncha.pdf |journal=Ukrainian Studies |year=2012 |volume=12 |publisher=Bulletin of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv |pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some information about the number of strongholds ({{lang-la|civitates}}) possessed by some of the tribes. [[Henryk Łowmiański]] demonstrated that the list consists of two parts, which may be datable to different periods and attributed to distinct authors.&lt;ref&gt;Henryk Łowmiański, ''O identyfikacji nazw Geografa bawarskiego'', Studia Źródłoznawcze, t. III: 1958, s.1–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The provenance of the document is disputed. Although early commentators suggested that it could have been compiled in [[Regensburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Henryk Łowmiański, ''O pochodzeniu Geografa bawarskiego'', Roczniki Historyczne, R. 20, 1955, s.9–58&lt;/ref&gt; the list seems to have been taken from {{lang|la|Codex Reginbertinus II}}, recorded in the 9th century in the library of the [[Reichenau Abbey]] and named after a local librarian.&lt;ref&gt;The codex contains [[Boethius]]'s treatise on geometry. See: Novy R. ''Die Anfänge des böhmischen Staates'', 1: Mitteleuropa im 9. Jh. Praha, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these findings, [[Bernhard Bischoff]] attributes it to a monk active at Reichenau from the 830s to 850s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff]]. ''Die südostdeutschen Schreibschulen und Bibliotheken in der Karolingerzeit''. Bd. 1.2. Aufl. Wiesbaden, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Nazarenko]] finds it more probable that the list was composed in the 870s, when [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]] is believed to have resided at Reichenau. The document may have been connected with his missions in the Slavic lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ru|[[Aleksandr Nazarenko|А. В. Назаренко]].

'''Bulgarian placename etymology''' is characterized by the linguistic and ethnic diversity of the [[Balkans]] through the ages and the position of the country in the centre of the region. While typical [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] placenames of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin vastly dominate, toponyms which stem from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Celtic language|Celtic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] can also be encountered.

== Slavic placenames ==

Slavic names account for the vast majority of toponyms on the territory of Bulgaria. Typical forms are:
* with the neutral suffix ''-ово/-ево'' (''[[-ovo/-evo]]''). This suffix is probably the most widespread one in Bulgaria. Examples: [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Gabrovo]], [[Haskovo]], [[Pamporovo]], [[Sevlievo]].
&lt;!--

   Balgarovo
  Madzharovo
   Bolyarovo
     Gabrovo
      Borovo
   Panitsovo
     Brezovo
--&gt;
* with the masculine suffix ''-ец'' (''-ets''). Examples: [[Pravets]], [[Borovets]], [[Kladenets (disambiguation)|Kladenets]], [[Lyubimets]].
* with the feminine suffix  ''-ица'' (''-itsa''). Examples: [[Gorna Oryahovitsa]], [[Dupnitsa]], [[Belitsa]], [[Koprivshtitsa]], [[Slivnitsa]], [[Perushtitsa]], [[Berkovitsa]], [[Kosharitsa]].
* with the suffixes ''-инци'' (''-intsi''), ''-овци'' (''-ovtsi''), and ''-ци'' (''-tsi''), which indicate the name, occupation or some other characteristic feature of the family or families that founded the settlement. Examples: [[Chiprovtsi]], [[Boychinovtsi]], [[Apriltsi]], [[Priseltsi]], [[Brusartsi]], [[Batanovtsi]].
* with the suffix ''-град'' (''-[[grad (geography)|grad]]''), which is used for mediaeval fortified settlements and modern cities. -grad is a very common suffix in southern Bulgaria due to the widespread renaming of towns that carried Turkish or Greek names. Many towns now have names that follow the established pattern, but are dedicated to Bulgarian rulers, national heroes or prominent people, such as [[Botevgrad]] (formerly ''Orhanie''), [[Asenovgrad]] (formerly ''Stanimaka'') and [[Blagoevgrad]] (formerly ''Gorna Dzhumaya''). Other examples: [[Zlatograd]], [[Svilengrad]], [[Razgrad]].

 Blagoevgrad
   Botevgrad
 Topolovgrad
 Ivaylovgrad
  Krumovgrad
  Asenovgrad

Dimitrovgrad
     Razgrad
--&gt;
* with the masculine suffixes ''-ник'' (''-nik'') and ''-чик'' (''-chik''). Examples: [[Pernik]], [[Balchik]], [[Belogradchik]], [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]], [[Breznik]].
* with the neutral suffix ''-ино'' (''-ino''). Examples: [[Ardino]], [[Nedelino]], [[Nevestino (disambiguation)|Nevestino]].
* with the masculine suffix ''-ен'' (''-en''). Examples: [[Pleven]], [[Sliven]], [[Kuklen]], [[Teteven]], [[Kiten (disambiguation)|Kiten]].
&lt;!--
   -en: Shumen?
   -in: Devin, Vidin?
--&gt;
* with the neutral suffix ''-ище'' (''-ishte''). Examples: [[Targovishte]], [[Bozhurishte]], [[Panagyurishte]].
* with other or without suffixes. Examples: [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]], [[Belene]], [[Dobrich]], [[Rudozem]], [[Sopot (disambiguation)|Sopot]], [[Beloslav]], [[Svishtov]], [[Razlog]], [[Troyan]], [[Vidin]], [[Byala Slatina]], [[Bankya]].

Slavic names often appear in pairs, wherever two places were historically related, or happen to have the same name. Examples: [[Stara Zagora]] and [[Nova Zagora]] (old/new), [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and [[Malko Tarnovo]] (great/small), Gorni Bogrov and Dolni Bogrov (upper/lower).

''Nov'', ''novi'', ''nova'', and ''novo'' (meaning "new") are also frequent, as many places were depopulated during [[History of early Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]] and later rebuilt. Examples: Novo Selo (9 villages are named thus), Novi Pazar. Nevertheless, the presence of "new" does not guarantee that the settlement has ever been destroyed&amp;nbsp;— it may have been founded by settlers from another village who wished to retain the name, for example.

== Turkish placenames ==

Bulgaria was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for 500 years, and Turkish placenames were widespread in southern and northeastern Bulgaria. However, most of them were changed in the 20th century. Examples: [[Kardzhali]] (''Kırca Ali'', partially Arabic through Hebrew), [[Kazanlak]] (''Kazanlık''), [[Pazardzhik]] (''Pazarcık''), [[Kyustendil]] (''Köstendil''), [[Buzludzha]] (''Buzluca''). [[Hisarya]], [[Harmanli]] (''Harmanlı''), [[Dolni Chiflik]] (''Aşağı Çiftlik''), [[Dzhebel]] (''Cebel'').

== Greek placenames ==

There is a certain number of Greek names, mostly in southern Bulgaria along the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]], which stem from ancient [[poleis]] and towns. Examples: [[Ahtopol]], [[Sozopol]], [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], [[Nesebar]] (a Slavicized version of the Hellenized Thracian name ''Menebria'', later ''Messembria''), [[Provadiya]].

== Latin placenames ==

An amount of names from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] has also survived until today, many of them being Roman versions of former Greek or Thracian ones. Some Latin names had fallen into disuse long ago, but were revived in the 20th century. Examples: [[Montana, Bulgaria|Montana]], [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]] (a Slavicized version of Latin ''Almus''), [[Archar (disambiguation)|Archar]] (a Slavicized version of Latin ''Raciaria''), Drastar (nowadays [[Silistra]]), derived from ''Durostorum'', [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] and [[Nikyup]], derived from ''Nicopolis'', [[Dzherman]], derived from ''Germania'', etc. The old Bulgarian name for [[Sofia]], ''Sredets'', was also derived from ''Sardica'' (''Serdica'').

Some names of [[Romance languages|Romance]] origin date to later times and are ascribed to the [[Balkan Latin]] ([[Vlachs|Vlach]]) population, several examples being [[Vakarel]], [[Pasarel]], [[Banishor]], [[Gurgulyat]].

== Other placenames ==

There are a number of ancient placenames from other languages, including Thracian or Dacian, such as [[Plovdiv]], derived from ''Pulpudeva'' (itself derived from ''Philipoppolis''), [[German, Bulgaria|German]] and Celtic, such as [[Vidin]] from ''Dunonia'' and ''Bononia''.

The placename [[Varna]] of the non-metathesized group CorC bears witness of [[Old Bulgarian]]'s preliterate period - or perhaps stemming from a more ancient [[Proto-Indo-European root]].{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; before 31 October 1451{{snd}}20 May 1506) was an [[Italians|Italian]] explorer, navigator, and [[colonialism|colonist]] who completed [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] under the auspices of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain. He led the first European expeditions to the [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]], initiating the permanent [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the Americas, a continent which was not then known to the [[Old World]]. While what he thought he had discovered was a route to the Far East, he is credited with the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans.

[[Origin theories of Christopher Columbus|Columbus's early life]] is somewhat obscure, but scholars generally agree that he was born in the [[Republic of Genoa]] and spoke a dialect of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles (and possibly Iceland) and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married a Portuguese woman and was based in [[Lisbon]] for several years, but later took a Spanish mistress; he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the [[East Indies]], hoping to profit from the lucrative [[spice trade]].

After years of lobbying, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain [[Capitulations of Santa Fe|agreed]] to sponsor a journey west, in the name of the [[Crown of Castile]]. Columbus left Spain in August 1492 with three ships, and after a stopover in the [[Canary Islands]] made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (now celebrated as [[Columbus Day]]). His landing place was an island in the [[Bahamas]], known by its native inhabitants as [[Guanahani]]; its exact location is uncertain. Columbus subsequently visited [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]], establishing [[La Navidad|a colony]] in what is now [[Haiti]]—the first European settlement in the Americas since the [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse colonies]] almost 500 years earlier. He arrived back in Spain in early 1493, bringing a number of captive natives with him. [[Columbus's letter on the first voyage|Word of his discoveries]] soon spread throughout Europe.

Columbus would make three further voyages to the New World, exploring the [[Lesser Antilles]] in 1493, [[Trinidad]] and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502. Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use. He continued to seek a passage to the East Indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain; he gave the name ''indios'' ("Indians") to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] he encountered. Columbus's strained relationship with the Spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to [[Pleitos colombinos|protracted litigation]] over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown.

Columbus's expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern [[Western world]]. The transfers between the [[Old World]] and [[New World]] that followed his first voyage are known as the [[Columbian exchange]], and the period of human habitation in the Americas prior to his arrival is known as the [[Pre-Columbian era]]. Columbus's legacy continues to be debated. He was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perceptions have changed as recent scholars have given attention to negative aspects of his life, such as his role in the extinction of the [[Taíno]] people, his promotion of slavery, and allegations of tyranny towards Spanish colonists. Many landmarks and institutions in the [[Western Hemisphere]] bear his name, including the country of [[Colombia]].

The name ''Christopher Columbus'' is the [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Latin]] '''Christophorus Columbus'''. His name in [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] is  '''Cristòffa Cómbo''', in [[Italian language|Italian]] '''Cristoforo Colombo''' and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]  '''Cristóbal Colón'''.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=741}} He was born before 31 October 1451 in the territory of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (now part of modern Italy), though the exact location remains disputed.{{sfn|Phillips, Jr|1992|p=9}}{{efn|"Even with less than a complete record, however, scholars can state with assurance that Columbus was born in the republic of Genoa in northern Italy, although perhaps not in the city itself, and that his family made a living in the wool business as weavers and merchants.&amp;nbsp;... The two main early biographies of Columbus have been taken as literal truth by hundreds of writers, in large part because they were written by individuals closely connected to Columbus or his writings.&amp;nbsp;... Both biographies have serious shortcomings as evidence."}} His father was [[Domenico Colombo]],{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=741}} a middle-class wool weaver who worked both in [[Genoa]] and [[Savona]] and who also owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked as a helper. His mother was [[Susanna Fontanarossa]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=741}} [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo were his brothers. Bartolomeo worked in a [[cartography]] workshop in [[Lisbon]] for at least part of his adulthood.&lt;ref name= britannica&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1993 ed., Vol. 16, pp. 605ff / Morison, ''Christopher Columbus'', 1955 ed., pp. 14ff&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a sister named Bianchinetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Lawrence|title=Columbus The Four Voyages, 1493–1504|year=2012|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-0143122104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus never wrote in his native language, which is presumed to have been a [[Genoese dialect|Genoese variety of Ligurian]] (his name would translate in the 16th-century Genoese language as ''Christoffa''&lt;ref&gt;Rime diverse, Pavia, 1595, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corombo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re4OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203 |first=Torquato|last=Tasso|title=Ra Gerusalemme deliverâ|location=Genoa|year=1755|page=32 |publisher=Ra Stamparia de Tarigo|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-lij|kriˈʃtɔffa kuˈɹuŋbu}}&lt;ref&gt;Çittara zeneize – [https://archive.org/details/cittarazeneizer00priagoog Regole d'Ortografia], Genoa, 1745&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consulta ligure, ''Vocabolario delle parlate liguri'', Sage, 1982, {{ISBN|887058044X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In one of his writings, he says he went to sea at the age of 10. In 1470, the Columbus family moved to [[Savona]], where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Christopher was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of [[René of Anjou]] to support his attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

In 1473, Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important [[Centurione]], [[Di Negro]] and [[Spinola family|Spinola]] families of Genoa. Later, he allegedly made a trip to [[Chios]], an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] island then ruled by Genoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/columbus.html |title=Christopher Columbus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020323182708/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/columbus.html |archivedate=23 March 2002}}. Thomas C. Tirado, PhD Professor History. Millersville University.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern Europe. He docked in [[Bristol]], England&lt;ref&gt;"It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1, University of Michigan Press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0131426702}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galway]], Ireland. In 1477, he was possibly in [[Iceland]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=741}} In the autumn of 1477, he sailed on a Portuguese ship from Galway to Lisbon, where he found his brother Bartolomeo, and they continued trading for the Centurione family. Columbus based himself in Lisbon from 1477 to 1485. He married [[Filipa Moniz Perestrelo]], daughter of the [[Porto Santo]] governor and Portuguese nobleman of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] origin [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio Maria de |last=Freitas |title=The Wife of Columbus: With Genealogical Tree of the Perestrello and Moniz Families |publisher=Stettinger, Lambert &amp; Co |location=New York |year=1893 |url=https://archive.org/details/wifeofcolumbus00frei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1479 or 1480, his son [[Diego Columbus]] was born. Between 1482 and 1485, Columbus traded along the coasts of [[West Africa]], reaching the Portuguese trading post of [[Elmina]] at the [[Guinea coast]] (in present-day [[Ghana]]).&lt;ref name="EB-online"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer)]". Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Some records report that Filipa died sometime around 1485, while Columbus was away in Castile.  He returned to Portugal to settle her estate and take his son Diego with him.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Emilio Taviani, "Beatriz Arana" in ''The Christopher Columbus Encyclopedia'', vol. 1, p. 24. New York: Simon and Schuster 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He had left Portugal for [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in 1485, where he found a mistress in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named [[Beatriz Enríquez de Arana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbus-day.123holiday.net/christopher_columbus_2.html|title=Christopher Columbus Biography |page= 2|publisher=Columbus-day.123holiday.net |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Beatriz met Columbus when he was in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a gathering site of many Genoese merchants and where the court of the Catholic monarchs was located at intervals. Beatriz, unmarried at the time, gave birth to Columbus's [[legitimacy (family law)|natural son]] [[Fernando Columbus]] in July 1488, named for the monarch of Aragón. Columbus recognized the boy as his offspring. Columbus entrusted his older, legitimate son Diego to take care of Beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death, but Diego was negligent in his duties.&lt;ref&gt;Taviani, "Beatriz Arana" in ''The Christopher Columbus Encyclopedia'', vol. 1, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambitious, Columbus eventually learned Latin, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Castilian. He read widely about astronomy, geography, and history, including the works of [[Claudius Ptolemy]], Cardinal [[Pierre d'Ailly]]'s ''Imago Mundi'', the [[travels of Marco Polo]] and Sir [[John Mandeville]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and [[Pope Pius II]]'s ''[[Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum]]''. According to historian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]],{{quote|Columbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, ...&lt;ref name="ESMorgan"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Edmund S.|last=Morgan|title=Columbus' Confusion About the New World|journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|year=2009|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Presence-of-Mind-A-World-Too-New.html?c=y&amp;page=1#ixzz0ydVfdyrA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his life, Columbus also showed a keen interest in the Bible and in [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecies]], often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs. For example, part of the argument that he submitted to the Spanish [[Catholic Monarchs]] when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the [[2 Esdras|Second Book of Esdras]] ([[Esdras|Ezra]]): see [[:wikisource:Bible (King James)/II Esdras#Chapter 6|2 Esdras 6:42]], which he took to mean that the Earth is made of six parts of land to one of water. Towards the end of his life, he produced a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of [[Christian eschatology]] and of [[apocalypticism]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

== Quest for Asia ==

=== Background ===
[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|"Columbus map", drawn c.&amp;nbsp;1490 in the [[Lisbon]] workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus&lt;ref&gt;"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles", p. 37. {{ISBN|978-2354040079}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Under the [[Mongol Empire]]'s hegemony over Asia (the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', or ''Mongol peace''), Europeans had long enjoyed [[Europeans in Medieval China|a safe land passage]], the [[Silk Road]], to the [[Indies]] (then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia) and [[China]], which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk. With the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became much more difficult and dangerous. Portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to Asia.

In 1470, the Florentine astronomer [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]] suggested to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] that sailing west would be a quicker way to reach the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], [[Cathay]], and [[Cipangu]] than the route around Africa. Afonso rejected his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2R4DA2lip9gC&amp;pg=PA522 | author=Charles R. Boxer |title=The Christian Century in Japan: 1549–1650 | page=2 |publisher=University of California Press|year=1951|accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese explorers, under the leadership of King [[John II of Portugal|John II]], then developed the [[Cape Route]] to Asia around Africa. Major progress in this quest was achieved in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in what is now South Africa. Meanwhile, in the 1480s, the Columbus brothers had picked up Toscanelli's suggestion and proposed a plan to reach the Indies by sailing west across the "Ocean Sea", i.e., the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. However, Dias's discovery had shifted the interests of Portuguese seafaring to the [[southeast passage]], which complicated Columbus's proposals significantly.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=978-0300170283 |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300170283 |ref=harv |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627113247/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=978-0300170283 |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical considerations ===
[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]].&lt;ref name=book3&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul F| last=Boller| title=Not So!: Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton |year=1995|isbn= 978-0195091861|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, nearly all educated Westerners had understood, at least since the time of [[Aristotle]], that [[Myth of the Flat Earth|the Earth is spherical]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;&lt;br /&gt;Zinn, Howard 1980. ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', HarperCollins 2001. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; The sphericity of the Earth is also accounted for in the work of [[Ptolemy]], on which [[Geocentric model|medieval astronomy]] was largely based. Christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the Earth is spherical include Saint [[Bede]] the Venerable in his ''Reckoning of Time'', written around AD 723. In Columbus's time, the techniques of [[celestial navigation]], which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the Earth is a sphere, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=6&amp;scid=13&amp;iid=25 "Mariner's Astrolabe"], Navigation Museum, Institute of Navigation&lt;/ref&gt;

As far back as the 3rd century BC, [[Eratosthenes]] had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|publisher=Watson-Guptill|year=2001|isbn=978-0823025121|location=New York, NY|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sagan, Carl]]. ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''; the mean circumference of the Earth is {{convert|40041.47|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC, [[Posidonius]] confirmed Eratosthenes's results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the Earth.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Atlantic Ocean, Toscanelli, 1474.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]'s notions of the geography of the Atlantic Ocean (shown superimposed on a modern map), which directly influenced Columbus's plans.]]

From d'Ailly's ''Imago Mundi'' Columbus learned of [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Alfraganus]]'s estimate that a degree of [[latitude]] (or a degree of [[longitude]] along the equator) spanned 56{{sfrac|2|3}} miles, but did not realize that this was expressed in the [[Arabic mile]] rather than the shorter [[Roman mile]] with which he was familiar (1,480&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942, pp. 65, 93]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore estimated the circumference of the Earth to be about 30,200&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the correct value is {{convert|40000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Furthermore, most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s estimate that [[Eurasia]] spanned 180° [[longitude]], rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain). Columbus, for his part, believed the even higher estimate of [[Marinus of Tyre]], which put the longitudinal span of the Eurasian landmass at 225°, leaving only 135° of water. He also believed that Japan (which he called "Cipangu", following [[Marco Polo]]) was much larger, farther to the east from China ("Cathay"), and closer to the equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than Japan, including the mythical [[Antillia]], which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the [[Azores]]. In this, he was influenced by the ideas of Florentine astronomer, [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], who corresponded with Columbus in 1474&lt;ref&gt;Journal article: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44208924 Christopher Columbus. An address delivered before the American Catholic Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to Asia.&lt;ref name="Morison-Admiral"&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942).

Columbus therefore estimated the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan to be about 3,000 Italian miles (3,700&amp;nbsp;km, or 2,300 statute miles). The true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfn|Phillips, Jr|1992|p=110}}{{efn|About 10,600 nautical miles}} No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable. Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The [[Catholic Monarchs]], however, having completed [[Reconquista|an expensive war]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus's project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Nautical considerations ===
Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the [[trade winds]], which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. During his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called "[[easterlies]]", propelled Columbus's fleet for five weeks, from the [[Canary Islands]] to [[The Bahamas]]. The precise first land sighting and landing point was [[San Salvador Island]].&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt; To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called [[Close hauled#Close hauled|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.

Instead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he was able to catch the "[[westerlies]]" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe. There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307004341/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=7 March 2012|accessdate=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/08_1.shtml|title=Trade Winds and the Hadley Cell|accessdate=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether Columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others. The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' ("turn of the sea"). Columbus's knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], skirting the so-called [[horse latitudes]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a [[tropical cyclone]], both of which, by chance, he avoided.&lt;ref name="Morison-Admiral" /&gt;

=== Quest for financial support for a voyage ===

In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to King [[John II of Portugal]]. He proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the Atlantic, search for a western route to the [[Orient]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made "Great Admiral of the Ocean", appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted Columbus's proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too low.&lt;ref name="Morison-Admiral" /&gt;

In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, resulting in John II again inviting him for an audience. That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the [[Cape of Good Hope]]). With an eastern sea route to Asia apparently at hand, King John was no longer interested in Columbus's far-fetched project.

[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|left|''Columbus before the Queen'', as imagined&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843]]

Columbus traveled from Portugal to both [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither. He had also dispatched his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to the court of [[Henry VII of England]] to inquire whether the English crown might sponsor his expedition, but also without success.

Columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], who had united several kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula by marrying and were ruling together. On 1 May 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, the [[expert|savants]] of Spain, like their counterparts in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], replied that Columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to Asia. They pronounced the idea impractical and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and, in 1489, furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will ''The Story of Civilization'' vol. vi, "The Reformation". Chapter XIII, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

After continually lobbying at the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish court]] and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in January 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered [[Granada]], the [[Emirate of Granada|last Muslim stronghold]] on the Iberian Peninsula, and they received Columbus in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], in the ''[[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]]'' castle. Isabella turned him down on the advice of her [[confessor]]. Columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him, and Ferdinand later claimed credit for being "the principal cause why those islands were discovered".{{sfn|Phillips, Jr|1992|p=132}}

In the April 1492 "[[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]", King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella promised Columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands he could claim for Spain. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.&lt;ref name="Morison-Admiral" /&gt;

Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts. He and his sons, Diego and Fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]], known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'', alleging that the Crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to Columbus and his heirs. The Columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McDonald, "Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488–1539)", 2005, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0714126449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1492 and 1503, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, each voyage being sponsored by the [[Crown of Castile]]. On his first voyage, he independently discovered [[the Americas]] and [[magnetic declination]].{{efn|That is, Columbus was unaware that others had already discovered each of these before he did.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]] discovered 400 years earlier, in Asia, the concept of [[true north]] in terms of [[magnetic declination]] towards the [[north pole]], with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and "the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the polestar and true north".

Columbus always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the [[Asia]]n continent, as previously described by [[Marco Polo]] and other European travelers.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt; Columbus's refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for Spain were not part of Asia might explain, in part, why the American continent was named after the [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and not after Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201227/http://www.umc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|title=The Naming of America|publisher=Umc.sunysb.edu|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships. The largest was a [[carrack]] (Spanish: ''nao''), the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' ex-''Gallega'' ("Galician"){{explain|date=June 2018}}. The other two were smaller [[caravel]]s. The name of one is lost: it is known today only by the [[nickname]] ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', which in Castilian of the time meant "painted one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The ''Santa María'' was owned by [[Juan de la Cosa]] and captained by Columbus. The ''Pinta'' and the ''Niña'' were piloted by the [[Pinzón brothers]] ([[Martín Alonso Pinzón|Martín Alonso]] and [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón|Vicente Yáñez]]).&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;

Columbus first sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], which belonged to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. He restocked provisions and made repairs in [[Gran Canaria]], then departed from [[San Sebastián de La Gomera]] on 6 September, for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean. At about 2:00 in the morning of 12 October (21 October, Gregorian Calendar New Style), a lookout on the ''Pinta'', [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodríguez Bermeo), spotted land, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout. Thereupon, the captain of the ''Pinta'', Martín Alonso Pinzón, verified the discovery and alerted Columbus by firing a [[lombard (gun)|lombard]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942]], p. 226); Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&amp;pg=PT14 p. 14]); Columbus &amp; Toscanelli ([[#CITEREFColumbusToscanelli2010|2010]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=MI7dzFQZHOoC&amp;pg=PA35 p. 35])&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&amp;pg=PT15 p. 15])&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus called the island (in what is now [[the Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'' (meaning "Holy Savior"); the natives called it [[Guanahani]]. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved. Based on primary accounts and on what one would expect from the geographic positions of the islands given Columbus's course, the prime candidates are [[San Salvador Island]] (so named in 1925 on the theory that it was Columbus's San Salvador),&lt;ref&gt;William D.

If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language."&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Fuson, ed., ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'', Tab Books, 1992, International Marine Publishing, {{ISBN|0877423164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus noted that their primitive weapons and military tactics made them susceptible to easy conquest, writing, "these people are very simple in war-like matters … I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased."&lt;ref&gt;Columbus ([[#CITEREFColumbus1991|1991]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OxbLxcS5uYgC&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]).

Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]], where he landed on 28 October. On 22 November, Martín Alonso Pinzón took the ''Pinta'' on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called "Babeque" or "Baneque", which the natives had told him was rich in gold.

On 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the New World, in the [[Bay of Rincón]] at the eastern end of the [[Samaná Peninsula]] in northeast Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;Fuson, Robert. ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'' (Camden, International Marine, 1987) 173.&lt;/ref&gt; There he encountered the warlike [[Ciguayos|Cigüayos]], the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTsLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 | title=Confronting Columbus: An Anthology | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |author1=Yewell, John |author2=Chris Dodge | year=1992 | location=Jefferson, NC | page=33 | isbn=978-0899506968 | accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cigüayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that Columbus desired; in the ensuing clash one Ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwI7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA159 | title=The Journal of Christopher Columbus | publisher=Hakluyt Society | author=Markham, Clements R. | year=1893 | location=London | pages=159–160 | accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this and because of the Cigüayos' use of arrows, he called the inlet where he met them [[Bay of Arrows|the Bay of Arrows (or Gulf of Arrows)]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Dunn and James Kelly. ''The Diario of Christopher Columbus's First Voyage to America'' (London: University of Oklahoma Press), 333–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus kidnapped about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him (only seven or eight of the natives arrived in Spain alive).{{sfn|Loewen|1995}}

Columbus headed for Spain on the ''Niña'', but a storm separated him from the ''Pinta,'' and forced the ''Niña'' to stop at the island of Santa Maria in the Azores. Half of his crew went ashore to say prayers in a chapel to give thanks for having survived the storm. But while praying, they were imprisoned by the governor of the island, ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates.  After a two-day standoff, the prisoners were released, and Columbus again set sail for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1 January 1990|pages = 17–23|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another storm forced him into the port at [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on 4 March 1493 in Portugal. There, he was interviewed by [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who had rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] a few years earlier, in 1488–1489. Dias's success had complicated Columbus's attempts to secure funding from the Portuguese court because the sure route to the Indies that Dias pioneered made a risky, conjectural western route unnecessary.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; Not finding King [[John II of Portugal]] in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for John's reply. John asked Columbus to go to ''Vale do Paraíso'' north of Lisbon to meet him. Relations between Portugal and Castile were poor at the time. Columbus went to meet with John at ''Vale do Paraíso''. Hearing of Columbus's discoveries, John told him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]].

After spending more than a week in Portugal, and paying his respects to [[Eleanor of Viseu]], Columbus again set sail for Spain. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] was a young boy and a ward of Eleanor's court; it is likely he saw Columbus during this visit.&lt;ref name=murphy /&gt; After departing, and after reportedly being saved from assassins by King John, Columbus crossed the bar of Saltes and entered the harbor of Palos de la Frontera on 15 March 1493. [[Columbus Letter on the First Voyage|Word of his finding new lands]] rapidly spread throughout Europe.

=== Second voyage ===
[[File:Columbus second voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Columbus's second voyage]]

Columbus left the port of [[Cádiz]] on 24 September 1493, with a fleet of [[Columbus's second voyage|17 ships]] carrying 1,200 men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the New World. The passengers included priests, farmers, and soldiers, who would be the new colonists. This reflected the new policy of creating not just "colonies of exploitation", but also "colonies of settlement" from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Baccus, M. Kazim ''Utilization, Misuse, and Development of Human Resources in the Early West Indian Colonies'', Wilfrid Laurier University Press (2 January 2000) {{ISBN|978-0889209824}} pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Modern studies suggest that, as reported by the ''Washington Post'', "crew members may have included free black Africans who arrived in the New World about a decade before the slave trade began."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051701885.html Who Went With Columbus? Dental Studies Give Clues.]". [[The Washington Post]]. 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the first voyage, the fleet stopped at the [[Canary Islands]], from which it departed on 13 October, following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition. On 3 November, Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named [[Dominica]] (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named ''Santa María la Galante''. After sailing past [[Les Saintes]] (''Los Santos'', "The Saints"), he arrived at the island of [[Guadeloupe]], which he named ''[[Santa María de Guadalupe]] de Extremadura'', after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of [[Villuercas]], in [[Guadalupe, Cáceres]], Spain. He explored that island from 4 to 10 November.

Michele da Cuneo, Columbus's childhood friend from [[Savona]], sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: "In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral."&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus,'' Oxford Univ. Press, (1991) pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus named the small island of "Saona&amp;nbsp;... to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Emilio Taviani]], ''Columbus the Great Adventure,'' Orion Books, New York (1991) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The same childhood friend reported in a letter that Columbus had provided one of the captured indigenous women to him. He wrote, "While I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom. I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But—to cut a long story short—I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears.

Pedro de las Casas, father of the priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], also accompanied Columbus on this voyage.&lt;ref name="traboulay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Traboulay|first=David M.|title=Columbus and Las Casas|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0819196422|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2016-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact course of Columbus's voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including:
* [[Montserrat]] (for Santa María de Montserrate, after the Blessed Virgin of the [[Monastery of Montserrat]], which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain),
* [[Antigua]] (after a church in [[Seville]], Spain, called Santa María la Antigua, meaning "Old St. Mary's"),
* [[Redonda]] (''Santa María la Redonda'', Spanish for "St. Mary the Round", owing to the island's shape),
* [[Nevis]] (derived from the Spanish ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'', "Our Lady of the Snows", because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain),
* [[Saint Kitts]] (for [[St. Christopher]], patron of sailors and travelers),
* [[Sint Eustatius]] (for the early Roman martyr, [[Saint Eustace|St. Eustachius]]),
* [[Saba]] (after the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]),
* [[Saint Martin]] (''San Martín''), and
* [[Saint Croix]] (from the Spanish ''Santa Cruz'', meaning "[[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]").{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Columbus also sighted the chain of the [[Virgin Islands]], which he named ''Islas de Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes'', "Islands of [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 Virgins" (shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to ''Islas Vírgenes''). He also named the islands of [[Virgin Gorda]] ("Fat Virgin"), [[Tortola]], and [[Peter Island]] (''San Pedro'').

He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed in [[Puerto Rico]], which he named ''San Juan Bautista'' in honor of [[Saint John the Baptist]] (a name that was later retained only for the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]). One of the first skirmishes between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and Europeans since the time of the Vikings{{sfn|Phillips, Jr|1992}} occurred when Columbus's men rescued two native boys who had just been castrated by their captors in another tribe.

On 22 November, Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit the fort of [[La Navidad]], built during his first voyage and located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]]. Columbus found the fort in ruins, destroyed by the native [[Taíno people|Taino]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/taino/taino-conquest.htm |title=The Spanish Conquest of the Tainos |author=Antonio de la Cova |date= |website=Latin American Studies |publisher=Dr. Antonio Rafael de la Cova |access-date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the 39 Spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the New World.

Columbus then sailed more than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} eastwards along the northern coast of Hispaniola, establishing a new settlement, which he called [[La Isabela]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090319132954.htm Teeth Of Columbus's Crew Flesh Out Tale Of New World Discovery]".

=== Third voyage ===
[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Third voyage]]

According to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. King John reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because "canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journals &amp; Other Documents on the Life &amp; Voyages of Christopher Columbus|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|publisher=The Heritage Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolomé De Las Casas, the first Historians of America|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1903|isbn=|location=New York|pages=379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 1498, Columbus left with [[Columbus's third voyage|six ships]] from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], for his third trip to the New World. Three of the ships headed directly for Hispaniola with much-needed supplies, while Columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the Caribbean islands he had already visited, including a hoped-for passage to continental Asia.&lt;ref name="Minster-3rd"&gt;Christopher Minster, [http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/thevoyagesofcolumbus/p/columbusthird.htm "The Third Voyage of Christopher Columbus"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus led his fleet to the Portuguese island of [[Porto Santo]], his wife's native land. He then sailed to [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain João Gonçalves da Camara, before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. As he crossed the Atlantic, Columbus discovered that the angle between North as indicated by a magnetic compass and North as measured by the position of the [[pole star]] changed with his position (a phenomenon now known as "[[Magnetic declination|compass variation]]"). He would later use his previous measurements of the compass variation to adjust his reckoning.&lt;ref name="EB-online" /&gt;

After being becalmed for several days in the [[doldrums]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus's fleet regained its wind and, dangerously low on water, turned north in the direction of [[Dominica]], which Columbus had visited in his previous voyage. The ships arrived at King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1838, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; After resupplying with food and water, from 4 to 12 August Columbus explored the [[Gulf of Paria]], which separates Trinidad from what is now [[Venezuela]], near the delta of the [[Orinoco River]]. He then touched the mainland of South America at the [[Paria Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Exploring the new continent, Columbus correctly interpreted the enormous quantity of fresh water that the Orinoco delivered into the Atlantic Ocean as evidence that he had reached a large landmass rather than another island. He also speculated that the new continent might be the location of the biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. He then sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island|Margarita]]. He sighted [[Tobago]] (which he named "Bella Forma") and [[Grenada]] (which he named "Concepción").{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In poor health, Columbus returned to [[Hispaniola]] on 19 August, only to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule, claiming that Columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the New World. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish court]], accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. Columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience. He had an economic interest in the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen.&lt;ref name="varela"&gt;Varela ([[#CITEREFVarela2006|2006]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SwtMUtesSDEC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111])&lt;/ref&gt; An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads: "From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Rolwing2002"&gt;{{cite magazine

=== Fourth voyage ===

[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Columbus's fourth voyage]]
[[File:House of Colon COA (2).svg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Coat of Arms]] granted to Christopher Columbus and the [[:es:Colón (familia)|House of Colon]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]] ''[[motu proprio]]'' in 1502.]]
Before leaving for his fourth voyage, Columbus wrote a letter to the Governors of the [[Bank of Saint George]], Genoa, dated at Seville, 2 April 1502.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|title=Letter from Christopher Columbus to the Governors of the Bank of St. George, Genoa.

Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his brother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]] and his 13-year-old son [[Fernando Colón|Fernando]], he left [[Cádiz]] on 11 May 1502, with his flagship ''Santa María''&lt;!--not ''Capitana''; that just means "flagship"--&gt; and the vessels ''Gallega'', ''Vizcaína'', and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue Portuguese soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the [[Moors]].

On 15 June, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (''Martinica''). A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on [[Hispaniola]]. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on 29 June, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the Rio Jaina, the first [[Spanish treasure fleet]] sailed into the hurricane. Columbus's ships survived with only minor damage, while 29 of the 30 ships in the governor's fleet were lost to [[List of Atlantic hurricanes before 1600#1500–1524|a storm on 1 July]]. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea.

After a brief stop at [[Jamaica]], Columbus sailed to Central America, arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bahía department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on 30 July. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as being "long as a galley" and filled with cargo. On 14 August, he landed on the continental mainland at [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]], near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]] Bay in [[Panama]] on 16 October.

On 5 December 1502, Columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal Columbus writes,

{{quote|For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. All this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', Boston, 1942, p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Columbus awes the Jamaican natives by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]] of 1504.]]

In Panama, Columbus learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean, but was told by local leader [[Quibían]] not to go past a certain point down the river. After much exploration, in January 1503, he established a [[garrison]] at the mouth of the [[Belén River]]. On 6 April, one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked by Quibían and the other ships were damaged. [[Shipworm]]s also damaged the ships in tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel. Columbus: The Lost Voyage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus left for Hispaniola on 16 April heading north. On 10 May he sighted the [[Cayman Islands]], naming them "''Las Tortugas''" after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel farther, on 25 June 1503 they were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St.&amp;nbsp;Ann's Bay, Jamaica]].

For one year Columbus and his men remained stranded on [[Jamaica]]. A Spaniard, Diego Méndez, and some natives paddled a [[canoe]] to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The governor, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, won their favor by predicting a [[February 1504 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504]], using [[Abraham Zacuto]]'s astronomical charts.&lt;ref&gt;Joy Jakim, ''The First Americans: Prehistory – 1600 A History of US'' Oxford University Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton J., Drees, ''The Late Medieval Age of Crisis and Renewal: 1300–1500 a Biographical Dictionary'', 2001, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djelal, Kadir, ''Columbus and the Ends of the Earth: Europe's Prophetic Rhetoric As Conquering Ideology'', University of California Press, 1992, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on 29 June 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], on 7 November.

== {{anchor|Accusations of tyranny}} Accusations of tyranny ==
Following his first voyage, Columbus was appointed Viceroy and Governor of the Indies under the terms of the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. In practice, this primarily entailed the administration of the colonies in the island of [[Hispaniola]], whose capital was established in [[Santo Domingo]]. By the end of his third voyage, Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted, his body wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand responded by removing Columbus from power and replacing him with [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]. Bobadilla, who ruled as governor from 1500 until his death in a storm in 1502, had also been tasked by the Court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against Columbus. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away in the explorations of his [[Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]], Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego. Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used [[torture]] and [[mutilation]] to govern Hispaniola. The 48-page report, found in 2006 in the national archive in the Spanish city of [[Simancas]], contains testimonies from 23 people, including both enemies and supporters of Columbus, about the treatment of colonial subjects by Columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule.&lt;ref name=newspaper1 /&gt;

According to the report, Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. Testimony recorded in the report stated that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartolomeo on "defending the family" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that Columbus was of lowly birth.&lt;ref name=newspaper1 /&gt; The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt; he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed and then paraded their [[dismemberment|dismembered]] bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.&lt;ref name=A&amp;E&gt;{{cite web |title=Columbus Controversy |url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/columbus-controversy |publisher= A&amp;E Television Networks |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny," Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian who has seen the document, told journalists.&lt;ref name=newspaper1 /&gt; "Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place."&lt;ref name=newspaper1&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Giles Tremlett]] |title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/07/books.spain |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their gross misgovernance, Columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to Spain from the third voyage. They lingered in jail for six weeks before King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long after, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There, the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Columbus's role as governor. Henceforth [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]] was to be the new governor of the [[West Indies]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Later life ==
[[File:ColumbusHouseOfValladolid.jpg|thumb|upright|Replica of the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', Columbus's flagship during his first voyage, at his [[Valladolid]] house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&amp;record=es098|title=Columbus Monuments Pages: Valladolid|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Columbus had always claimed the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, but he grew increasingly religious in his later years. Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the [[Carthusian]] monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a ''[[Book of Privileges]]'' (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' (1505), in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of Bible prophecy in the context of [[Christian eschatology]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=2}}

In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10 percent of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' ("Columbian lawsuits").

== Illness and death ==
[[File:The death of Columbus.jpg|thumb|''The death of Columbus'', lithograph by L.&amp;nbsp;Prang &amp; Co., 1893]]

During a violent storm on his first return voyage, Columbus, then 41, suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be [[gout]]. In subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be [[influenza]] and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, and prolonged attacks of gout. The suspected attacks increased in duration and severity, sometimes leaving Columbus bedridden for months at a time, and culminated in his death 14 years later.

[[File:Tumba de Colon-Sevilla.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tomb in [[Seville Cathedral]]. The remains are borne by kings of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of León|Leon]], Aragon and [[Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&amp;record=es093|title=Columbus Monuments Pages: Sevilla|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Based on Columbus's lifestyle and the described symptoms, modern doctors suspect that he suffered from [[reactive arthritis]], rather than gout.&lt;ref name=UMD /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoenig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoenig|first=LJ|title=The arthritis of Christopher Columbus|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=February 1992|volume=152|issue=2|pmid=1472175 |doi=10.1001/archinte.1992.00400140028008|pages=274–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive arthritis, previously known as Reiter's syndrome, is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases (primarily chlamydia or [[gonorrhea]]). "It seems likely that [Columbus] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation," writes Dr. Frank C. Arnett, a [[rheumatology|rheumatologist]] and professor of internal medicine, pathology and laboratory medicine the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Columbus Suffered From a Fatal Form of Arthritis|url=http://www.nahfoundation.org/news-and-events/news-releases/2005/christopher-columbus-suffered-from-a-fatal-form-of-arthritis|publisher=University of Maryland School of Medicine|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- AutoEd: rm unicode ctrl char w/no win-1252 mapping, intent unknown --&gt;

On 20 May 1506, aged probably 54, Columbus died in [[Valladolid]], Spain. His remains were first interred at Valladolid, then at the monastery of [[La Cartuja]] in [[Seville]] (southern Spain) by the will of his son [[Diego Colón]], who had been governor of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1542, the remains were transferred to [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Santo Domingo]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]. In 1795, when France took over the entire island of [[Hispaniola]], Columbus's remains were moved to [[Havana]], Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the remains were moved back to Spain, to the [[Cathedral of Seville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm|title=''Cristóbal Colón: traslación de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla'' at Fundación Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|publisher=Cervantesvirtual.com|accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]].

However, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying "Don Christopher Columbus" and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at [[Santo Domingo]] in 1877. To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to Havana and that Columbus's remains had been left buried in the cathedral at [[Santo Domingo]], [[DNA]] samples of the corpse resting in [[Seville]] were taken in June 2003 (''History Today'' August 2003) as well as other DNA samples from the remains of his brother Diego and younger son [[Ferdinand Columbus|Fernando Colón]]. Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tremlett|first1=Giles|title=Young bones lay Columbus myth to rest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/11/spain.science|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=2004-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA extraction proved difficult; only short fragments of [[mitochondrial DNA]] could be isolated. The mitochondrial DNA fragments matched corresponding DNA from Columbus's brother, giving support that both individuals had shared the same mother.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA verifies Columbus' remains in Spain|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12871458/|agency=Associated Press |date=19 May 2006 |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration ==
The anniversary of Columbus's 1492 landing in the Americas is usually observed on 12 October in Spain and throughout the Americas, except Canada. In Spain it is called the ''Fiesta Nacional de España y Día de la Hispanidad'', while a number of countries in Latin America celebrate it as ''Día de la Raza''. In the United States it is called [[Columbus Day]] and is observed annually on the second Monday in October. There are efforts in the US to rename Columbus Day as [[Indigenous Peoples' Day]].

The [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, 1893, commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11369/ |title = Bird's-Eye View of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1893 |accessdate = 17 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration.

The [[United States Postal Service]] participated in the celebration issuing the first US [[Commemorative stamp|''commemorative postage stamps]], a series of 16 postage issues called the [[Columbian Issue]] depicting Columbus, Queen Isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages. The issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations. Under Benjamin Harrison and his Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]] the Columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893. Wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation's first commemorative stamp to Harrison, the Congress and the U.S. Post Office. To demonstrate his confidence in the new Columbian commemorative issues Wanamaker purchased $10,000 worth of stamps with his own money. The Columbian Exposition lasted several months, and over $40&amp;nbsp;million in commemorative postage stamps had been sold.&lt;ref name="JOHN WANAMAKER PMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_rtf/PMGWanamaker.rtf. |publisher=United States Postal Service |title=John Wanamaker, Postmaster General |accessdate=19 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509022126/http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_rtf/PMGWanamaker.rtf |archivedate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 400th anniversary Columbian issues were very popular in the United States. A total of two billion stamps were issued for all the Columbian denominations, and 72 percent of these were the two-cent stamps, "Landing of Columbus", which paid the first-class rate for domestic mail at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Haimann, Alexander T., "2-cent Landing of Columbus", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a second Columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the 500th anniversary, except for the date in the upper right hand corner of each stamp. These issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced. The United States issued the series jointly for the first time with three other countries, Italy in lire, Portugal in escudos and Spain in pesetas.&lt;ref&gt;"Columbian Exposition Souvenir Sheets", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Christopher Columbus came to be considered the discoverer of America in US and European popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced. America was discovered and populated by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|its indigenous population]]. Columbus was not even the first European to reach its shores, having been preceded by [[Erik the Red]] in 10th-century [[Greenland]] and [[Leif Erikson]] in 11th-century [[Vinland]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History – Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, Columbus's efforts brought the Americas to the attention of Europe at a time ripe for Europe to act upon. Thus, Columbus was able to initiate the enduring association between the Earth's two major landmasses and their inhabitants. "Columbus's claim to fame isn't that he got there first," explains historian Martin Dugard, "it's that he stayed."&lt;ref name=dugard&gt;Dugard, Martin. [[The Last Voyage of Columbus]]. Little, Brown and Company: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have traditionally argued that Columbus remained convinced to the very end that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=North America: the historical geography of a changing continent | author1=Thomas F. McIlwraith | author2=Edward K. Muller | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year=2001 | isbn=978-0742500198 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NS0OTXRlTMC&amp;pg=PA35 | page=35 | accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but writer [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] argues that a document in the ''Book of Privileges'' indicates Columbus knew he found a new continent.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick (1991). ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy'', pp. 204–209&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, his journals from the third voyage call the "land of Paria" a "hitherto unknown" continent.&lt;ref name="Zeruvabel2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Terra cognita: the mental discovery of America | author1=Eviatar Zerubavel | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=2003 | isbn=978-0765809872 | pages=90–91 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkLCiKN0x4UC&amp;pg=PA90 | accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his other writings continued to claim that he had reached Asia, such as a 1502 letter to [[Pope Alexander VI]] where he asserted that Cuba was the east coast of Asia.{{sfn|Phillips, Jr|1992|p=227}} He also rationalized that the new continent of South America was the "Earthly Paradise" that was located "at the end of the Orient".&lt;ref name="Zeruvabel2003" /&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what his true beliefs were.

The term "[[pre-Columbian]]" is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and his European successors.

=== Flat Earth mythology ===
Columbus is often credited with refuting a prevalent belief in a flat Earth. However, this legacy is a [[List of common misconceptions|popular misconception]]. To the contrary, the [[Spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] had been known to scholars since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and was common knowledge among sailors. Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the Earth, the [[Erdapfel]], was made in 1492 just before Columbus's return to Europe. As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] |title=Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and modern historians |publisher=Praeger |date=1991 |location=New York |isbn=978-0275959043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== America as a distinct land ===
[[File:1893 Nina Pinta Santa Maria replicas.jpg|thumb|Replicas of ''Niña'', ''Pinta'' and ''Santa María'' sailed from Spain to the [[Chicago Columbian Exposition]]]]

The scholar [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who sailed to America in the years following Columbus's first voyage, was the first to speculate that the land was not part of Asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to Eurasians. His travel journals, published 1502–04, convinced German cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] to reach the same conclusion, and in 1507—a year after Columbus's death—Waldseemüller published a world map [[America (name)|calling the new continent]] ''America'' from Vespucci's Latinized name "Americus". According to Paul Lunde, "The preoccupation of European courts with the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the East partly explains their relative lack of interest in Columbus's discoveries in the West."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199203/piri.reis.and.the.columbus.map.htm Piri Reis and the Columbus Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325213706/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199203/piri.reis.and.the.columbus.map.htm |date=25 March 2009 }}". Paul Lunde. ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]''. May/June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the English had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of the Venetian [[John Cabot]] as a pioneer explorer, but for the emerging United States, Cabot made for a poor national hero. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. The name [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] for "America" first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=5&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285].&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word "Columbia", or simply the name "Columbus", spread rapidly after the American Revolution. Columbus's name was given to the federal capital of the United States ([[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]), the [[capital city|capital cities]] of two U.S. [[U.S. state|states]] ([[Ohio]] and [[South Carolina]]), and the [[Columbia River]]. Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the [[Gran Colombia]], a precursor of the modern [[Republic of Colombia]]. Numerous cities, towns, counties, streets, and plazas (called Plaza Colón or Plaza de Colón throughout Latin America and Spain) have been named after him. A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, celebration of Columbus's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas. Monuments to Columbus like the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and [[Columbus Circle]] in New York City were erected throughout the United States and Latin America extolling him.

In 1909, descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to [[Boalsburg]] near [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], Pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&amp;record=uspa14|title=Columbus Monuments Pages: Boalsburg|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair that the "Admiral of the Ocean Sea" used at his chart table.

=== Criticism and defense in modern scholarship ===
{{See also|Taíno genocide}}

Since the late 20th century, historians have criticized Columbus for initiating colonization and for abuse of  natives.&lt;ref&gt;Bigelow, B. (1992).

Columbus required the natives to pay tribute in gold and cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/04/opinion/l-slavery-and-colonialism-make-up-the-true-legacy-of-columbus-866089.html|title=Opinion: Slavery and Colonialism Make Up the True Legacy of Columbus|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous population declined rapidly, due primarily to the first [[pandemic]] of European endemic diseases, which struck Hispaniola after 1519. The natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities. There is also documentation that they were overworked.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Crosby, ''The Columbian Exchange'', Westport, 1972, pp. 39, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pest"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Austin Alchon|first=Suzanne|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage|title=A Pest in the Land: New World Epidemics in a Global Perspective|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2003|page=62|isbn=978-0826328717|accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, D.L., &amp; Goodman, A.H. (2002). Health conditions before Columbus: paleopathology of native North Americans. ''Western Journal of Medicine'', ''176''(1), 65. "Old World diseases that were not present in the Americas until contact include bubonic plague, measles, smallpox, mumps, chickenpox, influenza, cholera, diphtheria, typhus, malaria, leprosy, and yellow fever.19 Indians in the Americas had no acquired immunity to these infectious diseases, and these diseases caused what Crosby referred to as "virgin soil epidemics," in which all members of a population would be infected simultaneously."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern estimates for the pre-Columbian population of [[Hispaniola]] are around 250,000–300,000. According to the historian [[Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes]], by 1548, 56 years after Columbus landed, fewer than 500 Taíno were living on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby (1972), ''The Columbian Exchange'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slavery and serfdom ====
The natives of the island were systematically subjugated via the ''[[encomienda]]'' system implemented by Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeager|first=Timothy J.|date=1995|title=Encomienda or Slavery?

When natives on Hispaniola began fighting back against their oppressors in 1495, Columbus's men captured 1,500 [[Arawak]] men, women, and children in a single raid. The strongest were transported to Spain to be sold as slaves;&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=John|title=Columbus: For Gold, God and Glory|publisher=Madison Press Books|isbn=978-0670837250|page=183|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40 percent of the 500 shipped died en route.&lt;ref name="Zinn" /&gt; Historian [[James W. Loewen]] asserts that "Columbus not only sent the first slaves across the Atlantic, he probably sent more slaves—about five thousand—than any other individual."{{sfn|Loewen|1995|pp=57–58}}

According to Spanish colonist and Dominican friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]'s contemporary ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', when slaves held in captivity began to die at high rates, Columbus ordered all natives over the age of thirteen to pay a hawk's bell full of gold powder every three months. Natives who brought this amount to the Spanish were given a copper token to hang around their necks. The Spanish amputated the hands of those without tokens, and left them to bleed to death.&lt;ref name="Zinn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koning"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oxa-SjBh_cYC|title=Columbus|last=Koning|first=Hans|date=1976|publisher=Monthly Review Press|isbn=978-0853456001|page=86|ref=Koning|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of natives committed suicide by poison to escape their persecution.&lt;ref name=dyson/&gt;

==== Violence towards Natives and Spanish colonists ====
During his brief reign Columbus was reported to have executed Spanish colonists for minor crimes as well as use [[dismemberment]] as another form of punishment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-christopher-columbus/2015/10/08/3e80f358-6d23-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html|title=Five myths about Christopher Columbus|last=Lane|first=Kris|date=8 Oct 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus's soldiers killed and enslaved with impunity at every landing. When Columbus fell ill in 1495, "what little restraint he had maintained over his men disappeared as he went through a lengthy period of recuperation. The troops went wild, stealing, killing, raping, and torturing natives, trying to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stannard|first=David E.|authorlink=David Stannard|title=American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195085570|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzFsODcGjfcC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=21 November 2018|ref=Stannard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Las Casas, 50,000 natives perished during this period. Upon his recovery, Columbus organized his troops' efforts, forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs. Dogs were used to hunt down natives who attempted to flee.&lt;ref name=dyson/&gt; Columbus's men tore across the land, killing thousands of sick and unarmed natives. Soldiers would use their captives for sword practice, attempting to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stannard|first=David E.|title=American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195085570|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzFsODcGjfcC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=1 May 2015|ref=Stannard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arawaks attempted to fight back against Columbus's men but lacked their armor, guns, swords, and horses. When taken prisoner, they were hanged or burned to death. Desperation led to mass suicides and infanticide among the natives. In just two years under Columbus's governorship, over 125,000 of the 250,000–300,000 natives in Haiti were dead,&lt;ref name=Zinn /&gt; and in three decades, "virtually every member of the gentle race ... had been wiped out."&lt;ref name=dyson/&gt; Disease, warfare and harsh enslavement contributed to the depopulation.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W.

Indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1500 colonists who accompanied Columbus's second expedition in 1493.

By the end of 1494, disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the Spanish settlers.&lt;ref name="pest" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W.

Some historians have argued that, while brutal, Columbus was simply a product of his time, and being a figure of the 15th century, should not be judged by the morality of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/08/nyregion/in-person-in-defense-of-columbus.html|title=In Person; In Defense Of Columbus|last=Fusco|first=Mary Ann Castronovo|date=8 Oct 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an abundance of artwork involving Christopher Columbus exists, no [[Authentication|authentic]] contemporary [[portrait]] has been found.&lt;ref&gt;Alden, Henry Mills. ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]''. Volume 84, Issues 499–504. Published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]], 1892. Originally from [[Harvard University]]. Digitized on 16 December 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mk49AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA732 732]. Retrieved on 8 September 2009. 'Major, Int. Letters of Columbus, ixxxviii., says "Not one of the so-called portraits of Columbus is unquestionably authentic." They differ from each other, and cannot represent the same person.'&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Loewen]], author of ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]'', believes the various posthumous portraits have no historical value.{{sfn|Loewen|1995|p=55}}

Sometime between 1531 and 1536, [[Alejo Fernández]] painted an altarpiece, ''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'', that includes a depiction of Columbus. The painting was commissioned for a chapel in Seville's [[Casa de Contratación]] (House of Trade) and remains there, as the earliest known painting about the discovery of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;John Noble, Susan Forsyth, Vesna Maric, Paula Hardy. Andalucía. Lonely Planet, 2007, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Biesele Hall, Teresa Eckmann. ''Mary, mother and warrior'', University of Texas Press, 2004, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], 71 alleged portraits of Columbus were displayed; most did not match contemporary descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', pp. 47–48, Boston 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; These writings describe him as having reddish or blond hair, which turned to white early in his life, light colored eyes,&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé de Las Casas, ''Historia de las Indias'', ed. Agustín Millares Carlo, 3 vols. (Mexico City, 1951), book 1, chapter 2, 1:29. ''The Spanish word garzos is now usually translated as "light blue," but it seems to have connoted light grey-green or hazel eyes to Columbus's contemporaries. The word rubio can mean "blonde," "fair," or "ruddy." The Worlds of Christopher Columbus'' by William D. and Carla Rahn Phillips, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being a lighter-skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red. Accounts consistently describe Columbus as a large and physically strong man of some {{convert|6|ft|m|2|spell=in|abbr=off}} or more in height, easily taller than the average European of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/dna-tests.htm|title=DNA Tests on Christopher Columbus' bones, on his relatives and on Genoese and Catalan claimants|accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most iconic image of Columbus is a portrait by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], which has been reproduced in many textbooks. It agrees with descriptions of Columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair, but the painting dates from 1519 and cannot, therefore, have been painted from life. Furthermore, the inscription identifying the subject as Columbus was probably added later, and the face shown differs from other images, including that of the "Virgin of the Navigators."&lt;ref name="Met-Piombo"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/437645 "Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus (born about 1446, died 1506)"], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CrimeStat''' is a [[crime mapping]] software program. CrimeStat is Windows-based program that conducts spatial and statistical analysis and is designed to interface with a [[geographic information system]] (GIS). The program is developed by Ned Levine &amp; Associates under the direction of Ned Levine, with funding by the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ), an agency of the [[United States Department of Justice]].   The program and manual are distributed for free by NIJ.

CrimeStat performs spatial analysis on objects located in a GIS.  The objects can be points (e.g., events, locations), zones (e.g., blocks, traffic analysis zones, cities) or lines (e.g., street segments).  The program can analyze the distribution of the objects, identify hot spots, indicate spatial autocorrelation, monitor the interaction of events in space and time, and model travel behavior.

There is a regression module for non-linear spatial modeling. Some of its tools are specific to crime analysis.  Others can by applied in many fields.  There are 55 statistical routines in the program.

==Development==
[[Image:CrimeStat Head Bang.png|thumb|450px|'Head Bang' smoothing of Houston burglary rate produced by CrimeStat Head Bang interpolation routine.]]

CrimeStat has been developed since the mid-1990s.  The first prototype was a Unix-based C++ program called Pointstat that was developed to analyze motor vehicle crashes in Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, N. "Spatial statistics and GIS: software tools to quantify spatial patterns", ''Journal of the American Planning Association''. 1996. 62 (3), 381-392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, N., Kim, K. E., &amp; Nitz, L. H. (1995). "Spatial analysis of Honolulu motor vehicle crashes: I. Spatial patterns".  ''Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention'', 27 (5), 663-674.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the National Institute of Justice funded the first version of CrimeStat and the early Pointstat routines were folded into the program.

The first version (1.0) was released in August 1999: the latest version is 3.3 (July 2010).

* Up to version 3.1, CrimeStat was developed by [[Long Doan]] of [[Doan Consulting]], Falls Church, VA.
* Beginning at version 2.0, and solely from version 3.2, CrimeStat was developed by [[Haiyan Teng]] of Houston, TX.

==Functionality==

===Data setup===

CrimeStat can input data both attribute and GIS files but requires that all datasets have geographical coordinates assigned for the objects.  The basic file format is dBase (dbf) but shape (shp), and Ascii text files can also be read. The program requires a Primary File but many routines also use a Secondary File. CrimeStat uses three coordinate systems: spherical (longitude, latitude), projected and directional (angles).

Distance can be measured as direct, indirect ([[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan]]) or on a network (which also allows travel time or speed to be used). Distance units are decimal degrees for spherical coordinates and feet, meters, miles, kilometers, or nautical miles for projected coordinates. The program can create reference grids. Several routines also use the area of the geographical region for their calculations.

===Statistical routines===

The '''spatial description''' routines include:

*''[[Spatial descriptive statistics|Spatial distribution]]'' statistics (mean center, standard deviation ellipse, center of minimum distance, median center, directional mean, convex hull)
*''[[Spatial analysis#Spatial autocorrelation|Spatial autocorrelation]]'' statistics for zonal data ([[Moran's I]], [[Getis's G]], [[Getis-Ord Global G]], Moran correlogram, Geary correlogram, Getis-Ord correlogram),
*''Distance-based statistics'' among points ([[k-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest neighbor]] analysis, [[Spatial descriptive statistics#Ripley.27s K and L functions|Ripley’s "K"]], the allocation and summation of Primary File points to Secondary File points, and various distance calculation matrices), and
*''[[Cluster analysis]]'' statistics for points, zones or lines.  CrimeStat has a range of routines available for cluster identification:

[[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations can be run on many routines to estimate [[credible interval]]s.

The '''spatial modeling''' routines include:

The '''Crime Travel Demand''' module models crime travel over a metropolitan area.  It is an application of [[Transportation forecasting|travel demand]] modeling to crime or other rare events.&lt;ref&gt;Hensher, D.  A. &amp; Button, K. J. (2002). ''Handbook of Transport Modeling''.

===Output===

CrimeStat has three different types of output:
* Screen output that displays the results once the calculations are finished.  These can be saved to a text file.
* Non-graphical output for many routines in either dBase DBF or Ascii text format.
* Graphical output for many routines to allow the calculated objects to be displayed in a GIS.  Currently, the graphical output formats include [[Esri]] SHP, [[MapInfo Interchange Format]] (MIF/MID), Surfer for Windows DAT, and Ascii text formats.

==Shortcomings==
Unlike some other spatial statistics programs, CrimeStat has no mapping capabilities and must be used with GIS software.  Some users have found that the GUI interface is difficult to understand and inconsistent between routines.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Because CrimeStat analyzes points in most routines, its results are not always consistent with those of software that analyzes areas (e.g. [[GeoDa]]).  Finally, the size of the manual may be daunting to new users of spatial statistics.

==Ancillary CrimeStat development==

In addition to the development of the CrimeStat program, all the routines through{{clarify|reason=is this "upto", "from" or "only"|date=July 2012}} version 2.0 plus the spatial autocorrelation routines have been converted into .NET libraries for use in third-party applications.  Version 1.0 of the CrimeStat Libraries was released in August 2010 and is available on the CrimeStat web page.

==Reviews and examples==

Reviews and examples of CrimeStat in its application to crime analysis have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Brodsky, H.  (2002). “CrimeStat II on the geostatistical scene”. ''Geospatial Solutions'', November. 49-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulsen, D. &amp; Robinson, M. (2008).''Spatial Aspects of Crime: Theory and Practice'' (2nd edition). Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chainey, S. &amp; Ratcliffe, J. (2005). ''GIS and Crime Mapping''.  John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of the use of CrimeStat outside of crime analysis have also appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Lai PC, Low CT, Wong M, Wong WC, &amp; Chan MH. (2009). “Spatial analysis of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong”, ''International Journal of Health Geography'',  17:8-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Smith, M. J., Goodchild, M. F., &amp; Longley, P. A. (2007). ''Geospatial Analysis'' (second edition). The Winchelsea Press: Leicester, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne van der Veen, A.

===Use of CrimeStat by Baltimore County Police analysts===
Baltimore County Police analysts use CrimeStat to perform various spatial analytics.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The primary responsibility of police analysts in Baltimore County is to identify and address existing or anticipated crime problems. Police analysts use “hot spot analysis” in CrimeStat to identify areas within the county having high concentrations of crime. Another example demonstrating the use of CrimeStat involves the department’s Data Driven Approaches to Crime and Traffic Safety (DDACTS).

Police analysts used Nearest Neighbor Hierarchical Spatial clustering to identify areas having high concentrations of crime and traffic accidents. Analysts found that the two cluster groups, crime and accidents, did tend to overlap in many areas of the county. The County’s DDACTS program was initiated to increase police presence in the target areas. Preliminary results have been encouraging, with most targeted crimes and traffic accidents dropping in DDACTS areas.

The Department’s DDACTS program has since become a model nationwide with the support of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Finally, police analysts have used CrimeStat’s Journey to Crime and Bayesian Journey to Crime Estimation models to successfully identify a serial offender’s activity space. Once an offender’s activity space has been identified, police analysts will examine information captured from other police sources such as traffic stops, Field Interview Reports, and License Plate Readers to determine if a contact was made with a potential offender.

Police have also used CrimeStat’s Crime Travel Demand model to identify road networks used by drivers under the influence (DUI). Roadways identified by the Crime Travel Demand model were targeted for interdiction programs by the department’s DUI Enforcement Team. Similar weighted road networks have been used in conjunction with Journey to Crime models to improve identification of an offender’s activity space.

'''De Immigrant''' is a windmill located in [[Fulton, Illinois]], built on a flood-control dike on the [[Mississippi River]]. The City of Fulton contracted Molema Millbuilders, Havenga Construction, and Lowlands Management on December 4, 1998 to construct a Dutch windmill, to be fabricated by native millwrights in the Netherlands and shipped to Fulton for assembly. Two months later, construction began with thirty metric tons of wood. The construction took place in phases, and the tower, cap, sails, and machinery were all put together on November 19, 1999. On May 5, 2001, De Immigrant officially began grinding wheat, buckwheat, rye, and cornmeal.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, Thomas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11569">The '''Earth Observing System Data and Information System''' ('''EOSDIS''') is a key core capability in [[NASA]]’s Earth Science Data Systems Program. It is a comprehensive data and information system designed to perform a wide variety of functions in support of a heterogeneous national and international user community. EOSDIS provides a spectrum of services; some services are intended for a diverse group of casual users while others are intended only for a select cadre of research scientists chosen by NASA's peer-reviewed competitions, and then many fall somewhere in between. The primary services provided by EOSDIS are User Support, Data Archive, Management and Distribution, Information Management, and Product Generation, all of which are managed by the [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/esdis-project Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/science-system-description/eosdis-services|title=EOSDIS Services {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-08-25}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA network capabilities transport the data to the science operations facilities. EOSDIS consists of a set of processing facilities and Earth Science Data Centers (referred to as [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/daacs Distributed Active Archive Centers], or DAACs) distributed across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/|title=Earth Science Data  - NASA Science|website=science.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processing facilities and DAACs serve hundreds of thousands of users around the world, providing hundreds of millions of data files each year covering many Earth science disciplines. The EOSDIS project as of September 2012 reported it contained approximately 10 PB of data in its database with ingestion of approximately 8.5 TB daily.

The remaining capabilities of EOSDIS constitute the EOSDIS Science Operations, which are managed by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project. These capabilities include: generation of higher level (Level 1-4) science data products for EOS missions; archiving and distribution of data products from EOS and other satellite missions, as well as aircraft and field measurement campaigns. The EOSDIS science operations are performed within a distributed system of many interconnected nodes ([https://earthdata.nasa.gov/sips Science Investigator-led Processing Systems] and distributed, [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/discipline discipline-specific], Earth science [[data center]]s) with specific responsibilities for production, archiving, and distribution of [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data Earth science data products]. The distributed data centers serve a large and diverse user community (as indicated by EOSDIS performance metrics) by providing capabilities to search and access science data products and specialized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTIrAAAAYAAJ|title=Panel to Review EOSDIS Plans: Final Report|date=1994-01-01|publisher=[[National Academies]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From early 1980 through 1986, NASA supported pilot data system studies to assess the feasibility and development of publicly accessible electronic data systems. Part of the congressional approval of the EOS mission in 1990 included the NASA Earth Science Enterprise, which supported the development of a long-term data and information system (EOSDIS). This system would be accessible to both the science research community and the broader public, built on a distributed open architecture. With these functional requirements for space operations control and product generation for EOS, the EOSDIS would also be responsible for the data archival, management, and distribution of all NASA Earth science mission instrument data during the mission life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/10944/chapter/14|title=EOSDIS Lessons Learned - Climate Data Records from Environmental Satellites: Interim Report - The National Academies Press|page=124|doi=10.17226/10944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of Search ==
=== Data Center Search &amp; Order Tools ===
Each EOSDIS Data Center is distinguished from one another by their specific Earth system science discipline. In addition to the search-and-order capabilities provided by the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) and the Common Metadata Repository (or CMR, which has replaced the former EOS Clearinghouse, or ECHO), the data centers have individual online systems that allow them to provide unique services for users of a particular type of data. The center-specific systems emphasize data products, services, and data-handling tools unique to the data center.

[https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/tools Data Center-specific search tools]

=== GCMD - Dataset Directory ===
The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) is a directory to Earth science data and services. The GCMD database currently holds more than 30,000 Earth science data sets and service descriptions covering all aspects of Earth and environmental sciences. One can use the search box or select from the available keywords to search for data and services.
ECHO - Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for Search and Order

[http://gcmd.nasa.gov/ Global Change Master Directory]

=== The Common Metadata Repository (CMR) (formerly the EOS ClearingHouse (ECHO)) - Tailored client software ===
CMR is a [[metadata]] catalog of NASA's EOS data and a registry for related data services (e.g. reformatting, [[pattern recognition]]). CMR's catalog contains more than 3200 data sets held at 12 EOSDIS data centers. Users can access the data and services by using general or community-tailored clients that access CMR using a series of [[Application Program Interface]]s (APIs) defined using web services.

=== Earthdata ===
Earthdata will replace Reverb as EOSDIS's web-based client for discovering and ordering cross-discipline data from all of CMR's metadata holdings in January 2018. Earthdata allows users, including those without specific knowledge of the data, to search science data holdings, retrieve high-level descriptions of data sets and detailed descriptions of the data inventory, view browse images, and submit orders via CMR to the appropriate data providers.

==Distributed Active Archive Centers==

A '''Distributed Active Archive Center''' ('''DAAC''') is a part of EOSDIS. DAACs process, archive, document, and distribute data from NASA's past and current [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) satellites and field measurement programs. Each of the twelve data centers serves one or more specific Earth science disciplines and provides its user community with data products, data information, user services, and tools unique to its particular science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">'''Forgotten New York''' is a website created by Kevin Walsh in 1999, chronicling the unnoticed and unchronicled aspects of [[New York City]] such as painted building ads, decades-old castiron lampposts, 18th-century houses, abandoned subway stations, trolley track remnants, out-of-the-way neighborhoods, and flashes of nature hidden in the midst of the big city.&lt;ref name="gg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/fea/20070319/202/2123|title=The Price of Progress?|accessdate=2008-03-03|date=1997-03-19|work=Gotham Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[HarperCollins]] approached Walsh with the idea of turning the website into a book; ''Forgotten New York'' was published in September 2006.

Walsh released ''Forgotten Queens'', a collaboration with the Greater Astoria Historical Society, in December 2013 on Arcadia Books, is currently working on a ''Forgotten NY'' e-book, and plans a Forgotten NY app. He is also currently working on other projects within the site as well, such as a Forgotten Boston website.

On March 2, 2015, the [[Guides Association of New York City]] awarded Forgotten New York its first Outstanding New York Website award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/nyregion/thecity/29shad.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1|title=Children of Darkness|accessdate=2008-03-03|date=2007-07-29|author= Gibberd, Ben|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Forgotten New York: Views of a Lost Metropolis| last=Walsh| first=Kevin| year=2006| pages=384| publisher=Collins| isbn=0060754001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GPSBabel''' is a cross-platform, [[free software]] to transfer routes, tracks, and waypoint data to and from consumer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] units, and to convert between over a hundred types of GPS data formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpsbabel.org/capabilities.shtml GPSBabel Supported formats]&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[command-line interface|command-line]] interface and a [[graphical user interface|graphical interface]] for Windows, [[MacOS]], and  Linux users.

GPSBabel is part of many Linux distributions including [[Debian]] GNU/Linux and [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]], and also part of the '[[fink]]' system for getting Unix software on [[Mac OS X]]. The most current, official version is always on the official [https://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html GPSBabel download] site.  

== Applications ==
Many contributors to [[OpenStreetMap]] use GPSBabel to convert GPS track data from proprietary formats to the [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]] format OpenStreetMap requires.

GPSBabel is popular in the [[Geocaching]] community because it enables people with incompatible GPS units to share data.

[[Geographic information system|Geographic information system (GIS)]] applications such as [[QGIS]] and [[GRASS GIS|Grass]] use GPSBabel for many import and export operations and processing.

Photographers frequently use GPSBabel for [[geotagging]] images, associating location with photographs. This relies on [[GPS tracking unit|GPS data loggers]], either external or internal to the camera.

GPSBabel enables owners of many different brands of GPS units to view their GPS data in several popular consumer map programs, such as [[Google Earth]] and [[Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips]].

'''Geographic Center of Taiwan''' ({{zh|c=臺灣地理中心|p=Táiwān dìlǐ zhōngxīn}}) is the center point of [[Taiwan]] Island located in [[Puli, Nantou|Puli Township]], [[Nantou County]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://synapticism.com/the-geographic-center-of-taiwan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Geographic Center of Taiwan monument was constructed at the base of Mount Hutou (虎頭山) in the 1970s. Using a more modern [[Topographic map|land survey]] technique, a newer monument was built later on at the peak of the mountain.

==Architecture==
The first monument features an inscription by former President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. There are concentric steel rings on top of the monument pole, forming the basis of Puli Township logo.

The current monument was built with [[Taiwanese aborigines|aborigines]] architectural style of columns with flare tops. The monument was built on the former site of Yoshitaka Shrine built by the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese]].

The '''Gobi Desert''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ɡ|oʊ|.|b|i}}) is a large [[desert]] region in [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Troy|last2=Rueff|first2=Henri|last3=Middleton|first3=Nick|date=2015-01-26|title=Contraction of the Gobi Desert, 2000–2012|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/2/1346|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1346–1358|doi=10.3390/rs70201346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers parts of [[North China|northern]] and [[Northwest China|northwestern China]], and of southern [[Mongolia]]. The desert basins of the Gobi are bounded by the [[Altai Mountains]] and the grasslands and [[steppe]]s of Mongolia on the north, by the [[Taklamakan Desert]] to the west, by the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the southwest, and by the [[North China Plain]] to the southeast. The Gobi is notable in history as part of the great [[Mongol Empire]], and as the location of several important cities along the [[Silk Road]].

The Gobi is a [[rain shadow]] desert, formed by the [[Tibetan Plateau]] blocking precipitation from the [[Indian Ocean]] reaching the Gobi territory.

==Geography==
The Gobi measures over {{convert|1600|km|-2|abbr=on}} from southwest to northeast and {{convert|800|km|-2|abbr=on}} from north to south. The desert is widest in the west, along the line joining the [[Lake Bosten]] and the [[Lop Nor]] (87°–89° east). It occupies an arc of land {{convert|1295000|km2|-3|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite book 
  |editor-first=John W.|editor-last=Wright|year=2006|title=The New York Times Almanac|edition=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-14-303820-7|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; in area as of 2007; it is the fifth-largest desert in the world and Asia's [[List of deserts by area|second largest]]. Much of the Gobi is not sandy but has exposed bare rock.

In its broadest definition, the Gobi includes the long stretch of desert extending from the foot of the [[Pamirs]] (77° east) to the [[Greater Khingan]] Mountains, 116°-118° east, on the border of [[Manchuria]]; and from the foothills of the Altay, [[Sayan Mountains|Sayan]], and [[Yablonoi Mountains|Yablonoi]] mountain ranges on the north to the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], [[Altyn-Tagh]], and [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountain ranges, which form the northern edges of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hare|first=John|date=2009-11-01|title=The Mysteries of the Gobi Desert|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=40|issue=3|pages=408–417|doi=10.1080/03068370903195196|issn=0306-8374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively large area on the east side of the Greater Khingan range, between the upper waters of the [[Songhua]] (Sungari) and the upper waters of the Liao-ho, is reckoned to belong to the Gobi by conventional usage. Some [[geographer]]s and [[ecology|ecologists]] prefer to regard the western area of the Gobi region (as defined above): the [[Tarim Basin|basin of the Tarim]] in [[Xinjiang]] and the desert basin of Lop Nor and Hami ([[Kumul (city)|Kumul]]), as forming a separate and independent desert, called the [[Taklamakan Desert]].

Archeologists and paleontologists have done excavations in the [[Nemegt Basin]] in the northwestern part of the Gobi Desert (in Mongolia), which is noted for its fossil treasures, including [[Prehistoric mammal|early mammals]], [[dinosaur eggs]], and prehistoric [[Stone tool|stone implements]], some 100,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kielan-Jaworowska|first=Zofia|date=1975|title=Late Cretaceous Mammals and Dinosaurs from the Gobi Desert: Fossils excavated by the Polish-Mongolian Paleontological Expeditions of 1963–71 cast new light on primitive mammals and dinosaurs and on faunal interchange between Asia and North America|jstor=27845359|journal=American Scientist|volume=63|issue=2|pages=150–159|doi=10.2307/27845359|doi-broken-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gobi is overall a cold desert, with frost and occasionally snow occurring on its [[dune]]s. Besides being quite far north, it is also located on a plateau roughly {{convert|910|–|1520|m|ft|-1}} above sea level, which contributes to its low temperatures. An average of approximately {{convert|194|mm}} of rain falls annually in the Gobi. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the [[Siberia]]n Steppes. These winds may cause the Gobi to reach {{convert|-40|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|45|C|F}} in summer.&lt;ref name="bbcpe"&gt;''Planet Earth'', BBC TV series 2006 UK, 2007 US, "Episode 5".&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[climate]] of the Gobi is one of great extremes, combined with rapid changes of temperature of as much as {{convert|35|C-change}}. These can occur not only seasonally but within 24 hours.

In southern Mongolia, the temperature has been recorded as low as {{convert|−32.8|°C}}. In contrast, in [[Alxa League|Alxa]], Inner Mongolia, it rises as high as {{convert|37|°C}} in July.

Average winter minimums are a frigid {{convert|&amp;minus;21|°C}}, while summertime maximums are a warm {{convert|27|°C}}. Most of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gobiproject.weebly.com/climate.html|title=Climate|website=The Gobi Desert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the southeast [[monsoon]]s reach the southeast parts of the Gobi, the area throughout this region is generally characterized by extreme dryness, especially during the winter, when the [[Siberian anticyclone]] is at its strongest. The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this [[monsoon]] activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, the icy [[Dust storm|sandstorms]] and [[Winter storm|snowstorms]] of spring and early summer plus early January (winter).

The Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossil finds, including the first [[dinosaur eggs]].

Despite the harsh conditions, these deserts and the surrounding regions sustain many animals, including [[black-tailed gazelle]]s, [[marbled polecat]]s, [[wild Bactrian camel]]s, [[Mongolian wild ass]] and [[Plover|sandplover]]s. They are occasionally visited by [[snow leopard]]s, [[brown bear]]s, and [[Wolf|wolves]]. [[Lizard]]s are especially well-adapted to the climate of the Gobi Desert, with approximately 30 species distributed across its southern Mongolian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keqin|first=Gao|last2=Norell|first2=Mark A.|date=2000-03-01|title=Taxonomic composition and systematics of late Cretaceous lizard assemblages from Ukhaa Tolgod and adjacent localities|journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=249|pages=1–118|doi=10.1206/0003-0090(2000)2492.0.CO;2|issn=0003-0090|doi-broken-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common vegetation in the Gobi desert are shrubs adapted to drought.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Ji-Liang|last2=Li|first2=Feng-Rui|last3=Liu|first3=Chang-An|last4=Liu|first4=Qi-Jun|date=2012-09-01|title=Influences of shrub vegetation on distribution and diversity of a ground beetle community in a Gobi desert ecosystem|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|language=en|volume=21|issue=10|pages=2601–2619|doi=10.1007/s10531-012-0320-4|issn=0960-3115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shrubs included [[gray sparrow's saltwort]] (''Salsola passerina''), [[gray sagebrush]], and low grasses such as [[needle grass]] and [[bridlegrass]]. Due to livestock grazing, the amount of shrubs in the desert has decreased.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including [[Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park]], [[Great Gobi A Strictly Protected Area|Great Gobi A]] and [[Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area]].

The area is vulnerable to trampling by [[livestock]] and off-road vehicles (effects from human intervention are greater in the eastern Gobi Desert, where rainfall is heavier and may sustain livestock). In Mongolia, grasslands have been degraded by goats, which are raised by nomadic herders as source of [[cashmere wool]].&lt;ref&gt;Yiruhan, I. (2001). Changes in floristic composition of grasslands according to grazing intensity in inner Mongolia, China. ''Journal of Japanese Society of Grassland Science,'' ''47'', 362-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large copper deposits are being mined by [[Rio Tinto Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oyu Tol|url=https://www.riotinto.com/copperanddiamonds/oyu-tolgoi-4025.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine was and remains controversial. There was significant opposition in Mongolia's parliament to the terms under which the mine will proceed, and some are calling for the terms to be renegotiated. Specifically, the contention revolves primarily around the question of whether negotiations were fair (Rio Tinto is far better resourced) and whether Rio Tinto will pay adequate taxes on the revenues it derives from the mine (an agreement was reached whereby the operation will be exempt from [[Windfall tax (Mongolia)|windfall tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-20/rio-to-open-mammoth-mongolian-mine/4381178|accessdate=2012-11-20|title=Rio set to open mammoth Mongolian mine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desertification==
The Gobi Desert is expanding at an alarming rate, in a process known as [[desertification]]. The expansion is particularly rapid on the southern edge into China, which has seen {{convert|3600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of grassland overtaken every year by the Gobi Desert. Dust storms, which used to occur regularly in China, have increased in frequency in the past 20 years, mainly due to desertification. They have caused further damage to China's agriculture economy.

The northern and eastern boundaries between desert and grassland are constantly changing. This is mostly due to the climate conditions before the growing season, which influence the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] and subsequent plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;F. Yu, K. P. Price, J. Ellis, J. J. Feddema, P. Shi (2004). "Interannual variations of the grassland boundaries bordering the eastern edges of the Gobi Desert in central Asia". International Journal of Remote Sensing. 25: 327–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the Gobi is attributed mostly to human activities, notably [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]], and depletion of water resources. China has tried various plans to slow the expansion of the desert, which have met with some small degree of success, but no major effects. The most recent project is called the [[Three-North Shelter Forest Program]], huge strips of newly planted forests; the government hopes the forests will help stabilize the soil, retain moisture, and act as a buffer against further desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parungo|first1=Farn|last2=Zhe|first2=Li|last3=Xingsheng|first3=LI|last4=Yang|first4=Dongzeng|last5=Harris|first5=Joyce|title=Gobi dust storms and The Great Green Wall|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=1994-06-01|volume=21|issue=11|pages=999–1002|doi=10.1029/94GL00879|issn=1944-8007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecoregions==
The Gobi, broadly defined, can be divided into five distinct dry [[ecoregions]], based on variations in climate and topography:

* '''Eastern Gobi desert steppe''', the easternmost of the Gobi ecoregions, covering an area of {{convert|281800|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.
* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.
* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.
* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.
* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].

===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===
[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]
The surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000–1100&amp;nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by "bays" of the lowlands.

As the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.

The altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''. The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).

This great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.

===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===
The southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hsi-tau]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.

"Topographically," says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], "it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea." He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&amp;nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').

===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===
{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'—that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1973), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}–{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or "Salt Desert". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.

The Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.

In many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.

To the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grumm-Grzhimaylo|Grumm-Grzhimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.

In 91° east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the écheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].

==History==

===European exploration until 1911===
The Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert. Among the European explorers who contributed to early-20th-century understanding of the Gobi, the most important were the following:

* [[Jean-François Gerbillon]] (1688–1698)
* [[Eberhard Isbrand Ides]] (1692–1694)
* [[Lorenz Lange]] (1727–1728 and 1736)
* Fuss and [[Alexander G. von Bunge]] (1830–1831)
* [[Hermann Fritsche]] (1868–1873)
* [[Pavlinov]] and [[Z.L. Matusovski]] (1870)
* [[Ney Elias]] (1872–1873)
* [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]] (1870–1872 and 1876–1877)
* [[Zosnovsky]] (1875)
* [[Mikhail V. Pevtsov]] (1878)
* [[Grigory Potanin]] (1877 and 1884–1886)
* [[Count Béla Széchenyi]] and [[Lajos Lóczy]] (1879–1880)
* The brothers [[G. E. Grumm-Grshimailo]] (1889–1890) and ? Grumm-Grshimailo.
* [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]] (1893–1894 and 1899–1900)
* [[Vsevolod I. Roborovsky]] (1894)
* [[Vladimir Obruchev]] (1894–1896)
* [[Karl Josef Futterer]] and [[Dr. Holderer]] (1896)
* [[Charles-Etienne Bonin]] (1896 and 1899)
* [[Sven Hedin]] (1897 and 1900–1901)
* [[K. Bogdanovich]] (1898)
* [[Ladyghin]] (1899–1900) and [[Katsnakov]] (1899–1900)
* Count [[Jacques Bouly de Lesdain]] and Martha Mailey, 1902.&lt;ref name="romancegone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Romance Gone, Given Divorce|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/57729910/?terms=%22jacques%2Bde%2Blesdain%22|accessdate=October 4, 2016|work=The Evening News|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|date=July 28, 1926|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes|quote=In 1902, while Lesdain was leading an expedition through the Gobi desert, he crossed the path of another explorer.

'''Haunted highways or roads''' refer to streets, roads or highways which are the subject of folklore and [[urban legends]], including rumors and reports of ghostly apparitions, ghostly figures, [[phantom hitchhiker]]s, [[phantom vehicle]]s, repeating or looping highways, or other [[paranormal]] phenomena.

==Legends==
===Annie's Road, United States===
Annie's Road in [[New Jersey]] is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a woman killed on the road many years ago. It is located in [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]] on the first half of Riverview Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lostinjersey.com/spooky/annie.html |title=Lost in Jersey |publisher=Lost in Jersey |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-1 alpha-2''' [[code]]s are two-letter [[country code]]s defined in [[ISO 3166-1]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), to represent [[country|countries]], [[dependent territory|dependent territories]], and special areas of geographical interest. They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO (the others being [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|alpha-3]] and [[ISO 3166-1 numeric|numeric]]), and are used most prominently for the [[Internet]]'s [[country code top-level domain]]s (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref name="iso3166-info"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html| title=Country Codes - ISO 3166| publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used as country identifiers extending the postal code when appropriate within the international postal system for paper mail, and has replaced the previous one consisting one-letter codes. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.

==Uses and applications==
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in different environments and are also part of other standards. In some cases they are not perfectly implemented.

===Imperfect implementations===
Starting in 1985, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes have been used in the [[Domain Name System]] as [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs). The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] currently assigns the ccTLDs mostly following the alpha-2 codes, but with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/| title=IANA &amp;ndash; Root Zone Database| publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United Kingdom]], whose alpha-2 code is {{mono|GB}}, uses [[.uk]] instead of [[.gb]] as its ccTLD, as {{mono|UK}} is currently [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptionally reserved]] in ISO 3166-1 on the request of the United Kingdom.

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] coding standard ST.3 is based on ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, but includes a number of additional codes for international [[intellectual property organization]]s, which are currently [[#Codes currently agreed not to use|reserved and not used at the present stage]] in ISO 3166-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/pdf/03-03-01.pdf | title=Standard ST.3 &amp;ndash; Recommended standard on two-letter codes for the representation of states, other entities and intergovernmental organizations| work=Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation| pages=3.3.1–3.3.9| date=April 2007| publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] generally uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes with two exceptions: {{mono|EL}} (not {{mono|GR}}) is used to represent [[Greece]], and {{mono|UK}} (not {{mono|GB}}) is used to represent the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370100.htm| title=Publications Office &amp;ndash; Interinstitutional style guide &amp;ndash; Countries| publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notwithstanding, the ''Official Journal of the European Communities'' specified that {{mono|GR}} and {{mono|GB}} be used to represent Greece and United Kingdom respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:335:0022:0029:EN:PDF| title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 2645/98 of 9 December 1998 on the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States| work=Official Journal of the European Communities, L 335| pages=22–29| date=1998-12-10| publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Value added tax|VAT]] administration purposes, the [[European Commission]] uses [[VAT identification number#European Union VAT identification numbers|{{mono|EL}} and {{mono|GB}} for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively.]]

The [[United Nations]] uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|alpha-3]] codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for [[List of international vehicle registration codes|international vehicle registration codes]], which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently [[#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminately reserved]] in ISO 3166-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/Distsigns.pdf| title=Distinguishing signs used on vehicles in international traffic| publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IETF language tag]]s (conforming to the BCP 47 standard track and maintained in an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry) are also partially derived from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (for the region subtags). The full list of ISO 3166-1 codes assigned to countries and territories are usable as region subtags. Also, the "exceptionally reserved" alpha-2 codes defined in ISO 3166-1 (with the exception of {{mono|UK}}) are also usable as region subtags for language tags. However, newer stability policies (agreed with ISO) have been implemented to avoid deleting subtags that have been withdrawn in ISO 3166-1 ; instead they are kept and aliased to the new preferred subtags, or kept as subtags grouping several countries. Some other region grouping subtags are derived from other standards. Under the newer stability policies, old assigned codes that have been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1 should no longer be reassigned to another country or territory (as has occurred in the past for "CS").

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned: {{mono|AA}}, {{mono|QM}} to {{mono|QZ}}, {{mono|XA}} to {{mono|XZ}}, and {{mono|ZZ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html| title=Glossary for ISO 3166 - Codes for countries and their subdivisions| publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* The code {{mono|QZ}} is being used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] as an indicator for the [[Community Plant Variety Office]].
* The code {{mono|XN}} is being used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] as an indicator for the [[Nordic Patent Institute]], an international organization common to Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/pct/en/texts/agreements/ag_xn.pdf |title=Agreement between the Nordic Patent Institute and the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The code {{mono|XU}} is being used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] as an indicator for the [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]].
* The code {{mono|XV}} is being used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] as an indicator for the [[Visegrad Patent Institute]].
* The code {{mono|XX}} is being used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] as an indicator for unknown states, other entities or organizations.
* [[UN/LOCODE]] assigns {{mono|XZ}} to represent installations in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name="unlocode" /&gt;
* The [[Unicode]] [[Common Locale Data Repository]] assigns {{mono|QO}} to represent Outlying Oceania (a multi-territory region containing [[Antarctica]], [[Bouvet Island]], the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], [[Christmas Island]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]], the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], the [[French Southern Territories]], and the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]]), and {{mono|ZZ}} to represent "Unknown or Invalid Territory". Before the adoption of the macroregion code {{mono|EU}} by ISO, CLDR also used {{mono|QU}} to represent the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/| title=Unicode Technical Standard #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)| author=Mark Davis| publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The code {{mono|XK}} is being used by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes|title=Glossary:Country codes - Statistics Explained|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]]: [http://www.swift.com/dsp/resources/documents/IBAN_Registry.pdf ''IBAN Registry''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101223646/http://www.swift.com/dsp/resources/documents/IBAN_Registry.pdf |date=2013-11-01 }}, Release 50, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; CLDR and other organizations as a temporary country code for [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.wordpress.com/2010/03/08/xk-country-code-for-kosovo/ |title=XK country code for Kosovo |publisher=[[GeoNames]] Blog |date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The codes {{mono|XE}}, {{mono|XS}} and {{mono|XW}} are used by [[WhatsApp]] to represent the flags of England, Scotland and Wales as [[Emoji]].

{{anchor|OO}}
Furthermore, the code element {{mono|OO}} is designated as an [[escape code]] if the number of regular user-assigned code elements is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html|title=Country codes in ISO 3166|publisher=davros.org|date=2003-07-25|accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reserved code elements===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. The reserved alpha-2 codes can be divided into the following four categories: [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptional reservations]], [[#Transitional reservations|transitional reservations]], [[#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminate reservations]], and [[#Codes currently agreed not to use|codes currently agreed not to use]].

====Exceptional reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-2 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:

====Transitional reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Transitional reserved code elements are codes reserved after their deletion from ISO 3166-1. These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-2 codes are currently transitionally reserved:

The following alpha-2 code was previously transitionally reserved, but was later reassigned to another country as its official code:

{| class="wikitable sortable"

|}

For each deleted alpha-2 code, an entry for the corresponding former country name is included in [[ISO 3166-3]]. Each entry is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code, where the first two letters are the deleted alpha-2 code.

====Indeterminate reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Indeterminately reserved code elements are [[List of international vehicle registration codes|codes used to designate road vehicles]] under the 1949 and [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|1968 United Nations Conventions on Road Traffic]] but differing from those contained in ISO 3166-1. These code elements are expected eventually to be either eliminated or replaced by code elements within ISO 3166-1. In the meantime, the ISO 3166/MA has reserved such code elements for an indeterminate period. Any use beyond the application of the two Conventions is discouraged and will not be approved by the ISO 3166/MA. Moreover, these codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA at any time. The following alpha-2 codes are currently indeterminately reserved:

{| class="wikitable sortable"

The following alpha-2 codes were previously indeterminately reserved, but have been reassigned to another country as its official code:

====Codes currently agreed not to use====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
In addition, the ISO 3166/MA will not use the following alpha-2 codes at the present stage, as they are used for international [[intellectual property organization]]s in [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] Standard ST.3:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Code
! Organization name
|-
| id="AP" | {{mono|AP}} || [[African Regional Intellectual Property Organization|African Regional Industrial Property Organization]]
|-
| id="BX" | {{mono|BX}} || [[Benelux Office for Intellectual Property|Benelux Trademarks and Designs Office]]
|-
| id="EF" | {{mono|EF}} || Union of Countries under the [[EU patent#1970s and 1980s: proposed Community Patent Convention|European Community Patent Convention]]
|-
| id="EM" | {{mono|EM}} || [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market|European Trademark Office]]
|-
| id="EP" | {{mono|EP}} || [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Organization]] (Union of countries under the [[European Patent Convention]])

|-
| id="OA" | {{mono|OA}} || [[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle|African Intellectual Property Organization]]
|-
| id="WO" | {{mono|WO}} || [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]
|}

WIPO Standard ST.3 actually uses {{mono|EA}}, instead of {{mono|EV}}, to represent the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]]. However, {{mono|EA}} was already [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptionally reserved]] by the ISO 3166/MA to represent [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] for customs purposes. The ISO 3166/MA proposed in 1995 that {{mono|EV}} be used by WIPO to represent the Eurasian Patent Organization; however, this request was not honoured by WIPO.

==Deleted codes==
Besides the codes currently [[#Transitional reservations|transitionally reserved]] and two other codes currently [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptionally reserved]] ({{mono|FX}} for [[Metropolitan France|France, Metropolitan]] and {{mono|SU}} for [[Soviet Union|USSR]]), the following alpha-2 codes have also been deleted from ISO 3166-1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html#disused| title=Country codes in ISO 3166 (Table 2: codes withdrawn from use)| author=Clive Feather| date=2003-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:GW''' is the entry for [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Guinea-Bissau, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* 3 provinces
* [[regions of Guinea-Bissau|1 autonomous sector and 8 regions]]

The autonomous sector [[Bissau]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GW}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Guinea-Bissau. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter: provinces
* two letters: autonomous sector and regions

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

The '''Irish Hunger Memorial''' is a {{convert|0.5|acre|ha|sing=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.batteryparkcity.org/Visit/Museums-And-Memorials/Irish-Hunger-Memorial.php |title=Brian Tolle Irish Hunger Memorial, 2002 |publisher=[[Battery Park City]] |year=2002 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120926210059/http://www.batteryparkcity.org/Visit/Museums-And-Memorials/Irish-Hunger-Memorial.php |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; park at the corner of [[Vesey Street]] and North End Avenue in the [[Battery Park City]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]  &amp;mdash; dedicated to raising awareness of the [[Great Irish Famine]], referred to as ''An Gorta Mór'' in [[Irish language|Irish ]] or "The Great Hunger" in English, in which over one million starved to death between 1845 and 1852.

Construction of the memorial began in March 2001, and despite the [[September 11 attacks]] on the nearby [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], which also affected surrounding areas, the memorial was completed and dedicated on July 16, 2002.&lt;ref name="nyt-2002-07-16"/&gt;

The memorial, designed collaboratively by artist Brian Tolle, [[landscape architect]] Gail Wittwer-Laird, and architecture firm [[1100 Architect]], is landscaped with stones, soil, and native vegetation transported from the western coast of [[Ireland]] &amp;mdash; with stones from all counties of [[Ireland]].

An authentic Irish cottage from 19th century&lt;ref name="nyt-2002-07-16"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Memorial Remembers The Hungry |first=Roberta |last=Smith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/arts/critic-s-notebook-a-memorial-remembers-the-hungry.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 16, 2002 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Carradoogan in the parish of [[Attymass]] in [[County Mayo]] belonged to the Slack family &amp;mdash; and was deserted in the 1960s. The Slack family donated the cottage to the memorial in "memory of all the Slack family members of previous generations who emigrated to America and fared well there."&lt;ref name="nyt-2002-07-16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carradoogan.com/slack_history.html#hungermemorial |title=Slack History |work=carradoogan.com |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the memorial was temporarily closed for waterproofing work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bpca.ny.gov/community/irish-hunger-memorial-waterproofing-project/|title=Irish Hunger Memorial WaterProofing Project |publisher=[[Battery Park City Authority]] |website=bpca.ny.gov |accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened in August 2017.

This is a '''list of all present [[sovereign state]]s in [[South America]] and their predecessors'''. The division between North and South America is unclear, generally viewed as lying somewhere in the [[Isthmus of Panama]], however, the whole of [[Panama]] is considered to be part of North America as its southernmost nation. The continent was [[Colony|colonized]] by the [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans]]: First by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards]], and the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]]; and later by the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], and the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]]. Most of the present-day nations gained [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] in the early 19th century. Today, South America consists of twelve sovereign states with common government system being some form of [[Presidential system|presidential republic]].

[[File:Map - IT - Firenze - Comunità Montana Mugello.svg|thumb|Mugello within [[Metropolitan Florence]]]]
[[File:LocalitàApparita-Galliano.png|thumb|Countryside near Galliano di Mugello]]
The '''Mugello''' is a historic region and [[valley]] in northern [[Tuscany]], in Italy, corresponding to the course of the [[River Sieve]]. It is located to the north of the city of [[Florence]] and includes the northernmost portion of the [[Metropolitan City of Florence]]. The [[Futa Pass]] connects the Mugello valley to the separate [[Santerno|Santerno river]] valley.

==History==

The Mugello valley was settled by a [[Ligurians|Ligurian]] tribe known as the Magelli, hence the name. Then the region was occupied by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] who have left many archeological traces and who built the first road network of the Mugello.

The subsequent [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] conquest and colonization of the Mugello region dates back to the 4th century BCE. It is not only testified  by several finds such as tombs, coins, and walls, but also, through toponymy, e.g. names of places ending with the praedial suffix ''-ano'' (Latin ''[[-anus]]'') or ''-ana'': Cerliano, Figliano, Marcoiano, Galliano, Lucignano, etc.
[[File:CiperssiMugello.png|thumb|A Mugello road lined with cypress trees]]
In the [[Middle Ages]] the Mugello was home to numerous [[castle]]s. The Mugello region was later acquired by the [[Republic of Florence]]. Several patrician families of the area built [[villa]]s here, such as those of the [[house of Medici|Medici]] including [[Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo]] and [[Villa Medicea del Trebbio]].

[[File:Torre Idraulica e Diga.jpg|thumb|Dam across the Sieve at Lake Bilancino]]
In 1999 a [[dam]] was constructed across the [[Sieve (river)|Sieve river]], forming the reservoir of [[Lake Bilancino]] in the Mugello valley.

== In popular culture ==

The Mugello gives its name to the [[Mugello Circuit]] ({{Lang|it|Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello}}), an automobile race track that hosts an annual [[Moto GP]] event and to the [[Mugellese|Mugellese chicken]] a [[Bantam (poultry)|Bantam]] breed.

The 50th Anniversary National Wilderness Conference is the culminating commemorative event for the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. The conference was held in Albuquerque, NM, from October 15-19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilderness50th.org/conference.php?useraction=conf-about |title=National Wilderness Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==
This conference is a multi-day event including presentations, panel discussions, exhibits, field trips, and skill-development workshops. The conference will provide ample opportunity to network and share ideas, celebrate recent successes, share lessons learned, and discuss emerging challenges in wilderness stewardship. Conference tracks will include history, stewardship, education, experience, civic engagement, and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildernessstewardship.org/node/6 |title=50th Anniversary Conference and Exhibition |last=Lambert |first=Lee |date=2013-12-02 |publisher=Society for Wilderness Stewardship |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416184206/http://www.wildernessstewardship.org/node/6 |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference Goals==
The conference is convened to provide a forum for discussing growing challenges to wilderness values while deepening and enabling participants’ engagement in wilderness stewardship in a time of unprecedented environmental and social change;&lt;ref name="sierra"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Hundreds of activities planned as lead-up to September 2014 Anniversary |date=2013-09-04 |publisher=[[Sierra Club]] |url=http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2013/09/wilderness-act-50th-celebration-countdown-begins}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, it also aims to honor the achievement of a half-century of permanent protection for America’s wild places under the [[Wilderness Act]].

The '''Nigretta Falls''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-nigretta-falls.html|title=Nigretta Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|author=Cheng, Johnny T.|date=|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as the '''Upper Wannon Falls''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite VICNAMES|122583|Nigretta Falls|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[waterfall]]s located in the [[Shire of Southern Grampians|Southern Grampians Shire]], approximately {{convert|16|km}} west of [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The falls are fed by the [[Wannon River]] that has its head waters in the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians mountains]]. 

==Location and features==
The falls tumble over many rocky outcrops creating several streams of falling water and then drop into a large pool at the base before continuing its journey to the [[Wannon Falls]] some {{convert|10|km}} downstream. In contrast to the single plunge of the [[Wannon Falls]], Nigretta is a more interesting, multi-channel segmented cascade of smaller drops and bounces guided by patterns of joints in a much older (Devonian) [[rhyolitic]] volcanic rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grimes|first=Ken|title=Wannon &amp; Nigretta Falls|url=http://hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/wannon%20%20nigretta%20falls%20kg2005.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as with the Wannon Falls, the amount of water varies with the time of year - the photo shows a late winter, wet season, view. The Nigretta Scenic Reserve includes parts of the Wannon River Valley which contains representatives of the native plants of the Dundas Tablelands, listed in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bird|first=Rod|title=HFNC weed control work at Nigretta Falls Scenic Reserve|url=http://hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/M/weedcontrolnigrettascenicresnov2011.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Postal code]]s''' ({{zh|c=郵遞區號|p=Yóudì qūhào|poj=Iû-tē khu-hō}}) in '''[[Taiwan]]''' is a system of three + two digits used by [[Chunghwa Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/u_english/postal_e.jsp |title=postalservices Zip Code |publisher=Post.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720081302/http://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/u_english/postal_e.jsp |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 368 sets of three-digit codes for [[Township (Taiwan)|townships]], [[County-controlled city|county-controlled cities]], and [[District (Taiwan)|districts]] in [[Taiwan]].

The cities of [[Chiayi]] and [[Hsinchu]] have a single code covering all their districts. The uninhabited Taiwanese-controlled islands in the groups of [[Pratas Islands|Dongsha (Pratas)]] and [[Spratly Islands|Nansha (Spratly)]] each have a single code. The uninhabited [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyutai (Senkaku)]] (currently controlled by [[Japan]]) have a code, but there are no deliveries. 

Omitting the supplementary two digits is ordinarily acceptable, but using a five-digit code will speed the delivery of the mail.

== Large Postal Code Zones ==
The first digit is for a large postal zone:

==Notes==
Of the disputed territories, it is practically possible to send mail to Dongsha Island within the [[Pratas Islands|Dongsha Islands]] (817) and [[Taiping Island]], the largest island of the [[Spratly Islands]] (819), as those are above sea level and controlled by Taiwan. There is no mail delivery to the [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyutai Islands]] (290), as they are controlled by Japan and have been uninhabited for many decades.

The '''rule of marteloio''' is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] technique of [[navigation]]al computation that uses [[compass]] direction, [[distance]] and a simple [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] table known as the '''''toleta de marteloio'''''. The rule told [[mariner]]s how to plot the traverse between two different navigation [[Course (navigation)|courses]] by means of resolving [[triangle]]s with the help of the ''Toleta'' and basic [[arithmetic]].

Those uncomfortable with manipulating numbers could resort to the visual '''''tondo e quadro''''' (circle-and-square) and achieve their answer with [[dividers]].  The rule of marteloio was commonly used by [[Mediterranean]] navigators during the 14th and 15th centuries, before the development of [[celestial navigation|astronomical navigation]].

== Etymology ==
The [[etymology]] comes from the [[Venetian language]].  In his 1436 atlas, [[Venice|Venetian]] captain and cartographer [[Andrea Bianco]] introduced a table of numbers which he called the ''toleta de marteloio'' ("table of marteloio"), and the method of using it as the ''raxon de marteloio'' ("reason of marteloio").

The meaning of ''marteloio'' itself is uncertain.  The most widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|A.E. Nordenskiöld]], is that ''marteloio'' relates to "[[hammer]]" ("martelo" in Venetian), referring to the small hammer that was used to hit the on-board [[ship's bell]] to mark the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenskiöld (1897: p.51ff); Ruge (1900: [https://books.google.com/books?id=S6o9wHoZVZEC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.177]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the -''oio'' suffix implies that ''marteloio'' meant not quite the hammer itself nor the hammerer, but rather "the hammering", intending to indicate "the hammering, the din, the racket" from the [[watch system|change of the watch]] every four hours.  As there were many hands on deck during a change of the watch, it would be an opportune moment for the ship's [[maritime pilot|pilot]] to order a change in [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] (if necessary).&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative hypotheses (not nearly as accepted) are that "marteloio" is a corruption of ''mari logio'' (meaning "rule of the sea"),&lt;ref&gt;This was forwarded by Giuseppe Toaldo (1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 44])&lt;/ref&gt; or from ''mare tela'' (meaning "sea network"),&lt;ref&gt;This was proposed by Desimoni (1888: p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; or that it derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''homartologium'' (''όμαρτόλογίον'', meaning "companion piece"),&lt;ref&gt;Morelli (1810: [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ls6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.42]).  Morelli's interpretation is cited already by Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.28]).&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Greek ''imeralogium'' (''ήμερόλογίον'', meaning "daily calculation")&lt;ref&gt;This was proposed by Fincati, as reported by Albertis (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; or that it might be from the northern [[French language|French]] ''matelot'', which in turn comes from [[Breton language|Breton]] ''martolod'' (meaning "sailors").&lt;ref&gt;This is proposed by Breusing (1881: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vnA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 130])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

[[image:Medieval ship and compass (Mandeville).jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century mariner consulting a compass aboard ship (from [[John Mandeville]]'s ''Travels'', 1403)]]
The "rule of marteloio" was used in European navigation in the [[Middle Ages]], most notably in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 14th and 16th centuries, although it may have older roots.  It was an integral part of navigation by "compass and chart", before the advent of [[geographical coordinates]] and the development of [[celestial navigation]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956); Parry (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval navigation relied on two parameters, direction and distance.  On board ship, direction was determined by the [[mariner's compass]] (which emerged around 1300).&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (2001: p.76)&lt;/ref&gt;  Distance was measured by [[dead reckoning]], (''i.e.'', distance = speed &amp;times; time), where time was measured by a half-[[hour-glass]], and speed readings were taken with by some form of a [[chip log]] (the archaic method, used in the 14th and 15th centuries, involved heaving a piece of wood or flotsam overboard; the crew engaged in a rhythmic chant to mark the time it took for the chip to float past the length of the ship).&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p.12). This is slightly different from the later chip log, where the wood was tied to a rope with regularly spaced knots; the rope was allowed to unspool freely until a sandglass ran out, and the "[[knot (unit)|knots]]" counted up in the aftermath. The chip log was first mentioned by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] in 1574.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Mediterranean chart fourteenth century2.jpg|thumb|300px|Anonymous Genoese [[portolan chart]] from c. 1325 to c. 1350. ([[Library of Congress]], Washington DC)]]
Plotting a course required knowing the compass direction and distance between point A and point B.  Knowledge of where ports lay relative to each other was acquired by navigators by long experience at sea.  This information was sometimes collected and written down in a pilot's handbook, known as a ''[[portolano]]'' ("port book", in Italian, equivalent to the Greek ''[[periplus]]'', the Portuguese ''roteiro'' and the English ''[[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]'').  These handbooks were used to construct a class of nautical maps known as [[portolan charts]].  Portolan charts began being produced in [[Genoa]] in the late 13th century, and soon spread to [[Venice]] and [[Majorca]].  Portolan charts were not gridded by longitude and latitude lines, but rather by a web of [[compass rose|compass]] [[rhumb lines]], giving mariners an idea of only the distance and direction between places.

[[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|300px|32-wind [[compass rose]] with traditional names (and traditional color code).]]
By a handbook or a portolan chart, a navigator could see immediately that, for example, [[Pisa]] lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" in the traditional [[compass rose]] nomenclature) of [[Genoa]], and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat.  A mariner wishing to sail from [[Majorca]] to [[Naples]] could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of [[Sardinia]] lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route.  This is easier said than done, as [[geographical coordinates]] did not exist during this era.  The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.123, 159, 167); Parry (1974: p.37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands were a predictable obstacle – circumventing Sardinia would be simply a matter of sailing southeast for a set distance then changing the bearing to northeast ("Greco") for the remainder.  More problematic is if the ship were blown off its intended route by fitful winds, or had to engage in [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]], changing bearing repeatedly. How does it return to its intended course?  This is where the rule of marteloio came in.

== The traverse problem ==

The rule of marteloio addressed the problem of changing bearing at sea. More specifically, it helped a navigator plot the traverse from one navigational [[Course (navigation)|course]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.116ff.) Taylor (1960: p.10)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose a ship was to sail from [[Corsica]] to [[Genoa]], a course bearing straight north ("Tramontana") for some 130 miles. But the winds are not cooperative, and the ship was forced to sail northwest ("Maestro") for some 70 miles.  How does it return to its original route?  Re-setting its bearing to northeast ("Greco") seems sensible enough, but how long should it sail on that bearing?  How would a navigator know when the ship had reached its old route and should turn north again?   How to avoid overshooting or undershooting the old course?

[[image:Marteloio on chart.jpg|thumb|150px|The traverse problem: intended course ''AB'' (bearing N), actual course ''AC'' (bearing NW). Calculating the ''ritorno'' (distance on return course ''CD'', bearing NE) and ''avanzo'' (distance made good on intended course) is a matter of solving the triangle ''ACD'']]
This is a mathematical problem of [[solution of triangles|solving a triangle]].  If a navigator knows how long the ship has sailed on the erroneous course, he can calculate its current distance from its intended course, and estimate how long it must sail back on a new bearing until it recovers its old course.  In the Corsica-to-Genoa example, there is an implied [[triangle]] ''ACD'', with one side given (''AC'' = 70 miles on actual NW course), a 45° angle at ''A'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and intended course N) and another angle of 90° at ''C'' (angle of difference between actual course NW and return course NE).  The challenge to the navigator is to find how long one must sail on the NE return course (the length of side ''CD'', what is called the ''ritorno'') and how far one has advanced on the intended course by the time one straightens out (the length of the hypotenuse ''AD'', or what is called the total ''avanzo'').

This is elementary [[trigonometry]], solving for two sides given one side (70) and two angles (45° and 90°). This is quickly done by applying the [[law of sines]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {70 \text{ miles}}{\sin D} = \frac {\text{ritorno}}{\sin 45} = \frac {\text{avanzo}}{\sin 90}  &lt;/math&gt;

yielding up the solutions ''ritorno'' = 70 miles and total ''avanzo'' = 98.99 miles.  This means that if the ship bears NE from its current position (''C''), it will reach its original intended course after 70 miles of sailing on the NE bearing. By the time it reaches its junction point (''D''), it will have covered 98.99 miles of its original intended course.  There it can straighten its bearing N and sail the remaining 30 miles or so to Genoa.

Unfortunately, Medieval sailors with the rudimentary educational levels of the 14th and 15th centuries, were not likely to know the Law of Sines or manipulate it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Van Brunnelen (2010, p.67)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Medieval navigators needed simpler and more accessible method of calculation.

== Rules ==

=== Ramon Llull's "miliaria" ===

The scholar-cleric [[Ramon Llull]] of [[Majorca]], was the first writer to refer to a rule to solve the traverse problem of navigation. In his ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295), in the section of questions on geometry, Llul writes:

{{Cquote|How do mariners measure miles at sea (''miliaria in mari'')?  Mariners consider the four general winds, that is to say the eastern, western, northern and southern, and also another four winds that lie between them, ''grec'' (NE),''exaloch'' (SE), ''lebeg'' (SW) and ''maestre'' (NW).   And they look carefully at the center of the circle in which the winds (rhumbs) meet at angles; they consider when a ship travels by the East wind (''levant'')  100 miles from the center, how many miles it would make on the southeast (''exaloch'') wind; and for 200 miles, they double the number by multiplying and then they know how many miles there are from the end of each 100 miles in an easterly direction to the corresponding point in a southeasterly direction.  And for this they have this instrument [a mathematical table?] and a chart, rutter, needle and the pole star."&lt;ref&gt;Llull ''Arbor Scientiae'' (1295, (1635 Latin ed.):[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA570#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.570] See also Edson (2007: p.51) and Cotter (1978:p.5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What Llull seems to be trying to explain is that a ship actually sailing E, but intending to sail SE, it can figure out how much of its intended southeastward distance it has already made good – what Italians called the "''avanzar''", but Lull seems to call the "''miliaria in mari''".  Llull does not explain exactly how, but refers only to an "instrument", presumably some sort of trigonometric table. Lull is implying that mariners can calculate the ''miliaria'' on the intended course by multiplying the distance actually sailed on the erroneous course by the [[cosine]] of the angle between the two routes.&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation is originally due to Taylor (1956: pp. 117–19).  See also Cortesão (1969: v. 1, pp. 206–7), Cotter (1978: pp. 6–7) and Campbell (1987: pp. 441–42).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Marteloio of Ramon Llull.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ramon Lull]]'s ''miliaria in mari'', from his 1295 example.]]

: ''Miliaria in mari'' = distance sailed &amp;times; cos(''θ'')

where ''θ'' is the angle of difference between the two routes.

Using Lull's example, a ship that intended to sail southeast ("Exaloch" is [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "Scirocco") but was instead forced to sail east ("Levant"), then the angle of difference is ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  After 100 miles on the erroneous route, the ''miliaria'' on the intended route is 100&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;45° = 70.71.  Doubling the sailing on the erroneous route to 200 miles will double the ''miliaria'' on the intended route to 141.42 miles (=&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;45°).

(Diagramatically, Lull's ''miliaria in mari'' is measured by constructing a [[right-angled triangle]] by running a cord from the distance sailed on the actual course to the intended course, meeting the latter at a 90° angle).

Llull is a little more explicit in his ''Ars magna generalis et ultima'' (written c. 1305).&lt;ref&gt;Ramom Llull, 1517 ed., Part 10, "De Navigatione", [https://books.google.com/books?id=rG_yINh8V1gC&amp;pg=PT213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false fo. 93, p. 213].  See also Cotter (1978: p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversing his example, with a ship actually sailing Southeast but intending to sail East, Llull notes that for every four miles on the southeast bearing, it "gains three miles" (2.83 actually) on the intended eastward route.  Thus, Lull notes, the ship "loses 25 miles" (29 actually) of its intended course for every 100 miles it sails on the current course.

Notice that in his passages, Ramon Lull is not recommending the rule, but reporting it, insinuating that this rule was already known and used by contemporary sailors in practice.&lt;ref&gt;"To a mathematician familiar with contemporary mathematical knowledge and practice, it is quite clear that Lull did not fully understand what he was writing about.  He used his shipboard observations during his travels to support transcendental ideas about the circle, triangle and square.  His value is as a witness to late-thirteenth century mariners doing vector navigations with chart or plotting board." (Kelley, 1995: p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is perhaps unsurprising – although [[History of trigonometry|trigonometry]] was only in its infancy in Christian Europe, sine and cosine tables were already known in [[History of trigonometry#Islamic mathematics|Arab mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1960: p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kingdom of Majorca]], under Muslim rule until the 1230s, remained a multicultural center in Lull's time, with flourishing [[Majorcan Jews|Jewish communities]], many of whom dabbled in mathematics and astronomy, and whose seafarers had extensive contact across the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p. 114); Kelley (1995: p. 3); Vernet (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  That Majorcan navigators had some sort of trigonometric table at hand is not improbable.  Nonetheless, the exact content and layout of this table implied by Ramon Llull in 1295 is uncertain.

=== Andrea Bianco's "toleta" ===
[[image:Toleta de marteloio (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''toleta de marteloio'' from [[Andrea Bianco]]'s 1436 atlas]]
We get our first glimpse of a mariner's trigonometric table more than a century after Llull. In the first folio of his 1436 [[portolan chart|portolan atlas]], the [[Venice|Venetian]] captain [[Andrea Bianco]] explains the ''raxon de marteloio'', how to calculate the traverse and recover the course.  He lays out a simple trigonometric table he calls the ''toleta de marteloio'' and recommends that mariners commit the table to memory.&lt;ref&gt;For a transcription of Bianco's  1436 instructions, see Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.30]) or Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.73])&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''toleta de marteloio'' is set out as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Toleta'' we replicate here is the version of [[Michael of Rhodes]] (McGee et al., [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html p.48b]).  Bianco's original table contains some small errors – specifically in the ''ritorno'' column, Bianco mistakenly inserts 14 rather than 12 in the fifth row (q = 5); in the ''avanzo di ritorno'' column, Bianco gives 5{{frac|1|10}} instead of 2{{frac|1|5}} in the seventh row and 8 instead of 10 in the eighth row. Gelgich (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6mtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.74]).  It is possible that by the "5{{frac|1|10}}" entry, Bianco meant to write "1/5th of 10" = 2 (the number often given in modern reproductions of the toleta, e.g. Vernet, 2008)).  The 2{{frac|1|5}} is given only in the toleta version of Michael of Rhodes. The version in the Foscarini letter, that entry is given as 1{{frac|9|10}} 9/10 (Toaldo, 1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.43]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers in the ''Toleta'' can be approximated by the modern formulas:&lt;ref&gt;Vernet (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alargar = {{math|100 &amp;times; sin (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Avanzar = {{math|100 &amp;times; cos (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Ritorno = {{math|10 / sin (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}
* Avanzo di ritorno = {{math|10 / tan (&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; &amp;times; 11.15)}}

where ''q'' = number of [[quarter wind]]s (angle of difference expressed in number of quarter winds).  (notice that the numbers work with quarter-winds set at 11.15° intervals, rather than 11.25°, the usual definition of a quarter wind).

The ''Toleta'' is a simple table with several columns of numbers.  In the first column is the angle of difference between the actual and intended courses, expressed by number of [[quarter-winds]].  Once that difference is determined, the second column gives the ''Alargar'' (the "Widening", the current distance the ship is from the intended course) while the third column tells the ''Avanzar'' (the "Advance", how much of the distance on the intended course has already been covered by sailing on the current bearing – this is equivalent of Ramon Llull's ''miliaria di mari'').  The Alargar and Avanzar numbers are shown on the Bianco's table for 100 miles of sailing on the current course.

[[image:Marteloio alargar.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating ''alargar'' and ''avanzar'' from Bianco's ''Toleta''.]]
'''Example''':  suppose a ship intended to sail bearing east ("Levante") from point A to point B. But suppose that winds forced it to sail on a southeast-by-east course (SEbE, "Quarto di Scirocco verso Levante").  Southeast-by-east is three quarter winds (or 33.75°) away from east (on a 32-point [[compass rose|compass]], in order of quarter-winds away from east, 1 quarter is east-by-south, 2 quarters is East-southeast, 3 quarters is southeast-by-east).  That means that the navigator should consult the third row,&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, on the toleta.

Suppose the ship sailed 100 miles on the SE-by-E bearing. To check his distance from the intended eastward course, the mariner will read the corresponding entry on the ''alargar'' column and immediately see he is 55 miles away from the intended course.   The ''avanzar'' column informs him that having sailed 100 miles on the current SEbE course, he has covered 83 miles of the intended E course.

The next step is to determine how to return to the intended course.  Continuing the example, to get back to the intended Eastward course, our mariner has to re-orient the ship's bearing in a northeasterly direction. But there are various northeasterly angles – NbE, NNE, NE, ENE, etc.  The mariner has a choose the bearing – if he returns by a sharp angle (e.g. North by east), he will return to the intended course faster than at a more gentle gradient (e.g. East by north).  Whichever angle he chooses, he must deduce exactly how long he must sail on that bearing in order to reach his old course. If he sails too long, he risks overshooting it.

[[File:Marteloio ritorno.jpg|thumb|400px|Calculating the ''ritorno'' and ''avanzo di ritorno'']]This is what the third column of the toleta is for.  The return angles are expressed as quarters from the ''intended'' course bearing (''not'' the current course bearing).  In our example, the mariner intended to go east, but has been sailing southeast-by-east for 100 miles.  Given the winds, he decides it is best to return to the original course by re-orienting the ship east-northeast (ENE, "Greco-Levante").  ENE is two quarter-winds above the ''intended'' bearing, East, so now he looks at second row ("quarters = 2") on the table.  In the third column, the ''ritorno'', shows the number 26.  This represents the required number of miles he must travel on ENE bearing for every 10 miles of alargar.  Remember, his alargar (distance from intended course) was 55 miles.  So in order to return to his intended course he must travel 5.5 &amp;times; 26 = 143 miles on ENE.  In other words, he needs to hold his ENE bearing for 143 miles; once that distance is travelled, he should straighten his ship East, and he will be exactly on the intended course.

The final column (''avanzo di ritorno'') gives the length on the intended course he has made good by his return travel.  This is also expressed in terms per 10 miles alargar. His alargar was 55, and his angle of return was ENE (thus q = 2), that means his avanzo di ritorno is 5.5 &amp;times; 24 = 132.  In other words, if everything goes right, and our mariner holds his ENE bearing for 143 miles (''ritorno''), then during that return, he will have covered an additional 132 miles on his intended eastward course (''avanzo di ritorno'').

Finally, the total avanzo on the eastward bearing is the avanzar during the deviation (83 miles) plus the avanzo di ritorno (132 miles), thus on the whole, he has covered 83 + 132 = 215 miles on the intended course.  Measuring that distance on the map from the starting point (''A''), the mariner can figure out his exact current position.

This is the simplest use of the toleta de marteloio.  It is, at root, a trigonometric table. However, it does not tackle the traverse problem in one go, like the Law of Sines, but rather splits the problem into two [[right-angled triangle]]s which it proceeds to solve successively.  Modern [[trigonometry]] would dispense with the step of calculating the alargar, and calculate the ritorno directly – but for that, one needs to be armed with a full [[trigonometric tables|sine table]]. The toleta is a rather simple table, easy to consult and perform calculations with, and sufficiently compact to be memorized by navigators (as Bianco recommends).

=== Rule of three ===

The ''toleta de marteloio'' is expressed for nice round numbers, 100 and 10.  But, in practice, a ship would not usually sail 100 miles before trying to return, but some other distance, say 65 miles.  To calculate this is a simple problem of solving [[ratio]]s.  For example, if the ship had sailed 65 miles on southeast-by-east, then calculating the alargar from the intended Eastward course is simply a matter of solving the following for {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}}:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {26}{100} = \frac {x}{65} &lt;/math&gt;

where 26 is the alargar for 100 miles (as given in the second column of the table).  This is easily done by the simple "[[Rule of three (mathematics)|Rule of Three]]", a method of cross-multiplication, using three numbers to solve for the fourth by successive multiplication and division:

: {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 65 × 26 ÷ 100}}

So, sailing for 65 miles on SE by E implies alargar = {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}} =  16.9 miles.  The avanzar, etc. can be figured out analogously.

While the "rule of three" was already known in the 14th century, skill in executing [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] could be elusive for Medieval sailors drawn from what was a largely illiterate society. Nonetheless, it was not inaccessible.  As Andrea Bianco urged, navigators should "know how to multiply well and divide well" ("saver ben moltiplichar e ben partir")&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Gelgich (1892: p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;   It is here where we see the important interface of [[commerce]] and navigation.   The mathematics of commerce – [[Arabic numerals]], multiplication, division, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], the tools needed to calculate purchases and sales of goods and other commercial transactions – was essentially the same as the mathematics of navigation.&lt;ref&gt;This is clearly shown in the book of Michael of Rhodes, where commercial and navigational calculations follow one another.  See the [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/math.html Michael of Rhodes website].&lt;/ref&gt;  And this kind of mathematics was taught at the [[abacus school]]s which were set up in the 13th century in the commercial centers of northern Italy to train the sons of merchants, the very same class where Italian navigators were drawn from.  As historian E.G.R. Taylor notes, "sailors were the first professional group to use mathematics in their everyday work"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1960: p.12)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Circle and square ===

[[image:Tondo e quadro (basic features).jpg|thumb|300px|Reproduction of the basic features of the ''tondo e quadro'']]
For those troubled by the high art of manipulating numbers, there was an alternative. This was the visual device known as the "circle and square" (''tondo e quadro''), also supplied by [[Andrea Bianco]] in his 1436 atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.35]), Cotter (1978: ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.10])&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle was a 32-wind [[compass rose]] (or gathering of rhumb-lines).  The circle was inscribed with an 8 &amp;times; 8 square grid.

The compass rose in the center can be overlooked – indeed, the circle itself can be ignored, as it is seems to have no other purpose than the construction of the rays that run across the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  The rose of interest is in the upper left corner of the square grid. From that corner, emanate a series of compass [[rhumb lines]].  In his original 1436 ''tondo e quadro'', Bianco has sixteen emanating rays – that is, Bianco includes half-quarter winds, or eighth-winds (''otava''), so that the emanating rays are at intervals of 5.625 degrees.  Other constructions of the circle-and-square, e.g. the [[Cornaro Atlas]], use only eight rays emanating at quarter-wind distances (11.25 degrees).  Visually, these rays replicate the bottom right quarter of a 32-wind [[compass rose]]: East (0q), E by S (1q), ESE (2q), SE by E (3q), SE (4q), SE by S (5q), SSE (6q), S by E (7q) and South (8q).

[[image:Marteloio grid scale.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reproduction of the bar scale of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]
Above the grid is a distance [[Linear scale|bar scale]], notched with sub-units. There are two sets of numbers on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: p.116; 1960: p.14)&lt;/ref&gt;  The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with every black dot denoting one mile.  The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where the length of a unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles.  So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).

[[image:Tondo e quadro detail (Bianco, 1436).jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of Bianco's ''tondo e quadro'']]
The cherub with the [[dividers]] suggests how a navigator is supposed to use the grid to calculate alargar and avanzar by visual measurement rather than manipulating numbers.

[[image:Tondo e quadro (calculation).jpg|thumb|300px|Solving a triangle with the ''tondo e quadro'']]
'''Example''': suppose the ship has travelled 120 miles at two quarter-winds below the intended course (e.g. traveled at ESE, when the intended course is East).   Using the dividers and the 20m scale, the navigator can measure out 120 miles with his dividers.  Then setting one end at the top left corner (''A''), he lays out the dividers along the ESE ray (= two quarter-winds below the East ray, or horizontal top of the grid) and marks the spot (point ''B'' on the diagram). Then using a [[straightedge]] ruler draws a line up to the East ray, and marks the corresponding spot ''C''.

It is easy to see immediately that a [[right-angled triangle]] ''ABC'' has been created. The length ''BC'' is the ''alargar'' (distance from intended course), which can be measured as 46 miles (this can be visually seen as two grid squares plus a bit, that is 20m + 20m and a little bit which can be assessed as 6m by using the dividers and the 20m bar scale).  The length ''AC'' is the ''avanzar'' (distance made good), which is 111 miles – visually, five grid squares and a bit, or (20 &amp;times; 5) + 11, measured by dividers and scale again.

This is how the "circle and square" dispenses manipulating numbers by multiplication and division or the rule of three.  The navigator can assess the avanzar and alargar visually, by measurement alone.

This method can be used for any intended bearing and deviation, as the only purpose is to solve the triangle by dividers and scale.  e.g. using our first Corsica-to-Genoa example, where intended bearing was North but the ship actually sailed Northwest, the navigator would set the dividers at length 70 miles and lay it along the fourth quarter wind (= SE ray in the ''tondo e quadro'', as NW is four quarter winds away from North).  He would calculate the alargar and avanzar in exactly the same way – draw a line to the horizontal top of the grid, measure the squares, etc.

The ''tondo e quadro'' device is very similar to the Arab [[sine quadrant]] (''Rubul mujayyab''), with the corner rays replicating the role of the adjustable [[plumb line]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1995: p.3)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==

While the ''toleta de marteloio'' (and its visual counterpart, the ''tondo e quadro'') are designed for the explicit task of recovering an intended course, they can be used in more ways, for many classes of navigational problems, e.g. plotting out a course with multiple-bearing changes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/navigate_toolkit.html Michael of Rhodes website] shows various sort of problems Michael considered.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triangulation ===

One of the interesting applications of the rule of marteloio is for [[triangulation]], e.g. determining the distance of the ship from shore landmark. (This was the final exercise attempted in the notebook of the Venetian navigator [[Michael of Rhodes]], which we replicate here.)&lt;ref&gt;See Michael of Rhodes [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48a.html p.48a] and [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/manuscript/page_48b.html 48b]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example''': Suppose a ship sailing NW ("Maestro") spots a landmark due West ("Ponente") one evening, but distance unknown.  Suppose the ship continues sailing on the NW route overnight, and the next morning, 40 miles later, it notices that landmark is now west-southwest (WSW, "Ponente-Libeccio") of its current position.  Finding the distance of the landmark from the ship is just an application of the rule of marteloio.

[[Image:Marteloio landmark triangulation.gif|thumb|401px|Application of the rule of marteloio to estimate the distance between the ship and a shore landmark.]]
To solve the problem, start from the evening position (''A'' on the map) and treat the distance between the ship and the landmark (length ''AB'') as the intended course, and the actual route of the ship (NW) as a deviation. To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (''C'') is a matter of treating the distance ''BC'' as the calculated ritorno. Since we need to know the alargar to calculate the ritorno, this is a two-step procedure.

First, notice that NW is four quarter-winds above W, so looking up on the ''toleta'', in the q = 4 row, the ''alargar'' is 71 miles for every 100 miles on the NW course.  But the ship only sailed 40 miles overnight, so we have to solve the ratio 71/100 = ''x''/40, which by the rule of three means ''x'' = alargar = 28.4 miles.  In other words, by the overnight  sailing NW by 40 miles from A to C, the ship is now 28.4 miles away from its "intended" Westward course.

Now for the ritorno.  The landmark, as noted, is WSW of the ship's morning position (''C'').  So to "return" to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing from its current NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW.  However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of "intended" direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, so we need to look at the q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar.  Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 &amp;times; 2.84 = 73.84.  And there we have it.  The landmark is 73.84 miles away from the ship's morning position.

(To complete the story, we might wish to find out the distance that landmark was the evening before (i.e. from point A to landmark B). That is simply a matter of adding the avanzar and the avanzo in ritorno. Quick calculations show the avanzar (@ q = 4, for 40 miles) is 28.4 miles (= 71 × 40/100) and the avanzo di ritorno (@ q = 2 for 28.4 miles alargar), is 2.84 × 24 = 68.16. So total avanzo = 28.4 + 68.16 = 96.56 miles. That was the distance between the landmark and the ship the evening before.)

=== Finding locations ===

The rule of marteloio can also be used with the ''avanzar'' as a target, e.g. suppose a ship sets out with the intention of finding the [[Tordesillas Line]], the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] legally set in a 1494 treaty at 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]].  The ship need not set out from Cape Verde and set sail constantly at West bearing to find it.  Rather, it can sail out at a more convenient bearing (e.g. SW), and treat West as an "intended" course.  So using the marteloio rule, it can sail on until the ''avanzar'' on the "intended" West course reaches 370 leagues.

Indeed, it need not even set out from Cape Verde, but can set out from another place, say, [[Seville]], and use the known distance and bearing of Cape Verde (viz. Seville) and the rule of marteloio to calculate when it has finally reached the Tordesillas meridian.  This takes a couple of steps.  Suppose Cape Verde (''B'' on map) is 400 leagues Southwest of Seville (''A'' on map), but the ship intends to go straight West from Seville to reach the Tordesillas meridian in the open sea.  How long does it need to sail?

[[image:Marteloio tordesillas.gif|thumb|300px|Finding the [[Tordesillas Line]] via the rule of marteloio]]
The way to solve this by the rule of marteloio is to pose the problem in reverse: treat West as intended bearing and SW as the actual course.  SW is four quarter-winds below W, so looking up the toleta for q = 4, the ''avanzar'' is 71 for every 100 miles sailed.  So if a ship sailed 400 leagues on the "actual" SW course to Cape Verde, it would achieve an ''avanzar'' of 284 leagues (= 71 &amp;times; 4) on the "intended" Westward course.  Of course, the ship is not actually sailing SW to Cape Verde, but sailing W into the open sea. In other words, when the ship sets sail West from Seville, it knows it needs to sail 284 leagues on the West bearing before it reaches the implied Cape Verde [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (point ''C'' on map), and should only start counting the 370 leagues to the Tordesillas line thereafter. In other words, it needs to sail a total of 284 + 370 = 654 leagues West of Seville to reach the Tordesillas line (point ''D'' on map).

While this particular example shows the flexibility of the rule of marteloio, it also shows one of its principal drawbacks: the result completely ignores the [[curvature of the earth]], i.e. the fact that the [[longitude]] meridian lines converge on the [[North Pole]], and thus narrow at higher latitudes.  Contrary to what the marteloio suggests, 370 leagues West of Cape Verde is ''not'' on the same longitude meridian as 654 leagues West of Seville.  Because Seville is well north of Cape Verde, the meridians are clustered closer together at Seville's latitude than at Cape Verde's latitude.  A ship sailing west of Seville will, in fact, reach the real Tordesillas meridian (point ''T'' on map) well before 654 leagues are sailed (point ''D'').

The rule of marteloio has sailors plot routes by drawing [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] triangles on a chart, as if the world's surface were flat.  While this might be practical enough for sailing confined to the compact latitudes of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is quite misleading on a grander scale.

== Relation to later rules ==

=== Relation to the "regiment of the leagues" ===

In the late 15th and 16th centuries, the improvement of [[celestial navigation|nautical astronomy]] and the introduction of [[latitude]] parallels allowed navigators to determine their position at sea by celestial readings, rather than relying on estimation of distance sailed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956), Albuquerque (1970), Parry (1974), Randles (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  The successor of the rule of marteloio was the "Regiment of the Leagues" (''regimento das léguas''),  that was used by Portuguese navigators sailing in the Atlantic Ocean.  Or, to use the term introduced by [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1571), the "Rule to Raise or Lay a Degree", also known as the "Table of Leagues" or the "Rule for Raising the Pole".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1956: pp. 163–4); Cotter (1978: p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first written down in the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] navigation manual ''Regimento do astrolabio e do quadrante'' (published in Lisbon c. 1509, but written c. 1480)&lt;ref&gt;Diffie and Winius (1977: p.141); Parry (1974: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kCREcRCFD0QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.149])&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]] in his 1551 ''Breve compendio la esfera y del arte de navegar''.

The "Regiment of the Leagues" is not very different from the rule of marteloio. The Regiment of the Leagues always considers the west-east bearing as the "intended course" and measures set deviations from it.  More specifically, the league table considers a fixed value of ''alargar'' – set at 1 [[Latitude#Degree length|latitude degree]] (or, in the measurements of the time, 17.5 (Portuguese) [[League (unit)|leagues]], or equivalently 70 (Italian) [[nautical mile|miles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Parry (pp. 149–50). One Portuguese league was four Italian miles. In modern nautical measures, one degree is 20 leagues, and one league is three nautical miles, thus 60 nautical miles to the degree.&lt;/ref&gt;  It then gives for every different [[quarter wind]] of sailing direction (always designated as quarters away from the north-south axis, rather than away from the intended course), the ''relevar'' and the ''afastar''.  The ''relevar'' is the number of leagues on the actual course that a ship must sail in order to cover the pre-set 1 degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the starting parallel). The ''afastar'' is merely the corresponding ''avanzar'' on the west-east bearing.

[[image:Regiment of the leagues.gif|thumb|400px|Illustration of the "Regiment of the Leagues"]]
'''Example''':  Suppose a ship sets out on an East-southeast (ESE) bearing.  That is six quarter-winds above South (remember: unlike the marteloio, the Regiment of the Leagues always measures quarter-winds away from the north–south meridian).  Looking at any regiment of the leagues table (e.g. [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], 1551),&lt;ref&gt;See Cotter (1978: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fAnNGk1xXwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.13])&lt;/ref&gt; for ''q'' = 6, the table gives the ''relevar'' as 45{{frac|11|15}} leagues and the ''afastar'' as 42{{frac|1|4}} leagues.  This means that a ship sailing on the ESE bearing will have to sail 45.73 leagues to cover one degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of ''alargar'' from the east bearing, to use the marteloio language), and the corresponding ''afastar'' (''avanzar'' in marteloio terms) will be 42.25 leagues.

If, instead, the ship had set out on a SE bearing, that is four quarter-winds above South, the corresponding values of the Regiment of the Leagues table at ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 are ''relevar'' = 24{{frac|3|4}} and the ''afastar'' = 17 {{frac|1|2}}.

Notice that the SE bearing reaches the 1 degree alargar faster (i.e. smaller ''relevar'') than that the ESE bearing, and will have less ''afastar'' (closer to the N–S meridian).

Mathematically,

:''relevar'' = 17.5/cos θ
:''afastar'' = 17.5 &amp;times; tan θ

where θ = 11.25 &amp;times; number of quarters-winds away from the north-south axis.

Despite the difference in terminology, notably the use of latitude degrees, the rule of marteloio and the Regiment of the Leagues are very similar – they are both about solving triangles on a plane chart.  The advantage of the regiment over the marteloio is the introduction of latitude parallels in the table, so that the position can be checked by astronomical observation (via [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], [[astrolabe]], etc.), and not have to rely wholly on sailor estimations of distance and direction.

With the regiment, geographical coordinates can also be used to guide navigation.  For instance, the search for the Todesillas line (meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde) is much simplified by reference to a precise latitude.  For instance, suppose two ships depart from Cape Verde (17° N), one on a West by North bearing (WbN, that is one quarter above West, or ''q'' = 7 from North axis), the other by a west-northwest bearing (WNW, two quarters above west, or ''q'' = 6 from the North axis). Using the Regiment of the Leagues, it is possible to calculate the precise latitudes when they will cross the Tordesillas meridian – simply divide 370 leagues west by the implied ''afastar'' at the different bearings. The WbN ship will reach the meridian when it achieves latitude 21° 21' N, while the WNW ship will reach it when it achieves latitude 29° N.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque (1973:[https://books.google.com/books?id=vOrDjQgDzQ8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 231])&lt;/ref&gt; So rather than counting leagues with hourglass and speed readings, the ships can just maintain bearing, and take periodic astronomical observations to assess their latitude.

=== Relation to "traverse sailing" ===

The toleta de marteloio is ancestral to the modern "[[traverse table]]" used in more modern navigation.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a traverse table, see Gunmere (1822) ''Mathematical Tables'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAg1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern nomenclature, the ''traverse'' is the "crooked path made by a ship when she sails in several successive directions" and ''resolving the traverse'' is "the method of finding a single course and distance which would bring a ship to the same place as two or more courses and distances".&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield (1883: [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUYDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58])&lt;/ref&gt;  In marteloio language, when "resolving the traverse", the known information given is the "actual course" and the "ritorno", while the unknowns are the "intended bearing" and "total avanzo".

Traverse tables use three values for each of the crooked course segments – the ''Distance'' (Dist.), ''Difference of Latitude'' (D.Lat., movement along N–S axis) and the ''Departure'' (Dep., movement along E–W axis), the latter two calculated by the formulas:

: ''Difference of latitude'' = distance × cos ''θ'' 
: ''Departure'' =  distance × sin ''θ''

where ''θ'' is the angular difference of the course from the N–S axis if the values of ''θ'' are less than 45°; if, however, the angle exceeds 45°, then ''θ'' is expressed as the angle of difference from the E–W axis, and the formulas are flipped, i.e. the Difference of Latitude formula becomes the Departure, and the Departure formula is the Difference of Latitude).  Or, even more simply, calculate  ''θ'' as the angle of difference from the nearest principal wind (N, S, E, W), run the formulas and then place the larger number in the appropriate column (D.Lat. or Dep.).

For each course segment, the navigator inserts the relevant trio (Dist., D.Lat., Dep.) and can calculate the implied bearing from the beginning to the endpoint and the distance made good on that bearing. He then combines, by addition and subtraction, all the differences of latitude and departure, to get the overall difference of latitude and departure, and converts that back to overall bearing and distance made good.&lt;ref&gt;For applications, see Merrifield (1883: p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manuscript sources ==

[[Ramon Llull]]'s suggestive 1295 remarks aside, the earliest known reference to ''marteloio'' is dated 1390, in the inventory of the estate of the mother of a certain Oberto Foglieto of Genoa, where an entry reads  ''unum martelogium....item carta una pro navegando''.&lt;ref&gt;This is reproduced in Albertis (1893: p. 118).  See also Cortesão (1969: p.209&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear appearance and explanation is the 1436 atlas of Venetian captain [[Andrea Bianco]].  Other early manuscripts have since been found relating the rule of marteloio, include:&lt;ref&gt;This list is based on Rossi (2009: p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Toleta de marteloio (Cornaro Atlas).jpg|thumb|150px|''Toleta de marteloio'' and an eight-wind ''tondo e quadro'', from p. 47 of the [[Cornaro Atlas]] (c. 1489)]]
* an anonymous 15th-century Venetian codex, post-1428, once part of the collection of Doge [[Marco Foscarini]], now lost.&lt;ref&gt;It is described by Abbot [[Giuseppe Toaldo]] (1782: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWErAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.44]); the date is definitely after 1428, since it contains a tract by Venetian captain-general [[Andrea Mocenigo]] from that time. Toaldo (p.60) tentatively speculates it may have been introduced as late as 1463 by [[Regiomontanus]], but that is inconsistent with all other earlier manuscript dates.  However, Toaldo, writing in 1782, would not have been aware of them (although he does make a note that an "interesting" 1436 atlas (Andrea Bianco's) was just discovered that year by Formaleoni).&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''Liber'' of Venetian mariner [[Michael of Rhodes]] (c. 1434–36) (Ms. in private collection)&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript is reproduced in Long, P.I., D. McGee and A.M. Stahl (2009).  It can also be found online at the [http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/index.html Michael of Rhodes website] hosted by the Museo Galileo.  Rossi (2009: p.xxxii–iii) suggests 1434–6 as the dating of the writing of the mathematical section, which includes the marteloio, although the rest of the book would continue to be written through the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Karl Siegfried Passarge''' (28 November 1866&lt;ref&gt;due to an incorrect parish register entry, his birth date is often stated as 26 February 1867; compare the [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz18731.html article]&lt;/ref&gt; – 26 July 1958) was a German geographer from [[East Prussia]].

==Life==
Siegfried Passarge was born in [[Königsberg]], the son of travel writer [[:de:Ludwig Passarge|Ludwig Passarge]]. He attended [[Frederick College]], and after graduation studied geography in [[Berlin]] and [[Jena]]. He also trained in medicine, and worked as a doctor during his military service.

In 1894 Passarge took part in an expedition to [[Adamawa Region|Adamawa]], at the northern boundary of the former German colony of [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Christian|title=Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany|publisher=|year=|ISBN=}}, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1899 Passarge worked as a geologist and surveyor for the British West Charterland Company in [[South Africa]], during which time he made extensive ethnographic studies of the [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kalahari Ethnographies (1896–98) of Siegfried Passarge: nineteenth-century Khoisan- and Bantu-speaking peoples.(Review)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61823463.html|publisher=''Africa'' magazine via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required)|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=September 22, 1999|author=Guenther, Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901–1902 he took part in an expedition to the [[Orinoco]], followed by travel in Algeria in 1906 and 1907. His travel memoirs record his experiences, including the violences he committed whilst in Africa.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; 

From 1904–1905 Passarge held the post of Associate Professor of Geography in Berlin and in 1905 he became Professor of Geography in [[Wrocław|Breslau]]. In 1908 he joined the Colonial Institute in [[Hamburg]], where he worked until 1936. He theorised that it should be possible for geographers to set up a taxonomic system for landforms, in much the same way as the biological sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Delineation, Characterization, and Classification of Topographic Eminences|last=Sinha|first=Gaurav|ISBN=9780549370550|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he favoured an empirical, descriptive system rather than a genetic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|last1=James|first1=Preston Everett|last2=Martin|first2=Geoffrey J.|title=All possible worlds: a history of geographical ideas|publisher=Wiley|year=1981|ISBN=9780471061212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passarge's theories of racial geography (expounded in the 1920s in ''Das Judentum als landschaftskundlich-ethnologisches Problem'') were embraced by the Nazi Party after 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Gregory Paul|title=Anti-Semitism and Schooling Under the Third Reich|pages=147–148|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=9780815339434|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1933 he was among the signatories of the commitment of the professors at German universities and colleges to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich|last=Klee|first=Ernst|publisher=Fischer Taschenbuch|year=2005|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tiantishan Caves''' ({{zh|s=天梯山石窟|p=Tiāntīshān shíkū}}) are a series of [[rock cut architecture|rock cut]] [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] cave temples in the [[Liangzhou District]] of [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu]], northwest [[China]].

The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] monk [[Daoxuan]] in his ''Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu'' ascribes the opening of Tiantishan to the [[Xiongnu]] king of [[Northern Liang]] [[Juqu Mengxun]]'s devotion to "meritorious deeds" alongside his desire to avoid the [[Impermanence#Buddhism|impermanence]] of the city by fashioning caves from the mountains.&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&amp;pg=PA584 |title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220–589 AD) |editor1=John Lagerwey |editor2=Pengzhi Lü |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-9004175853 |pages=584 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the account in the ''[[Wei Shu]]'' of monks and Buddhist teachers relocating to the east after the conquest of the [[Northern Liang]] by the [[Northern Wei]] and subsequent persecution, structural, iconographic, and stylistic analysis shows that activity at the site continued.&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt; A total of nineteen caves in three tiers have been identified:&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt;

==Later history==
Tiantishan disappeared from the historical record after the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt; While decoration and modification of the caves continued into the [[Qing dynasty]], five suffered from collapse over the centuries, exacerbated by an earthquake in 1927.&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt; Despite initial survey in the early 1950s demonstrating the importance of the site, in April 1959 the Gansu provincial government approved the construction of a reservoir that would flood two of the three tiers of caves when commissioned in May the following year.&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt; In the interval, a research team from the [[Dunhuang Research Academy|Dunhuang Academy]] and [[Gansu Provincial Museum]] documented the site and excavated the collapsed caves, although all the written records and colour photographs and most of the black-and-white photographs have since been lost, along with most of the copies of the wall paintings.&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt; Some {{convert|50|sqm}} of the paintings were [[Detachment of wall paintings|detached]], although the colours have since "faded after 40 years of natural weathering", and other than for the largest, most of the sculptures were taken down and removed to the Museum.&lt;ref name="Wuwei"/&gt; In 2001, in recognition of their [[Values (heritage)|significance]] as one of the earliest [[Buddhist]] grotto sites in the country, the Tiantishan Caves were designated a [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level]] by [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage|SACH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/col/col1644/index.html |script-title=zh:全国重点文物保护单位 |trans-title=Major National Historical and Cultural Sites |publisher=[[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]]| language=Chinese |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tupo''' &lt;!--{{IPAc-en|}} --&gt;is a large crater in the middle of the southern hemisphere of the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], located at 32.35° S, 88.38° E. It has a diameter of 37 km. The crater is named after an obscure [[Mangarevan mythology|Mangarevan god]] of disorder (perhaps the same as Tu or Tupa), involved in turmeric planting&lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt; It was officially named by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] on July 3, 2015.&lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt;

Nearby prominent craters are Tafakula and the tiny Braciaca to the north, the gigantic [[Kerwan (crater)|Kerwan]] towards the east-center part of Ceres in Vendimia Planitia, Chaminuka further southeast and [[Darzamat (crater)|Darzamat]] to the southwest.  Due west of Tupo is a hill feature known as Niman Rupes.

{{For|the railroad device|water crane}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|Deep sea water column]]

A '''water column''' is a conceptual column of water from the surface of a sea, river or lake to the bottom sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B.H., Axler, R., Hagley C., Host G., Merrick G., Richards C. (2004). "[http://waterontheweb.org/resources/glossary.html#W Glossary]". ''Water on the Web''. University of Minnesota-Duluth. Retrieved 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptively, the deep sea water column is divided into five parts—''[[pelagic zone]]s'' (from Greek πέλαγος (pélagos), 'open sea')—from the surface to below the floor, as follows: ''[[epipelagic]]'', from the surface to 200 meters below the surface; ''[[mesopelagic]]'', from 200 to 1000 meters below the surface; ''[[bathypelagic]]'', from 1000 to 4000 meters below the surface; ''[[abyssopelagic]]'', from 4000 meters below the surface to the level sea floor; ''[[hadopelagic]]'', depressions and crevices below the level sea floor.

The concept of water column is useful since many aquatic phenomena are explained by the incomplete vertical mixing of chemical, physical or biological parameters.  For example, when studying the metabolism of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]], it is the specific bottom layer concentration of available [[chemical]]s in the water column that is meaningful, rather than the average value of those chemicals throughout the water column. 

Water columns are used chiefly for [[environmental science|environmental studies]] evaluating the [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] or mixing of the thermal or chemically stratified layers in a lake, stream or ocean: for example, by wind-induced currents. Some of the common parameters analyzed in the water column are [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[temperature]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], [[salinity]], [[total dissolved solids]], various [[pesticide]]s, [[pathogen]]s and a wide variety of chemicals and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

The term ''water column'' is also commonly used in [[scuba diving]] to describe the vertical space through which divers ascend and descend.

The '''Willapa Hills''' is a [[Geology|geologic]], [[Physiography|physiographic]], and [[Geography|geographic]] region in southwest Washington. When described as a physiographical province, the Willapa Hills are bounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, the [[Columbia River]] to the south, the [[Olympic Mountains]] to the north, and the [[Cascade Range]] to the east.&lt;ref name=ares&gt;{{cite book |last= Ares |first= Adrian |title= The Fall River long-term site productivity study in coastal Washington |year= 2007 |series= General Technical Report, Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station |publisher= DIANE Publishing |isbn= 978-1-4223-2472-1 |pages= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions place the Puget Lowland physiographic province east of the Willapa Hills.&lt;ref name=dnr&gt;{{cite web |title= Geology of Washington - Willapa Hills |publisher= Washington State Department of Natural Resources |url= http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/Topics/GeologyofWashington/Pages/willapa.aspx |accessdate = 2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within the province are the [[Black Hills (Washington)|Black Hills]], the [[Doty Hills]], and a number of broad river valleys, some of which open up into broad [[Estuary|estuaries]] on the Pacific such as [[Grays Harbor]] and [[Willapa Bay]].&lt;ref name=dnr/&gt; Other definitions do not include the Black Hills.&lt;ref name=peakbagger&gt;{{cite web |title= Willapa Hills |publisher= Peakbagger.com |url= http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=12213 |accessdate= 2009-05-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USGS]] [[GNIS]] defines the Willapa Hills as bounded by the Columbia River to the south and the [[Chehalis River (Washington)|Chehalis River]] to the north, without giving specific east and west bounds.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{cite gnis |id= 1513656 |name= Willapa Hills |accessdate= 2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Willapa Hills are one of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], which continue north as the Olympic Mountains and south, across the Columbia River, as the [[Oregon Coast Range]].

The highest point is {{convert|3087|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Boistfort Peak]]. The Willapa Hills are the lowest uplands in the entire [[Pacific Coast Range]] system. Almost all of the land is privately held and has been repeatedly logged. Only a few [[long corners]] remain with virgin forest. [[Alders]] less than twenty years old are typically harvested for [[pulp mill]]s.

The Willapa Hills receive abundant rainfall and a number of rivers originate in the region, including the [[Chehalis River (Washington)|Chehalis River]], [[Willapa River]], [[North River (Washington)|North River]], [[Bone River]], [[Niawiakum River]], [[Palix River]], [[Bear River (Washington)|Bear River]], [[Naselle River]], [[Grays River (Washington)|Grays River]], and [[Elochoman River]], among others.
