'''1991 BA''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] that was first observed by [[Spacewatch]] on 18 January 1991, and passed within 160,000&amp;nbsp;km (100,000&amp;nbsp;mi) of [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-1991BA" /&gt; This is a little less than half the distance to the [[Moon]].

== Description ==
1991 BA is approximately 5 to 10 meters (15 to 30&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter and is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]].&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; It follows a highly eccentric (0.68), low-inclination (2.0°) orbit of 3.3 years duration, ranging between 0.71 and 3.7 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]]. 1991 BA was, at the time of its discovery, the smallest and closest confirmed asteroid outside of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Scotti1991/&gt; 1991 BA is too faint to be observed except during close approaches to Earth and is considered [[Lost asteroid|lost]].

== Possible impact ==
Virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory show a 1 in 1,961,000 chance that the asteroid will [[Impact event|impact]] Earth on 2023 January 18.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; It is estimated that an impact would produce an upper atmosphere air burst equivalent to 19 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kt TNT]],&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; roughly equal to Nagasaki's [[Fat Man]]. The asteroid would appear as a bright fireball and fragment in the air burst into smaller pieces that would hit the ground at terminal velocity producing a meteorite [[strewn field]]. Impacts of objects this size are estimated to occur approximately once a year.{{citation needed|reason=One Nagasaki bomb per year??|date=September 2016}} Asteroid {{mpl|2008 TC|3}} was an object of similar size that was discovered less than a day before its impact on Earth on October 7, 2008 and produced a fireball and meteorite strewn field in the [[Sudan]].

The '''6V6''' is a [[beam-power]] [[tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]]. The first of this family of tubes to be introduced was the '''6V6G''' by [[Kentucky Electrical Lamp Company|Ken-Rad]] Tube &amp; Lamp Corporation in late 1936,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Engineering/30s/1936/Radio-Engineering-1936-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the availability by December of both [[Kentucky Electrical Lamp Company|Ken-Rad]] and [[Raytheon]] 6V6G tubes announced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Service-Magazine/30s/Service-1936-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still in use in audio applications, especially electric guitar amplifiers.&lt;ref name="6v6-gplayer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/5-6v6-powered-low-wattage-tube-combos/16211 |title=5 6V6 –Powered, Low-Wattage Tube Combos |author=Dave Hunter |publisher=guitarplayer.com |date=August 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 21, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311223603/http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/5-6v6-powered-low-wattage-tube-combos/16211 |archivedate=March 11, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction in July 1936 of the [[6L6]], the potential of the scaled down version that became the 6V6 was soon realized. The lower-powered 6V6 was better suited for average home use, and became common in the audio output stages of "farmhouse" table-top [[radio]]s, where power pentodes such as the [[6F6]] had previously been used. The 6V6 required less heater power and produced less distortion than the 6F6, while yielding higher output in both single-ended and [[Push-pull output|push-pull]] configurations. Although the 6V6 was originally designed especially for use in automobile radios,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Today/30s/Radio-Today-1936-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the clip-in [[Loctal base]] '''7C5''',&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/201/7/7C5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; from early 1939, or the lower heater current '''12V6GT''', both with the identical characteristics to the 6V6, but with the smaller T-9 glass envelope, soon became the tubes of choice for many automotive radios manufacturers. Additionally, the 6V6 had applications in portable battery-operated radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCA Receiving Tube Manual|url=https://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/191/6/6V6.pdf|publisher=RCA|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data sheet information supplied by the tube manufacturers design centers, list the typical operation of an audio output stage for a single 6V6 as producing about 5W of continuous power, and a push-pull pair about 14W. Amplifier manufacturers soon realized that the tube was capable of being used at ratings above the recommended maximums, and guitar amplifiers with 400V on the plates of a pair of 6V6GTA claim to produce an output power of 20W RMS at 5%THD with 40W Peak Music Power, and with 490V on the plates, as much as 30W RMS.

==History==
[[File:6V6 tube bulbs.png|thumb|Different 6V6 tube envelope dimensions]][[File:Coin Based RCA 6V6GTA.jpg|thumb|1970's "Coin" Based RCA 6V6GTA]][[File:6V6s.JPG|thumb|right|Various 6V6's manufactured around the world; from left to right – 6V6GTA by General Electric, 6V6GT JAN National Union (1940s), 6P6S (USSR, 1978) and modern production 6V6GT by Electro-Harmonix.]]
Following the '''6V6G''', RMA Release #96 – 09 Nov. 1936, sponsored by [[Kentucky Electrical Lamp Company|Ken-Rad]] Tube &amp; Lamp Corporation, with the ST 14 shouldered glass envelope, the '''6V6''' was announced with a metal mantel in January 1937 by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Hygrade Sylvania Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Today/30s/Radio-Today-1937-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The RMA Release #125 – 03 Jan.1938, Sponsored by [[RCA Corporation|RCA]]. for the 6V6 tube has led to some confusion as to the origins of the 6V6. The 6V6G but not the 6V6 is in the RCA manual RC-13 from July 1937, but the 6V6 is to be found in the 1937 tube manuals of other manufacturers, such as Raytheon. Tube manufacturers were keen to promote the superiority of the metal tube construction that was introduced on April 1, 1935, and large quantities of the 6V6 tube were produced in the following decade, many as military supply [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|JAN]] tubes, and the price of the metal and glass versions were held to closely the same retail price level for the first few years of their production. The introduction of the '''6V6GT''', RMA Release #201 – 10 July 1939, was sponsored by Hytron Corporation. By 1940, the 6V6G production was largely superseded by this smaller "GT" T-9 glass envelope.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/049/6/6V6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 1942, the War Production Board ordered
radio tube manufacturers to discontinue within seven days the production for civilian use of 349 of the 710 types of radio tubes on the market, amongst these was the 6V6G and 6V6GX. By 1943, we find that the price of the metal version is almost twice that of the GT version, and this proportional difference in price seems to have remained constant, right through to the end of the 1970s. The '''6V6GTA''' – RMA Release #1681 – 2 July 1956, sponsored by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Hygrade Sylvania Corporation]], has a controlled warm-up period.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/049/6/6V6GTA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The various different NOS (new old stock) tubes of the 6V6 family, depending on manufacturer, model, series, strength and condition, will vary enormously in scarcity and therefore usually in price. The metal NOS 6V6 tube, once costing almost twice the price of its now highly valued glass enveloped counterparts, is now considered to be fairly common, and is usually the cheapest NOS tube available, with many current production tubes costing more than its 60 to 80 year older classic predecessor. In the final years of U.S. production, several of the major manufacturers switched to using the so-called "coin" based GT bulb.

==Current use==
Now, eighty years after its introduction, and still retaining its original characteristics, the 6V6 has one of the longest active lifetimes of any electronic component, having never been out of production in all this long period of time. Although historically widely used in all manner of electronic goods, many of which are still in service, it is in guitar amplifiers where its use has become archetypal. Not only are there very many existing amplifiers in regular use that rely on the 6V6, with contemporary reproductions of the more iconic models still being made, modern designers are still keen to develop new creations that rely on its use.
Generally speaking, 6V6 tubes are sturdy and can be operated beyond their published specifications (the Soviet made 6P6S,&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/113/6/6P6S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Chinese 6V6 versions being possible exceptions, although current production has improved). Because of this, the 6V6 soon proved itself to be suitable for use in consumer-market musical [[instrument amplifier]]s, particularly combo-style guitar amps such as the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] GA-40, and the [[Fender Amplifiers]]; [[Fender Champ|Champ]], [[Fender Princeton Reverb|Princeton]], and [[Fender Deluxe Reverb|Deluxe]], some of which drive their 6V6s well in excess of the [[datasheet]] specified maximum rating. This ongoing demand encourages [[China|Chinese]], [[Slovakia]]n and [[Russia]]n tube factories not only to keep the 6V6 in production to this day, but to further develop the supply.

Other equivalents of this tube are the '''CV1862,''' '''[[EL90]],''' '''6005,''' '''6095,''' '''6669,''' '''6928,''' '''BPM 04,''' '''CK-6005,''' '''M8249,''' '''N7277C5,''' '''6L31'''

'''12AQ5''' - Same as the 6AQ5, but with different heater ratings.

'''[[6P1P]]''' ('''6П1П''' in Cyrillic.) – 9-pin Soviet version of the 6AQ5.

'''6973''' – US version, 9 pin Noval base tube, higher plate voltage ratings, intended for high fidelity output applications.

'''6CM6''' – 9 pin Noval base tube, equivalent type primarily intended for vertical deflection amplifiers in television receivers.

'''12CM6''' - Same as the 6CM6, but with different heater ratings.

'''12AB5''' – 9 pin Noval base tube with  12V heater, suitable for automotive receiver applications. Equivalent to the '''7061'''

The [[pentode]] '''[[EL84]]/6BQ5''' - 9 pin Noval base tube, that although different enough from the 6V6 not to justify rating it as an equivalent, because of its popularity and ready availability, plus having a close enough similarity to make it possible, adapters have been developed commercially to allow an amplifier designed for 6V6 use, to accept the noval based [[EL84]] tube. Likewise, the inverse adapter is also available.

* The [http://www.gamlss.org GAMLSS framework] 

It is important to clarify that although the ACEGES model builds on the available scholarly and policy literature, it does not strictly follow any existing approach.

== History ==
The ACEGES project was conceived by Vlasios Voudouris (with contributions by Michael Jefferson). Voudouris is now Affiliate Professor (Energy and Commodities) at the [[ESCP Europe]].  The first version of the ACEGES decision-support tool was written in 2010. The ACEGES models energy demand and supply of 218 countries. The ACEGES tool was the main output of the [http://www.aceges.org ACEGES Project]. The overall aim of the ACEGES project was to develop, test and disseminate an agent-based computational laboratory for the systematic experimental study of the global energy system through the mechanism of Energy Scenarios. In particular, the intention was to show how the ACEGES framework and prototype can be used to help leaders in government, business and civil society better understand the challenging outlook for energy through controlled computational experiments.

== Demonstrations ==
The ACEGES tool has been used, for example, to test the [[peak oil]] theory and to develop plausible [[Scenario analysis|scenarios]] of [[conventional oil]] production by means of demonstration at:

[[File:Sisyphus by von Stuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sisyphus]], the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by [[Franz Stuck]] (1920)]]

&lt;!-- Do not edit the definition of Absurdism without first discussing on the Talk page - thank you for helping to maintain a neutral point of view --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], "'''the Absurd'''" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|inherent value]] and [[meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. 

As a philosophy, '''absurdism''' furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-73373-6|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|existentialist philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Stewart, Jon (2011). Kierkegaard and Existentialism. Farnham, England: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-2641-7}}. pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon |title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. The aftermath of [[World War II]] provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [[France]].

{{Also|Existentialism#The Absurd}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the [[meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]] of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942), respectively:

*[[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.
*[[Religious]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]], or abstract belief in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires an irrational but perhaps necessary religious "leap" into the intangible and empirically unprovable (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as "philosophical suicide".
*Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom. By recognizing no religious or other moral constraints, and by revolting against the Absurd (through meaning-making) while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could find contentment through the transient personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1941}} Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to existentialism and nihilism==
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the [[free will]] of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that "it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically ''in spite of'' the psychological tension of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=What is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in “revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus himself passionately worked to counter [[nihilism]], as he explained in his essay "[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]," while he also categorically rejected the label of "existentialist" in his essay "Enigma" and in the compilation ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'', though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of [[existential nihilism]]: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., "a benign indifference", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress,{{example needed|date=November 2018}} however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.

Such a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning.  While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other.  The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death.  But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.

==Søren Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Kierkegaard designed the relationship framework based (in part) on how a person reacts to [[existential despair|despair]]. Absurdist philosophy fits into the 'despair of defiance' rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''. ''Kierkegaard wrote about all four viewpoints in his works at one time or another, but the majority of his work leaned towards what would later become absurdist and theistic existentialist views.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A century before [[Albert Camus|Camus]], the 19th century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

{{quotation|What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;|Kierkegaard, Søren|Journals|1849}}

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: {{Quotation|What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up. etc., has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, in as much as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.&lt;br&gt;—Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210}}

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: {{Quotation|I gladly undertake, by way of brief repetition, to emphasize what other pseudonyms have emphasized. The absurd is not the absurd or absurdities without any distinction (wherefore Johannes de Silentio: "How many of our age understand what the absurd is?"). The absurd is a category, and the most developed thought is required to define the Christian absurd accurately and with conceptual correctness. The absurd is a category, the negative criterion, of the divine or of the relationship to the divine. When the believer has faith, the absurd is not the absurd — faith transforms it, but in every weak moment it is again more or less absurd to him. The passion of faith is the only thing which masters the absurd — if not, then faith is not faith in the strictest sense, but a kind of knowledge. The absurd terminates negatively before the sphere of faith, which is a sphere by itself. To a third person the believer relates himself by virtue of the absurd; so must a third person judge, for a third person does not have the passion of faith. Johannes de Silentio has never claimed to be a believer; just the opposite, he has explained that he is not a believer — in order to illuminate faith negatively.&lt;br&gt;—''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' X6B 79&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Naturalthinker.com|title=Søren Kierkegaard|url=http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/X_6_B.html|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard provides an example in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (1843), which was published under the pseudonym ''[[Johannes de Silentio]]''. In the story of [[Abraham]] in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Abraham is told by [[God]] to [[Binding of Isaac|kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").&lt;ref&gt;Silentio, Johannes de. ''Fear and Trembling'', Denmark, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym ''[[Anti-Climacus]]''. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Sickness Unto Death'', Ch.3, part B, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

==Albert Camus==
Though the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all [[Albert Camus]]'s writing, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a "divorce" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand&amp;nbsp;– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: [[suicide]], a [[leap of faith]], or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"/&gt;

For Camus, suicide is a "confession" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is "too much." Suicide offers the most basic "way out" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a "leap of faith," a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, ''Johannes de Silentio'' (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself),&lt;ref name=CC&gt;"The Kierkegaardian Leap" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''.&lt;/ref&gt; where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a "leap of faith," one must act with the "virtue of the absurd" (as ''Johannes de Silentio'' put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as "philosophical suicide," rejecting both this and physical suicide.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom&amp;nbsp;– and the opportunity to give life meaning&amp;nbsp;– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. "To live without appeal,"&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

Camus states in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': "Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolt" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; "Freedom" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; "Passion" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

==The meaning of life==
According to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find [[Meaning of life|meaning in their lives]]. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a [[deity|higher power]]—a belief in [[God]], or adherence to some [[religion]] or other abstract concept. 

===Elusion===
Camus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere "act of eluding"&amp;mdash;that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in [[religion]], [[existentialism]], and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.
Camus also concedes that elusion is the most common.

===God===
Even with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, "I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 40, note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal meaning===
For Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an [[irony|ironic]] distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.

===Freedom===
[[Liberty|Freedom]] cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of "acceptance without resignation" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can "live without appeal", while defining a "conscious revolt" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.

===Hope===
The rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so ''without'' hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s [[epitaph]]: "I hope for nothing.  I fear nothing.  I am free."

===Integrity===
The absurdist is not guided by [[morality]], but rather, by their own [[integrity]]. The absurdist is, in fact, [[Amorality|amoral]] (though not necessarily [[Morality|immoral]]). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.

'''BIRD''' ('''Bispectral and Infrared Remote Detection''') is a [[satellite]] launched by [[ISRO]] in 2001 for [[DLR Institute for Planetary Research|DLR]]. This small (92&amp;nbsp;kg) boxlike system, with [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] two collectors on stub wings, has remarkable fire-detection qualities. It hosts a two-channel infrared sensor system in combination with a Wide-Angle Optoelectronic Stereo Scanner (WAOSS). It also features a neuronal network classificator in orbit to reduce downlink bandwidth and cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/tech/tech_9.htm BIRD - A DLR Small Satellite Mission for the Investigation of Vegetation Fires and Vegetation Condition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique combination of a stereo camera and two infrared cameras gives the opportunity to acquire:

* More precise information about leaf mass and photosynthesis for the early diagnosis of vegetation condition and changes
* Real time discrimination between smoke and water clouds

The attitude&amp;control system of the BIRD satellite was reused in the [[TET-1]] satellite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4605">The '''Baldwin effect''' in astronomy describes a relationship between continuum and emission-line fluxes observed in the electromagnetic spectra of [[quasar]]s and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], namely an [[anticorrelation]] between the [[equivalent width]], W&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, of a spectral line and the continuum luminosity, L, in broad UV optical emission lines. This means that the ratio of brightness of the emission line to the brightness of the nearby continuum decreases with increasing luminosity of the continuum.

== Discovery and observations ==

The effect was discovered in observations of high-[[redshift]] quasars reported in 1977, and has been commonly named after the discoverer&lt;ref name = PoggePeterson1992/&gt; Jack Allen Baldwin, an astronomer at [[Lick Observatory]]. It was found that the [[equivalent width]] of the broad [[ultraviolet]] C IV (λ 1549) [[Spectral line|emission line]], caused by the presence of thrice [[ion]]ised [[carbon]] C&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, decreased with increasing continuum luminosity of the source.&lt;ref name = Baldwin1977/&gt; For flat-spectrum, radio-loud quasars the relation

&lt;math&gt;W_\lambda \propto L^{-2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

was found.&lt;ref name = Baldwin1989/&gt;

The same effect has been observed for other spectral lines such as the Ly-α [[hydrogen]] line and the C III] (λ 1909) line of twice ionised carbon.&lt;ref name = Baldwin1977/&gt; It has also been found for spectral lines in the [[infrared]] range, e.g. in several [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]].&lt;ref name = Hoenig2008/&gt;

== Explanation ==

More or less satisfactory explanations of the phenomenon have been attempted using [[photoionization]] models, continuum beaming, variability, or continuum shape. An adequate, but not exclusive explanation is offered as a consequence of the presence of massive [[accretion disk]]s in the centres of active galaxies and quasars.&lt;ref name = Netzer1985/&gt; However, a complete explanation is still outstanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">In physics, a '''bipolaron''' is a type of [[quasiparticle]] consisting of two [[polaron]]s. In [[organic chemistry]], it is a molecule or a part of a macromolecular chain containing two positive [[charge (physics)|charge]]s in a [[conjugated system]].

== Bipolarons in physics ==

In physics, a bipolaron is a bound pair of two polarons. An electron in a material may cause a distortion in the underlying lattice. The combination of [[electron]] and distortion (which may also be understood as a cloud of [[phonon]]s) is known as a polaron (in part because the interaction between electron and [[crystal structure|lattice]] is via a [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]]). When two polarons are close together, they can lower their energy by sharing the same distortions, which leads to an effective attraction between the polarons. If the interaction is sufficiently large, then that attraction leads to a bound bipolaron. For strong attraction, bipolarons may be small. Small bipolarons have integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and thus share some of the properties of [[boson]]s. If many bipolarons form without coming too close, they might be able to form a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. This has led to a suggestion that bipolarons could be a possible mechanism for [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. For example, they can lead to a very direct interpretation of the [[BCS theory#Successes of the BCS theory|isotope effect]].

Recently, bipolarons have been found in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Two polarons interchange sound waves and they attract to each other, forming a bound-state when the strength coupling between the single polarons and the condensate is strong in comparison with the interactions of the host gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bipolarons in a Bose-Einstein Condensate |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |date= 6 July 2018 |volume=121 |issue=013401 |url=https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.013401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bipolarons in organic chemistry ==

In organic chemistry, a bipolaron is a [[molecule]] or part of a [[macromolecular]] chain containing two positive charges in a conjugated system. The charges can be located in the centre of the chain or at its termini. Bipolarons and polarons are encountered in doped [[conducting polymer]]s such as [[polythiophene]].

It is possible to synthesize and isolate bipolaron model compounds for [[X-ray diffraction]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;

Two [[resonance structure]]s exist for the dication. Structure '''2a''' is a (singlet) diradical and '''2b''' is the [[closed shell]] [[quinoid]].

On the other hand, when a [[thiophene]] unit is added to the core in the structure depicted in ''scheme 2'', these bond lengths are identical (around 138 pm) making it a true hybrid.

'''Business Action for Energy (BAE)''' is a business network set up to give input to the UN Commission on [[Sustainable Development]].

The Business Action for Sustainable Development (BASD) was a temporary initiative developed around the [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD, Johannesburg, 2002). This initiative was a resounding success and this model for positive business co-operation has since received much support around the world. 

Businesses positive involvement must be continued in the international debate and on-the-ground projects, through partnerships and initiatives that can make a significant contribution to the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and the [[Johannesburg Declaration]].

Set up in January 2005 by three founding organizations - the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) and the [[World Energy Council]] (WEC) - Business Action for Energy (BAE) is an ad hoc, temporary business initiative bringing together a comprehensive network of businesses, large and small, from around the world, through the representation of their associations, drawn from many sectors and regions.

==Purpose==

BAE has been established to coordinate business input into the 14th and 15th sessions (May 2006 and 2007) of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), which will focus on [[energy]], industrial development, atmosphere and [[Climate Change|climate change]], and to other important forums in that timeframe. 

It will do so by coordinating the delivery of international business views, positions, or recommendations, and by communicating the depth and variety of activities and projects undertaken by businesses, often in partnership with governments, international, regional and local agencies, and [[NGO]]s, in pursuit of a more sustainable energy future. 

==Participants==

BAE brings together international, regional and sector organizations, representing oil, gas, nuclear, coal, electricity and other major energy producers and consumers. At the national level, members include national committees, chambers, chapters of international business organizations and sector associations.  The current list of confirmed participating organizations, including the founding organizations, are the:

*[[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC)
*[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD)
*[[World Energy Council]] (WEC)
*International Aluminium Institute (IAI)
*[[IPIECA]], The global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues
*Union of the Electricity Industry - [[EURELECTRIC]] 
*[[World Coal Institute]] (WCI)
*[[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA)
*[[World LP Gas Association]] (WLPGA)
*[[International Emissions Trading Association]] (IETA)
*[[International Hydropower Association]] (IHA)

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}'''The theory of cellularization''', also known as Ciliate-acoel theory, is one of the theories explaining the origin of the [[metazoan]]s. It was first based on [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s assumption that these beasts are formed from the jaws of fish and that the earliest animals derived from [[ciliate]] [[protozoan]]s. Haeckel later abandoned this idea which is revived by Hadzi in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnPeZdz5X4sC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357&amp;dq=hadzi+cellularization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c8fPO6hKuS&amp;sig=laEifAnxZ15HRCrBIkj7g8TfdoA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KQ4ATdzfFZLYngf38rnlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hadzi%20cellularization&amp;f=false Strickberger's evolution: the integration of genes, organisms and populations. By Brian Keith Hall, Benedikt Hallgrímsson, Monroe W. Strickberger, pg357]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, a [[multinucleated]] unicellular ciliate ancestor would give rise to organisms similar to modern [[turbellaria]]n [[flatworm]]s by cellularization of the external layer. Recent molecular and morphologic data add increasing evidence against this view, and the alternative [[colonial theory]], also proposed by Haeckel in the 1870s is gaining widespread acceptance.

A '''''derecho''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|tʃ|oʊ}}, from {{lang-es|derecho}} {{IPA-es|deˈɾetʃo|}}, "straight") is a widespread, long-lived, [[straight-line wind]] storm that is associated with a land-based, fast-moving group of [[Severe weather#Categories|severe thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref name="noaafacts" /&gt;

Derechos can cause hurricane-force winds, [[tornado]]es, heavy rains, and flash floods. [[Mesoscale convective system|Convection-induced]] winds take on a [[bow echo]] (backward "C") form of [[squall line]], forming in an area of [[wind divergence]] in upper levels of the [[troposphere]], within a region of low-level [[Thermal wind#Advection Turning|warm air advection]] and rich low-level moisture. They travel quickly in the direction of movement of their associated storms, similar to an [[outflow boundary]] (gust front), except that the wind is [[maximum sustained wind|sustained]] and increases in strength behind the front, generally exceeding [[Beaufort scale|hurricane-force]].

A warm-weather phenomenon, derechos occur mostly in summer, especially during June, July, and August in the Northern Hemisphere, within areas of moderately strong [[Atmospheric instability|instability]] and moderately strong vertical [[wind shear]]. They may occur at any time of the year and occur as frequently at night as during the daylight hours.

[[File:Progressive derecho diagram.jpg|thumb|275px|A typical progressive derecho]]

''Derecho'' comes from the Spanish word in adjective form for "straight" (or "direct"), in contrast with a ''[[tornado]]'' which is a "twisted" wind.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Spanish/English Dictionary (2009). [http://www.merriam-webster.com/spanish/derecho Derecho.] Merriam-Webster, Incorporated. Retrieved on 2009-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in the ''American Meteorological Journal'' in 1888 by [[Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs]] in a paper describing the phenomenon and based on a significant derecho event that crossed Iowa on 31 July 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dvn/?n=hinrichs|accessdate=2012-07-04|date=2009-12-18|title=A Brief History of Gustavus Hinrichs, Discoverer of the Derecho|author=Wolf, Ray|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Central Region Headquarters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Organized areas of [[thunderstorm]] activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, and can outrun [[cold front]]s. The resultant [[Mesoscale Convective System|mesoscale convective system]] (MCS) forms at the point of the best upper level divergence in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow.{{clarify|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Severe Thunderstorm Forecasting: A Historical Perspective|author=Schaefer, Joseph T.|journal=Weather and Forecasting|publisher=American Meteorological Society|date=December 1986|volume=1|issue=3|pages=164–189|number=|doi=10.1175/1520-0434(1986)001&lt;0164:STFAHP&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1986WtFor...1..164S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convection then moves east and toward the [[equator]] into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines with the mean tropospheric flow. When the convection is strong linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |year=2008 |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |title=Chapter 2: Definitions |pages=2–1 |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506002006/http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |archivedate=6 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derechos are squall lines that are bow- or spearhead-shaped on [[weather radar]] and, thus, also are called ''bow echoes'' or ''spearhead radar echoes''. Squall lines typically bow out due to the formation of a [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] [[high-pressure area|high pressure system]] which forms within the [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] rain area behind the initial line. This high pressure area is formed due to strong descending motion behind the squall line, and could come in the form of a [[downburst]].&lt;ref name="blowmedown"&gt;Parke, Peter S. and Norvan J. Larson (2005). [http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dlh/science/event_archive/summer_archive/1999blowdown/1999blowdown.php Boundary Waters Windstorm.] [[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. Retrieved on 2008-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the bow may vary, and the storms associated with the bow may die and redevelop.

During the cold season within the Northern Hemisphere, derechos generally develop within a pattern of southwesterly winds at mid levels of the troposphere in an environment of low to moderate atmospheric instability (caused by heat and moisture near ground level or cooler air moving in aloft and measured by [[convective available potential energy]]) and high values of vertical wind shear ({{convert|20|m/s|mph|abbr=on}} within the lowest {{convert|5|km|ft}} of the atmosphere). 

Warm season derechos in the Northern Hemisphere form in west to northwesterly flow at mid levels of the [[troposphere]] with moderate to high levels of instability. Derechos form within environments of low-level warm air advection and significant low-level moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/811.1 |title=A 4-Yr Climatology of Cold-Season Bow Echoes over the Continental United States |year=2004 |last1=Burke |first1=Patrick C. |last2=Schultz |first2=David M. |journal=Weather and Forecasting |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1061–1069|bibcode = 2004WtFor..19.1061B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and criteria==
Its common definition is a thunderstorm complex that produces a damaging wind swath of at least {{convert|250|mi}},&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/BAMS-86-11-1577 |title=Derecho Hazards in the United States |year=2005 |last1=Ashley |first1=Walker S. |last2=Mote |first2=Thomas L. |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=86 |issue=11 |pages=1580–1585|bibcode = 2005BAMS...86.1577A }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a concentrated area of convectively-induced wind gusts exceeding {{convert|50|kn|mph km/h|-1}}.&lt;ref name="noaafacts"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts.htm| title=About Derechos| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]], NCEP, NWS, NOAA Web Site| first= Stephen F.| last= Corfidi|first2=Robert H. | last2=Johns | first3=Jeffry S. | last3=Evans | date=2013-12-03| accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Weather Service]] criterion, a derecho is classified as a band of storms that have winds of at least {{convert|50|kn|-1}} along the entire span of the storm front, maintained over a time span of at least six hours. Some studies add a requirement that no more than two or three hours separate any two successive wind reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0434(2004)019&lt;0595:ITCOD&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0434 |year=2004 |volume=19 |pages=595 |title=Interpreting the Climatology of Derechos |last1=Coniglio |first1=Michael C. |last2=Stensrud |first2=David J. |journal=Weather and Forecasting |issue=3|bibcode = 2004WtFor..19..595C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Derechos typically possess a high or rapidly increasing forward speed. They have a distinctive appearance on radar (known as a bow echo) with several unique features, such as the rear [[inflow notch]] and [[bookend vortices]], and usually they manifest two or more [[downburst]]s.

There are four types of derechos:

* '''Serial derecho'''&amp;nbsp;– This type of derecho is usually associated with a very deep [[low pressure area|low]].
** '''Single-bow'''&amp;nbsp;– A very large [[bow echo]] around or upwards of {{convert|250|mi|km}} long. This type of serial derecho is less common than the multi-bow kind. An example of a single-bow serial derecho is the derecho that occurred in association with the [[October 2010 North American storm complex]].
** '''Multi-bow'''&amp;nbsp;– Multiple bow derechos are embedded in a large squall line typically around {{convert|250|mi|km}} long. One example of a multi-bow serial derecho is a derecho that occurred during the [[1993 Storm of the Century]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|date=4 August 2004|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/mar12-131993page.htm|title=Summary of the Subtropical Derecho|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of embedded [[supercell]]s, [[tornado]]es can spin out of these types of derechos. This is a much more common type of serial derecho than the single-bow kind. Multi-bow serial derechos can be associated with [[line echo wave pattern]]s on weather radar.
* '''Progressive derecho'''&amp;nbsp;– A line of thunderstorms take the bow-shape and may travel for hundreds of miles along stationary fronts. Examples of this include "[[Hurricane Elvis]]" in 2003 and the [[Boundary Waters-Canadian Derecho]] of 4–5 July 1999. Tornado formation is less common in a progressive than serial type.{{why|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
* '''Hybrid derecho'''&amp;nbsp;– A derecho with characteristics of both a serial and progressive derecho. Similar to serial derechos and progressive derechos, these types of derechos are associated with a deep low, but are relatively small in size. An example is the [[Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho]] that moved through the central Northern Plains and the Southern Great Lakes on 30–31 May 1998.
* '''Low dewpoint derecho'''&amp;nbsp;– A derecho that occurs in an environment of comparatively limited low-level moisture, with appreciable moisture confined to the mid-levels of the atmosphere. Such derechos most often occur between late fall and early spring in association with strong low pressure systems. Low dewpoint derechos are essentially organized bands of successive, dry [[downburst]]s. The Utah-Wyoming derecho of 31 May 1994 was an event of this type. It produced a 105&amp;nbsp;mph wind gust at Provo, Utah, where sixteen people were injured, and removed part of the roof of the Saltair Pavilion on the Great Salt Lake. Surface dewpoints along the path of the derecho were in the mid-40s °F.&lt;ref name="noaaUW"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/may311994page.htm| title=The Utah-Wyoming derecho of May 31, 1994| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]], NCEP, NWS, NOAA Web Site| first= Stephen F.| last= Corfidi| accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Winds in a derecho can be enhanced by downburst clusters embedded inside the storm. These straight-line winds may exceed {{convert|100|mph|km/h}}, reaching {{convert|130|mph|km/h}} in past events.&lt;ref name="RAH"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Changing Skies over Central North Carolina|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/newsletter/RAHNewsletter_Mar13.pdf|title=Understanding a Derecho: What is it?|date=Spring 2013|author=Brandon Vincent and Ryan Ellis|volume=10|number=1|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2013-05-06|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes sometimes form within derecho events, although such events are often difficult to confirm due to the additional damage caused by straight-line winds in the immediate area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xweather.org/derecho|title=Derecho|publisher=XWeather.org|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the average tornado in the United States and Canada rating in the low end of the F/[[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF]]1 classification at {{convert|85|to|100|mph}} peak winds and most or all of the rest of the world even lower, derechos tend to deliver the vast majority of extreme wind conditions over much of the territory in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Datasets compiled by the United States [[National Weather Service]] and other organizations show that a large swath of the north-central United States, and presumably at least the adjacent sections of Canada and much of the surface of the Great Lakes, can expect winds above 85&amp;nbsp;mph to as high as 120&amp;nbsp;mph (135 to 190&amp;nbsp;km/h) over a significant area at least once in any 50-year period, including both [[convective]] events and extra-tropical cyclones and other events deriving power from [[baroclinic]] sources. Only in 40 to 65&amp;nbsp;percent or so of the United States resting on the coast of the Atlantic basin, and a fraction of the Everglades, are derechos surpassed in this respect&amp;nbsp;— by [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalling]] [[hurricanes]], which at their worst may have winds as severe as EF3 tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/hurricanes/largest-hurricane/|title=What was the Largest Hurricane to Hit the United States?|publisher=Geology.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain derecho situations are the most common instances of severe weather outbreaks which may become ''less'' favorable to tornado production as they become more violent;{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} the height of 30–31 May 1998 upper Middle West-Canada-New York State derecho and the latter stages of significant tornado and severe weather outbreaks in 2003 and 2004 are only three examples of this. Some upper-air measurements used for severe-weather forecasting may reflect this [[point of diminishing return]] for tornado formation, and the mentioned three situations were instances during which the rare [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]] [[Severe thunderstorm watch|severe thunderstorm]] variety of [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|severe weather watches]] were issued from the [[Storm Prediction Center]] of the U.S. [[National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Some derechos develop a radar signature resembling that of a [[hurricane]] in the low levels. They may have a central ''[[eye (cyclone)|eye]]'' free of precipitation, with a minimum central pressure and surrounding bands of strong convection, but are really associated with an MCS developing multiple squall lines, and are not tropical in nature. These storms have a warm core, like other mesoscale convective systems. One such derecho occurred across the midwestern U.S. on 21 July 2003. An area of convection developed across eastern [[Iowa]] near a weak stationary/warm front and ultimately matured, taking on the shape of a wavy squall line across western [[Ohio]] and southern [[Indiana]]. The system re-intensified after leaving the Ohio Valley, starting to form a large hook, with occasional hook echoes appearing along its eastern side. A surface low pressure center formed and became more impressive later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Roth.

{{Main article|List of derecho events}}

Derechos in North America form predominantly from April to August, peaking in frequency from May into July.&lt;ref name="RAH"/&gt; During this time of year, derechos are mostly found in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] most commonly from [[Oklahoma]] and across the [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; During mid-summer when a hot and muggy airmass covers the north-central U.S., they will often develop farther north into [[Manitoba]] or [[Northwestern Ontario]], sometimes well north of the Canada–US border. 

[[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]] and upper [[Michigan]] are also vulnerable to derecho storms when such conditions are in place. They often occur along [[stationary front]]s on the northern periphery of where the most intense heat and humidity bubble exists. Late-year derechos are normally confined to [[Texas]] and the [[Deep South]], although a [[New York State Labor Day Derechos|late-summer derecho]] struck upper parts of the [[New York State]] area after midnight on 7 September 1998. Warm season derechos have greater instability than their cold season counterpart, while cool season derechos have greater shear than their warm season counterpart.

Although these storms most commonly occur in North America, derechos can occur elsewhere in the world, although infrequently. Outside North America, they sometimes are called by different names. For example, in [[Bangladesh]] and adjacent portions of India, a type of storm known as a "Nor'wester" may be a progressive derecho.&lt;ref name="noaafacts" /&gt; One such event occurred on 10 July 2002 in Germany: a serial derecho killed eight people and injured 39 near Berlin. They have occurred in Argentina and South Africa as well, and on rarer occasions, close to or north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] in northern Canada. Primarily a [[mid-latitudes]] phenomenon, derechos do occur in the Amazon Basin of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode=2010GeoRL..3716701N |title=Widespread Amazon forest tree mortality from a single cross-basin squall line event |author1=Negrón-Juárez |first1=Robinson I. |last2=Chambers |first2=Jeffrey Q. |last3=Guimaraes |first3=Giuliano |last4=Zeng |first4=Hongcheng |last5=Raupp |first5=Carlos F.

==Damage risk==

Unlike other thunderstorms, which typically can be heard in the distance when approaching, a derecho seems to strike suddenly. Within minutes, extremely high winds can arise, strong enough to knock over highway signs and topple large trees. These winds are accompanied by spraying rain and frequent lightning from all directions. It is dangerous to drive under these conditions, especially at night, because of blowing debris and obstructed roadways. Downed wires and widespread power outages are likely but not always a factor. A derecho moves through quickly, but can do much damage in a short time.

Since derechos occur during warm months and often in places with cold winter climates, people who are most at risk are those involved in outdoor activities. Campers, hikers, and motorists are most at risk because of falling trees toppled over by straight-line winds. Wide swaths of forest have been felled by such storms. People who live in mobile homes are also at risk; mobile homes that are not anchored to the ground may be overturned from the high winds. Across the United States, Michigan and New York have incurred a significant portion of the fatalities from derechos. Prior to [[Hurricane Katrina]], the death tolls from derechos and hurricanes were comparable for the United States.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

Derechos may also severely damage an urban area's electrical distribution system, especially if these services are routed above ground. The derecho that struck [[July 2011 Midwest Derecho|Chicago, Illinois on 11 July 2011]] left more than 860,000 people without electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, Kim, Mitch Dudek and Stefano Esposito, [http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/6455127-418/severe-thunderstorms-to-arrive-before-steamy-afternoon-heat.html "Storm could break ComEd record with 860,000-plus losing power,"] ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[June 2012 North American derecho]] took out electrical power to more than 3.7 million customers starting in the Midwestern United States, across the central Appalachians, into the Mid-Atlantic States during a [[heat wave]].&lt;ref name="reut630"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|author=Simpson, Ian|date=2012-06-30|title=Storms leave 3.4 million without power in eastern U.S.|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2012-06-30|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-weather-stormbre85t02u-20120629,0,1801684.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4383">'''Energy current''' is a flow of energy defined by the [[Poynting vector]] ({{nowrap|'''E''' × '''H'''}}), as opposed to normal [[electric current|current]] (flow of [[charge (physics)|charge]]). It was originally postulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]]. It is also an informal name for [[Energy flux]].

== Explanation ==

"Energy current" is a somewhat informal term that is used, on occasion, to describe the process of energy transfer in situations where the transfer can usefully be viewed in terms of a flow. It is particularly used when the transfer of energy is more significant to the discussion than the process by which the energy is transferred. For instance, the flow of fuel oil in a pipeline could be considered as an energy current, although this would not be a convenient way of visualising the fullness of the storage tanks.

The units of energy current are those of [[Electric power|power]] ([[watt|W]]).  This is closely related to [[energy flux]], which is the energy transferred per unit area per unit time (measured in W/m{{sup|2}}).

== Energy current in electromagnetism ==

A specific use of the concept of energy current was promulgated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in the last quarter of the 19th century.  Against heavy resistance from the engineering community,&lt;ref&gt;
"The Maxwellians"
by Bruce J. Hunt 1991
Cornell University Press
&lt;/ref&gt; Heaviside worked out the physics of signal velocity/impedance/distortion on telegraph, telephone, and undersea cables.  He invented the inductor-loaded "distortionless line" later patented by [[Michael Pupin]] in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;
"Invention"
by Dr. Norbert Wiener 1993
{{ISBN|0-262-23167-0}}
MIT Press
pp 69-76
&lt;/ref&gt;
Building on the concept of the [[Poynting vector]], which describes the flow of energy in a [[transverse electromagnetic wave]] as the vector product of its electric and magnetic fields ({{nowrap|'''E''' × '''H'''}}), Heaviside sought to extend this by treating the transfer of energy due to the electric current in a conductor in a similar manner. In doing so he reversed the contemporary view of current, so that the electric and magnetic fields due to the current are the "prime movers", rather than being a result of the motion of the charge in the conductor.&lt;ref&gt;
"Digital Hardware Design"
by Ivor Catt, David Walton, Malcolm Davidson 1979
{{ISBN|0-333-25981-5}}
p. 65
[http://www.ivorcatt.org/digihwdesignp65.htm]
[http://www.ivorcatt.com/6_4.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside's approach had some adherents at the time&amp;mdash;enough, certainly, to quarrel with the "traditionalists" in print. However, the "energy current" view presented a number of difficulties, most notably that in asserting that the energy flowed in the electric and magnetic fields around the conductor the theory is unable to explain why the charge appears to flow in the conductor.  Another major flaw is that electrical science and engineering are built on solutions of [[Maxwell's Equations]] in which the electric current - expressed through the current-density vector '''J''' – is a fundamental quantity, while a so-called 'energy current' does not appear.  Moreover, there are no equivalent equations describing the physical behaviour of the [[Poynting vector]] on which the concept of energy current is based.

After the discovery of the [[electron]] in 1897, the [[Drude model]], which describes electrical conduction in metals, was developed very quickly. By associating the somewhat abstract concept of moving charge with the rather more concrete motion of the charged electrons, the Drude model effectively deals with the traditional "charge current" and the Heaviside "energy current" views simultaneously. 
With this achievement of "unification", the energy current approach has largely lost favour, because in omitting the concepts related to conduction it has no direct model for (for example) [[Ohm's Law]]. In consequence it is less convenient to use than the "traditional" charge current approach, which defines the concepts of current, voltage, resistance, etc., as commonly used for electrical work.

Poynting-flow diagrams are part of E&amp;M engineering, transmission line theory, and antenna design, but rare in electronics texts.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Dr. Hugo Eckener''' (10 August 1868{{spaced ndash}}14 August 1954)&lt;ref name=Schwensen&gt;[[#Schwensen|Schwensen]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam289"&gt;[[#Adam|Thomas Adam]]. p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ostsee"&gt;[[#ostsee|ostsee.de]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the manager of the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]] during the inter-war years, and also the commander of the famous ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' for most of its record-setting flights, including the first [[airship]] flight around the world, making him the most successful airship commander in history. He was also responsible for the construction of the most successful type of airships of all time. An anti-Nazi who was invited to campaign as a moderate in the German presidential elections,&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPDEsser"&gt;[[#SPD19320218|Social Democratic Party of Germany 18 February 1932 p. 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam290"&gt;[[#Adam|Thomas Adam]]. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; he was blacklisted by that regime and eventually sidelined.

== Background ==
[[File:Eckener Haus (Vorderansicht).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|Birth house]]
Eckener was born in [[Flensburg]] as the first child of Johann Christoph Eckener from Bremen and Anna Lange, daughter of a shoemaker.&lt;ref name=Schwensen/&gt; As a youth he was judged an "indifferent student",&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam289"/&gt; and he spent summers sailing and winters ice skating.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1892 under Professor [[Wilhelm Wundt]], Eckener had earned a doctorate "magna cum laude"&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt; in what today might be deemed experimental psychology.&lt;ref name="Adam289"/&gt; at the [[University of Leipzig]].

Eckener then began his military service in the [[Infantry Regiments of the German Imperial Army (1871 - 1918)|Infantry Regiment 86]] in Flensburg.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;

Eckener's early career was as a journalist and editor; by August 1893 he was working for the ''{{lang|de|Flensburger Nachrichten}}'';&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt; in October 1897 he married Johanna, daughter of the publisher family Maaß.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt; He later became a correspondent for the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]]&lt;ref name="Adam289"/&gt; in 1905 and 1906, whilst writing a book on the social effects of [[capitalism]].

== Pre-war airship activities ==
Asked to cover the first flights of the [[Zeppelin]]s [[Zeppelin LZ 1|LZ 1]] and [[Zeppelin LZ 2|LZ 2]], Eckener was critical of both airships' marginal performances, but praised [[Count]] [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s dedication to his cause. Because several scientists and engineers had criticized his airship plans, the Count sought to speak to his critic and Eckener was so impressed by him that during October 1908 he agreed to be a part-time publicist for the Zeppelin Company.&lt;ref name=Schwensen/&gt; He became extremely interested in airships, and joined the company on a full-time basis.

His aptitude at flying was noticed early on in his career, and he became an airship captain, obtaining his airship license in 1911.&lt;ref name="ostsee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam290"/&gt; However, when Eckener attempted his first flight on 16 May 1911 in the [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 8|LZ 8]], christened ''Deutschland II'', he decided to launch it in a strong wind which pushed the craft into the hangar wall, damaging it seriously.&lt;ref name=Brandes&gt;[[#Brandes|Brandes 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he became a very successful airshipman.

== World War I ==
Eckener was responsible for training most of Germany's airship pilots both during&lt;ref name=Brandes/&gt; and after World War I. Despite his protestations, he was not allowed on operational missions due to his value as an instructor.

== Head of the Zeppelin Company ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00645, Probefahrt des Zeppelin-Luftschiffes Z.R. III.jpg|thumb|right|Eckener (marked with an x) test flying the LZ 126 in August before delivery to the United States in October 1924]]
After the War, Eckener succeeded Count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], who had died on 8 March 1917. After considerable conflict with Zeppelin's business manager, [[Alfred Colsman]], who wanted to replace the production of airships with production of other (and likely more profitable) products, Eckener was able to keep the Zeppelin factory at Friedrichshafen on [[Bodensee]] (Lake Constance) in [[Württemberg]], southern Germany, from being retooled. Colsman left the company soon afterwards.

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] had forbidden Germans to construct airships of the size needed&lt;ref name="Adam290"/&gt; to operate the profitable trans-Atlantic service that was Eckener's goal. However, after much skilful lobbying, he persuaded the US and German governments to allow the company to build [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ 126]], later rechristened the ''USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)'', for the [[US Navy]] as part of Germany's war reparations. Eckener himself captained the airship on its delivery flight to [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Schwensen/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam290"/&gt; The ''Los Angeles'' became the longest-serving rigid airship ever operated by the US Navy.

== The golden age of the rigid airship ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12053, Rudolf Lasarewitsch Samoilowitsch und Hugo Eckener.jpg|thumb|right|Russian polar researcher [[Rudolf Samoylovich|Rudolf Lazarevich Samoylovich]] (left) prior to leading the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'s scientific polar flight, with Eckener in Friedrichshafen, July 1931]]
Refused funds by the penniless [[Weimar Republic|Weimar government]], Eckener and his colleagues began a nationwide fund-raising lecture tour in order to commence construction of ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'', which became the most successful rigid airship ever built.

The first flight to America was fraught with drama. Near Bermuda on the outbound flight the airship was nearly lost after becoming caught in a severe storm during which [[:File:DLZ 127 Graf Zeppelin Fabric.jpg|fabric was ripped]] off the left fin. The ship was saved only by Eckener's skilled piloting and the courage of his son, [[Knut Eckener]], and other crew members who climbed out onto the fin to repair the damage.&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4 History. [http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/airships2.html The Airships]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival in America, a country which Eckener grew to love, he and the crew were subject to the first of two New York ticker tape parades.

Eckener captained ''Graf Zeppelin'' during most of its record-setting flights, including the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin#First intercontinental passenger airship flight|1928 first intercontinental passenger airship flight]], the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin#Round-the-world flight|1929 flight around the world]] (the only such flight by an airship, and the second by an aircraft of any type) and the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin#The polar flight|1931 Arctic flight]].

[[File:Interrupted Flight 1929.jpg|thumb|Cover autographed by Eckener flown on the nearly disastrous "Interrupted Flight" in May/August 1929.]]A master of publicity as well as a master airship captain, Eckener used the ''Graf Zeppelin'' to establish the Zeppelin as a symbol of German pride and engineering.

After these flights the public treated Eckener as a national hero.&lt;ref name="Adam290"/&gt; During the early 1930s, Eckener was one of the most well-known and respected figures in Weimar Republic Germany. In the [[German presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]] Eckener was a potential unity candidate against Adolf Hitler, encouraged to campaign by leaders of both the SPD and the Zentrum, but he bowed out when [[Paul von Hindenburg]] decided to run for a second term.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPDEsser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam290"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandes/&gt; However, his potential candidacy had already angered the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi party]].&lt;ref name="syon2002p176"&gt;[[#syon2002|de Syon]], p.176 "opponent of the economic policy of autarky and of the regime's Jewish policies" ... "incensed by the new flag order"&lt;/ref&gt; In supposed anger and fear of Eckener, Hitler's de facto deputy, [[Hermann Esser]], once called him the "director of the flying [[weisswurst]]",&lt;ref name="SPDEsser"/&gt; a greyish-white [[Bavaria]]n [[sausage]].

== Sidelined ==
The Nazis came to power in January 1933. A planned arrest of Eckener in 1933 was blocked by Hindenburg. Hitler met Eckener only once, in July 1933, but the two barely spoke.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt; Eckener did not make any secret of his dislike of the Nazis&lt;ref name="syon2002p176"/&gt; and the disastrous events he foresaw. He criticised the regime frequently, and refused to allow the Nazis to use the large hangars at [[Frankfurt]] for a rally. Eventually the Nazis declared Eckener to be ''[[persona non grata]]'' and his name was no longer allowed to appear in print.

During the 1930s, the Nazi government [[nationalisation|nationalized]] the Zeppelin operation under the name [[Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei|Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei GmbH]] (DZR). The Nazis sidelined Eckener in favour of men who were more compliant with their wishes. In their haste to please the Nazi regime, these newly promoted airshipmen did not always obey Eckener's  safety procedures. For example, the maiden voyage of the Hindenburg nearly resulted in disaster when Captain [[Ernst Lehmann]] brought the ship out in strong winds in order to undertake a Nazi [[propaganda]] flight. The ship was damaged, and there was an argument between Eckener, Lehmann and the Nazi propaganda ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/16/archives/eckener-command-unaffected-in-row-he-will-bring-the-hindenburg-here.html?scp=1 "Eckener command unaffected in row"], ''The New York Times''. April 16, 1936. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo Eckener had always made safety his absolute priority during his many years managing airship operations. With Eckener's management, the Zeppelin company had a perfect safety record with no passenger ever sustaining a serious injury on any of the more than 1 million air miles that the rigid airships flew, until the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] disaster of 1937. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Eckener was in [[Graz, Austria]] when he heard news of the [[Hindenburg disaster]] on 6 May 1937. In the official inquiry he concluded that a static spark ignited leaking hydrogen in the aft section of the ship. The leak would have been caused by a sharp turn, which he believed overstrained a bracing wire, causing it to snap and rip open an adjacent gas cell.

After the destruction of the ''Hindenburg'', the nearly-completed [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin|LZ-130 ''Graf Zeppelin'']] was redesigned as a helium-filled ship, although, owing to geo-political considerations, the American helium was not available.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Thus the ship never began commercial service. However, under the command of Captain Albert Sammt, who had previously survived the fiery destruction of the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], albeit with severe burns, the ship performed an espionage mission off the coast Great Britain, intended to investigate the [[Chain Home|radar defences]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sammt|Sammt 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; Eckener, however, had by this time little influence on the Zeppelin Company.

==After World War II==
Eckener survived World War II despite his disagreements with the Nazis. Post war, he was involved in a plan by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] Zeppelin Corporation to build large rigid airships. However, nothing came to pass of this project.

In 1945, Johannes Weyl and Eckener co-founded the ''{{lang|de|Südkurier}}'' regional newspaper and Eckener started writing for German-French co-operation.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;&lt;!-- at start only 4 pages per issue and once or twice weekly due to French restrictions on paper, daily by 1953 --&gt;&lt;ref name="ostsee"/&gt; In November 1945 Eckener was confronted with the charge of collaboration with [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1947 the French occupying powers fined him 100,000 [[German Reichsmark]]s. Many personalities lobbied for Eckener's [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="syon2002p207"&gt;[[#syon2002|de Syon]], p.207 "convicted of helping the war effort ... lost civil privileges in 1948 for five years  ... 100,000-mark fine"&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement was rejected in July 1948 and Eckener was rehabilitated.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;

Eckener's home town of Flensburg had a Danish-oriented majority in its council since 1945, with the goal of unification with Denmark. Eckener remained active in local politics campaigning for a German majority in Flensburg, while at the same time, during a "thundering" one-hour speech in 1951, warning against small-mindedness in border concerns.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;

Eckener died in Friedrichshafen on 14 August 1954 just after his 86th birthday.&lt;ref name="Schwensen"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Eckener was responsible for many innovative aviation developments, notably the trans-Atlantic passenger services offered by the airships ''Graf Zeppelin'' and ''Hindenburg''. 

Since his death his achievements have been remembered by airship enthusiasts and historians. Additionally, the town of [[Friedrichshafen]], scene of his many triumphant homecomings in ''Graf Zeppelin'', has recognised his memory by naming a large new conference centre after him.

==Bibliography==
Eckener wrote or contributed to 24 publications,&lt;ref&gt;[[#PND|German National Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; including two books in English:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nustede|Nina Nustede]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
: Eckener, Hugo: Count Zeppelin. The Man and his Work. London: Massie Publishing Company, Ltd. 1938.
: Eckener, Hugo: My Zeppelins. London: Putnam 1958.

==In popular culture==
Eckener features as a character in the 2012 novel ''Flight from Berlin'' by David John and in the novels ''Vango: Between Sky and Earth'' (2010) and "A Prince Without Kingdom" (2011) by Timothée de Fombelle.

The '''Indian Energy Exchange''' (IEX)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iexindia.com |title=Indian Energy Exchange |publisher=Iexindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an electronic system based power trading exchange regulated by the [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission]] (CERC). IEX started its operations on June 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-first-power-exchange-starts-operations-1174141 |title= First Power Exchange starts operations |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Energy Exchange pioneered the development of power trading in [[India]] and provides an electronic platform to the various participants in power market, comprising [[State Electricity Board (disambiguation)|State Electricity Board]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, Power producers, Power Traders and Open Access Consumers (both Industrial &amp; Commercial).

IEX is one of the two operational Power Exchanges in India. Ever since its incorporation, it has held an influential market share. IEX operates a day-ahead market based on closed auctions with double-sided bidding and uniform pricing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/ime/anoops/IEX%20Training-2016/IITK%20-%20PPTs%20-%202016/Day%20-%203%20IITK/Mr.%20Prassana%20Rao%20-%202%20-%20Trading%20at%20Power%20Exchanges.pdf |title= Trading at Power Exchange |publisher=iitk.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has over 3,800 registered clients, over 300 private generators and more than 3,300 industrial electricity consumers.

== Promoters ==

Financial Technologies (India) Limited (FTIL) made an impulsive thrust into India's Power Sector by launching Indian Energy Exchange, along with Power Trading Corporation of India Limited. The aim of the promoters was to magnify the unexplored potential of Indian Power market and abridge the demand supply gap. Thereby creating a marketplace wherein players from different purposes may garner the business potential.

== History ==

The concept of power exchange in India had its genesis in the year of 2005, post which, Financial Technologies Limited and [[Multi Commodity Exchange]] together yielded an application for setting up the nation's first power exchange. Since its development  on June 9, 2008, IEX had recorded 37.4 million transactions, the same month that electricity prices on the exchange hit a record low 13 paisa/KWh. In November 2009, IEX won Best E-Enabled Customer Platform at the second annual India Power Awards for developing what was described as "a robust platform for energy trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iexindia.com/events/index.htm |title=Indian Energy Exchange |publisher=Iexindia.com |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

== Operations ==

IEX was envisioned as a neutral platform where participants from different segments of the sector may participate and utilize the range of products and services to match their needs. The participants are required to bear a membership and participate in the bid for the respective product/service. The exchange has launched a range of products and are broadly classified as:

'''Day Ahead'''

'''Term Ahead'''

'''Renewable Energy Certificates'''

'''Energy Saving Certificates(Es Certs)'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23221">The '''isoelectric point''' ('''pI''', '''pH(I)''', '''IEP'''), is the [[pH]] at which a particular [[molecule]] carries no net [[electric charge|electrical charge]] or is electrically neutral in the [[statistical mean]]. The standard nomenclature to represent the isoelectric point is pH(I),&lt;ref&gt;Acceptable variants on pH(I) would include pH&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, pH&lt;sub&gt;IEP&lt;/sub&gt;, ''etc'';  the main point is that one cannot take the 'power' of I, rather one measures the pH subject to a nominated condition.&lt;/ref&gt; although pI is also commonly seen,&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line corrected version: http://goldbook.iupac.org (2006-) created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. {{ISBN|0-9678550-9-8}}. doi:10.1351/goldbook.
Last update: 2014-02-24; version: 2.3.3.
DOI of this term: doi:10.1351/goldbook.I03275.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in this article for brevity.  The net charge on the molecule is affected by pH of its surrounding environment and can become more positively or negatively charged due to the gain or loss, respectively, of [[protons#In Physics and biochemistry|protons]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Surfaces naturally charge to form a [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In the common case when the surface charge-determining ions are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the net surface charge is affected by the pH of the liquid in which the solid is submerged.

The pI value can affect the solubility of a molecule at a given pH. Such molecules have minimum [[solubility]] in water or salt solutions at the pH that corresponds to their '''pI''' and often [[precipitate]] out of [[solution]].  Biological amphoteric molecules such as [[protein]]s contain both acidic and basic [[functional groups]]. Amino acids that make up proteins may be positive, negative, neutral, or polar in nature, and together give a protein its overall charge. At a [[pH]] below their pI, proteins carry a net positive charge; above their pI they carry a net negative charge. Proteins can, thus, be separated by net charge in a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using either [[QPNC-PAGE|preparative gel electrophoresis]], which uses a constant pH to separate proteins or [[isoelectric focusing]], which uses a pH gradient to separate proteins. Isoelectric focusing is also the first step in [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]].

In biomolecules, proteins can be separated by [[Ion chromatography|ion exchange chromatography]]. Biological proteins are made up of [[zwitterion]]ic amino acid compounds; the net charge of these proteins can be positive or negative depending on the pH of the environment. The specific pI of the target protein can be used to model the process around and the compound can then be purified from the rest of the mixture. Buffers of various pH can be used for this purification process to change the pH of the environment. When a mixture containing a target protein is loaded into an ion exchanger, the stationary matrix can be either positively-charged (for mobile anions) or negatively-charged (for mobile cations). At low pH values, the net charge of most proteins in the mixture is positive - in cation exchangers, these positively-charged proteins bind to the negatively-charged matrix. At high pH values, the net charge of most proteins is negative, where they bind to the positively-charged matrix in anion exchangers. When the environment is at a pH value equal to the protein's pI, the net charge is zero, and the protein is not bound to any exchanger, and therefore, can be eluted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dayton|first=W. R.|date=1983|title=Protein Separation Techniques|url=http://www.meatscience.org/docs/default-source/publications-resources/rmc/1983/protein-separation-techniques.pdf?sfvrsn=2|journal=Reciprocal Meat Conference Proceedings|volume=36|pages=98–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating pI values ==
For an [[amino acid]] with only one [[amine]] and one [[carboxyl]] group, the pI can be calculated from the [[mean]] of the [[pKa]]s of this molecule.&lt;ref&gt;For derivation of this expression see [[acid dissociation constant#Isoelectric point|acid dissociation constant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{pI} = \frac{\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a1} + \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a2}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[pH]] of an electrophoretic gel is determined by the [[Buffer solution|buffer]] used for that gel.  If the [[pH]] of the buffer is above the pI of the protein being run, the [[protein]] will migrate to the positive pole (negative charge is attracted to a positive pole).  If the [[pH]] of the buffer is below the pI of the [[protein]] being run, the [[protein]] will migrate to the negative pole of the gel (positive charge is attracted to the negative pole).  If the [[protein]] is run with a buffer pH that is equal to the pI, it will not migrate at all. This is also true for individual amino acids.

=== Examples ===
{|style="float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;"
|-
|[[File:Glycine pI.png|250px]]

|[[File:AMP pI.png|250px]]
|-
|align=center|glycine pK = 2.72, 9.60
|align=center|adenosine monophosphate pK = 0.9, 3.8, 6.1
|}
In the two examples (on the right) the isoelectric point is shown by the green vertical line. In [[glycine]] the pK values are separated by nearly 7 units so the concentration of the neutral species, glycine (GlyH), is effectively 100% of the analytical glycine concentration. Glycine may exist as a [[zwitterion]] at the isoelectric point, but the equilibrium constant for the isomerization reaction in solution
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H {{eqm}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
is not known.

The other example, [[adenosine monophosphate]] is shown to illustrate the fact that a third species may, in principle, be involved. In fact the concentration of (AMP)H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is negligible at the isoelectric point in this case.
If the pI is greater than the pH, the molecule will have a positive charge.

== Isoelectric point of peptides and proteins ==

A number of algorithms for estimating isoelectric points of [[peptide]]s and [[protein]]s have been developed. Most of them use [[Henderson–Hasselbalch equation]] with different pK values. For instance, within the model proposed by Bjellqvist and co-workers the pK's were determined between closely related immobilines, by focusing the same sample in overlapping pH gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjellqvist|first=B.|last2=Hughes|first2=G.

== Ceramic materials ==
The isoelectric points (IEP) of metal oxide ceramics are used extensively in material science in various aqueous processing steps (synthesis, modification, etc.).  In the absence of chemisorbed or physisorbed species particle surfaces in aqueous suspension are generally assumed to be covered with surface hydroxyl species, M-OH (where M is a metal such as Al, Si, etc.).&lt;ref name="ref2pineapple"&gt;

''Note: The following list gives the isoelectric point at 25&amp;nbsp;°C for selected materials in water. The exact value can vary widely, depending on material factors such as purity and phase as well as physical parameters such as temperature.  Moreover, the precise measurement of isoelectric points can be difficult, thus many sources often cite differing values for isoelectric points of these materials.''

Mixed oxides may exhibit isoelectric point values that are intermediate to those of the corresponding pure oxides.  For example, a synthetically prepared amorphous [[aluminosilicate]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was initially measured as having IEP of 4.5 (the electrokinetic behavior of the surface was dominated by surface Si-OH species, thus explaining the relatively low IEP value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jara | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Mora | first3 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Studies of the surface charge of amorphous aluminosilicates using surface complexation models | url = | journal = Journal of Colloid and Interface Science | volume = 292 | issue = 1| pages = 160–170 | doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2005.05.083| bibcode = 2005JCIS..292..160J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly higher IEP values (pH 6 to 8) have been reported for 3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-2SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by others.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Similarly, also IEP of [[barium titanate]], BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was reported in the range 5-6&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; while others got a value of 3.&lt;ref name="VamvakakiBillingham2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vamvakaki|first1=Maria|last2=Billingham|first2=Norman C.|last3=Armes|first3=Steven P.|last4=Watts|first4=John F.|last5=Greaves|first5=Stephen J.|title=Controlled structure copolymers for the dispersion of high-performance ceramics in aqueous media|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|volume=11|issue=10|year=2001|pages=2437–2444|issn=09599428|doi=10.1039/b101728o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of [[Titanium dioxide|titania]] (TiO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;) and [[zirconia]] (ZrO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;) were studied and found to have an isoelectric point between 5.3-6.9, varying non-linearly with %(ZrO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref name="GlennaLDrisko2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drisko|first1=Glenna L|last2=Luca|first2=Vittorio|last3=Sizgek|first3=Erden|last4=Scales|first4=Nicolas F.|last5=Caruso|first5=Rachel A.|title=Template Synthesis and Adsorption Properties of Hierarchically Porous Zirconium Titanium Oxides|journal=Langmuir|volume=25|issue=9|year=2009|pages=5286–5293|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la804030h}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface charge of the mixed oxides was correlated with acidity. Greater titania content led to increased Lewis acidity, whereas zirconia-rich oxides displayed Br::onsted acidity. The different types of acidities produced differences in ion adsorption rates and capacities.

== Isoelectric point versus point of zero charge ==
The terms isoelectric point (IEP) and [[point of zero charge]] (PZC) are often used interchangeably, although under certain circumstances, it may be productive to make the distinction.

In systems in which H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/OH&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; are the interface potential-determining ions, the point of zero charge is given in terms of pH. The pH at which the surface exhibits a neutral net electrical charge is the point of zero charge at the surface. [[Electrokinetic phenomena]] generally measure [[zeta potential]], and a zero zeta potential is interpreted as the point of zero net charge at the [[Electrical double layer|shear plane]]. This is termed the isoelectric point.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Adamson, A.P. Gast, "Physical Chemistry of Surfaces", John Wiley and Sons, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the isoelectric point is the value of pH at which the colloidal particle remains stationary in an electrical field. The isoelectric point is expected to be somewhat different than the point of zero charge at the particle surface, but this difference is often ignored in practice for so-called pristine surfaces, i.e., surfaces with no [[adsorption|specifically adsorbed]] positive or negative charges.&lt;ref name="ref2pineapple" /&gt; In this context, specific adsorption is understood as adsorption occurring in a [[Double layer (interfacial)|Stern layer]] or [[chemisorption]]. Thus, point of zero charge at the surface is taken as equal to isoelectric point in the absence of specific adsorption on that surface.

According to Jolivet,&lt;ref name="Jolivet"&gt;Jolivet J.P., ''Metal Oxide Chemistry and Synthesis. From Solution to Solid State'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. 2000, {{ISBN|0-471-97056-5}}  (English translation of the original French text, ''De la Solution à l'Oxyde'', InterEditions et CNRS Editions, Paris, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; in the absence of positive or negative charges, the surface is best described by the point of zero charge. If positive and negative charges are both present in equal amounts, then this is the isoelectric point. Thus, the PZC refers to the absence of any type of surface charge, while the IEP refers to a state of neutral net surface charge. The difference between the two, therefore, is the quantity of charged sites at the point of net zero charge. Jolivet uses the intrinsic surface equilibrium constants, p''K''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; and p''K''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to define the two conditions in terms of the relative number of charged sites:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{p}K^- - \mathrm{p}K^+ = \Delta \mathrm{p}K = \log {\frac{\left[\mathrm{MOH}\right]^2}{\left[\mathrm{MOH}{_2^+}\right]\left[\mathrm{MO}^-\right]}} &lt;/math&gt;

For large Δp''K'' (&gt;4 according to Jolivet), the predominant species is MOH while there are relatively few charged species - so the PZC is relevant.  For small values of Δp''K'', there are many charged species in approximately equal numbers, so one speaks of the IEP.

The '''Latin Bloc''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Blocco Latino'', [[French language|French]]: ''Bloc Latin'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Bloque Latino'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Bloco Latino'') was a proposal for an alliance made the 1920s to the 1940s that began with Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] proposing such a bloc in 1927 between [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]], and [[Ditadura Nacional|Portugal]], that would be an alliance based upon common Latin civilization and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A History of Fascism, 1914–1945. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995.

During World War II the proposal was discussed between Mussolini, Spain's ''[[Caudillo]]'' [[Francisco Franco]], and [[Vichy France]]'s head of state [[Philippe Petain]].&lt;ref name="jlukacs" /&gt; However the alliance failed to materialize.&lt;ref name="jlukacs" /&gt; The planned bloc would have united Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and [[Vatican City]] together as a bloc alliance based upon unity of the Latin culture European states that would be within the [[Axis powers]] that was designed to balance the power between them and [[Germany]] in the Axis by combining together.&lt;ref name="jlukacs" /&gt; The main effort was to create a "Rome-Madrid axis", Franco took a major role in promoting the proposal, and Franco with Vichy French leader Petain in [[Montpellier]], France in 1940 to discuss the proposal, and Franco met with Mussolini in [[Bordighera]], Italy in 1941 to discuss it.&lt;ref name="jlukacs" /&gt; Germany supported the proposal for the Latin Bloc during World War II and German propaganda assisted Italian propaganda in promoting the bloc&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt.

This is a '''bibliography of [[renewable energy]]'''.

'''Renewable energy''' is [[energy]] which comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). About 16% of global final energy consumption comes from renewables, with 10% coming from traditional [[biomass]], which is mainly used for [[heating]], and 3.4% from [[hydroelectricity]]. New renewables (small hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels) account for another 3% and are growing very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox deity

}}
'''Apúng Sinukuan''', is the Kapampangan  sun god of war and death who lived in [[Mount Arayat]]. During the colonial period, the Spanish rebranded him into '''Maria Sinukuan''', the [[diwata]] (fairy) or mountain goddess associated with [[Mount Arayat]] in [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]], and later became a prominent example of the mountain-goddesses motif in Philippine mythology, other prominent examples being [[Maria Makiling]] of [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] and [[Maria Cacao]] of [[Cebu]].

==Origin of Sinukuan==
Prior to Spanish colonization, Sinukuan was known as a powerful male Kapampangan god, named Aring Sinukûan, who was in par with the Kapampangan god of Pinatubo, Apûng Malyari. The two were the second most powerful deities in Kampampangan mythology, next only to Mangechay (sometimes called Mangacha), the great elder and creator goddess. Aring Sinukûan was the sun god of war and death, taught the early inhabitants the industry of metallurgy, wood cutting, rice culture and waging war. He had three children, namely, Munag Sumalâ, the golden serpent god who represent dawn, Lakandanup, the god of gluttony who represented the sun at noon time, and Gatpanapun, the noble god who only knew pleasure and represented the afternoon. He also had a winged assistant named Galurâ, a giant eagle deity believed to be the bringer of storms, and a wife named Mingan. However, when the Spanish arrived, they 'rebranded' Sinukuan as a woman, thinking that the people would not revere the deity if he was a female, not knowing that the great elder deity of the Kapampangan was a woman named Mangechay. Additionally, Sinukuan's wife, Mingan, was rebranded as 'male'. Despite this, the natives continued to revere Sinukuan. Furious, the Spanish added 'Maria' to Sinukuan's name to somewhat turn her into Catholic in a bid to further subjugate the natives and convert them into Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arayat2012.tripod.com/maria.htm|title=The Legend of Maria Sinukuan|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/11314629/Myths_and_Legends_of_Pinatubo_and_Arayat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later legend as Maria Sinukuan==
The basic legend is similar to those of many mountain guardian goddesses, notably ''[[Maria Makiling]]''.

Sinukuan is associated with the unusual bounty of the forests in Arayat, and with the profusion of animals there.  Watching over the needs of the people in the nearby town, she used to regularly leave fruits and animals at the doorstep of locals who needed food during hard times. At one point, though, a group of young men got greedy.  They sought out where Sinukuan’s home was in the mountains, and when they found it, they asked for more than what they actually needed. Sinukuan did not object to this, and allowed them to pick a great load of fruits.  She warned them, however, not to get any fruits from the forest without her permission.  On their way back home, they decided they would get more.  Why not? They asked each other. “She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference."  But she did. As soon as they had started picking more fruit, their packs began to feel heavier.  They soon discovered that all the fruit and meat they were carrying had turned into rocks.  The young men ran away, but before they managed to escape the forest, Sinukuan appeared before them. As punishment, she said, she would turn them into swine.  And so she did.

But the other people in the village were also getting greedy.  More and more, they stole from Sinukuan’s forests.  Angered, Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She made the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. And she also never allowed the villagers to see her again.

==Appearance==
Local tradition describes Sinukuan, the Spanish-imposed female counterpart, as:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Her black hair… naturally curled, reaches down to her ankles. Her eyes are framed by long lashes which are black. Her eyebrows are arched. Her nose which is beautifully neither too high nor too flat is finely chiseled. Her lips are well formed. Her skin is a flawless brown. Her clothes are made of white flowing robe. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
'''Sinukuan''' or '''SINyang''', '''KUnnie''', and '''ANing''' is a fictional character in [[Dyosa]] series, a [[telefantasya]] being aired by [[ABS-CBN]] Network portrayed by [[Philippines|Filipino]] actress [[Mickey Ferriols]].

Mariang Sinukuan is a Fictional Character Voiced By ''[[Kylie Padilla]]'' With her Animals Kuneho "[[Pekto]]'' and Hunyango "[[John Feir]]" in  ''[[Alamat (TV series)|Alamat]]''  by GMA Network

At a land area of approximately {{convert|1144000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second-largest and the most populous of the three territories in [[Northern Canada]].&lt;ref name="census11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&amp;T=101&amp;S=50&amp;O=A|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2011 and 2006 censuses |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291.&lt;ref name=StatCan2016Q1Est/&gt; [[Yellowknife]] became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the [[Carrothers Commission]].

The Northwest Territories, a portion of the old [[North-Western Territory]], entered the [[Canadian Confederation]] on July 15, 1870, but the current borders were formed on April 1, 1999, when the territory was subdivided to create [[Nunavut]] to the east, via the ''[[Nunavut Act]]'' and the ''[[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]]''.&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.6/index.html |title=Nunavut Act |author=Justice Canada |authorlink =Department of Justice (Canada) |year=1993 |accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=claims&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/N-28.7//20070517/en?command=searchadvanced&amp;caller=AD&amp;search_type=bool&amp;shorttitle=%20Nunavut%20Land%20Claims%20Agreement%20Act&amp;day=17&amp;month=5&amp;year=2007&amp;search_domain=cs&amp;showall=L&amp;statuteyear=all&amp;lengthannual=50&amp;length=50 |title=Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act |author=Justice Canada |year=1993 |accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nunavut is mostly [[Arctic]] [[tundra]], the Northwest Territories has a slightly warmer climate and is both [[Taiga|boreal forest (taiga)]], and [[tundra]], and its most northern regions form part of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]].

The Northwest Territories is bordered by Canada's two other territories, Nunavut to the east and [[Yukon]] to the west, and by the provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]] to the south.

==Etymology==
The name is descriptive, adopted by the British government during the colonial era to indicate where it lay in relation to [[Rupert's Land]]. It is shortened from North-Western Territory (''see'' History). In [[Inuktitut]], the Northwest Territories are referred to as ᓄᓇᑦᓯᐊᖅ (''Nunatsiaq''), "beautiful land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There was some discussion of changing the name of the Northwest Territories after the splitting off of Nunavut, possibly to a term from an Aboriginal language. One proposal was "Denendeh" (an [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] word meaning "our land"), as advocated by the former premier [[Stephen Kakfwi]], among others. One of the most popular proposals for a new name – one to name the territory ''"Bob"'' – began as a prank, but for a while it was at or near the top in the [[opinion poll|public-opinion polls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/northwest-territories-looking-for-new-name-bob-need-not-apply-1.319749 |title=Northwest Territories looking for new name – "Bob" need not apply |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=January 11, 2002 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/western-arctic-to-northwest-territories-mp-calls-for-riding-name-change-1.764460 |title=Western Arctic to Northwest Territories: MP calls for riding name change |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end a poll conducted prior to division showed that strong support remained to keep the name "Northwest Territories". This name arguably became more appropriate following division than it had been when the territories extended far into Canada's north-central and northeastern areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caldercup.com/CNEWSNunavut/feature11.html |title=Tundra for two: dividing Canada's far-north is no small task |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405201955/http://caldercup.com/CNEWSNunavut/feature11.html |archivedate=April 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Willing |url=http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/112699/4Features/Features2.shtml |title=What about Bob, Water-Lou? |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030118152558/http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/112699/4Features/Features2.shtml |archivedate=January 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Located in northern Canada, the territory borders Canada's two other territories, [[Yukon]] to the west and Nunavut to the east, and three provinces: [[British Columbia]] to the southwest, and [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] to the south. It possibly meets Manitoba at a [[Four Corners (Canada)|quadripoint]] to the extreme southeast, though surveys have not been completed. It has a land area of {{convert|1183085|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="area"/&gt;

The Northwest Territories extends for more than {{convert|1300000|km2|abbr=on}} and has a large climate variant from south to north. The southern part of the territory (most of the mainland portion) has a [[subarctic climate]], while the islands and northern coast have a [[polar climate]].

Summers in the north are short and cool, with daytime highs of 14-17 Celsius (60° to 70&amp;nbsp;°F), and lows of 1-5 Celsius (45° to 55&amp;nbsp;°F). Winters are long and harsh, daytime highs in the mid {{convert|-20|C}} and lows around {{convert|-40|C}}. Extremes are common with summer highs in the south reaching {{convert|36|C}} and lows reaching into the negatives. In winter in the south, it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach {{convert|-40|C}}, but they can also reach the low teens during the day. In the north, temperatures can reach highs of {{convert|30|C}}, and lows can reach into the low negatives.
In winter in the north it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach {{convert|-50|C}} but they can also reach the single digits during the day. [[Thunderstorm]]s are not rare in the south. In the north they are very rare, but do occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Northwest Territories Proclamation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation concerning the admission of [[Rupert's Land]] and the North-Western Territories to Canada]]

The present-day territory came under government authority in July 1870, after the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] transferred [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to the British Crown, which subsequently transferred them to the [[Dominion of Canada]], giving it the name the North-west Territories. This immense region comprised all of today's Canada except that which was encompassed within the early signers of [[Canadian Confederation]], that is, British Columbia, early forms of present-day Ontario and Quebec (which encompassed the coast of the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley and the southern third of [[Quebec]]), the [[Maritimes]] (NS, PEI and NB), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[Labrador]] coast, and the [[British Arctic Territories|Arctic Islands]], except the southern half of [[Baffin Island]] (the Arctic Islands remained under direct [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] claim until 1880).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/101/119-eng.cfm |title=Canadian Heritage – Northwest Territories |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1870 transfer, some of the North-west Territories was whittled away. The province of [[Manitoba]] was created on July 15, 1870, at first a small square area around [[Winnipeg]], and then enlarged in 1881 to a larger rectangular region composing the modern province's south. By the time British Columbia joined Confederation on July 20, 1871, it had already (1866) been granted the portion of North-Western Territory south of [[60th parallel north|60 degrees north]] and west of [[120th meridian west|120 degrees west]], an area that comprised most of the [[Stickeen Territories]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}
[[File:Kane The Surveyor.jpg|thumb|left|Captain [[John Henry Lefroy]] winter 1843/44]]

In the meantime, the Province of [[Ontario]] was enlarged northwestward in 1882. Quebec was also extended northwards in 1898. The Yukon was made a separate territory that year, due to the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], to free the North-west Territories government in Regina from the burden of addressing the problems caused by the sudden boom of population and economic activity, and the influx of non-Canadians.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905. In 1906, the [[Parliament of Canada]] renamed the "North-West Territories" as the '''''Northwest Territories''''', dropping all [[hyphen]]ated forms of it.&lt;ref name="PWNHC"&gt;

Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec acquired the last addition to their modern landmass from the Northwest Territories in 1912. This left only the districts of Mackenzie, Franklin (which absorbed the remnants of Ungava in 1920), and Keewatin within what was then given the name Northwest Territories. In 1925, the boundaries of the Northwest Territories were extended all the way to the [[North Pole]] on the sector principle, vastly expanding its territory onto the northern [[ice cap]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} Between 1925 and 1999, the Northwest Territories covered a land area of {{convert|3439296|km2|abbr=on|0}} – larger than that of India.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

On April 1, 1999, the existing Northwest Territories was split into two parts, with a separate [[Nunavut]] territory being formed to represent the [[Inuit]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/visitors/creation-new-nwt|title=Creation of a new Northwest Territories|publisher=[[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest denominations by number of adherents according to the 2001 census were Roman Catholic with 16,940 (46.7%); the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] with 5,510 (14.9%); and the [[United Church of Canada]] with 2,230 (6.0%), while a total of 6,465 (17.4%) people stated no religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Religion/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;View=1a&amp;Code=61&amp;Table=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;B1=61&amp;B2=All |title=Selected Religions, for Canada, Provinces and Territories&amp;nbsp;– 20% Sample Data |publisher=2.statcan.ca |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
[[File:Multilingual sign for eye clinic in Yellowknife, NT.jpg|right|thumb|Sign for eye clinic in Yellowknife with all 11 official territorial languages|alt=A metallic white sign on a gray background with a red and blue depiction of a building at the top. Below it is text in blue saying "Eye Clinic" in English, French and the other nine official territorial languages]]
French was made an official language in 1877 by the territorial government. After a lengthy and bitter debate resulting from a [[speech from the throne]] in 1888 by [[List of lieutenant governors of the Northwest Territories|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Joseph Royal]] the members of the day voted on more than one occasion to nullify that and make English the only language used in the assembly. After some conflict with the Confederation Government in Ottawa, and a decisive vote on January 19, 1892, the assembly members voted for an English-only territory.

The Northwest Territories' Official Languages Act recognizes the following eleven [[official language]]s:&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;[http://www.nwtlanguagescommissioner.ca/nwt-official-languages/ Northwest Territories Official Languages Act, 1988] (as amended 1988, 1991–1992, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}

NWT residents have a right to use any of the above languages in a territorial court, and in the debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, the laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the [[Politics of the Northwest Territories|NWT government]] only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is a significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practical terms, English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service, except for the courts.

The 2016 census returns showed a population of 41,786. Of the 40,565 singular responses to the census question regarding each inhabitant's "mother tongue", the most reported languages were the following:

The NWT's geological resources include gold, diamonds, [[Beaufort Sea#Oil and Gas Exploration|natural gas and petroleum]]. BP is the only oil company currently producing oil in the Territory. NWT diamonds are promoted as an alternative to purchasing [[blood diamond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhpbilliton.com/bb/productEnquiries/diamondsSpecialtyProducts.jsp |title=BHP Billiton diamond marketing |publisher=Bhpbilliton.com |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the biggest mineral resource companies in the world, [[BHP Billiton]] and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] mine many of their diamonds from the NWT. In 2010, NWT accounted for 28.5% of Rio Tinto's total diamond production (3.9 million carats, 17% more than in 2009, from the [[Diavik Diamond Mine]]) and 100% of BHP's (3.05 million carats from the [[Ekati Diamond Mine|EKATI mine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/documents/110118_Fourth_quarter_2010_operations_review.pdf|title=Rio Tinto 4th quarter 2010 Operations|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124051458/http://www.riotinto.com/documents/110118_Fourth_quarter_2010_operations_review.pdf|archivedate=January 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/docs/2010Form20f.pdf|title=BHP Billiton 2010 Annual Report '''page 124'''|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
[[File:Northwest Territories Legislative Building.jpg|thumb|[[Northwest Territories Legislative Building]]]]
As a territory, the NWT has fewer rights than the provinces. During his term, Premier Kakfwi pushed to have the federal government accord more rights to the territory, including having a greater share of the returns from the territory's natural resources go to the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030703.wnwt0703/BNStory/National/ |title=NWT Premier asks provincial leaders for backing |publisher=Globeandmail.com |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015121840/http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030703.wnwt0703/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=October 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Devolution of powers to the territory was an issue in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 2003|20th general election]] in 2003, and has been ever since the territory began electing members in 1881.

The [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioner]] of the NWT is the chief executive and is appointed by the Governor-in-Council of Canada on the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development]]. The position used to be more administrative and governmental, but with the devolution of more powers to the elected assembly since 1967, the position has become symbolic. The Commissioner had full governmental powers until 1980 when the territories were given greater self-government. The Legislative Assembly then began electing a cabinet and ''Government Leader'', later known as the [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]]. Since 1985 the Commissioner no longer chairs meetings of the Executive Council (or cabinet), and the federal government has instructed commissioners to behave like a provincial [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]]. Unlike Lieutenant Governors, the [[Commissioners of the Northwest Territories|Commissioner of the Northwest Territories]] is not a formal representative of the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Unlike provincial governments and the government of Yukon, the government of the Northwest Territories does not have political parties, except for the period between 1898 and 1905. It is a [[consensus government]] called the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Legislative Assembly]]. This group is composed of one member elected from each of the nineteen constituencies. After [[List of Northwest Territories general elections|each general election]], the new Assembly elects the [[List of premiers of the Northwest Territories|Premier]] and the [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Speaker]] by secret ballot. Seven MLAs are also chosen as cabinet ministers, with the remainder forming the opposition.

The [[18th Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly|current Legislative Assembly]] is the 18th and the [[Northwest Territories general election, 2015|most recent election]] was held November 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsnwt.ca/sites/default/files/2015-12-21_official_voting_results_of_the_2015_general_election_englishweb.pdf Elections NWT official results]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Premier of the Northwest Territories|Premier]] is [[Bob McLeod (politician)|Bob McLeod]]. The member of Parliament for the [[Northwest Territories (electoral district)|Northwest Territories]] is [[Michael McLeod (politician)|Michael McLeod]] ([[Liberal Party (Canada)|Liberal Party]]). The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories is [[George Tuccaro]] and the [[List of Northwest Territories deputy commissioners|Deputy Commissioner]] is [[Margaret Thom]].

In the [[Parliament of Canada]], the NWT comprises a single [[Canadian Senate divisions|Senate division]] and a single [[Electoral district (Canada)|House of Commons electoral district]], titled [[Northwest Territories (electoral district)|Northwest Territories]] (''Western Arctic'' until 2014).

===Departments===
The Government of Northwest Territories comprises the following departments:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.nt.ca/research/departments/index.html Government of the NWT], retrieved March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Education, Culture and Employment
* Environment and Natural Resources
* Executive and Indigenous Affairs
* Finance
* Health and Social Services
* Industry, Tourism and Investment
* Infrastructure
* Justice
* Lands
* Legislative Assembly
* Municipal and Community Affairs

===Administrative Regions===
The Northwest Territories is divided into five administrative regions (with regional seat):
* [[Dehcho Region]] ([[Fort Simpson]])
* [[Inuvik Region]] ([[Inuvik]])
* [[North Slave Region]] ([[Behchoko]] and [[Yellowknife]])
* [[Sahtu Region]] ([[Norman Wells]]) 
* [[South Slave Region]] ([[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] and [[Hay River, Northwest Territories|Hay River]])

==Transportation==

===Road===
[[File:Dempster 2769.jpg|thumb|Dempster Highway, south of [[Inuvik]], Northwest Territories]]
{{see also|List of Northwest Territories highways}}

Northwest Territories has eight numbered highways. The longest is the [[Mackenzie Highway]] which stretches from the [[Alberta Highway 35]]'s northern terminus in the south at the Alberta – Northwest Territories border at the 60th parallel to [[Wrigley, Northwest Territories]] in the north. [[Ice road]]s and [[winter road]]s are also prominent and provide road access in winter to towns and mines which would otherwise be [[Remote and isolated community|fly-in locations]]. [[Yellowknife Highway]] branches out from Mackenzie Highway and connects it to Yellowknife. [[Dempster Highway]] is the continuation of [[Klondike Highway]]. It starts just west of [[Dawson City, Yukon]] and continues east for over {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} to Inuvik.

Yellowknife did not have an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the completion of [[Deh Cho Bridge]] in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the [[Mackenzie River]]. This became a problem during spring and fall time when the ice was not thick enough to handle vehicle load but the ferry could not pass through the ice, which would require all goods from fuel to groceries to be airlifted during the transition period.

===Public transit===
[[Yellowknife Transit]] is the [[public transportation]] agency in the city, and is the only transit system within the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/City+Clerks/Forms+And+Publications/TransitRouteAnalysisStudyFinalReportOctober2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=Transit Route Analysis Study Final Report |publisher=City of Yellowknife |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706213754/http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/City%2BClerks/Forms%2BAnd%2BPublications/TransitRouteAnalysisStudyFinalReportOctober2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
{{see also|List of airports in the Northwest Territories}}

[[File:Yellowknife Airport terminal.jpg|thumb|Yellowknife Airport]]
[[Yellowknife Airport]] is the largest airport in the territory in terms of aircraft movements and passengers. It is the gateway airport to other destinations within the Northwest Territories. As the airport of the territory capital, it is part of the [[National Airports System]]. It is the hub of multiple regional airlines. Major airlines serving destinations within Northwest Territories include [[Buffalo Airways]], [[Canadian North]], [[First Air]], [[North-Wright Airways]].

==Culture==
Aboriginal issues in the Northwest Territories include the fate of the [[Dene]] who, in the 1940s, were employed to carry radioactive uranium ore from the mines on Great Bear Lake. Of the thirty plus miners who worked at the [[Port Radium, Northwest Territories|Port Radium]] site, at least fourteen have died due to various forms of cancer. A study was done in the community of [[Deline]], called ''A Village of Widows'' by [[Cindy Kenny-Gilday]], which indicated that the number of people involved were too small to be able to confirm or deny a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/SEEJ/Mining/gilday.html |title=A Village of Widows |publisher=Arcticcircle.uconn.edu |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/deline_deaths.html |title=Echoes of the Atomic Age |publisher=Ccnr.org |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been racial tension based on a history of [[Bloody Falls Massacre|violent conflict between the Dene and the Inuit]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000229125642/http://www.canadianarchaeology.com/cmcc/pinuva.htm Relations with their Southern Neighbours] &lt;/ref&gt; who have now taken recent steps towards reconciliation.

Land claims in the NWT began with the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed on June 5, 1984. It was the first Land Claim signed in the Territory, and the second in Canada.&lt;ref name="Inuvialuit Regional Corporation Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRC: Inuvialuit Final Agreement|url=http://www.irc.inuvialuit.com/about/finalagreement.html|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It culminated with the creation of the Inuit homeland of Nunavut, the result of the [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]], the largest land claim in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="NLCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nucj.ca/library/bar_ads_mat/Nunavut_Land_Claims_Agreement.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agreement between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada|accessdate=January 10, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324220716/http://www.nucj.ca/library/bar_ads_mat/Nunavut_Land_Claims_Agreement.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another land claims agreement with the [[Tłı̨chǫ people]] created a region within the NWT called [[Tlicho Government|Tli Cho]], between Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes, which gives the Tłı̨chǫ their own legislative bodies, taxes, resource royalties, and other affairs, though the NWT still maintains control over such areas as health and education. This area includes two of Canada's three diamond mines at Ekati and Diavik.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.nt.ca/MAA/newsreleases/tlicho_land_claim.htm Government of the NWT news release on land claims signing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212163741/http://www.gov.nt.ca/MAA/newsreleases/tlicho_land_claim.htm |date=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{See also|Category:Festivals in the Northwest Territories}}
Among the festivals in the region are the [[Great Northern Arts Festival]], the [[Snowking Winter Festival]], [[Folk on the Rocks]] music festival in [[Yellowknife]], and [[Rockin the Rocks]].

==Tourism==
During the winter, many international visitors go to Yellowknife to watch the [[aurora]]s.

[[Aulavik National Park]] is in the northern part of Northwest Territories.

The '''Norwegian Institute for Air Research''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Institutt for luftforskning}}) or '''NILU''' is one of the leading specialized scientific laboratories in [[Europe]] researching issues related to [[air pollution]], [[climate change]] and health. NILU has a staff of scientists, engineers and technicians with specialized expertise for working on air pollution problems. The staff do more than two hundred projects annually for research councils, industries, international banks and local, national and international authorities and organizations. Its director since 2009 is [[Kari Nygaard]].

== Fields of work ==
NILU was founded in 1969 and the institute conducts environmental research with emphasis on the sources of [[air pollution]] and on [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilu.no/OmNILU/tabid/67/language/en-GB/Default.aspx About NILU], www.nilu.no&lt;/ref&gt; transport, transformation and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]]. It is also involved in the assessment of the effects of [[pollution]] on [[ecosystem]]s, [[human health]] and materials. Integrated environmental assessments and optimal abatement strategy planning has been a field of priority during the last few years. [[Evaluation|Assessment]] of transboundary transport of [[air pollutant]]s, [[acid rain]] and global [[air quality]] are important tasks.

NILU has the responsibility as a national research institution for air pollution in [[Norway]] and is also being used as an international air pollution expert by the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

NILU has developed an automatic [[surveillance]] program for [[air quality]] in cities and background areas. NILU have specialized in computerized automatic air pollution [[surveillance]], planning and optimal abatement strategy planning. This AirQUIS system is an air pollution management and planning system designed for managers and decision-makers.

== Companies and Locations ==
NILU's head office is at [[Kjeller]] on the outskirt of [[Oslo]] in Norway.

The '''oasis effect''' refers to the creation of a local [[microclimate]] that is cooler than the surrounding [[Arid|dry area]] due to [[evaporation]] or [[evapotranspiration]] of a [[water]] source or plant life and higher [[albedo]] of plant life than bare ground.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hao|first=Xingming|last2=Li|first2=Weihong|last3=Deng|first3=Haijun|date=2016|title=The oasis effect and summer temperature rise in arid regions - case study in Tarim Basin|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep35418|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35418|doi=10.1038/srep35418|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5064418|pmid=27739500|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oasis effect is so-named because it occurs in [[desert]] [[oasis|oases]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potchter|first=O.|last2=Goldman|first2=D.|last3=Iluz|first3=D.|last4=Kadish|first4=D.|date=2012|title=The climatic effect of a manmade oasis during winter season in a hyper arid zone: The case of Southern Israel|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140196312001991|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|volume=87|pages=231–242|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.07.005|issn=0140-1963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Causes ==
An oasis contains [[moisture]] from a water source and/or plants. When that water [[evaporation|evaporates]] or [[Transpiration|transpirates]], [[heat]] from the surroundings is used to convert [[liquid]] to [[gas]] in an [[Endothermic process|endothermic reaction]], which results in cooler local temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saaroni|first=Hadas|last2=Bitan|first2=Arieh|last3=Dor|first3=Eyal Ben|last4=Feller|first4=Noa|date=2004|title=The mixed results concerning the 'oasis effect' in a rural settlement in the Negev Desert, Israel|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140196303001435|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|volume=58|issue=2|pages=235–248|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2003.08.010|issn=0140-1963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[vegetation]] has a higher [[albedo]] than bare ground, and reflects more [[sunlight]], leading to lower land [[Temperature|temperatures]], lower [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] temperatures, and a cooler local [[microclimate|microclimate.]] 

== Seasonal Effects ==
The oasis effect occurs most prominently during the summertime because warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the winter, the oasis effect operates differently. Instead of making the oasis cooler, the oasis effect makes it warmer at night. This occurs through the fact that trees block heat from leaving the land. Basically, [[radiation]] cannot be emitted back into the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] because the trees intercept and absorb it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Urban Planning ==
[[File:Central park.jpg|thumb|Parks like Central Park in New York City help create an oasis effect in urban areas.]]The oasis effect plays a role in [[Urban planning|urban development]] because plants and bodies of water result in cooler [[City|cities]]. Accordingly, cities with [[Park|parks]] will have lower temperatures because plants have higher [[albedo]] than bare ground or [[Road|roads]]. Areas with higher albedo [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] more light than they [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]], leading to cooler temperatures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Georgescu|first=M.|last2=Moustaoui|first2=M.|last3=Mahalov|first3=A.|last4=Dudhia|first4=J.|date=2011|title=An alternative explanation of the semiarid urban area "oasis effect"|url=|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=116|issue=D24|pages=n/a|doi=10.1029/2011jd016720|issn=0148-0227|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, cities are hotter than their suburbs due to dense population, dark buildings and roads, and pollution; this is known as the [[urban heat island]] effect.

:''This article describes techniques; for a history of the movement of tectonic plates, see [[Geological history of Earth]].''
'''Plate reconstruction''' is the process of reconstructing the positions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] relative to each other (relative motion) or to other reference frames, such as the [[earth]]'s [[magnetic field]] or groups of [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], in the geological past. This helps determine the shape and make-up of ancient [[supercontinent]]s and provides a basis for [[Paleogeography|paleogeographic]] reconstructions.

==Defining plate boundaries==
[[File:Quake epicenters 1963-98 notitle.png|thumb|300px|Earthquake epicenters 1963–98]]
An important part of reconstructing past plate configurations is to define the edges of areas of the [[lithosphere]] that have acted independently at some time in the past.

===Present plate boundaries===
Most present plate boundaries are easily identifiable from the pattern of recent [[Earthquake|seismicity]].&lt;ref name="Condie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condie|first=K.C.|title=Plate tectonics and crustal evolution|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|date=1997|edition=4th|pages=282|isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfhGuFwi0DgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=identification+%22plate+boundaries%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now backed up by the use of [[GPS]] data, to confirm the presence of significant relative movement between plates.

===Past plate boundaries===
Identifying past (but now inactive) plate boundaries within current plates is generally based on evidence for an ocean that has now closed up. The line where the ocean used to be is normally marked by pieces of the crust from that ocean, included in the collision zone, known as [[ophiolites]].&lt;ref name="Luis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lliboutry|first=L.|title=Quantitative geophysics and geology|publisher=Springer|date=2000|pages=480|isbn=978-1-85233-115-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7rny3qA6RMC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=old+oceans+suture+ophiolites&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line across which two plates became joined to form a single larger plate, is known as a [[Suture (geology)|suture]].

In many [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]], the collision is not just between two plates, but involves the sequential [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of smaller [[terrane]]s. Terranes are smaller pieces of continental crust that have been caught up in an orogeny, such as [[continental fragment]]s or [[island arc]]s.

==Reference frames==
Plate motions, both those observable now and in the past, are referred ideally to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] that allows other plate motions to be calculated. For example, a central plate, such as the African plate, may have the motions of adjacent plates referred to it. By composition of reconstructions, additional plates can be reconstructed to the central plate. In turn, the reference plate may be reconstructed, together with the other plates, to another reference frame, such as the earth's magnetic field, as determined from paleomagnetic measurements of rocks of known age. A global hotspot reference frame has been postulated (see, e.g., [[W. Jason Morgan]]) but there is now evidence that not all hotspots are necessarily fixed in their locations relative to one another or the earth's spin axis.&lt;ref name="Kearey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearey|first=P.|author2=Klepeis K.A.|author3=Vine F.J.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Global tectonics|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|date=2009|edition=3rd|pages=482|isbn=978-1-4051-0777-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYqZntfg25UC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=indo+atlantic+hotspot+%22reference+frame%22&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=indo%20atlantic%20hotspot%20%22reference%20frame%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are groups of such hotspots that appear to be fixed within the constraints of available data, within particular [[mesoplates]].&lt;ref name="Rex"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilger|first=R.H.|title=Geokinematics: prelude to geodynamics|publisher=Springer|date=2003|pages=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfX-o96Ou1wC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=hotspot+%22reference+frame%22&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=hotspot%20%22reference%20frame%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-02-21|isbn=9783540005483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euler poles==
The movement of a rigid body, such as a plate, on the surface of a sphere can be described as rotation about a fixed axis (relative to the chosen reference frame). This pole of rotation is known as an [[Euler's rotation theorem|Euler pole]]. The movement of a plate is completely specified in terms of its Euler pole and the angular rate of rotation about the pole. Euler poles defined for current plate motions can be used to reconstruct plates in the recent past (few million years). At earlier stages of earth's history, new Euler poles need to be defined.&lt;ref name="Kearey"/&gt;

==Estimating past plate motions==
[[File:Earth seafloor crust age 1996.png|thumb|300px|Ages of oceanic lithosphere]]
In order to move plates backward in time it is necessary to provide information on either relative or absolute positions of the plates being reconstructed such that an Euler pole can be calculated. These are quantitative methods of reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Trond2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geodynamics.no/GMAP/Methods/Introduction_to_Methods.htm|title=Reconstruction Methods|last=Torsvik|first=T.H.|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric matching of continental borders===
Certain fits between continents, particularly that between South America and Africa, were known long before the development of a theory that could adequately explain them. The reconstruction before Atlantic rifting by Bullard based on a least-squares fitting at the 500 [[fathom]] contour still provides the best match to paleomagnetic pole data for the two sides from the middle of [[Paleozoic]] to [[Late Triassic]].&lt;ref name="Trond2"/&gt;

===Plate motion from magnetic stripes===
Plate reconstructions in the recent geological past mainly use the pattern of [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic stripes]] in [[oceanic crust]] to remove the effects of [[seafloor spreading]]. The individual stripes are dated from [[magnetostratigraphy]] so that their time of formation is known. Each stripe (and its mirror image) represents a plate boundary at a particular time in the past, allowing the two plates to be repositioned relative to one another. The oldest oceanic crust is [[Jurassic]], providing a lower age limit of about 175 Ma for the use of such data. Reconstructions derived in this way are only relative.&lt;ref name="Trond2"/&gt;

=== Plate reconstructions from paleomagnetism ===

==== Paleomagnetic data: Sampling ====
[[Paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetic data]] are obtained by taking oriented samples of rocks and measuring their remanent magnetizations in the laboratory. Good quality data can be recovered from different [[List of rock types|rock types]]. In [[Igneous rock|igneous rocks]], magnetic minerals crystallize from the melt, and when the rock is cooled below their [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], it acquires a thermoremanent magnetization ([[Thermoremanent magnetization|TRM]]) in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field. In [[sedimentary rocks]], magnetic grains will align their magnetic moments with the direction of the magnetic field during or soon after the deposition, resulting in a detrital or post-detrital remanent magnetization ([[Paleomagnetism#Detrital%20remanent%20magnetization|DRM]]). A common difficulty with the use of clastic sediments for defining directions of the magnetic field in the past is that the direction of DRM may rotate toward the bedding plane due to the compaction of sediment, resulting in an inclination, which is shallower than the inclination of the field during the deposition. The inclination flattening error can nevertheless be estimated and corrected for through re-deposition experiments, measurements of magnetic anisotropy, and the use of theoretical models for the dispersion of paleomagnetic directions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauxe|first=L.|date=2005|title=Inclination flattening and the geocentric axial dipole hypothesis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05000762|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=233|issue=3–4|pages=247–261|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.01.027|issn=0012-821X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Metamorphic rocks]] are not normally used for paleomagnetic measurements due to the complexities related to the acquisition of remanence, uncertainties in magnetization age, and high magnetic anisotropy. 

A typical paleomagnetic study would sample a large number of independent rock units of similar age at nearby locations and collect multiple samples from each unit in order to estimate measurement errors and assess how well the obtained paleomagnetic dataset samples [[geomagnetic secular variation]]. Progressive demagnetization techniques are used to identify secondary magnetization components (e.g., magnetic overprints that could have been imparted on the rock due to chemical alteration or reheating) and to isolate the primary magnetization, which records the direction of the magnetic field at the time when the rock was formed. Various [[Rock magnetism|rock-magnetic]] and paleomagnetic tests are normally performed to establish the primary nature of the isolated remanent magnetization. The recovered paleomagnetic directions are used to derive paleomagnetic poles, which provide constrains on the latitudinal position of the crustal block from which the rock samples were taken, and its original orientation with respect to the lines of longitude.

Good quality paleomagnetic data are available from the ''Global Paleomagnetic Database'', which is accessible from the World Data Center A in the USA at [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="NGDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/paleo.shtml|title=IAGA Paleomagnetic Databases |last=National Geophysics Data Center|date=2010|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paleomagnetic poles ====
A paleomagnetic pole is defined by taking the average direction of the primary remanent magnetization for the sampled rocks (expressed as the mean [[Magnetic declination|declination]] and [[Magnetic dip|inclination]]) and calculating the position of a [[geomagnetic pole]] for the field of a geocentric [[magnetic dipole]] that would produce the observed mean direction at the sampled locality in its present geographic coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paleomagnetism: Magnetic Domains to Geologic Terranes, Chaper 7: Paleomagnetic Poles|last=Butler|first=R.F.|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|year=1992|isbn=|location=https://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/chap07.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative way of defining paleomagnetic poles is to calculate a virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) for each individual rock unit and then estimate the mean location for all VGPs.

Both approaches are used in paleomagnetic studies, but it has been recognized that averaging directions instead of full remanence vectors can lead to biased estimates of the mean direction of the paleomagnetic field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creer|first=K.

Paleomagnetic studies of geologically recent lavas (Pliocene to Quaternary, 0-5 Ma) indicate that when the geomagnetic field is averaged on time scales of tens of thousands to millions of years – over a time period long enough to fully sample [[geomagnetic secular variation]], the time-averaged field can be accurately approximated by the field of a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) – that is, a [[magnetic dipole]] placed in the center of the Earth and aligned with the Earth’s rotation axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opdyke|first=N.

The difference between the paleomagnetic pole and the present geographic pole reflects the paleogeographic position of the crustal block containing the sampled area at the time when the studied rocks were formed, including its original latitude (paleolatitude) and orientation. Under the assumption that the mean paleomagnetic direction corresponds to that of the GAD field, the paleolatitude of the sampling location (λ) can be derived from the inclination (I) of the mean direction using a simple equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paleomagnetism: Magnetic Domains to Geologic Terranes, Chapter 1: Introduction to Geomagnetism|last=Butler|first=R.F.|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|year=1992|isbn=|location=https://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/chap01.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 

&lt;math&gt;\tan(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \tan(I)&lt;/math&gt;

The mean declination (D) gives the sense and amount of rotation about a vertical axis passing through the sampling area, which needs to be applied to restore its original orientation with respect to the lines of longitude. The paleolatitude for any specific location belonging to the same crustal block can be computed as 90° minus the angular distance between this location and the paleomagnetic pole, and the local vertical axis rotation can be estimated by computing the declination expected from the position of the pole&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/book/chap10.pdf|title=Chapter 10 Applications to paleogeography|last=Butler|first=R.F.|date=1992|work=Paleomagnetism:Magnetic domains to geologic terranes|publisher=Blackwell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817084001/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/book/chap10.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, a paleomagnetic pole defines the paleo-latitudinal position and orientation of the entire tectonic block at a specific time in the past. However, because the GAD field is azimuthally symmetric about the Earth’s rotation axis, the pole doesn’t set any constraint on the absolute longitude. From the perspective of paleomagnetic directions, the GAD field has the same values of inclination and declination along a line of constant latitude at all longitudes, so that any conceivable longitude would be an equally viable option for the reconstruction of a tectonic element if its paleogeographic position is constrained by paleomagnetic data alone.

Considering that a paleomagnetic pole approximates the position of the geographic pole with respect to the continent or geologic terrane from which it was determined, the paleolatitude and orientation can be restored by finding a rotation ([[Euler Pole|Euler pole and rotation angle]]) that reconstructs the paleomagnetic pole to the geographic pole, and applying this rotation to the continent or terrane. By doing so, the crustal block and its paleomagnetic pole are reconstructed using the same Euler rotation, so that they do not move relative to each other, the paleomagnetic pole is placed at the geographic pole, and the crustal block is correctly restored in latitude and orientation (i.e., with respect to the geographic pole). Noting that a further rotation around the geographic pole will only change the longitude of the block, but its latitude and orientation with respect to the lines of longitude will not be affected, the absolute paleolongitude cannot be determined in reconstructions based on paleomagnetism. However, relative longitudes of different crustal blocks can be defined using other types of geological and geophysical data constraining relative motions of tectonic plates, including the histories of seafloor spreading recorded my marine magnetic anomalies, matching of continental borders and geologic terranes, and paleontological data.&lt;ref name="Trond2" /&gt;

====Apparent polar wander paths====
{{Main|Apparent polar wander}}
Poles from different ages in a single continent, lithospheric plate, or any other tectonic block can be used to construct an [[apparent polar wander]] path (APWP). If paths from adjacent crustal fragments are identical, this is taken to indicate that there has been no relative movement between them during the period covered by the path. Divergence of APW paths indicates that the areas in question have acted independently in the past with the point of divergence marking the time at which they became joined.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Combined or synthetic APWPs can be constructed by rotating paleomagnetic poles from different plates into the reference frame fixed to a single plate, using estimates of relative plate motions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For the times postdating the assembly of [[Pangaea|Pangea]] (320 Ma), synthetic APWPs are often constructed in the reference frame fixed to the African plate&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; because Africa has occupied a central position in the Pangea configuration and has been dominantly surrounded by spreading ridges after the Pangea breakup, which commenced in the early Jurassic (ca. 180 Ma). 

==== Longitude constraints ====
For a single lithospheric plate, the APWP reflects the motion of the plate with respect to the geographic pole (changes in latitude) and changes of its orientation with respect to paleomeridians. The longitudes of paleogeographic reconstructions based on APWPs are uncertain, but it has been argued that the uncertainty can be minimized by selecting a reference plate that is expected to move the least in longitude from the consideration of the plate tectonics theory and by linking the reconstructions of the remaining plates to this reference plate using the estimates of relative plate motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torsvik|first=T.H. et al.|date=2008|title=Longitude: Linking Earth's ancient surface to its deep interior|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08006328|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=276|issue=3–4|pages=273–282|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.09.026|issn=0012-821X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, and it was shown that assuming no significant longitudinal motion of Africa since the time of the Pangea assembly results in a reasonable plate tectonic scenario, in which no large, coherent east-west motions of the continental lithosphere are observed in paleogeographic reconstructions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberger|first=Bernhard|last2=Torsvik|first2=Trond H.|date=2008|title=Absolute plate motions and true polar wander in the absence of hotspot tracks|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06824|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=452|issue=7187|pages=620–623|doi=10.1038/nature06824|pmid=18385737|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

APWPs can be interpreted as records of a combined signal from two sources of plate motion: (1) motion of lithospheric plates with respect to the Earth’s mantle and (2) motion of the entire solid Earth (mantle and lithosphere) with respect to the Earth’s rotation axis. The second component is commonly referred to as [[true polar wander]] (TPW) and on geologic time scales results from gradual redistribution of mass heterogeneities due to convective motions in the Earth’s mantle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=Peter|last2=Toomre|first2=Alar|date=1969-05-15|title=Some remarks on polar wandering|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|language=en|volume=74|issue=10|pages=2555–2567|doi=10.1029/jb074i010p02555|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparing plate reconstructions based on paleomagnetism with reconstructions in the mantle reference frame defined by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] for the last 120 Ma, the TPW motions can be estimated, which allows tying paleogeographic reconstructions to the mantle and hence constraining them in paleolongitude&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doubrovine|first=Pavel V.|last2=Steinberger|first2=Bernhard|last3=Torsvik|first3=Trond H.|date=2012|title=Absolute plate motions in a reference frame defined by moving hot spots in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|language=en|volume=117|issue=B9|pages=|doi=10.1029/2011jb009072|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

====Apparent polar wander paths geometric parameterizations====
Paleomagnetic Euler poles derived by geometrizing apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) potentially allows constraining paleolongitudes from paleomagnetic data. This method could extend absolute plate motion reconstructions deeply into the geologic history as long as there are reliable APWPs.&lt;ref name="WuKravchinsky14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=L.|author2=Kravchinsky V.A.|title=Derivation of paleo-longitude from the geometric parametrization of apparent polar wander path: implication for absolute plate motion reconstruction|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=41|issue=13|pages=4503–4511|bibcode=2014GeoRL..41.4503W|doi=10.1002/2014GL060080|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hotspot tracks===
[[File:Hawaii hotspot.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]]
The presence of chains of volcanic islands and seamounts interpreted to have formed from fixed [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] allows the plate on which they sit to be progressively restored so that a seamount is moved back over the hotspot at its time of formation. This method can be used back to the [[Early Cretaceous]], the age of the oldest evidence for hotspot activity. This method gives an absolute reconstruction of both latitude and longitude, although before about 90&amp;nbsp;Ma there is evidence of relative motion between hotspot groups.&lt;ref name="Trond"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.geodynamics.no/indexOld.htm |title=Fra kontinentaldrift til manteldynamikk |trans-title=From Continental Drift to Mantle Dynamics |last=Torsvik |first=Trond Helge |last2=Steinberger |first2=Bernhard |date=December 2006 |journal=Geo |language=Norwegian |pages=20–30 |volume=8 |accessdate=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723122146/http://www.geodynamics.no/indexOld.htm |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}, translation: {{Cite book |last=Torsvik |first=Trond Helge |last2=Steinberger |first2=Bernhard |title=Geology for Society for 150 years - The Legacy after Kjerulf |chapter= From Continental Drift to Mantle Dynamics |chapterurl=http://www.geodynamics.no/guest/Torsvik_SteinbergerGraasteinen12.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2010 |pages=24–38 |editor=Trond Slagstad |editor2=Rolv Dahl Gråsteinen |publisher=Norges Geologiske Undersokelse |place=Trondheim |postscript=&amp;nbsp;[Norwegian Geological Survey, Popular Science].|volume=12 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slab constraints===
Once oceanic plates subduct in the lower mantle (slabs), they are assumed to sink in a near-vertical manner. With the help of seismic wave tomography, this can be used to constrain plate reconstructions at first order back to the Permian.&lt;ref name="van der Meer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Meer |first=D.G. |author2=Spakman W. |author3=van Hinsbergen D.J.J. |author4=Amaru M.L. |author5=Torsvik T.H. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2010 |title=Towards absolute plate motions constrained by lower-mantle slab remnants |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=36–40 |doi=10.1038/NGEO708 |url=http://www.geologist.nl/images/vanderMeer_2010.pdf |accessdate=22 November 2011 |bibcode=2010NatGe...3...36V |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426000755/http://www.geologist.nl/images/vanderMeer_2010.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.668.427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other evidence for past plate configurations==
[[File:Kuunga2.png|thumb|240px|Reconstruction of eastern [[Gondwana]] showing position of orogenic belts]]
Some plate reconstructions are supported by other geological evidence, such as the distribution of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[rock type]]s, the position of [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] and [[terrestrial ecozone|faunal provinces]] shown by particular fossils. These are semi-quantitative methods of reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Trond2"/&gt;

===Sedimentary rock types===
Some types of sedimentary rock are restricted to certain latitudinal belts. [[Glacial deposits]] for instance are generally confined to high latitudes, whereas [[evaporite]]s are generally formed in the tropics.&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm|title=Climate History|last=Scotese|first=C.R.|date=2002-04-20|work=Paleomap Project|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faunal provinces===
Oceans between continents provide barriers to plant and animal migration. Areas that have become separated tend to develop their own fauna and flora. This is particularly the case for plants and land animals but is also true for shallow water marine species, such as [[trilobite]]s and [[brachiopod]]s, although their [[plankton]]ic [[larva]]e mean that they were able to migrate over smaller deep water areas. As oceans narrow before a collision occurs, the faunas start to become mixed again, providing supporting evidence for the closure and its timing.&lt;ref name="Trond2"/&gt;

===Orogenic belts===
When supercontinents break up, older linear geological structures such as orogenic belts may be split between the resulting fragments. When a reconstruction effectively joins up orogenic belts of the same age of formation, this provides further support for the reconstruction's validity.&lt;ref name="Trond2"/&gt;

This state is thought to consist of [[asymptotically free]] [[Strong force|strong-interacting]] [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s, which are ordinarily confined by [[color confinement]] inside atomic nuclei or other [[hadron]]s. This is in analogy with the conventional [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] where nuclei and electrons, confined inside [[atom]]s by [[electrostatic forces]] at ambient conditions, can move freely. Artificial quark matter, which has been produced at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven National Laboratory’s]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]], can only be produced in minute quantities and is unstable and impossible to contain, and will radioactively decay within a fraction of a second into stable particles through [[hadronization]]; the produced [[hadron]]s or their decay products and [[gamma ray]]s can then be detected. In the [[quark matter]] phase diagram, QGP is placed in the high-temperature, high-density regime, whereas ordinary matter is a cold and rarefied mixture of nuclei and vacuum, and the hypothetical [[quark star]]s would consist of relatively cold, but dense quark matter. It is believed that up to a few milliseconds after the Big Bang, known as the [[quark epoch]], the Universe was in a quark–gluon plasma state.

The strength of the [[color force]] means that unlike the gas-like [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], quark–gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal [[Fermi liquid]], although research on flow characteristics is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2005/apr/19/quark-gluon-plasma-goes-liquid |title=Quark-gluon plasma goes liquid |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=110303|title=BNL Newsroom {{!}} RHIC Scientists Serve Up 'Perfect' Liquid|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LHC's [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eleanor Imster |url=http://earthsky.org/human-world/lhc-creates-liquid-from-big-bang |title=LHC creates liquid from Big Bang &amp;#124; Human World |publisher=EarthSky |date= |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; QGP differs from a "free" collision event by several features; for example, its particle content is indicative of a temporary [[chemical equilibrium]] producing an excess of middle-energy [[strange quark]]s vs. a nonequilibrium distribution mixing light and heavy quarks ("strangeness production"), and it does not allow [[Jet (particle physics)|particle jets]] to pass through ("jet quenching").

Experiments at [[CERN]]'s [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) first tried to create the QGP in the 1980s and 1990s: the results led CERN to announce indirect evidence for a "new state of matter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newstate-matter.web.cern.ch/newstate-matter/Experiments.html |title=A New State of Matter – Experiments |publisher=Newstate-matter.web.cern.ch |date=2000-02-04 |accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000.

== General introduction ==

Quark–gluon plasma is a [[state of matter]] in which the elementary particles that make up the hadrons of [[baryon]]ic matter are freed of their [[Strong interaction|strong]] attraction for one another under extremely high [[Energy density|energy densities]]. These particles are the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s that compose baryonic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infocenter ILGTI: Indian Lattice Gauge Theory Initiative |url=http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/ilgti/infocenter/ |accessdate=May 20, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212185849/http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/ilgti/infocenter/ |archivedate=February 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal matter quarks are ''[[Color confinement|confined]]''; in the QGP quarks are ''[[Deconfinement|deconfined]]''. In classical QCD quarks are the [[fermion]]ic components of [[hadron]]s ([[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s) while the [[gluon]]s are considered the [[boson]]ic components of such particles.  The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.

Although the experimental high temperatures and densities predicted as producing a quark–gluon plasma have been realized in the laboratory, the resulting matter does ''not'' behave as a quasi-ideal state of free quarks and gluons, but, rather, as an almost perfect dense fluid.&lt;ref name=Zajc&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The fluid nature of quark-gluon plasma |author= WA Zajc |journal=Nuclear Physics A |year=2008 |volume=805 |issue= 1–4 |pages=283c–294c |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2008.02.285 |arxiv=0802.3552 |postscript=.|bibcode = 2008NuPhA.805..283Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, the fact that the quark–gluon plasma will not yet be "free" at temperatures realized at present accelerators was predicted in 1984 as a consequence of the remnant effects of confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=How free is the quark-gluon plasma |first=M. |last=Plümer |first2=S. |last2=Raha |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=R.

=== Relation to normal plasma ===

A [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  &lt;math&gt;Q \rightarrow Q e^{-r/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length α. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.

Because of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).

=== Theory ===

One consequence of this difference is that the [[color charge]] is too large for [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] computations which are the mainstay of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].&lt;ref name="Karsch"&gt;https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-lat/pdf/9503/9503010v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862–863 |issue=12 |pages=4-12 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.

=== Production ===

The QGP can be created by heating matter up to a [[temperature]] of {{val|2|e=12|ul=K}}, which amounts to {{val|175|u=MeV}} per particle. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a "fireball", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.

=== How the QGP fits into the general scheme of physics ===

[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent. Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.

The study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).

== Expected properties ==

=== Thermodynamics ===
The cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This "crossover" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.

=== Flow ===
The equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The [[speed of sound]] is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The [[mean free path]] of quarks and gluons has been computed using [[perturbation theory]] as well as [[string theory]]. [[Lattice gauge theory|Lattice computations]] have been slower here, although the first computations of [[viscosity|transport coefficients]] have recently been concluded. These indicate that the [[mean free time]] of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another recent development that is still in an active stage.

=== Excitation spectrum ===
The study of thermodynamic and flow properties indicate that the assumption of QGP consisting almost entirely of free quarks and gluons is an over-simplification. Many ideas are currently being developed and will be put to test in the near future. It has been hypothesized recently that some mesons built from heavy quarks do not dissolve until the temperature reaches about {{val|350|u=MeV}}. This has led to speculation that many other kinds of bound states may exist in the plasma. Some static properties of the plasma (similar to the [[Debye length|Debye screening length]]) constrain the excitation spectrum.

=== Glasma hypothesis ===
Since 2008, there is a discussion about a hypothetical precursor state of the Quark–gluon plasma, the so-called "Glasma", where the dressed particles are condensed into some kind of glassy (or amorphous) state, below the genuine transition between the confined state and the plasma liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=From Glasma to Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions |year=2008 |arxiv=0806.1356 |bibcode = 2008JPhG...35j4003V |doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/35/10/104003 |volume=35 |issue=10 |journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics |page=104003|last1=Venugopalan |first1=Raju }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be analogous to the formation of metallic glasses, or amorphous alloys of them, below the genuine onset of the liquid metallic state.

== Experimental situation ==
Those forms of the QGP that are easiest to compute are not those that are easiest to verify experimentally. While the balance of evidence points towards the QGP being the origin of the detailed properties of the fireball produced at [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] (CERN), in the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] and at [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], this is the main barrier which prevents experimentalists from declaring a sighting of the QGP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnl.gov/npp/docs/Hunting%20the%20QGP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The important classes of experimental observations are
* [[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)
* [[Strangeness production]]
* [[Photon and muon rates]] (and [[J/ψ#J/ψ melting|J/ψ melting]])
* [[Elliptic flow]]
* [[Jet quenching]]
* [[Quantum fluctuation|Fluctuations]]
* [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose–Einstein correlations]]

In short, a quark–gluon plasma flows like a splat of liquid, and because it's not "transparent" with respect to quarks, it can attenuate [[Jet (particle physics)|jets]] emitted by collisions. Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark–gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a nonequilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.

== Formation of quark matter ==
In April 2005, formation of quark matter was tentatively confirmed by results obtained at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]'s [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC). The consensus of the four RHIC research groups was that they had created a quark–gluon [[liquid]] of very low [[viscosity]]. However, contrary to what was at that time still the widespread assumption, it is yet unknown from theoretical predictions whether the QCD "plasma", especially close to the transition temperature, should behave like a gas or liquid.  Authors favoring the weakly interacting interpretation derive their assumptions from the lattice QCD calculation, where the entropy density of quark–gluon plasma approaches the weakly interacting limit. However, since both energy density and correlation shows significant deviation from the weakly interacting limit, it has been pointed out by many authors that there is in fact no reason to assume a QCD "plasma" close to the transition point should be weakly interacting, like electromagnetic plasma (see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=nucl-th/0403032 |author1=Miklos Gyulassy |title=The QGP Discovered at RHIC |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  That being said, systematically improvable perturbative QCD quasiparticle models do a very good job of reproducing the lattice data for thermodynamical observables (pressure, entropy, quark susceptibility), including the aforementioned "significant deviation from the weakly interacting limit", down to temperatures on the order of 2 to 3 times the critical temperature for the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Andersen | author2=Leganger | author3=Strickland | author4=Su | doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.12.070 | journal=Physics Letters B |volume=696|title=NNLO hard-thermal-loop thermodynamics for QCD |year=2011 |arxiv=1009.4644 |bibcode= 2011PhLB..696..468A | issue=5 | pages=468–472 | citeseerx=10.1.1.766.4960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andersen |author2=Michael Strickland |author3=Nan Su |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.122003 |pmid=20366527 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |title=Gluon Thermodynamics at Intermediate Coupling |issue=12 |pages=122003 |year=2010 |arxiv=0911.0676|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104l2003A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |arxiv=hep-ph/0303185 |author1=Blaizot |author2=Iancu |author3=Rebhan |title=Thermodynamics of the high-temperature quark-gluon plasma |year=2003 |doi=10.1142/9789812795533_0002 |journal=Quark–Gluon Plasma 3 |pages=60–122|isbn=978-981-238-077-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heat exchanger.svg|thumb|400px|Types of recuperator, or cross plate [[heat exchanger]]]]
A '''recuperator''' is a special purpose [[countercurrent exchange|counter-flow]] [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the [[exhaust gas]]es of an industrial process, in order to recover the [[waste heat]]. Generally, they are used to extract heat from the exhaust and use it to preheat air entering the combustion system. In this way they use waste energy to heat the air, offsetting some of the fuel, and thereby improves the [[energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]] of the system as a whole.

==Description==
In many types of processes, [[combustion]] is used to generate heat, and the recuperator serves to recuperate, or reclaim this heat, in order to reuse or recycle it. The term recuperator refers as well to liquid-liquid counterflow heat exchangers used for heat recovery in the chemical and refinery industries and in closed processes such as ammonia-water or LiBr-water absorption refrigeration cycle.

Recuperators are often used in association with the burner portion of a [[heat engine]], to increase the overall efficiency. For example, in a [[gas turbine]] engine, air is compressed, mixed with fuel, which is then burned and used to drive a turbine. The recuperator transfers some of the waste heat in the exhaust to the compressed air, thus preheating it before entering the fuel burner stage. Since the gases have been pre-heated, less fuel is needed to heat the gases up to the turbine inlet temperature. By recovering some of the energy usually lost as waste heat, the recuperator can make a heat engine or gas turbine significantly more efficient.

==Energy transfer process==
Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as "[[sensible heat]]", which is the exchange of energy, or [[enthalpy]], resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative [[humidity]] levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation to take place in the device, then this will cause "[[latent heat]]" to be released and the heat transfer material will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite airstream, the water will reduce the [[thermal resistance]] of the [[boundary layer]] of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the [[heat transfer coefficient]] of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the exhaust air stream.

However, the film of condensation will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and depending upon the spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. If the unit is not laid to falls, and the condensate not allowed to drain properly, this will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the seasonal efficiency of the device.

==Use in ventilation systems==
In heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, [[HVAC]], recuperators are commonly used to re-use waste heat from exhaust air normally expelled to [[atmosphere]]. Devices typically comprises a series of parallel plates of [[aluminium]], [[plastic]], [[stainless steel]], or [[synthetic fiber]], alternate pairs of which are enclosed on two sides to form twin sets of ducts at right angles to each other, and which contain the supply and extract air streams. In this manner heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the separating plates, and into the supply air stream. Manufacturers claim gross efficiencies of up to 80% depending upon the specification of the unit.

The characteristics of this device are attributable to the relationship between the physical size of the unit, in particular the air path distance, and the spacing of the plates. For an equal air pressure drop through the device, a small unit will have a narrower plate spacing and a lower air velocity than a larger unit, but both units may be just as efficient. Because of the cross-flow design of the unit, its physical size will dictate the air path length, and as this increases, heat transfer will increase but pressure drop will also increase, and so plate spacing is increased to reduce pressure drop, but this in turn will reduce heat transfer.

As a general rule a recuperator selected for a pressure drop of between {{convert|150|-|250|Pa}} will have a good efficiency, while having a small effect on fan power consumption, but will have in turn a higher seasonal efficiency than that for physically smaller, but higher pressure drop recuperator.

When heat recovery is not required, it is typical for the device to be bypassed by use of dampers arranged within the ventilation distribution system. Assuming the fans are fitted with inverter speed controls, set to maintain a constant pressure in the ventilation system, then the reduced pressure drop leads to a slowing of the fan motor and thus reducing power consumption, and in turn improves the seasonal efficiency of the system.

==Use in metallurgical furnaces==
Recuperators have also been used to recover heat from waste gasses to preheat combustion air and fuel for many years by metallic recuperators to reduce energy costs and carbon footprint of operation. Compared to alternatives such as regenerative furnaces, initial costs are lesser, there are no valves to be switching back and forth, there are no induced-draft fans and it does not require a web of gas ducts spread up all over the furnace.

Historically the recovery ratios of recuperators compared to [[regenerative burner]]s were low. However, recent improvements to technology have allowed recuperators to recover 70-80% of the waste heat and pre-heated air up to {{convert|850|-|900|°C}} is now possible.

==Gas turbines==

Recuperators can be used to increase the efficiency of [[gas turbines]] for power generation, provided the exhaust gas is hotter than the compressor outlet temperature. The exhaust heat from the turbine is used to pre-heat the air from the compressor before further heating in the combustor, reducing the fuel input required. The larger the temperature difference between turbine out and compressor out, the greater the benefit from the recuperator. &lt;ref&gt;Çengel, Yunus A.; Boles, Michael (1994). Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[microturbine]]s (&lt;1MW), which typically have low pressure ratios, have the most to gain from the use of a recuperator. In practice, a doubling of efficiency is possible through the use of a recuperator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hiflux.co.uk/applications/microturbine-recuperators/ |title= Microturbine Recuperators |publisher= Hiflux Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major practical challenge for a recuperator in microturbine applications is coping with the exhaust gas temperature, which can exceed {{convert|750|°C}}.

'''Recycling codes''' are used to identify the material from which an item is made, to facilitate easier [[recycling]] or other reprocessing. Having a recycling code, the chasing arrows logo or a resin code on an item is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the item is.  Such symbols have been defined for [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Biodegradable waste|biomatter/organic material]], [[glass]], [[metals]], [[paper]], and [[plastics]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Various countries have adopted different codes. For example, the table below shows the polymer resin codes (plastic) for a country. In the United States there are fewer, as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] is grouped in with others in group 7. Other countries have a more granular recycling code system. For example, China's polymer identification system has seven different classifications of plastic, five different symbols for post-consumer paths, and 140 identification codes.&lt;ref&gt;Standardization Administration of the People’s Republic of China (SAC) GB16288,2008. Marking of plastics products. Chinese Standard Publishing House, Beijing; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of codes in some countries has encouraged those who can fabricate their own plastic products, such as [[RepRap]] and other [[prosumer]] [[3-D printer]] users, to adopt a voluntary recycling code based on the more comprehensive Chinese system.&lt;ref&gt;Emily J. Hunt, Chenlong Zhang, Nick Anzalone, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/11229348/Polymer_recycling_codes_for_distributed_manufacturing_with_3-D_printers Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers], ''Resources, Conservation and Recycling'', '''97''', pp. 24-30 (2015).

[[File:Ballast water en.svg|thumb|Ballast water discharge from other sides of the world cause a certain type of pollution different from an emission type pollution as it introduces [[invasive species]] that can literally cause domestic species to go extinct.]]
After delivering their cargo, empty commercial ships need to take up water from the port of arrival in order to maintain stability and ensure safe navigation conditions before heading back to the port of departure. This water, called [[ballast water]], which contains aquatic organisms typical of the port of arrival, is stored in [[ballast tank]]s and is ultimately discharged at the port of departure when the ship is ready to be re-loaded. During this process, aquatic organisms capable of surviving in ballast water are released into new environments and can therefore become invasive species, causing serious economic and public health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Invasion|publisher= WWF International |year=2009|url=http://www.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen-PDF/Study_Silent_Invasion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control and management of ballast water |year=2012|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-management-of-ballast-water |publisher=gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following the ratification of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO)’s Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention, commercial ships will have to treat their ballast water in order to comply with maximum discharge standards established for organisms in different size categories (IMO’s D-2 Standards and [[US Coast Guard]] Standards). However, some organisms are capable of surviving or even recovering after harsh treatments, leading to regrowth in ballast water tanks before discharge. In order to minimise regrowth and hence avoid exceeding discharge limits, different criteria such as duration of the journey, ballast water tanks capacity and water flow rate at intake and discharge, among others, should be considered when choosing an appropriate type-approved ballast water treatment systems (BWTS).

== Regrowth ==
Surviving organisms have the potential to regrow after treatment and, depending on the duration of the voyage and the prevailing conditions, this regrowth could lead to exceeding the maximum number of aquatic organisms that can be discharged according to the established standards.

Both phytoplankton and zooplankton have been shown to be capable of surviving in ballast water tanks for up to 23 days.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J.H., Hyun, B.G., Shin, K. (2010).

''Journal of Applied Phycology'' '''26''': 227-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the scientific evidence currently available supports the idea that it is not an issue of “IF regrowth” but “WHEN regrowth”.

== Considerations ==
Timescales are very important when considering regrowth. For instance, if ballast water is treated at intake and held in ballast tanks for over a week before discharge, then the organisms surviving the treatment could have enough time to increase in numbers and potentially exceed discharge standards before the end of the voyage.

Every BWTS has its advantages and disadvantages &lt;ref name=Lloyds2015 /&gt; and ship owners and ship operators should consider the benefits and limitations of different systems before making an educated choice based on their requirements. The issue of regrowth should be taken seriously and should be taken into account when choosing an appropriate BWTS.&lt;ref&gt;Grob, C., Pollet, B.G. (2016).

The '''Reykjavík Green Days''' is an annual event which takes place in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. This event was founded by a group of students at the University of Iceland in the Environmental and Natural resources program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nemendafelog.hi.is/gaia/about-us/|title=About Us {{!}} Gaia|website=nemendafelog.hi.is|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gaia", as the group is known, aims to raise awareness and stimulate citizens, businesses, non-governmental organizations, local authorities and other urban actors to improve the environment's quality by implementing changes in behavior.

It's considered by the Reykjavík town Council an environmental education initiative that encourages all stakeholders to take steps towards becoming more environmentally responsible.

The initiave has been organized by the SEED Iceland association in collaboration with other minor local institutions. The staff has been made up of people with 9 nationalities&lt;ref&gt;[http://seedsiceland.webs.com/credits.htmFrom The initiative credits; Reykjavík Green days staff]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: Sumi Ahn (South Korea), Judit Alonso  (Spain/France), Aurelia de Callatay (Belgium), Juan Antonio Corbalan Liarte (Spain), François Gentil (France, Waste management day and Critical Mass overseer), Andrea Gori (Italy, Webmaster and Critical Mass overseer), Angels Hernandez (Spain), Sophie Muller (France), Tommaso Papini (Italy), Mauro Pitzalis (Italy, supervisor for the children activities), Felipe Sanchez (Colombia/Denmark, Green days supervisor and Efficient use of energy resources day overseer), Edward Williams (England, Film festival debate-moderator).&lt;/ref&gt; and so the event has been a relevant tourist attraction.
The most important happening of the 2009 edition was the [[Critical mass|Reykjavík critical mass]], which was actually the first one in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&amp;ew_0_a_id=338007 Iceland review online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RunWise''' is an [[energy recovery]] project within the [[Parker Hannifin Corporation]].  The plans of this project are: being part of the [[powertrain]] on [[truck]]s performing multiple stop and go cycles, the Runwise system will store energy from vehicle [[Brake|braking]] into [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulator]]s, releasing the power again for acceleration.

[[Autocar Company|Autocar]], maker of severe service trucks, is partnering with Parker Hannifin to release a refuse truck utilizing the RunWise system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccjdigital.com/parker-designs-runwise-hybrid-for-refuse-vehicles-2/ |title=Parker designs RunWise hybrid for refuse vehicles |publisher=CCJ |date={{Date|2009-06-15}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">The '''seasonally adjusted annual rate''' (SAAR) is a rate that is adjusted to take into account typical seasonal fluctuations in data and is expressed as an annual total. SAARs are used for data affected by [[seasonality]], when it could be misleading to directly compare different times of the year.

SAARs are often used for car sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ALTSALES |title=Light Weight Vehicle Sales: Autos and Light Trucks|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]]|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm |title=Federal Reserve Seasonal Factors for Domestic Auto and Truck Production: formulas|publisher=[[Federal Reserve]]|date=1 April 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of when SAARs could be used are occupancy rates at ski resorts, which are higher in the winter, or sales of ice cream, which are higher in the summer. Sales between seasons can be more easily compared using seasonally adjusted rates. The SAAR is calculated by dividing the unadjusted annual rate for the month by its seasonality factor and multiplying by 12 to create an annual rate. (Quarterly data would be multiplied by 4.)

::''[[Energy density]] has tables of specific energies of devices and materials.''

'''Specific energy''' is [[energy]] per unit [[mass]]. (It is also sometimes called "energy density," though "energy density" more precisely means [[energy density|energy per unit volume]].) It is used to quantify, for example, stored [[heat]] and other [[thermodynamic properties]] of substances such as [[specific internal energy]], [[specific enthalpy]], specific [[Gibbs free energy]], and specific [[Helmholtz free energy]].  It may also be used for the [[kinetic energy]] or [[potential energy]] of a body.  Specific energy is an [[intensive property]], whereas energy and mass are [[extensive property|extensive properties]].

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for specific energy is the [[joule]] per [[kilogram]] (J/kg).  Other units still in use in some contexts are the [[kilocalorie]] per gram (Cal/g or kcal/g), mostly in food-related topics, [[watt hour]]s per kilogram in the field of batteries, and the [[Imperial System|Imperial unit]] [[BTU]] per [[pound (mass)|pound]] (BTU/lb), in some [[engineering]] and applied technical fields.&lt;ref name=Heselton&gt;
  Kenneth E. Heselton (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y0qRQl7XDEC&amp;pg=PA153 "Boiler Operator's Handbook"]. Fairmont Press, 405 pages. {{ISBN|0881734357}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gray (unit)|gray]] and [[sievert]] are specialized measures for specific energy absorbed by body tissues in the form of [[radiation]].  The following table shows the factors for converting to J/kg:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Unit!! SI equivalent
|-
|kcal/g&lt;ref&gt;Using the thermochemical calorie.&lt;/ref&gt; || 4.184 MJ/kg
|-
|Wh/kg || 3.6 kJ/kg
|-
|kWh/kg || 3.6 MJ/kg
|-
|Btu/lb&lt;ref&gt;Using the definition based on the International Steam Table calorie.&lt;/ref&gt; || 2.326 kJ/kg
|-
|Btu/lb&lt;ref&gt;Using the definition based on the thermochemical calorie.&lt;/ref&gt; || ca. 2.32444 kJ/kg
|}

The concept of specific energy is related to but distinct from the [[chemistry|chemical]] notion of ''molar'' energy, that is energy per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance, which uses units of energy per mole, such as J/[[mole (unit)|mol]], kJ/mol, or the older (but still widely used) [[kilocalorie|kcal]]/mol.&lt;ref name=Lesz&gt;
  Jerzy Leszczynski (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aJn6UBl2YCwC&amp;pg=PA1238 "Handbook of Computational Chemistry"].  Springer, 1430 pages. {{ISBN|940070710X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For a table giving the specific energy of many different fuels as well as batteries, see the article [[Energy density]].

==Energy density of food==
{{Main|Food energy}}

Energy density is the amount of energy per mass or volume of food. The energy density of a food can be determined from the label by dividing the energy per serving (usually in [[kilojoule]]s or [[food calorie]]s) by the serving size (usually in grams,&lt;!-- or ounces?--&gt; milliliters or fluid ounces).  Energy density is thus expressed in cal/g, kcal/g, J/g, kJ/g, cal/mL, kcal/mL, J/mL, or kJ/mL. The "calorie" commonly used in nutritional contexts is the kilogram-calorie (abbreviated "Cal" and sometimes called the "dietary calorie", "food calorie" or "Calorie" with a capital "C").  This is equivalent to a thousand gram-calories (abbreviated "cal") or one kilocalorie (kcal). Because food energy is commonly measured in Calories, the energy density of food is commonly called "caloric density".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stevens|first=Heidi |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-19/features/sc-food-0416-calories-20100419_1_calorie-density-caloric-density-fiber |title=Consider caloric density for weight loss|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy density measures the energy released when the food is [[metabolized]] by a healthy organism when it ingests the food (see [[food energy]] for calculation) and the food is metabolized with oxygen, into waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Besides [[ethanol|alcohol]] the only sources of food energy are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s and [[protein]]s, which make up ninety percent of the dry weight of food.&lt;ref name="merck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec12/ch152/ch152b.html |title=Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats: Overview of Nutrition|work=  The Merck Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, [[water]] content is the most important factor in energy density.  Carbohydrates provide four calories per gram (17&amp;nbsp;kJ/g), and proteins offer slightly less at 16kJ/g whereas fat provides nine calories per gram (38&amp;nbsp;kJ/g),&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; {{frac|2|1|4}} times as much energy.  Fats contain more carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds than carbohydrates or proteins and are therefore richer in energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=David L.|title=11th Hour: Introduction to Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YApiST6qvbgC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=lipids+carbon-hydrogen+bonds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ofdVUoykB4K49gSr74CQCg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lipids%20carbon-hydrogen%20bonds&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=9781444313222|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foods that derive most of their energy from fat have a much higher energy density than those that derive most of their energy from carbohydrates or proteins, even if the water content is the same.  Nutrients with a lower absorption, such as [[fiber]] or [[sugar alcohol]]s, lower the energy density of foods as well.  A moderate energy density would be 1.6 to 3 calories per gram (7–13&amp;nbsp;kJ/g); salmon, lean meat, and bread would fall in this category. High-energy foods would have more than three calories per gram and include crackers, cheese, dark chocolate, and peanuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okinawaprogram.com/pdf/caloric_density_pyramid.pdf |title=The Okinawa Diet: Caloric Density Pyramid |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509033559/http://www.okinawaprogram.com/pdf/caloric_density_pyramid.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel==
{{Main|Energy density}}
Energy density is sometimes useful for comparing fuels.  For example, [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel has a higher specific energy (energy per unit mass) than [[gasoline]] does, but a much lower volumetric energy density.

==Astrodynamics==
[[Specific mechanical energy]], rather than simply energy, is often used in [[astrodynamics]], because gravity changes the kinetic and potential specific energies of a vehicle in ways that are independent of the mass of the vehicle, consistent with the [[conservation of energy]] in a [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravitational system]].

The specific energy of an object such as a [[meteoroid]] falling on the earth from outside the earth's gravitational well is at least one half the square of the [[escape velocity]] of 11.2&amp;nbsp;km/s. This comes to 63 MJ/kg (15 kcal/g, or 15 tonnes [[TNT equivalent]] per tonne). [[Comet]]s have even more energy, typically moving with respect to the sun, when in our vicinity, at about the square root of two times the speed of the earth. This comes to 42&amp;nbsp;km/s, or a specific energy of 882&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg. The speed relative to the earth may be more or less, depending on direction. Since the speed of the earth around the sun is about 30&amp;nbsp;km/s, a comet's speed relative to the earth can range from 12 to 72&amp;nbsp;km/s, the latter corresponding to 2592&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg. If a comet with this speed fell to the earth it would gain another 63&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg, yielding a total of 2655&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg with a speed of 72.9&amp;nbsp;km/s. Since the equator is moving at about 0.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, the impact speed has an upper limit of 73.4&amp;nbsp;km/s, giving an upper limit for the specific energy of a comet hitting the earth of about 2690&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg.

If the [[Hale-Bopp]] comet (50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) had hit the earth, it would have vaporized the oceans and sterilized the surface of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The end of life on Earth|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Jun 4, 2016|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030760-300-the-end-what-will-become-of-earth-and-all-that-lives-here}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
* [[Kinetic energy]] per unit mass: {{frac2|1|2}}''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''v'' is the speed (giving J/kg when ''v'' is in m/s). See also [[Projectile#Typical projectile speeds|kinetic energy per unit mass of projectiles]].
* [[Potential energy]] with respect to gravity, close to earth, per unit mass: ''gh'', where ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity ([[standard gravity|standardized]] as ~9.8&lt;!--0655--&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''h'' is the height above the reference level (giving J/kg when ''g'' is in m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''h'' is in m).
* [[Heat]]: energies per unit mass are [[specific heat capacity]] times [[temperature]] difference, and [[Latent heat|specific melting heat]], and [[Standard enthalpy change of vaporization|specific heat of vaporization]]

'''Specific mechanical energy''' is the [[mechanical energy]] of an object per unit of mass. Similar to mechanical energy, the specific mechanical energy of an object in an isolated system subject only to [[Conservative force|conservative forces]] will remain constant.

It is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    e &amp;= e_k+e_p
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific kinetic energy]] 

* &lt;math&gt;e_p&lt;/math&gt; it the [[specific potential energy]]

== Astrodynamics ==
{{Main article|Specific orbital energy}}In the [[gravitational two-body problem]], the specific mechanical energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \epsilon &amp;= \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}
            = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu^2}{h^2} \left(1 - e^2\right)
            = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;v\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the relative [[orbital speed]];
* &lt;math&gt;r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Orbital position vector|orbital distance]] between the bodies;
* &lt;math&gt;\mu = {G}(m_1 + m_2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the [[Standard gravitational parameter|standard gravitational parameters]] of the bodies;
* &lt;math&gt;h\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific relative angular momentum]] in the sense of [[relative angular momentum]] divided by the reduced mass;
* &lt;math&gt;e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Eccentricity (orbit)|orbital eccentricity]];
* &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]].

=== Orbital Mechanics ===
When calculating the specific mechanical energy of a satellite in orbit around a celestial body, the mass of the satellite is assumed to be negligible:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = G(M + m) \approx GM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the celestial body.

'''''The Flight of the Phoenix''''' is  a 1964 novel by [[Elleston Trevor]]. The plot involves the crash of a transport aircraft in the middle of a [[desert]] and the survivors' desperate attempt to save themselves. The book was the basis for the 1965 film ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' starring [[James Stewart]] and the 2004 [[remake]] entitled ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]''.
''The Flight of the Phoenix'' came at the midpoint of Trevor's career and led to a bidding war over its film rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/etrevor.htm |title=Elleston Trevor |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=Kuusankoski Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926061423/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/etrevor.htm |archivedate=26 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Pilot Frank Towns and navigator Lew Moran are ferrying a mixed bag of passengers out of the Jebel oil town of the Libyan desert, among them oil workers, a couple of British soldiers, and a German who was visiting his brother. An unexpected sandstorm forces the aircraft down, damaging it, killing two of the men, and severely injuring the German. In the book, the action takes place in the [[Libya]]n part of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Flight-of-the-Phoenix/Elleston-Trevor/e/9780060762223 "Flight of the Phoenix by Elleston Trevor (Mass Market Paperback - Reissue) Book review."] ''barnesandnoble.com''. Retrieved: May 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The survivors wait for rescue but begin to worry, as the storm has blown them far off course, away from where searchers would look for them. After several days, Captain Harris marches toward a distant oasis together with another passenger. His aide, Sergeant Watson feigns a sprained ankle and does not join Harris.  A third man follows after them. Days later, Harris barely manages to return to the crash site.  The others are lost.

As the water begins to run out, Stringer&lt;!-- The Englishman, Stinger, belongs to the book, which this article is about.  The German, Dorffman, belongs to the movie, for which there is another article; see [The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)] --&gt;, a precise, arrogant English [[aeronautical engineer]], proposes a radical solution. He claims they can rebuild a new aircraft from the wreckage of the old [[twin-boom aircraft]], using the undamaged boom and adding skids to take off. They set to work.

At one point, they spot a party of [[nomad]]ic tribesmen. Captain Harris decides to ask them for help, but Sergeant Watson refuses to accompany him. Instead another survivor, a Texan named Loomis, goes with him. The next day, Towns finds their looted bodies, throats cut, and the nomads gone.

Later, Towns finds out that Stringer's job is designing [[Model aircraft|''model'' aircraft]], not real, full-scale ones. Afraid of the effect on morale, he and Moran keep their discovery secret, though they now believe Stringer's plan is doomed. However, they turn out to be wrong. The aircraft is reborn, like the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]. It flies the passengers, strapped to the outside of the fuselage, to an [[oasis]] and civilization.

==Film adaptations==
{{Main article|The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)}}
The book was the basis of a 1965 film starring [[James Stewart]], [[Richard Attenborough]], and [[Hardy Krüger]]. The 2004 remake featuring [[Dennis Quaid]] was also based on the novel, although it was re-located to the [[Gobi Desert]] in Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6229">'''Theistic rationalism''' is a hybrid of [[Natural theology|natural religion]], [[Christianity]], and [[rationalism]], in which rationalism is the predominant element.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Henry Clarence Thiessen, the concept of theistic rationalism first developed during the [[18th century|eighteenth century]] as a form of [[Deism in England and France in the 18th century|English]] and German [[Deism]].&lt;ref name="Thiessen"&gt;

Some scholars have argued that the term properly describes the beliefs of some of the prominent  [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], including [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="SmithFaith"&gt;

Theistic rationalists believe natural religion, Christianity, and rationalism typically coexist compatibly, with rational thought balancing the conflicts between the first two aspects.&lt;ref name="SmithFaith"/&gt; They often assert that the primary role of a person's religion should be to bolster [[morality]], a fixture of daily life.&lt;ref name="SmithFaith"/&gt; 

Theistic rationalists believe that God plays an active role in human life, rendering prayer effective.&lt;ref name="SmithFaith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GroveCity"/&gt;
They accept parts of the Bible as divinely inspired, using reason as their criterion for what to accept or reject.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg L. Frazer, "The Political Theology of the American Founding" (Ph.D. dissertation), Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California, 2004, pp. 11-12; also Frazer, ''The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, Revolution'' (University Press of Kansas, 2012) &lt;/ref&gt;
Their belief that God intervenes in human affairs and their approving attitude toward parts of the Bible distinguish theistic rationalists from Deists.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, "The Political Theology of the American Founding"  p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] (1671-1713), has been described{{by whom?|date=May 2015}} as an early theistic rationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, "The Political Theology of the American Founding" pp. 243-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stanley Grean, {{Cquote|''Both Shaftesbury and the Deists wanted to preserve theology while freeing it from supernaturalism; both denied the occurrence of miracles; both called for free criticism of the Bible and questioned the absoluteness of its authority; both shared a distrust of sacramental and priestly religion; and both stressed the importance of morality in religion.  However, despite this broad area of agreement, Shaftesbury did not identify himself unreservedly with the developing Deistic movement, and he expressed some serious doubts about certain aspects of it...The Deists were wrong if they relegated God to the status of a Prime Mover without subsequent contact with the universe; Deity must be conceived as being in constant and living interaction with the creation; otherwise the concept is "dry and barren."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Grean, ''Shaftesbury's Philosophy of Religion and Ethics: A Study in Enthusiasm'' (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1967, pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}
