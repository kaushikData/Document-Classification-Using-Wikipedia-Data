'''Aaron Louis Friedberg''' (born April 16, 1956)&lt;ref name=CAO&gt;{{cite book|title=Aaron Louis Friedberg|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  served from 2003 to 2005 in the office of the [[Vice President of the United States]] as deputy assistant for [[national security|national-security]] affairs and director of policy planning.

After receiving his PhD in [[Government]] from [[Harvard]], Friedberg joined the [[Princeton University]] faculty in 1987 and was appointed professor of politics and international affairs in 1999. He has  served as Director of Princeton's Research Program in International Security at the Woodrow Wilson School  as well as Acting Director of the [[Center of International Studies]] at Princeton. Friedberg is a former fellow at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]], and [[Harvard University]]’s [[Center for International Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbr.org/publications/bulletin/no16march2002/march2002.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Counselors for the [[National Bureau of Asian Research]]'s Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbr.org/research/group.aspx?id=fea49944-0fd2-4d0c-86d0-2bc059ac5a4d NBR's Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Friedberg began a nine-month residential appointment as  the first [[Henry Alfred Kissinger]] Scholar at the [[Library of Congress]]. During his tenure he researched "the rise of Asia and its implications for America." Apart from many articles for ''Commentary'' magazine, Friedberg has written several books on foreign relations. 

He was one of the signers of the [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) documents ''Statement of Principles'' (June 3, 1997) and a letter on terrorism submitted to President [[George W. Bush]] (September 20, 2001). His name has been connected to the [[Aspen Strategy Group]] at the [[Aspen Institute]].

Friedberg represented the Romney campaign in his capacity as the campaign's National Security Advisor during a [http://www.c-span.org/video/?309030-1/us-china-policy debate on US policy toward China in October 2012].

== International relations philosophy ==

Although Friedberg's [[international relations]] [[philosophy]] is rooted in concern for the structural organization of power characteristic of the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] school of international relations, he draws from many of the traditions of [[liberal institutionalism]], resulting in what scholar Thomas Christensen has termed a "positive-sum" stance on international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Christensen, "Fostering Stability or Creating a Monster? The Rise of China and U.S. Policy toward East Asia", ''International Security'', Vol. 31, No. 1 (Summer 2006), pp. 81–126.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, unlike more pessimistic [[political realism|realist]] scholars, Friedberg, in a seminal article published in [[International Security]] in 1993, advocated continued U.S. engagement in [[East Asia]] to serve as a stabilizing force until regional economic integration and [[multilateralism|multilateral]] institutions had time to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron L. Friedberg, "Ripe for Rivalry: Prospects for Peace in a Multipolar Asia," ''International Security'', Vol. 18, No. 3 (Winter 1993/94), pp. 5–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in contrast to traditional [[realpolitik]] scholars, Friedberg believes that conflict is not inevitable in East Asia as China continues to develop as long as multilateral institutions and economic integration are used as tools to manage [[security dilemma]]s.

'''Abāmūn of Toukh''' is a [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Egypt]]ian [[martyr]] known only from a mention of him in the ''[[Synaxarion]]'' of Mikhail of Atrib. His feast day is 20 July (13 [[Epip|Abib]]).

==Biography==
He was from [[Toukh]] in the diocese of [[Banha]]. He is said to have been visited by the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], who told Abāmūn that he would be martyred at [[Ansena]]. Abamun traveled to Ansena, There he was tortured by the governor Eukhious by a variety of means, including the [[rack (torture device)|rack]], fire, red-hot irons, flogging, flaying, and the furnace) before he was finally beheaded. He is also said to have worked a number of miracles.

After his execution, another Christian, [[Julius of Aqfahs]], wrapped the body in cloths and had it carried back to his homeland, Toukh. Vagaries of translation have led some to believe that Mikhail went on to imply that Abāmūn's body had been taken there immediately, although other translators have made it clear that the intended meaning was more likely that the body was moved from Toukh sometime in the thirteenth century.

==Veneration==
[[Abu Salih the Armenian]] records that in the thirteenth century there was a church dedicated to Abamūn (note the spelling difference) at [[El-Bahnasa]]. He went on to say that he himself was not sure whether the church was dedicated to '''Abāmūn of Ṭoukh''' or his namesake [[Abāmūn of Tarnūt]].

The evidence available makes it seem more likely that it was named after Abāmūn of Ṭoukh, for several reasons. One is that Julius of Aqfahs personally took care of this martyr's body, but not the other's. Another is that Mikhail specifically mentions that this Abāmūn was at the time of his writing in the Said, which indicates that there was a [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] extant at the time [[veneration|venerating]] this Abāmūn, but not the other. Lastly, there is the existing reference to this individual working a number of miracles, with no such reference made to any miracle by the other Abamun.

'''Carolina (Carola) Elena Lorenzini''' (15 August 1889 – 23 November 1941) was a pioneer Argentine aviator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buscabiografias.com/biografia/verDetalle/6667/Carola%20Lorenzini|title=Biografía de Carola Lorenzini|last=buscabiografias|website=www.buscabiografias.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Life ==
Lorenzini was born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, the seventh of eight children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She worked as a typist at the Unión Telefónica Company, and enjoyed participating in sports such as rowing, javelin, athletics and hockey. In 1933 she started learning to fly at the Aeroclub de [[Morón, Buenos Aires|Morón]]. The lessons were expensive, and she had to use all her savings, and sell her bicycle and encyclopedia, to pay. In March 1935 she earnt her pilot's license. The same year, she broke the South American record for altitude, flying to 5,700 metres.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inac.edu.ar/ciataonline/index.php?sec=&amp;pag=noticia&amp;tipo=Institucional&amp;id=21|title=CIATA - Centro de Instrucción de Aeronavegantes y Técnicos Aeronáuticos|date=2009-10-04|access-date=2016-12-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004065125/http://www.inac.edu.ar/ciataonline/index.php?sec=&amp;pag=noticia&amp;tipo=Institucional&amp;id=21|archivedate=4 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also entered and won several flying races, and became interested in high aerobatics, enrolling in a course on the subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She became famous for her skill in performing inverted loops, an advanced maneouvre which only one other aviator, her instructor Santiago Germanó, was able to perform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-698-2003-04-20.html|title=Página/12 :: radar|website=www.pagina12.com.ar|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1938 to 1940, Lorenzini was involved in an air exploration mission to fly all of Argentina's 14 provinces and make aerial maps for transport and mail flights. She flew to every town and city in the country, annotating maps as she travelled.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, she became nationally famous; in 1939 the magazine ''Vosotras'' named Lorenzini one of Argentina's eight women of the year, and in 1940 she featured on the cover of ''[[El Gráfico|El Grafico]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

On 23 November 1941 Lorenzini lost control of her aircraft, a [[Focke-Wulf]], while conducting her famous inverted loop, and crashed. She was killed immediately. The accident happened in Morón during an aerobatics exhibition for a visiting group of Uruguayan aviators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was later reported that Lorenzini had been flying an aircraft she was unfamiliar with and that she had been extremely angry on the day of the exhibition due to an ongoing issue with the organisers of the event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2001, the Argentine post office issued a postage stamp bearing Lorenzini's image and name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stampcommunity.org/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=35146&amp;whichpage=9|title=Famous women on stamps and covers - Stamp Community Forum - Page 9|website=Stamp Community Family Stamp Collecting Forum|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5631">'''Claire Lacombe''' (4 August 1765-?) was a French actress and revolutionary. She is best known for her contributions during the [[French Revolution]]. Though it was only for a few years, Lacombe was a revolutionary and a founding member of the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]].

==Early life==
Lacombe was born in the provincial town of [[Pamiers]] in southwestern [[France]]. She became an actress at a young age and appeared in theatrical productions in the provinces before arriving in Paris in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not an outstanding success in the theater, and she was not entirely happy with her life. The acting company that Lacombe worked for moved from town to town and sometimes went to castles and the country houses of aristocrats. This probably had an influence in her decision to quit the company to become a revolutionary.

==Revolutionary career==

In Paris during the [[10 August (French Revolution)|insurrection of 10 August]] 1792, Lacombe fought with the rebels during the storming of the [[Tuileries]]. She was shot through the arm but kept fighting on, earning herself the lifelong sobriquet, "Heroine of August Tenth. " For her bravery, she was awarded a civic crown by the victorious [[Fédéré|''fédérés'']].&lt;ref&gt;Godineau, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacombe became a frequent attendee at meetings of the [[Cordeliers|Cordeliers Club]] through which she became involved with the most radical elements of the Revolution. In February, 1793, Lacombe and another female revolutionary, [[Pauline Léon]], founded the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]].&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes385&gt;Fremont-Barnes, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sokolnikova, pp. 145ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Composed chiefly of working-class women, the Society associated with the most militant [[sans-culottes]] and ''[[enragés]]''.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes385/&gt; They functioned partly as a fighting force among the market women of Paris, and employed violent tactics to root out anti-revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=Doyle420&gt;Doyle, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the deeply entrenched chauvinism of the time, Lacombe met a few revolutionary men who fought for women's rights. One of these was [[Jean Théophile Victor Leclerc|Théophile Leclerc]], with whom she lived for a while, until he left her to marry Pauline Léon.&lt;ref name=Uglow309&gt;Uglow, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Reign of Terror]], the ''enragés'' were suppressed along with most other extremist groups, including the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women. Lacombe's group had been so notorious that the [[National Convention]] specifically banned women's organizations (30 October 1793).&lt;ref name=Doyle420/&gt;

Barred from any political activity, Lacombe considered returning to her acting career. In April 1794, she was arrested as she prepared to leave for a theater in [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name=Uglow309/&gt;

Lacombe was finally released from prison on 20 August 1795 (by order of 18 August 1795 signed by the [[Committee of General Security]]).&lt;ref&gt;Léopold Lacour, ''Les origines du féminisme contemporain: Olympe de Gouges, Théroigne de Méricourt, Rose Lacombe'', Paris: Plon, 1900, pp. 413-414.&lt;/ref&gt; She went back to the theater but quit again after three months, and settled into a life of unrecorded obscurity.&lt;ref name=Uglow309/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6293">'''Claire Wolfe''' is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] author and columnist. Some of Wolfe's favored topics are [[John Galt|gulching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Claire |last= Wolfe |title= Heading for Hardyville Gulch |quote= ''...The original gulch – [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Galt’s Gulch]] (follow the link and scroll down) was Ayn Rand’s creation in Atlas Shrugged....'' |date= 4 May 2004 |accessdate= 15 May 2017 |url= http://www.backwoodshome.com/heading-for-hardyville-gulch//}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[homesteading]], [[firearms]], [[homeschooling]], [[Open-source model|open source]] technology, and opposition to [[national ID]] and the [[surveillance state]] or [[nanny state]].

Wolfe's books include such titles as ''101 Things to Do 'Til the Revolution'' and ''I Am Not a Number!''. Wolfe also writes or has written for a number of magazines, notably [http://www.backwoodshome.com/wolfe_index.html Backwoods Home Magazine], [http://www.swatmag.com/archive_2005/aug05.html S.W.A.T. magazine], and [http://www.dgcmagazine.com/ DGC Magazine], which covers electronic, metal-backed currencies. A common subject in Wolfe's writing has been the fictional town of Hardyville, a rural libertarian [[enclave]] populated by [[stereotypical]] characters (Dora-the-[[Yale|Yalie]], Bob-the-[[Nerd]], Carty-the-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], etc.). When not writing, Wolfe is also an artist specializing in pastel portraits of people and animals and makes and sells jewelry and kaleidoscopes.

Wolfe's first book, ''101 Things to Do 'Til the Revolution'', was the result of disillusionment with the voting record of [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Linda Smith (American politician)|Linda Smith]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], whose congressional campaign Wolfe had supported in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mind-trek.com/arti-int/970109.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The book advocated a [[Radicalization|radical]] libertarian stance, opposed both major political parties, and encouraged [[self-sufficiency]] and actions to minimize the influence of the government in the life of the individual, as well as ideas for [[monkeywrenching]]. It was published by [[Loompanics Unlimited]] and became an underground bestseller.

Wolfe wrote a column for [[WorldNetDaily]] in the late 1990s and has written and [[Blogging|blogged]] irregularly since then. ''The Freedom Outlaw's Handbook'' (2004) is a compilation of ideas from Wolfe's first two books, both of which are now out of print.

{{Croats}}

The '''Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina''', often referred to as the '''Bosnian Croats''', are the third most populous [[ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|ethnic group]] in that country after [[Bosniaks]] and [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]], and are one of the [[constitutive nations]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf |title=Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina have made significant contributions to the [[culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Most Croats declare themselves [[Roman Catholics]] and speakers of [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

From the 15th to the 19th century, Catholics in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina were often persecuted under the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} causing many of them to flee the area. In the 20th century, political turmoil and poor economic conditions caused more to [[Emigration|emigrate]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] within Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s saw Croats forced to different parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although having lived in numerous regions prior to the Bosnian War. According to the report by the Bosnia and Herzegovina statistics office, on the [[2013 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|census of 2013]] there were 544,780 Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popis2013.ba/popis2013/doc/Popis2013prvoIzdanje.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

===Kingdom of Croatia===
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Krunidba kralja Tomislava.jpg|thumb|Coronation of King [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], painted by [[Oton Iveković]]]]
Croats settled the areas of modern Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 7th century.{{sfn|Englar|2007|p=23}}{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=420}}{{sfn|Čuvalo|2010|p=74}} There, they assimilated with native [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during the [[Migration Period|great migration of the Slavs]].{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=420}}{{sfn|Džino|2010|p=1}} The Croats adopted [[Christianity]] and began to develop their own culture, art, and political institutions, culminating in their own [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|kingdom]], which consisted of two [[Principality|principalities]]: [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] in the north, and [[Dalmatian Croatia]] in the south. [[Red Croatia]], to the south, was land of a few minor states. One of the most important events of the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early Middle Ages is the First Croatian Assembly held in 753 in [[Tomislavgrad|Županjac]] (present-day Tomislavgrad).{{sfn|Mandić|1974|p=109}} The second major event was the coronation of [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first King of Croatia, in ca. 925, in the fields of Županjac.{{sfn|Vulliamy|1994|p=227}} By this act, Pannonian Croatia and Dalmatian Croatia formed a united Croatian kingdom, which included [[Tomislav of Croatia#Geographical extent|Dalmatia and part of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Pannonia (eastern Slavonia and northeastern Bosnia), and Savia (western Slavonia).{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=420}}

===High and late middle age===
In 1102 Croatia entered into a union with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After this, Bosnia, which was earlier part of the Kingdom of Croatia,{{sfn|Pinson|1996|p=3}} started to disassociate with Croatia. At first, Bosnia became a separate principality under [[Ban Kulin]]  who managed to solidify Bosnian autonomy at the expense of more powerful neighbours, but only in the 14th century did Bosnia become a formidable state. In the 14th century, King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] conquered part of western Serbia and later part of the Kingdom of Croatia,{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=421}} which he accomplished by defeating various Croatian nobles and supporting Hungary.{{sfn|Pinson|1996|p=6}} Thus, the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] emerged, but part of present territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina remained in the [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]].

Regarding religion, Bosnia was closer to Croatia than the Orthodox lands to the east, and the Diocese of Bosnia is mentioned as Catholic in the 11th century, and later fell under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Split and in the 12th Century under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Dubrovnik. Another connection of Bosnia with Croatia is that Bosnian rulers always used the political title "[[Ban Kulin]]" in similarity with their Croatian counterparts.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=15}} The specific religion in medieval Bosnia was [[Bogomilism]] and [[Bosnian Church]], so some of the notable feudal lords in Medieval Bosnia were followers of this religion, such as Duke [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić|Hrvoje Hrvatinić]].{{sfn|Ibrahimagić|1996|p=100}} Due to the scarcity of historical records, there are no definite figures dealing with the religious composition of medieval Bosnia. However, some Croat scholars suggest that a majority of Bosnia's medieval population were Catholics who, according to Zlopaša, accounted for 700,000 of 900,000 of the total Bosnian population.{{dubious|date=August 2017}} Some 100,000 were Bogomils and other 100,000 were Orthodox Christians.{{sfn|Zlopaša|2005|p=23}}

===Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Zbjeg.jpg|thumb|The migration of the Catholic people from Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Ottoman takeover.]]
In the middle of the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire started to conquer Bosnia. In 1451 they took [[Vrhbosna]] province and conquered Bosnia in 1463. Herzegovina was conquered in 1481, while northern Bosnia was still under Hungary and Croatia until 1527, when it was conquered by the Ottomans.{{sfn|Pinson|1996|p=11}} After the Turkish conquest, many Catholic Bosnians converted to Islam,{{sfn|Duhan-Kaplan|1995|p=293}} and their numbers in some areas shrank as many fled from fear of conversion and persecution. The Ottoman conquest changed the demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, reducing the number of Catholics, and eliminating the Bosnian Church, whose members apparently converted to Islam ''en masse''.{{sfn|Zlopaša|2005|p=23}} The present-day boundaries of Bosnia and Herzegovina were made in 1699, when the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] was signed in order to establish peace between the [[Austrian Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire. Another significant event for Bosnian Croats is the boundary established by an agreement between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and the Ottoman Empire, where Ragusans promised to give in part of their territory in [[Neum]] to the Ottomans in order to protect themselves from the [[Republic of Venice]].{{sfn|Zlopaša|2005|p=24}}

The activity of the Catholic Church was limited, while the Ottomans preferred the Orthodox Church because Catholicism was the faith of Austria, the Ottoman enemies, while Orthodoxy was common in Bosnia, and thus it was more acceptable to the Ottomans. In the first 50 years of Ottoman rule, many Catholics fled from Bosnia.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=73}} A number of Catholics also converted to Orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=76}} Franciscans were only Catholic priests to be active in Bosnia. Before the Ottomans arrived in Bosnia, there was 35 Franciscan monasteries in Bosnia and four in Herzegovina. Some monasteries were destroyed and some were converted to mosques.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In the 1680s there were only 10 Franciscan monasteries left in Bosnia. The Catholic Church in Bosnia divided its administration into two dioceses, one was the Croatian Bosnia diocese, part which was not conquered by the Ottomans, and other was [[Bosna Srebrena]] diocese.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=74}}

Between 1516 and 1524, a planned persecution and forced Islamization of Catholics occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=70}} In that year, Franciscan monasteries in [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]], [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Fojnica]], [[Kreševo]] and [[Konjic]], and later in [[Mostar]]. It is believed that during that time, some 100,000 Croats converted to Islam. In 1528 the Ottomans conquered [[Jajce]] and [[Banja Luka]], thus destroying the Croatian defence line on [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] river. After that conquest, Croatia reduced to around 37,000&amp;nbsp;km². During the 18th century, Turkish rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina started to weaken, and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] their rule rapidly decreased; the Ottoman Empire lost its demographic, civilization, and other reserves for military and territorial expansion, while the Austrian Empire, as the rest of the European countries, gained them.

From 1815 to 1878 the Ottoman's authority in Bosnia and Herzegovina was decreasing. After the reorganization of the Ottoman army and abolition of the [[Janissary|Jannisaries]], Bosnian nobility revolted, led by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who wanted to establish autonomy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to stop any further social reforms. During the 19th Century, various reforms were made in order to increase freedom of religion which sharpened relations between of Catholics and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon, economic decay would happen and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] influence from Europe came to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the state administration was very disorganized and the national conscience was very strong among the Christian population, the Ottoman Empire lost control over Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 19 June 1875 Catholic Croats, led by Don [[Ivan Musić]],{{sfn|Grandits|Clayer|Pichler|2011|p=121}} revolted because of high taxes in West Herzegovina. Their goal was to subordinate Bosnia to the rule of the Emperor of Austria, respectively King of Croatia. During the revolt, for the first time Bosnian Croats used the flag of Croatia.{{sfn|Klaić|1878|p=98}} Soon after, the Orthodox population in East Herzegovina also revolted, which led to the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovina Uprising]]. The Ottoman authorities were unable to defeat the rebels, so Serbia and Montenegro took advantage of this weakness and attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1876, soon after the [[Russian Empire]] did the same. The Turks lost the war in 1878, and this resulted in over 150,000 refugees who went to Croatia.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|p=366}} After the [[Congress of Berlin]] was held in same year, Bosnia and Herzegovina was transferred to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empire.{{sfn|Herb|Kaplan|2008|p=1529}}

===Austria-Hungary===
Even after the fall of the Ottoman rule, the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided.{{sfn|Klaić|1878|p=72}} In the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia]], Croatian politicians strived for the unification of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] with Croatia. Another ambition of Croatian politicians was to incorporate the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] into the Kingdom of Croatia. The Habsburg Governor [[Béni Kállay]] resorted to co-opt religious institutions. Soon, the Austrian Emperor gained support to name Orthodox metropolitans and Catholic bishops and to choose Muslim hierarchy.{{sfn|Bilandžić|1999|p=35}} The first Catholic archbishop was [[Josip Stadler]].{{sfn|Maletić|1993|p=419}} Both apostolic vicarates, Bosnian and Herzegovinian, were abolished, and instead three dioceses were founded; Vrhbosna diocese with a seat in Sarajevo, Banja Luka diocese with a seat in Banja Luka and Mostar-Duvno diocese with a seat in Mostar    .

At the time, Bosnia and Herzegovina was facing a Habsburg attempt at modernization. Between 180,000 and 200,000 people inhabited Bosnia and Herzegovina, the majority were Croats, Serbs, Muslims and in smaller percentages [[Slovenes]], [[Czechs]] and others.{{sfn|Bilandžić|1999|p=35}} During this period, the most significant event is Bosnian entry to European political life and the shaping of ethnic Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina into a modern nation. At the end of the 19th century, Bosnian Croats founded various reading, cultural and singing societies, and at the beginning of the 20th century, a new Bosnian Croat intelligentsia played a major role in the political life of Croats. The Croatian Support Society for Needs of Students of Middle Schools and High Schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina was founded in 1902, and in 1907 it was merged with Croatian Society for Education of Children in Craft and Trade, also founded in 1902, into [[HKD Napredak|Croatian Cultural Society Napredak]] (Progress). Napredak educated and gave scholarships to more than 20,000 students. Students of Napredak were not only Bosnian Croats, but also Croats from other regions.{{sfn|Dizdar|2004|p=1081}}

Kallay tried to unify all Bosnians into a single nation of Bosniaks, but he failed to do so after Bosnians created their national political parties.{{sfn|Bilandžić|1999|p=35}} Before the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, the [[Croat People's Union]] (HNZ) become a political party; its ideology was very similar to that of the [[Croatian-Serbian Coalition]] in Croatia. In 1909, Stadler opposed such a policy and founded a new political party, the [[Croat Catholic Association]] (HKU), an opponent of the secular HNZ. HKU emphasized clerical ideals and religious exclusivity.{{sfn|Donia|Van Antwerp Fine|1994|p=104}} However, Bosnian Croats mostly supported the secular nationalist policy of the HNZ.{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=105}} HNZ and Muslim Nation Organization formed a coalition which ruled the country from 1911 until the dissolution of the Bosnian parliament in 1914.{{sfn|Donia|Van Antwerp Fine|1994|p=104-109}}

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
[[File:Stjepan Radic in Mostar, 1925.jpg|thumb|People gathered waiting for [[Stjepan Radić]] to arrive in Mostar in 1925]]
After World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the internationally unrecognized [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which existed between October and December 1918. In December 1918, this state united with the Kingdom of Serbia as [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]],{{sfn|Klemenčić|Pratt|Schofield|1994|p=7}}which was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929.{{sfn|Lukic|Lynch|1999|p=57}} This new state was characterized by [[Serbian nationalism]], and was a form of "[[Greater Serbia]]". Serbs held control over armed forces and politics of the state.{{sfn|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=237}} With around 40% Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian leadership of the state wanted to implement a Serbian hegemony in this region. Bosnian Croats constituted around a quarter of the total Bosnian population, but they did not have a single municipality president.{{sfn|Bilandžić|1999|p=82}} The regime of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was characterized by limited parliamentarism, drastic elective manipulations and later [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]]'s [[6 January Dictatorship]], state robbery present outside Serbia and political killings ([[Milan Šufflay]], [[Ivo Pilar]]) and corruption. Yugoslavia was preoccupied with political struggles, which led to the collapse of the state after [[Dušan Simović]] organized a coup in March 1941 and after which Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia.

King Alexander was killed in 1934, which led to the end of dictatorship. In 1939, faced with killings, corruption scandals, violence and the failure of centralized policy, the Serbian leadership agreed a compromise with Croats. On 24 August 1939, the president of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], [[Vladko Maček]] and [[Dragiša Cvetković]] made an agreement (''Cvetković-Maček agreement'') according to which [[Banovina of Croatia]] was created on territory of [[Sava Banovina|Sava]] and [[Littoral Banovina]] and on districts of [[Dubrovnik]], [[Šid]], [[Brčko (town)|Brčko]], [[Ilok]], [[Gradačac]], [[Derventa]], [[Travnik]] and Fojnica. Around 30% of the present-day territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina become part of Banovina of Croatia. Those parts had a Croatian majority.

===World War II===
{{Further|World War II in Yugoslavia|Independent State of Croatia}}
[[File:Oslobođena teritorija za vreme drugog zasedanja AVNOJ-a.jpg|thumb|Territory under the control of Yugoslav Partisans in November 1943]]
After the collapse of Yugoslavia amidst [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|German and Italian invasion]] in April 1941, the Axis puppet state which encompassed the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) under the radical Croat nationalist ustaša regime was established. Bosnian Croats were divided, as some supported NDH, some actively opposed it by joining or supporting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], while others chose to wait, not attracted either by fascist ustaše or communist-led resistance. After ustaše campaign of [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|ethnic cleansing]] and terror, targeting [[World War II persecution of Serbs|Serbs]], [[Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], and [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], a brutal civil war ensued. Ustaše regime also persecuted any opponents or dissidents among Bosnian Croats, especially [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communists]], pre-war members of the now-banned [[Croatian Peasant Party]], and those connected with the partisan resistance. Ustaše executed many Bosnian Croats, for instance, resistance fighters and supporters Jakov Dugandžić, Mostar's Ljubo Brešan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vuksfrj.se/istorija/heroji/B/bresan_blaza_ljubo.htm|title=bresan_blaza_ljubo|website=vuksfrj.se|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 19-year old [[Gimnazija Mostar|Mostar gymnasium]] student Ante Zuanić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegram.hr/price/kako-mi-je-herceg-bosna-unistila-grad/|title=Kako mi je Herceg-Bosna unistila grad|last=Markovina|first=Dragan|date=2017-11-28|work=Telegram.hr|access-date=2018-02-26|language=hr-HR}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a prominent Mostar CPP member Blaž Slišković (in [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mandić, Hrvoje.

Families of Bosnian Croats who left to join the partisan resistance were usually interned or sent to [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|concentration camps]] by ustase authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mandić, pp 725-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Bosnian Croats joined the partisan movement, fighting against the Axis forces and ustaše regime. Some of them included [[Order of the People's Hero|people's heroes]] such as [[Franjo Kluz]], Ivan Marković Irac, Stipe Đerek, Karlo Batko, Ante Šarić "Rade Španac" and others. From the very beginning of the uprising against the Axis, many Bosnian Croats became commanders of partisan units, even as the units were predominantly Serb ones (e.g., Josip Mažar-Šoša, Ivica Marušić-Ratko etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=M4poAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Ivan+Markovi%C4%87+Irac&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ir2vSjJey3&amp;sig=j5UkXJOlhSdpl-y2oyXmwjnGsXc&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuu86ZmMbZAhUKCewKHcHgCxc4ChDoAQg9MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Ivan%20Markovi%C4%87%20Irac&amp;f=false|title=The Bosnian Muslims in the Second World War|last=Hoare|first=Marko Attila|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199365432|language=en|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1977, 8.8% of Bosnian recipients of veteran's pensions were Croats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoare|first=Marko|year=2002|title=Whose is the Partisan movement?

The territory that partisans liberated and managed to keep under their control from November 1942 to January 1943 (dubbed the ''[[Bihać Republic|Republic of Bihać]]'') included all of rural [[West Herzegovina Canton|Western Herzegovina]] west of Neretva and Široki Brijeg, including Livno. [[Livno]] and its area, under partisan control from August to October 1942, was very important for Bosnian Croat resistance, as key [[Croatian Peasant Party|CPP]] members Florijan Sučić and Ivan Pelivan joined the resistance and mobilized many other Croats.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (2014), pp 38-9&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Croats' representatives, among which Mostar lawyer [[Cvitan Spužević]], also actively participated in the provisional assembly of the country, [[ZAVNOBiH]] (State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). ZAVNOBiH proclaimed the statehood of Bosnia-Herzegovina and equality of Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs in the country in its historic session in 1943.

After the partisans liberated most of Yugoslavia and NDH collapsed in May 1945, some NDH soldiers and civilians retreated to the British-occupied zone in Austria near [[Bleiburg]]. Many of them were killed in reprisals by the Yugoslav partisans in an event remembered as the [[Bleiburg massacre]].{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=155}} In the closing stages of the war and the immediate aftermath, some Bosnian Croats who previously supported the ustaše regime or were merely perceived as potential opponents of the new communist Yugoslavia were persecuted or executed (notably, [[Franciscan Province of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Herzegovina friars]]).

Total casualties and losses of Bosnian Croats in the WWII and the aftermath are estimated at 64-79.000.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Vladimir. "[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/151801 Human losses of Croats in World War II and the immediate post-war period caused by the Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland) and the Partizans (People's Liberation Army and the partizan detachment of Yugoslavia/Yugoslav Army) and the Yugoslav Communist authoritities. Numerical indicators]." ''Review of Croatian history''8.1 (2013): 77-121.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Žerjavić]], 17.000 Bosnian Croats died in partisan ranks, 22.000 in NDH forces, while 25.000 lost their lives as civilians; of civilians, almost ¾ or 19.000 died as a result of Axis terror or in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|ustaše concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, p 117, Table 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
{{Main|Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
After the war, [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] became one of the 6 constitutive republics of Socialist Yugoslavia. Intensive state campaign of nationalization of property, followed by industrialization and urbanization variously affected Bosnian Croats. While some centers and areas prospered, other rural areas underwent depopulation and urban flight, as well as (most notably western Herzegovina) high rates of emigration to the Western world.

Office holders usually rotated among the three ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 1980s, many Bosnian Croat politicians were in high positions - for instance, [[Ante Marković]], [[Branko Mikulić]], and [[Mato Andrić]].

===Bosnian War===
[[File:D-30J howitzer.jpg|thumb|HVO soldier fires a 122mm Howitzer D-30J]]

Citizens of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] voted for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|referendum]] that was held between 29 February and 1 March 1992.{{sfn|Nohlen|Stöver|2010|p=330}} The referendum question was: "Are you in favor of a sovereign and independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, a state of equal citizens and nations of Muslims, Serbs, Croats and others who live in it?"{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=237}} Independence was strongly favoured by Bosniak and Bosnian Croat voters, but the referendum was largely boycotted by [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]]. The total turn out of voters was 63.6% of which 99.7% voted for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Nohlen|Stöver|2010|p=334}}

On 5 April 1992, Serb forces started the [[Siege of Sarajevo]]. On 12 May, [[Yugoslav People's Army]] left Bosnia and Herzegovina and left most of the arms to the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], headed by [[Ratko Mladić]]. The first unit to oppose Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina was the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) founded by [[Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 18 December 1991.&lt;ref name=HSPCepin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsp-cepin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=56 |title=HOS - Povijest |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Croatian Party of Rights|HSP]] Čepin |language=Croatian |accessdate=16 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231514/http://hsp-cepin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=56 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] established its own force, the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) on 8 April 1992. HVO consisted from 20-30% of Bosniaks who joined HVO because local Muslim militias were unable to arm themselves.{{sfn|Mulaj|2010|p=53}} Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was founded on 18 November 1991 as a community of municipalities where majority of population were Croats. In its founding acts, Herzeg-Bosnia had no separatist character. The [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] was declared by the Bosnian Croat leadership as a temporary region, which after war ended, would again become part of a united Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=313}}
[[File:DaytonAgreement.jpg|thumb|[[Slobodan Milošević]], [[Alija Izetbegović]] and [[Franjo Tuđman]] signing the [[Dayton agreement|Dayton Peace Accords]] on 14 December 1995]]
At the beginning of the [[Bosnian War]], Bosnian Croats were first to organize themselves, especially Croats in western Herzegovina who were already armed. At the end of May 1992, Croats launched a counter-offensive, liberating Mostar after a month of fighting.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=311-312}} Also, in central Bosnia and Posavina, Croatian forces stopped the Serbian advance, and in some places they repelled the enemy. On 16 June 1992, President of Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]] and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Alija Izetbegović]] signed an alliance according to which, Bosnia and Herzegovina legalized the activity of Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council on its territory. Bosnian Croat political leadership and the leadership of Croatia urged Izetbegović to form a [[confederation]] between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, but Izetbegović denied this since he tried to represent Serbian interests as well as those of Bosniaks and Croats. The Bosnian Croat leadership was irritated by Izetbegović's neutrality, so [[Mate Boban]] threatened to pull back the HVO from actions in Bosnia.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=313}} Since the UN implemented embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina on the import of arms, Bosniak and Croat forces had difficulties fighting Serbian units, which were supplied with arms from the Middle East, just before the outbreak of war. However, after Croat and Bosniak forces reorganized in late May 1992, the Serbian advance was halted and their forces mostly remained in their positions during the war.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=315}} The tensions between Croats and Bosniaks started on 19 June 1992, but the real war began in October.

The [[Croat-Bosniak War]] was at its peak during 1993. In March 1994, the Bosniak and Croat leadership signed the [[Washington agreement]], according to which, the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH)-controlled and HVO-controlled areas were united into the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. After the Washington agreement was signed, the [[Croatian Army]], HVO and ARBiH liberated southwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina in seven military operations. In December 1995, the Bosnian War ended with the signing of the [[Dayton agreement]]. However, the same agreement caused problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was largely ineffective. According to the information published by the Research and Documentation Centre in Sarajevo, 7,762 Croats were killed or missing. From the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 230,000 Croats were expelled, while from territory of [[Republika Srpska]], 152,856 Croats were expelled.&lt;ref name=Kresic&gt;{{cite news |title=Iz Federacije prognano 230.000, iz RS-a 152.856 Hrvata katolika |author=Krešić, Zoran |url=http://www.vecernji.ba/vijesti/iz-federacije-prognano-230-000-rs-a-152-856-hrvata-katolika-clanak-387375 |newspaper=[[Večernji list]] |date=15 March 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprising 15.43% of the country's population, Croats have been unequally spread across the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This has further been reflected and reinforced by the post-1995 [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|political division]] of the country. Currently, according to the [[2013 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|2013 census]], 91% of them live in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], while just 5.4% and 3.2% live in [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Brčko District]], respectively. In RS, Croat share in the entity population is just 2% (29,645), while in Brčko it stands at 20.7% (17,252). On the other hand, in the Federation Croats form 22.4% of the entity population. Four out of ten Federation's cantons have Croat majority. All Croat-majority municipalities are located in this entity as well.

===Municipalities===

However, Croats are further variously spread in the Federation itself. Most of the municipalities with a clear Croat majority form two compact regions. One is in the southwest of the country, along the border with Croatia, from Kupres and Livno in the northwest along [[West Herzegovina Canton|West Herzegovina]] to Ravno in the southeast ([[Široki Brijeg]], [[Ljubuški]], [[Livno]], [[Čitluk]], [[Tomislavgrad]], [[Čapljina]], [[Posušje]], [[Grude]], [[Prozor-Rama]], [[Stolac]], [[Neum]], [[Kupres]], [[Ravno, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ravno]]). Around 40% of country's and 45% of Federation's Croats live here. The second is [[Posavina Canton]] in the north ([[Orašje, Bosnia|Orašje]], [[Odžak]], [[Domaljevac-Šamac]]). This canton's share in the Croat population is 6%. Other Croat-majority or -plurality municipalities are enclaves in [[Central Bosnia Canton|Central Bosnia]] and around Zenica ([[Dobretići]], [[Vitez]], [[Busovača]], [[Kiseljak]], [[Usora Municipality|Usora]], [[Kreševo]], [[Žepče]]). In ethnically mixed [[Jajce]] and [[Novi Travnik]] in Central Bosnia, Croats form around half of the population.

In [[Mostar]] area, Croats comprise the plurality of the population both in the municipality (48.4%) and the city itself (49%).&lt;ref name="mostar"&gt;[http://www.statistika.ba/?show=12&amp;id=11410&lt;nowiki&gt; Mostar municipality], 2013 census results, statistika.ba&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mostar is the largest city in [[Herzegovina]] and the city with the largest Croat population in the country (51,216 in the area and 29,475 in the urban district). Croats comprise an overwhelming majority in the western part of both the city and the entire municipality.&lt;ref name="mostar"/&gt;

Croats comprise 41% of the population in [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Uskoplje]], a third in [[Vareš]] and [[Pelagićevo]], and a quarter in [[Glamoč]] and [[Donji Žabar]]. In [[Bosansko Grahovo|Grahovo]], Croats make around 15% of the population.

In addition to that, 762 Croats form the plurality (40.4%) in an ethnically diverse small town Glamoč.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistika.ba/?show=12&amp;id=10359 Glamoc], census of 2013, statistika.ba&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Cantons]]===
There are 4 Croat-majority cantons and in total 6 cantons in which Croats form more than 10% of the population.

====Medieval Bosnia and Ottoman Empire====
[[File:BosniaEthnic1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1910. Croats in blue]]
Some estimates state that the population of medieval Bosnia, was between 850,000 - 900,000 inhabitants, of which 750,000 were Catholics (85,22%), 80,000 were Bogomils (9,09%) and 50,000 were Orthodox Christians (5,68%). During the Ottoman rule, the number of Catholics decreased drastically. When the Turks conquered Bosnia in 1463, according to their data, they took 100,000 Catholics into captivity and 30,000 Catholic boys to serve as janissaries. In 1558/59, in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, there were 360,000 Catholics (57%), 220,000 Muslims (34%) and 55,000 Orthodox Christians (9%). Many Catholics fled to Venetian or Habsburg-ruled lands. In 1624, there was around 450,000 Muslims (67%), 150,000 Catholics (22%) and 75,000 Orthodox Christians (11%).{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=71}} In 1776, according to Klaić, there were around 50,000 Catholics in Bosnia. However, the Turkish censuses were biased, and they only numbered the houses and later exclusively included the male population.{{sfn|Klaić|1878|p=71}} Throughout this period, Catholic majority persisted in the southwest of the country (western Herzegovina), parts of central Bosnia, and Posavina, mostly in rural areas.

During [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian rule]] (1878–1918), the number and share of Croats started to slowly increase. Croats from Croatia moved to the country to work in the austro-Hungarian administration or as teachers, doctors and officers. According to the Croatian author [[Vjekoslav Klaić]], at the beginning of the period, in 1878, there were 646,678 Orthodox Christians (respectively Serbs, 48.4%), 480,596 Muslims (35.9%), 207,199 Catholics (respectively Croats, 15.5%) and 3,000 Jews (0.2%).{{sfn|Klaić|1878|p=72}} In 1895, Bosnia and Herzegovina had 1,336,091 inhabitants, of which there was 571,250 Orthodox Christians (42.76%), 492,710 Muslims (36,88%), 265,788 Catholics (19.89%), 5,805 Jews (0.43%) and 53 others (0.04%).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The slow process of nation-building on one hand and the austro-Hungarian administration's downplaying ethnic differences and nationalism while trying to keep [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatian]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] influence on the country at bay on the other hand make it difficult to assess the actual ethnic allegiance at this period.

The main characteristic of the ethnic policy of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (1918–1941) was a Serbian attempt to implement Serbian hegemony and to serbianize rest of the population.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} According to the 1931 census, Bosnia and Herzegovina had 2,323,787 inhabitants of which Serbs made 44.25%, Muslims 30.90%, Croats 23.58% and others made 1.02% of the total population.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

====Communist Yugoslavia====
The first Yugoslav census recorded a decreasing number of Croats; from the first census in 1948 to the last one from 1991, the percentage of Croatians decreased from 23% to 17.3%, even though the total number increased. According to the 1953 census, Croats were in the majority in territories which became part of Banovina of Croatia in 1939. Their total number was 654,229, that is 23,00% of total Bosnian population. According to the 1961 census, Croats made up 21.7% of total population, and their number was 711,660. After that, districts were divided into smaller municipalities.

According to the 1971 census, Croats were 20.6% of total population, and their number was 772,491. According to the 1981 census, Croats made up 18.60% of total population, and their number was 767,247. In comparison to the 1971 census, for the first time the percentage of Croats was below 20%, and after 1981, their percentage continued to fall. From 1971 to 1991, the percentage of Croats fell due to emigration into Croatia and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Bosniaks or Muslims"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosniaks or Muslims |url=http://www.seep.ceu.hu/issue22/dimitrovova.pdf |publisher=Southeast European Politics Online| work=www.seep.ceu.hu |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academician Dalibor Brozovic interview - Hrvatska riječ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academician Dalibor Brozovic interview |url=http://www.ex-yupress.com/hrvrijec/hrvrijec6.html |publisher=Hrvatska riječ |accessdate=2009-07-11 |at="chapter title: Important Croats Deserve Special Treatment - (second question) second paragraph" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628064445/http://ex-yupress.com/hrvrijec/hrvrijec6.html |archivedate=June 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the fall in population percentage is only absent in western Herzegovina municipalities where Croats account for more than 98% of the population. According to the 1991 census, Croats were 17.3% of the total population, and their number was 755,895.

====Bosnian War====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
The total number of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to fall, especially after the Bosnian War broke out in 1992. Soon, an exodus of Bosnian Croats occurred when a large number of Croats were expelled from central Bosnia and Posavina. According to the 1996 census, made by UNHCR and officially unrecognized, there were 571,317 Croats in the country (14.57%). In the territory of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Herzeg-Bosnia]], the percentage of Croats slightly changed, although, their total number was reduced.

[[File:Napredak Palace Construction Board.jpg|thumb|The Napredak Palace Board members in 1911]]
The first education institutions of Bosnian Croats were monasteries, of which the most significant were those in [[Kreševo]], [[Fojnica]], [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]] and [[Tolisa]], and later monasteries in Herzegovina, of which most significant are those in [[Humac, Ljubuški|Humac]] and [[Široki Brijeg]]. The most significant people workingfor the elementary education of Bosnian Croats in the 19th century were [[Ivan Franjo Jukić]] and [[Grgo Martić]], who founded and organized elementary schools throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In 1887, many elementary schools were founded in Bosnia and Herzegovina along with the [[Order of Sisters of St. Francis]], whose classes were led methodologically and professionally, so Bosnian Croat schools were, at the end of Ottoman era and beginning of Austrian-Hungarian occupation, the same as elementary schools in rest of Europe. The educational system of Bosnia and Herzegovina during communism was based on a mixture of nationalities and the suppression of Croat identity. With the foundation of Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia, Bosnian Croat schools took the educational system from Croatia.

At the same time, University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar was renamed to [[University of Mostar]] with official Croatian language. This university is the only one in Bosnia and Herzegovina to use Croatian as official language. After signing the Dayton accords, jurisdiction over education in Republika Srpska was given to RS Government, while in Federation, jurisdiction over education was given to the cantons. Municipalities with Croat majority or significant minority, schools with Croatian language as official one also exist, while on territories were there is only a small number of Croats, Catholic centres perform education. Another education institutes are [[HKD Napredak]], Scientific Research Institute of University of Mostar, Croatian Lexicographic Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Institute for Education in Mostar.

==Language==
{{main|Croatian language}}
Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]], a standardized variety of [[Serbo-Croatian language]], spoken by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even though most of them speak in the [[Ijekavian]], also the norm among Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs, [[Ikavian]] is also used and was widespread in larger parts of Bosnia.

It remains the permanent aspiration of the Croatian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Eleanor: [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-s-largest-bosniak-party-reject-croat-entity-demands-01-30-2017#sthash.MroANztc.dpuf "Bosniaks Slap Down Calls for Bosnian Croat Entity"], Balkan Insight, January 30th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties===
Currently, there are several Croatian political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many corresponding to parties within Croatia itself. The [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (HDZ BiH), [[Croatian Democratic Union 1990]] (HDZ 1990) are the most popular parties.

HDZ was founded in 1990 and is major political parties among Bosnian Croats, being the most powerful during the Bosnian War (1992–1995) and existence of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (1991–1994). HDZ is [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]], conservative and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeanist]] political party.{{sfn|Čović|2011|p=5}}

HDZ 1990 is a split party of the Croatian Democratic Union, founded in 2006, however, their ideology is very similar to one of the HDZ. HDZ 1990 is also Christian democratic and pro-Europeanist.&lt;ref name=HDZ1990&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hdz1990.org/category/hdz1990/statut/ |title=Statut Hrvatske demokratske zajednice 1990 |author=[[Božo Ljubić|Ljubić, Božo]] |date=30 October 2009 |work= |publisher=Croatian Democratic Union 1990 |language=Croatian |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian Party of Rights was also very popular during the Bosnian War, even among Bosniaks since its military unit, [[Croatian Defence Forces]], had a lot of both, Croat and Bosniak soldiers. HSP was founded also in 1990. HSP is a far-right, nationalist political party.&lt;ref name=HSP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsp-bih.ba/povijest.html |title=Povijest |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina |language=Croatian |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233921/http://hsp-bih.ba/povijest.html |archivedate=6 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open issues ===

A conference was held in [[Neum]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on October 27 and 28th 2005, under the title '''Constitutional-law position of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina - language, education, culture and media''' ({{lang-hr|Ustavno-pravni položaj Hrvata u BiH - jezik, obrazovanje, kultura i mediji}}) was

It was organized by the [[University of Mostar]] and the [[Croatian Society of Arts and Science]]. It produced the ''Declaration of the constitutional-law position of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina''. (The words "constitutional-law position" refer to the position of [[Croats]] as one of the [[constitutive nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|President]] [[Ivo Miro Jović]] sponsored the conference and it also received support from many other organizations.

The Declaration produced several demands about the equal treatment of the Croatian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most significant of these was the creation of three republics within the nation:

* "Starting from the scientific cognitions and practical experiences, we think, that in consultation with the representatives of Serbian and Bosniak people and International Community, we should organize Bosnia and Herzegovina as the compound federal state, composed of three federal units and with three levels of government. Since only the republic, as a democratic form of the rule of nations, includes and guarantees the highest level of democracy, political, cultural and every other autonomy, we pledge for the establishment of three republics for three sovereign nations, which is in full accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Pact on the civil, social and cultural rights to the equality of all nations regardless of their numerousness."

The Declaration upheld the right to learn Croatian in school as well as the need for preservation of their people's culture. Another important issue was the need for a Croat [[television station]] within the country.

===Art===
{{see also|Croatian art}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
In the area near the [[Neretva]] river, a hellenized Illyrian tribe, the Daorsi, spread cultural influences from Greece. Their capital [[Daorson]] on [[Oršćani]] near [[Stolac]] is today the most significant center of antic culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The complex of the terraced shrine near Gradac near [[Posušje]], built in 183, was dedicated to a dead Roman Emperor, [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Late Roman art in Bosnia and Herzegovina was characterized by the building of vilas, Christian mausoleums, basilicas and oratories like Vila "Mogorjelo" near [[Čapljina]] (early 4th century). The influence of [[romanesque architecture]] arrived in Bosnia and Herzegovina across Croatia, but it was never completely accepted, only its elements were used. Such buildings are St. Luke's Tower in [[Jajce]] (15th century) or motives of ''stećak'' tombstones. Valuable manuscripts of Bosnian origin occur at this time.

[[Hrvoje's Missal]] is the most significant art of the medieval Bosnian Croats, written in the 15th century. During the 15th and 16th century, Bosnia and Herzegovina was under Ottoman rule, which destroyed the influence of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], the impact of which was only present in [[Franciscan]] monasteries in Visoko, [[Kreševo]], [[Fojnica]], and [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]]. The first Bosnian Croat painters were educated in European academies in [[Vienna]], [[Munich]], [[Prague]], [[Krakow]], [[Budapest]] and [[Paris]]. Their education was funded by [[HKD Napredak]]. The most famous Bosnian Croat painters are [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Karlo Mijić]], [[Branko Radulović]] and [[Petar Šain]]. Statuary was reduced to the memorial portraits, of which the most famous is that of [[Robert Frangeš Mihanović]] and ''Sputani genije'', a statue on the grave of [[Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević]] built by [[Rudolf Valdec]]. After World War II, the Association of Artists of Bosnia and Herzegovina was founded along with the Painting State School and Sarajevo Art Gallery. Architectural Regionalism is seen in the 1970s on buildings such as department store ''Razvitak'' in Mostar (1970) and in Jajce (1976). The best example of Functionalism is the multiple award-winning hotel ''Ruža'' in Mostar (1979).

Bosnian Croat literature consists of works written in the Croatian language by authors who originated from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered part of [[Croatian literature]]. It consists of pre-Ottoman literature (first written monuments, texts of Bogomils, diplomatic and law documents, manuscripts on tombstones), [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena|Bosna Srebrena]] literature (prayer books, catechisms, collections of sermons, biographies of saints, monastery yearbooks, first historical works, poems and memoirs, travel books, grammars of Latin and Croatian languages and lexicographic works), national awakening literature (the foundation of various associations, reading rooms, libraries in which writing courses were held), the literature of Bosnian Muslims (various Bosniak writers made a significant impact on Croatian literature and were influenced by other Croat authors) and modern Bosnian Croat literature.

[[File:Gusle Zelovo kod Sinja Jukić 260109.jpg|thumb|Gusle]]
Traditional music of Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina is related to [[Ganga (music)|ganga]], [[klapa]], [[gusle]], [[tamburica]] and [[šargija]]. Those ways of singing and musical instruments are part of Bosnian Croat national identity. Ganga, klapa and gusle are mostly widespread on territory of western Herzegovine, even though those can be seen in eastern Herzegovina and Bosnia. Tamburica is popular in [[Posavina]] and central Bosnia. Šargija is widespread in northern Bosnia, from [[Posavina]] to [[Olovo]] and [[Vareš]].

With mixture of traditional and modern music, modern Bosnian music was represented by [[Indexi]], [[Bijelo dugme]], [[Ambasadori]] and others. The most known singers of modern Bosnian Croat music are [[Đorđe Novković]], [[Željko Bebek]] and [[Jura Stublić]]. Some new known singers include [[Mate Bulić]], [[Ivan Mikulić]], [[Nikša Bratoš]], [[Ivana Marić]], the [[Feminnem]] girl band, and others.

There are two significant music festivals, ''Melodije Mostara'' (Melodies of Mostar) and ''Etnofest Neum'' on which musicians from Croatia also participate. Alongside traditional music, some other musical genres also developed, like [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], [[House (music)|house]] and [[techno]].

The parish of [[Međugorje]] is a significant [[Marian shrine]] which attracts approximately one million visitors annually. It became a popular site of religious pilgrimage due to reports of apparitions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] to six local Catholics in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medjugorje.org/overview.htm|title=Overview of Medjugorje|website=www.medjugorje.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand hotel and hostel beds are available for religious tourism.

'''Daniel Toroitich arap Moi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oː|iː}} {{respell|MOH|ee}}) (born 2 September 1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VO4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=Daniel+Toroitich+arap+Moi+2+september&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA98uwt5DUAhWIa5oKHSkFBycQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Daniel%20Toroitich%20arap%20Moi%202%20september&amp;f=false|title=Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders|last=East|first=Roger|last2=Thomas|first2=Richard J.|date=2014-06-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317639404|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Kenya]]n politician who served as the second [[President of Kenya]] from 1978 to 2002. Through popular agitation and external pressures, he was forced to allow multiparty elections in 1991; he led his party, [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]], to victory in the 1992 and 1997 elections. Prior to becoming President, he served as the third [[Vice President of Kenya]] from 1967 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/moi/profile.htm |title=Profile of Daniel arap Moi |author=[[State House (Kenya)|State House]] |publisher=[[State House (Kenya)|State House]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705160330/http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/moi/profile.htm |archivedate=2014 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moi is popularly known to Kenyans as ''Nyayo'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "footsteps", as he often said he was following in the footsteps of the first President, [[Jomo Kenyatta]]. He also earned the [[sobriquet]] "Professor of Politics" due to his long rule of 24 years, the longest in Kenyan history to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moi: the ruthless 'professor of politics' |author= |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/15/1034561157417.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=16 October 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and entry into politics==
Moi was born in Kurieng'wo village, [[Sacho]] division, [[Baringo County]], and was raised by his paternal uncle Kimoi Chebii following the early death of his father. He is of the [[Tugen people|Tugen]] sub-group of the [[Kalenjin people]]. After completing his secondary education at [[Kapsabet High School]], he attended [[Tambach Teachers Training College]] in the [[Keiyo District]]. He worked as a teacher from 1946 until 1955.

In 1955 Moi entered politics when he was elected Member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley. He was the chosen replacement of Dr. John ole Tameno, the former representative who had had to quit due to heavy drinking and suspected connections to the freedom movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sde.co.ke/thenairobian/article/2001237797/the-vet-who-often-sent-debt-reminders-to-president-jomo-kenyatta-handed-mzee-moi-the-mantle|title=The vet who often sent debt reminders to President Jomo Kenyatta  ‘handed’ Mzee Moi the mantle|last=Editor|website=Standard Digital News|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1957 Moi was re-elected Member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley. He became Minister of Education in the pre-independence government of 1960–1961.

In 1960 he founded the [[Kenya African Democratic Union]] (KADU) with Ronald Ngala to challenge the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) led by Jomo Kenyatta. KADU pressed for a federal constitution, while KANU was in favour of centralism. The advantage lay with the numerically stronger KANU, and the British government was finally forced to remove all provisions of a federal nature from the constitution.

==Vice-Presidency==
After Kenya gained independence on 12 December 1963, Kenyatta convinced Moi that KADU and KANU should be merged to complete the process of decolonisation. Accordingly, KADU dissolved and joined KANU in 1964. The only real challenge to KANU's dominance came from the [[Kenya People's Union]], starting in 1966. That party was banned in 1969, and from that point onward Kenya was a de facto [[one-party state]] dominated by the [[Kikuyu people|Kĩkũyũ]]-[[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] alliance. However, with an eye on the fertile lands of the Rift Valley populated by members of Moi's [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] tribe, Kenyatta secured their support by first promoting Moi to Minister for Home Affairs in 1964, and then to [[Vice-President of Kenya|Vice-President]] in 1967. As a member of a minority tribe Moi was also an acceptable compromise for the major tribes. Moi was elected to the [[National Assembly of Kenya|Kenyan parliament]] in 1963 from [[Baringo North Constituency|Baringo North]]. From 1966 until his retirement in 2002 he served as the [[Baringo Central Constituency|Baringo Central]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Wanyiri Kihoro (2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080228121210/http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf Politics and Paliamenterians in Kenya 1944–2007] Center for Multiparty Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Moi faced opposition from the Kikuyu elite known as the [[Kiambu Mafia]], who would have preferred one of their own to be eligible for the presidency. This resulted in an attempt by the constitutional drafting group to change the constitution to prevent the vice-president automatically assuming power in the event of the president's death. The presence of this [[Order of succession|succession]] mechanism might have led to dangerous political instability if Kenyatta died, given his advanced age and perennial illnesses. However, Kenyatta withstood the political pressure and safeguarded Moi's position.

==Presidency==
[[File:Kenya presidential standard DANIEL ARAP MOI.svg|thumb|left|Presidential Standard of Daniel Toroitich arap Moi]]

When Jomo Kenyatta died on 22 August 1978, Moi became acting president. Per the Constitution, a special presidential election for the balance of Kenyatta's term was held on [[Kenyan presidential election, 1978|8 November]], 90 days later. Moi was the sole candidate.

In the beginning, Moi was popular, with widespread support all over the country. He toured the country and came into contact with the people everywhere, which was in great contrast to Kenyatta's imperial style of governing behind closed doors. However, political realities dictated that he would continue to be beholden to the Kenyatta system which he had inherited intact, including the nearly dictatorial powers vested in the presidency. Despite his popularity, Moi was still too weak to consolidate his power. From the beginning, anticommunism was an important theme of Moi's government; speaking on the new President's behalf, Vice-President [[Mwai Kibaki]] bluntly stated, "There is no room for communists in Kenya."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norman and Rodger Yeager. ''Kenya: The Quest for Prosperity'' (second edition). Page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 1982, lower-level Air Force personnel, led by Senior [[Private (rank)|Private]] Grade-I [[Hezekiah Ochuka]] and backed by university students, [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|attempted a coup d'état]] to oust Moi. The putsch was quickly suppressed by military and police forces commanded by Chief of General Staff [[Mahamoud Mohamed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Society|year=1992|publisher=Nyamora Communications Limited|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MctAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day it appears that the attempt by two independent groups to seize power contributed to the failure of both, with one group making its attempt slightly earlier than the other.

Moi took the opportunity to dismiss political opponents and consolidate his power. He reduced the influence of Kenyatta's men in the cabinet through a long running judicial enquiry that resulted in the identification of key Kenyatta men as traitors. Moi pardoned them but not before establishing their traitor status in the public view. The main conspirators in the coup, including Ochuka were sentenced to death, marking the last judicial executions in Kenya. He appointed supporters to key roles and changed the constitution to formally make KANU the only legally permitted party in the country. However, as mentioned above, Kenya had been a ''de facto'' one-party state since 1969. Kenya's academics and other intelligentsia did not accept this and the universities and colleges became the origin of movements that sought to introduce democratic reforms. However, Kenyan [[secret police]] infiltrated these groups and many members moved into exile. Marxism could no longer be taught at Kenyan universities. Underground movements, e.g. Mwakenya and Pambana, were born.

Moi's regime now faced the end of the [[Cold War]], and an economy stagnating under rising oil prices and falling prices for agricultural commodities. At the same time the West no longer dealt with Kenya as it had in the past, when it was viewed as a strategic regional outpost against communist influences from Ethiopia and Tanzania. At that time Kenya had received much foreign aid, and the country was accepted as well governed with Moi as a legitimate leader and firmly in charge. Western allies deliberately overlooked the increasing degree of [[political repression]], including the use of [[torture]] at the infamous [[Nyayo House]] torture chambers. Some of the evidence of these torture cells was eventually to be exposed in 2003 after [[Mwai Kibaki]] became President.&lt;ref&gt;News From Africa, March 2003: [http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_1282.html Stunning revelations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710205059/http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_1282.html |date=10 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a new thinking emerged among Western policymakers after the end of the Cold War, and as Moi increasingly was viewed as a [[despotism|despot]]. Foreign aid was withheld pending compliance with economic and political reforms. One of the key conditions imposed on his regime, especially by the United States through fiery ambassador [[Smith Hempstone]], was the restoration of a [[multi-party system]]. Despite his own lack of enthusiasm for the  multiparty system, Moi managed to win over his  party who were pro-single party, single-handedly convincing the delegates at a convened  KANU conference at Kasarani in December 1991.

Moi won elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by political violence on both sides. Moi skilfully exploited Kenya's mix of ethnic tensions in these contests, especially smaller tribes' ever-present fear of domination by the larger tribes. In the absence of an effective and organised opposition, Moi had no difficulty in winning. Although it is also suspected that electoral fraud may have occurred, the key to his victory in both elections was a divided opposition. He always won the election with a minority vote of about 30% against the opposition who had a combined 70%, which was nonetheless of no consequence because it was subdivided among the opposition who had failed to unite.

==Criticism and corruption allegations==
{{see also|Corruption in Kenya|Goldenberg scandal}}

In 1999 the findings of NGOs like [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="huri-01"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kenya | work=Amnesty International Report 2000 | url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/kenya/document.do?id=AF95118DFE41371C802568E400729F0A | accessdate=12 December 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130051054/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/kenya/document.do?id=AF95118DFE41371C802568E400729F0A | archivedate=30 November 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a special investigation by the United Nations&lt;ref name="huri-02"&gt;{{cite web | title=UN Special Rapporteur | work=Misc. reports concerning abuse of human rights in Kenya | url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=U1343Q6367847.5490&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=power&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=bib&amp;ri=&amp;index=.SW&amp;term=kenya&amp;matchopt=0%7C0&amp;oper=and&amp;x=8&amp;y=13&amp;aspect=power&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=&amp;matchopt=0%7C0&amp;oper=and&amp;index=.TN&amp;term=torture&amp;matchopt=0%7C0&amp;oper=and&amp;index=.AW&amp;term=&amp;matchopt=0%7C0&amp;ultype=&amp;uloper=%3D&amp;ullimit=&amp;ultype=&amp;uloper=%3D&amp;ullimit=&amp;sort= | accessdate=12 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published which indicated that [[human rights abuse]]s were prevalent in Kenya under the Moi regime.

Reporting on corruption and human rights abuses by British reporter [[Mary Anne Fitzgerald]] from 1987–88 resulted in her being vilified by the government and finally deported. Moi was implicated in the 1990s [[Goldenberg scandal]] and subsequent cover-ups, where the Kenyan government subsidised exports of gold far in excess of the foreign currency earnings of exporters. In this case, the gold was smuggled from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], as Kenya has negligible gold reserves. The Goldenberg scandal cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country's annual GDP.

Half-hearted inquiries that began at the request of foreign aid donors never amounted to anything substantial during Moi's presidency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Although it appears that the peaceful transfer of power to [[Mwai Kibaki]] may have involved an understanding that Moi would not stand trial for offences committed during his presidency, foreign aid donors reiterated their requests, and Kibaki reopened the inquiry. As the inquiry has progressed, Moi, his two sons, Philip and Gideon (now a Senator), and his daughter, June, as well as a host of high-ranking Kenyans, have been implicated. In testimony delivered in late July 2003, Treasury Permanent Secretary [[Joseph Magari]] recounted that, in 1991, Moi ordered him to pay Ksh34.5&amp;nbsp;million ($460,000) to Goldenberg, contrary to the laws then in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Africa/1499.cfm Kenya: Corruption Scandal] William Karanja, World Press Review correspondent. From the October 2003 issue of World Press Review (Vol. 50, No. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, Moi was found by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to have taken a bribe from a Pakistani businessman, to award a monopoly of duty-free shops at the country's international airports in Mombasa and Nairobi. The businessman, Ali Nasir, claimed to have paid Moi US$2 million in cash to obtain government approval for the World Duty Free Limited investment in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asil.org/ilib/2007/02/ilib070220.html International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815002919/https://www.asil.org/ilib/2007/02/ilib070220.html |date=15 August 2007 }} World Duty Free Company Ltd. v. Kenya (4 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2007, WikiLeaks published a secret report that laid bare a web of shell companies, secret trusts and frontmen that his entourage had used to funnel hundreds of millions of pounds into nearly 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_looting_of_Kenya_under_President_Moi The looting of Kenya under President Moi].

Retrieved on 6 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Moi was constitutionally barred from running in the 2002 presidential elections. Some of his supporters floated the idea of amending the constitution to allow him to run for a third term, but Moi preferred to retire, choosing [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], the son of Kenya's first President, as his successor. However, [[Mwai Kibaki]] was elected President by a two to one majority over Kenyatta, which was confirmed on 29 December 2002. Kibaki was then wheelchair bound, having narrowly escaped death in a road traffic accident on the campaign trail.

[[Image:Moi and Bush.jpg|thumb|right|235px|President Moi with President [[George W. Bush]] in New York in 2001.]]

Moi handed over power in a poorly organised ceremony that had one of the largest crowds ever seen in Nairobi in attendance. The crowd was openly hostile to Moi.

After leaving office in December 2002, Moi lived in retirement, largely shunned by the political establishment. However, he still retained some popularity with the masses, and his presence never failed to gather a crowd. He spoke out against a proposal for a new constitution in 2005; according to Moi, the document was contrary to the aspirations of the Kenyan people. After the proposal was defeated in a [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2005|November 2005 constitutional referendum]], President Kibaki called President Moi to arrange for a meeting to discuss the way forward.

On 25 July 2007, Kibaki appointed Moi as special peace envoy to [[Sudan]], referring to Moi's "vast experience and knowledge of African affairs" and "his stature as an elder statesman". In his capacity as peace envoy, Moi's primary task was to help secure peace in southern Sudan, where an agreement, signed in early 2005, was being implemented. At the time, the Kenyan press speculated that Moi and Kibaki were planning an alliance ahead of the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|December 2007 election]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

He sharply criticised the two opposition [[Orange Democratic Movement]] factions, arguing that they were tribal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007114915/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143973644 Moi supports Kibaki’s re-election], ''The Standard'' (Kenya), 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas Barasa and Benjamin Muindi, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200708280714.html "Kenya: Moi Endorses Kibaki for Second Term"], ''The Nation'' (Nairobi), 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moi owns the [[Kiptagich Tea Factory]], established in 1979, which has been involved in controversy. In 2009 the factory was under threat of being closed down by the government during the [[Mau Forest]] evictions.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 22 December 2009: [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/829452/-/view/printVersion/-/10qvtnt/-/index.html MP vows to fight Moi eviction bid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Daniel arap Moi married Lena Moi (born Helena Bommet) in 1950, but they separated in 1974, before his presidency. Lena died in 2004. Daniel arap Moi has eight children, five sons and three daughters.

[[Squadron Leader]] '''Sir David John Checketts''', {{small|[[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]]}} (born 1930) was [[Office of the Prince of Wales|Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales]] 1970-1979.

He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1948 and received flying training at RATG [[Bulawayo]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1948-1950.

'''Ding Zilin''' ({{zh|c=丁子霖}}; born December 20, 1936 or January 1, 1939&lt;ref&gt;The year of birth provided by the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] is 1939. Ding Zilin said in a telephone interview on October 9, 2006 that she was born in Shanghai on December 20, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a retired professor of philosophy and the leader of the political pressure group [[Tiananmen Mothers]].

==Biography==
Ding, born in Shanghai on December 20, 1936, was professor of philosophy at [[Renmin University of China]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[[Perry Link]], [http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_zilin.html "60 years of Asian heroes – Ding Zilin"], [[Time Magazine]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband, Jiang Peikun (蔣培坤), was head of the Aesthetics Institute at the university.

Ding's seventeen-year-old son, [[Jiang Jielian]] (蔣捷連), was one of the first to be killed&lt;ref name=list&gt;[http://www.89-64.org/html/victims155.htm List of the confirmed deaths], Ding Zilin, 89-64.org, accessed May 17, 2007 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[People's Liberation Army]] crushed the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]].  He left the family home in defiance of the curfew. Accounts vary of what happened next. Eyewitnesses had told her that her son was shot and was left to bleed to death on the night of June 3, 1989.&lt;ref name=tirade&gt;Staff reporter, [http://www.scmp.com/article/593028/ma-lik-didnt-experience-massacre "Ma Lik didn't experience the massacre"], Page A3, [[South China Morning Post]], May 16, 2007, retrieved May 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Ding says he was shot through the heart by riot police on the way to [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; He was rushed to the [[Beijing Children's Hospital]], where he was pronounced "[[Dead on arrival]]".&lt;ref name=list/&gt;

Following her son's death, Ding said she attempted suicide six times.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

In August 1989, she met another bereaved mother, and found a commonality within the self-help group, which continued growing.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[[Rebecca MacKinnon]], [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/ding.zilin.html "Ding Zilin: an advocate for the dead"], [[CNN]], June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She formed a network of some 150 other families who had lost sons and daughters during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; and this group became known as "[[Tiananmen Mothers]]". Ever since that day, she has been asking the government to apologize for the deaths. She and some others have faced imprisonment, house-arrest, phone-tapping and constant surveillance.

In 1991, after an interview she gave to [[ABC News]], the government prevented her and her husband from carrying out their work or research, and were barred from publishing domestically. [[Chinese Communist Party|Party]] membership was revoked. In addition, she was detained for more than 40 days. She was forced into early retirement.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Since her release, she was under close supervision by the authorities. Harassment continued when on September 9, 1994, she was arrested in front of the University and held by police for two hours, for having had published an article in the foreign media "hurtful to the people".&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;[http://www.alliance.org.hk/prison/?lang=c&amp;viewid=1715 Democracy movement activists database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212508/http://www.alliance.org.hk/prison/?lang=c&amp;viewid=1715 |date=September 27, 2007 }}, [[The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]], Retrieved May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1995, she and her husband were arrested in [[Wuxi]] on August 18 and incarcerated until September 30, allegedly on "economic matters", and were denied visitors.&lt;ref name=alliance/&gt; In 1996 Ding's husband was forced to retire early.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Since February 28, 2000, she has been under 24-hour surveillance by the authorities.&lt;ref name=alliance/&gt;

In 2004, she and other Tiananmen Mothers were put under [[house arrest]] shortly before the 15th anniversary of the massacre to prevent them from holding any public memorial or protest.&lt;ref name=fifteen&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/print_article.cfm?article_id=1986&amp;dont=yes "Fifteenth Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre"], ''[[World Press]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; She was allegedly told by a senior official that a review of the June 4, 1989 crackdown was "out of the question."&lt;ref name=fifteen/&gt; In 2006, [[Time magazine]] selected her as one of the ''60 Asian heroes''.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

She has been collecting the names of those who were shot dead by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in Beijing around June 4, 1989. At the end of June 2006, Ding was able to confirm 186 deaths through her own efforts&lt;ref name=list/&gt; despite repeated harassment by the authorities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} However, it should be noted, that upon close inspection of the cause of deaths, not all individuals on Ding's list died directly at the hands of the army.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; For example, at least one of the individuals on the list had committed suicide after the uprising had been squashed.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;

She and her husband have been under house arrest as of May 24, 2004.&lt;ref name=alliance/&gt; On February 8, 2007, she won the [[Vasyl Stus Award|Vasyl Stus "Freedom-to-Write" Award]] for her book ''Looking for the June 4 victims''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacehall.com/news/gb/intl/2007/02/200702080056.shtml 独立笔会自由写作奖在国际笔会香港会议上颁发] February 8, 2007 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was ordered to leave Beijing for a forced vacation during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2008/08/25/chinas-rulers-stay-tough-despite-the-olympics-hoopla|title=China's Rulers Stay Tough Despite the Olympics Hoopla|last=Mooney|first=Paul|date=August 25, 2008|work=[[US News and World Report]]|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement that [[Liu Xiaobo]] had won the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]], and his dedication of his prize to those who died in 1989, dissident groups reported on October 18 she and her husband may have been taken into custody by police, and have not been seen or heard from for four days; their phones have been cut off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]] in Beijing (October 18, 2010). "Activists condemn anti-Liu crackdown", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Since her son's death in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], Ding Zilin has been fighting for justice for the victims. Her activism has drawn international attention and association with recognizable human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[HRIC]] (Human Rights in China). New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization.&lt;ref&gt;Tong Yi. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/16/opinion/china-s-latest-theft.html "China’s Latest Theft"]. ''The New York Times'', February 16, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Ding Zilins efforts Amnesty International has a political campaign to put pressure on the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens. Amnesty applauded the Chinese government in June 2007 for allowing Ding Zilin, her husband and two other dead citizens’ kin to light candles west of Tiananmen Square.&lt;ref name="amnesty.ca"&gt;[http://www.amnesty.ca/atrisk/index.php/ding-zilin/ "Ding’s Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127071010/http://www.amnesty.ca/atrisk/index.php/ding-zilin/ |date=November 27, 2010 }}. Amnesty International Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the minimal recognition from the government Amnesty urges Chinese authorities to allow open debate and more public memorials in order to help improve Chinas human rights record and the image of Beijing on the international stage.&lt;ref name="amnesty.ca"/&gt; Ding Zilin and human rights groups demand the Chinese government to stop labelling the student protest with political jargon such as “counter-revolutionary rebellion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Saiget. [http://chinapost.com.tw/print/259216.htm ‘Tiananmen mothers’ demand open dialogue]. ''[[The China Post]]'', June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization ===
[[Tiananmen Mothers]] is an activist group of people who lost family members on June fourth. Spearheaded by Ding Zilin they have collected over one hundred names of individuals who openly state that they lost a loved one on that day. Over the past twenty years in public letters published by multiple sources including [http://www.hrichina.org/en HRIC], [[The China Post]], [[The New York Times]], [[Time Magazine]] and Amnesty International, the Tiananmen Mothers continue to publish a list of demands:

* The right to mourn peacefully and in public
* The right to accept humanitarian aid from organizations and individuals inside and outside China
* No more persecution of June Fourth victims, including those injured in the massacre and the families of the dead
* The release of all people still suffering in prison for their role in the 1989 protests
* A full, public accounting for the June Fourth Massacre, ending the impunity for the perpetrators of this crime&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China. {{cite web |url=http://www.hrichina.org/public |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221023534/http://www.hrichina.org/public/ |archivedate=December 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Disobedience ===
Despite her multiple arrests and constant surveillance, [[civil disobedience]] is Ding Zilin's daily choice, she never stops using her voice to speak out in non-violent ways against the violations of human rights committed by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. On April 5, 2004 ''Time'' magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China who want the government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jakes. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,607848,00.html "Mother Courage"]. ''Time'' Magazine, April 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Author of ''[[Beijing Coma]]'', [[Ma Jian (writer)|Ma Jian]] also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 ''New York Times'' article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off [[Chang'an Avenue]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Ma Jian. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/opinion/04ma.html "China’s Grief, Unearthed"]. ''The New York Times'', June 4, 2008. Translated by Flora Drew&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== Statements ===
In June 2009 in a [[Newsweek]] interview with Ding Zilin she condemns the actions and legacy of many historical figures. She questions why [[Deng Xiaoping]] was not brought to justice like the notorious former Cambodian [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;Melinda Liu. [http://newsweek.com/2009/06/01/not-an-isolated-incident "Not an Isolated Incident: Twenty years after her teenage son’s death in Tiananmen Square, Ding Zilin waits for an apology she says will never come"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130130194406/http://newsweek.com/2009/06/01/not-an-isolated-incident |date=January 30, 2013 }}. ''[[Newsweek]]'', June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ding Zilin uses her son's story to spread the message of [[human rights in China]] and feels it should be a central political issue. She was disappointed when [[US Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] said that close [[Sino-American Relations]] should not be overshadowed by [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; She does, however, acknowledge that in 1995 Hillary Clinton helped to get her released from one of her many incarcerations. Ding Zilin condemns former President [[Bill Clinton]] for
attending a ceremonial red carpet appearance in Tiananmen Square:“With the blood of the students still wet, the wounds still there, unhealed, how could Clinton step onto the red carpet to review Chinese troops?”.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; Human Rights Watch claims that on May 26, 1994, President Clinton said China had not made significant progress on many of the issues outlined in his 1993 [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]], however, a tough human rights policy was hampering the ability of the US to pursue other interests&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/china-98/visit.htm "President Clinton's Visit To China In Context"], Human Rights Watch, Retrieved May 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups like HRIC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch describe in their philosophies to be critical of governments gaining international power with bad human rights records.{{clarify|date=May 2013}}

Ding Zilin has dedicated the remainder of her life after her son's death to being a human rights [[activist]]. She has most recently spoken out in support of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner Liu Xiaobo.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; Her continued campaigning relies on support from fundraising organizations like Fill the Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fillthesquare.org/eng/step1.php Fill The Square: Support the Tiananmen Mothers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Chefou is believed to have the led [[Tongo Tongo ambush|the ambush]] of a convoy of U.S. and Nigerien troops in October 2017 that left four American and five Nigerien soldiers dead. Formerly a [[Fula people|Fulani]] herder in the Niger-Mali border region, he initially took up arms to battle [[Tuareg]] cattle thieves.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=Reuters | title=How a Herdsman Became the Jihadist Who Killed US Soldiers in Niger | website=VOA | date=2017-11-12 | url=https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-herdsman-jihadist-us-soldiers/4111534.html | access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Yang | first=Mackenzie | title=December 11th, 2017 - Vol. 190, No. 24 - Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, South Pacific | website=TIME.com | date=2017-12-11 | url=http://time.com/magazine/south-pacific/5042943/december-11th-2017-vol-190-no-24-asia-europe-middle-east-and-africa-south-pacific/ | access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', U.S. troops were attempting to locate Chefou in October 2017 when at least fifty militants purportedly led by him attacked them near the village of [[Tongo Tongo]] in southwestern Niger.&lt;ref name="Callimachi Cooper Schmitt Blinder 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Callimachi | first=Rukmini | last2=Cooper | first2=Helene | last3=Schmitt | first3=Eric | last4=Blinder | first4=Alan | last5=Gibbons-Neff | first5=Thomas | title=‘An Endless War’: Why 4 U.S. Soldiers Died in a Remote African Desert | website=The New York Times | date=2018-02-20 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/17/world/africa/niger-ambush-american-soldiers.html | access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chefou is believed by African officials to be one of the main propagators of unrest in the [[Sahel]] region. Niger's defense minister labeled him a "terrorist" and a "bandit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://independent.ng/anti-terror-war-america-dumped-nigeria-niger/|title=You are being redirected...|website=independent.ng|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faisal bin Sultan al-Duwaish''' ([[Arabic]]: فيصل بن سلطان الدويش, c. 1882 – d. 1931) was a [[Sheikh|Prince]] of the [[Mutair]] tribe and one of the [[Ikhwan]] leaders, who assisted Ibn Saud in the [[unification of Saudi Arabia]].

Al-Duwaish commanded the [[Kuwait-Najd Border War|attack]] on [[Kuwait]] Defense and Security Forces in Hamdh 16 May 1920. Later, in 1920, he led [[Battle of Jahra|an attack]] by the Ikhwan on Kuwait.

He was injured at the 1929 [[battle of Sabilla]], fled Arabia and later surrendered to the British in Kuwait. Sultan was pardoned by his former ruler [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud of Nejd and Hejaz]] (later of Saudi Arabia), but was later jailed in Riyadh where he died in 1931 suffering from an [[aneurysm]].

[[Image:coriolanus.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Veturia]] at the Feet of Coriolanus'' by Gaspare Landi]]
'''Gaius Marcius''' ('''Caius Martius''') '''Coriolanus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒr|i|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|n|ə|s}}) was a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] general who is said to have lived in the 5th century BC. He received his [[toponymy|toponymic]] [[cognomen]] "Coriolanus" because of his exceptional valor in a Roman siege of the [[Volsci]]an city of [[Corioli]]. He was subsequently exiled from Rome, and led troops of Rome's enemy the [[Volsci]] to besiege Rome.

In later ancient times, it was generally accepted by historians that Coriolanus was a real historical individual, and a consensus narrative story of his life appeared, retold by leading historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. More recent scholarship has cast doubt on the historicity of Coriolanus, with some portraying him as either a wholly legendary figure or at least disputing the accuracy of the conventional story of his life or the timing of the events.&lt;ref name=Lendering/&gt;

According to Plutarch, his ancestors included prominent patricians such as [[Censorinus]] and even an early King of Rome.

The story is the basis for the tragedy of ''[[Coriolanus]]'', written by [[William Shakespeare]], and a number of other works, including Beethoven's ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'' (based not on Shakespeare but on the play ''Coriolan'' by [[Heinrich Joseph von Collin]]).

==Consensus biography==
[[File:The Mother of Corolanus pleads for her son.gif|thumb|The Mother of Coriolanus pleads for her son]]

===Siege of Corioli===
Coriolanus came to fame as a young man serving in the army of the consul [[Postumus Cominius Auruncus]] in 493 BC during the [[Roman-Volscian wars#Roman reprisals 493 BC|siege]] of the Volscian town of Corioli. While the Romans were focused on the siege, another Volscian force arrived from [[Antium]] (modern [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]]&lt;ref&gt;Paola Brandizzi Vittucci, ''Antium: Anzio e Nettuno in epoca romana'', Roma, Bardi, 2000 {{ISBN|88-85699-83-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and attacked the Romans, and at the same time the soldiers of Corioli launched a sally. Marcius held watch at the time of the Volscian attack. He quickly gathered a small force of Roman soldiers to fight against the Volscians who had sallied forth from Corioli. Not only did he repel the enemy, but he also charged through the town gates and then began setting fire to some of the houses bordering the town wall. The citizens of Corioli cried out, and the whole Volscian force was dispirited and was defeated by the Romans. The town was captured, and Marcius gained the cognomen Coriolanus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#33|2.33]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict and exile===
In 491 BC, two years after Coriolanus' victory over the Volscians, Rome was recovering from a grain shortage.  A significant quantity of grain was imported from [[Sicily]], and the senate debated the manner in which it should be distributed to the commoners.  Coriolanus advocated that the provision of grain should be dependent upon the reversal of the pro-plebeian political reforms arising from the [[First secessio plebis in 494 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#34|2.34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The senate thought Coriolanus' proposal was too harsh.  The populace were incensed at Coriolanus' proposal, and the tribunes put him on trial.  The senators argued for the acquittal of Coriolanus, or at the least a merciful sentence.  Coriolanus refused to attend on the day of his trial, and he was convicted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#35|2.35]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defection to the Volsci===
{{Main|Roman-Volscian wars#Volscian invasion led by Coriolanus in 491-488 BC}}

Coriolanus fled to the Volsci in exile.  He was received and treated kindly, and resided with the Volscian leader [[Attius Tullus Aufidius]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Plutarch's account of his defection tells that Coriolanus donned a disguise and entered the home of Aufidius as a [[supplication|supplicant]].

Coriolanus and Aufidius then persuaded the Volscians to break their truce with Rome and raise an army to invade.  Livy recounts that Aufidius tricked the Roman senate into expelling the Volsci from Rome during the celebration of the [[Ludi Romani|Great Games]], thereby stirring up ill-will among the Volsci.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#37|2:37-38]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coriolanus and Aufidius led the Volscian army against Roman towns, colonies and allies.  Roman colonists were expelled from [[Circeii]].  They then retook the formerly Volscian towns of [[Satricum]], [[Longula (ancient Volscian Town)|Longula]], [[Pollusca]] and [[Corioli]].  Then the Volscian army took [[Lavinium]], then [[Corbio]], [[Vitellia (ancient Latin town)|Vitellia]], [[Trebia (ancient Latin town)|Trebia]], [[Lavici]] and [[Pedum]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#39|2:39]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From there the Volsci marched on Rome and besieged it.  The Volscians initially camped at the [[Cluilian trench]], five miles outside Rome, and ravaged the countryside.  Coriolanus directed the Volsci to target plebeian properties and to spare the patricians'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The consuls, now [[Spurius Nautius Rutilus]] and [[Sextus Furius Medullinus (consul 488 BC)|Sextus Furius Medullinus Fusus]], readied the defences of the city.  But the plebeians implored them to sue for peace.  The senate was convened, and it was agreed to send supplicants to the enemy.  Initially ambassadors were sent, but Coriolanus sent back a negative response.  The ambassadors were sent to the Volsci a second time, but were refused entry to the enemy camp.  Next priests, in their regalia, were sent by the Romans, but achieved nothing more than had the ambassadors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Then Coriolanus' mother [[Veturia]] (known as Volumnia in Shakespeare's play) and his wife [[Volumnia (wife of Coriolanus)|Volumnia]] (known as Virgilia in Shakespeare's play) and his two sons, together with the matrons of Rome, went out to the Volscian camp and implored Coriolanus to cease his attack on Rome.  Coriolanus was overcome by their pleas, and moved the Volscian camp back from the city, ending the siege.  Rome honoured the service of these women by the erection of a temple dedicated to [[Fortuna]] (a female deity).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#40|2:40]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coriolanus' fate after this point is unclear, but it seems he took no further part in the war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

One version{{which|reason=This needs a cite, as it's not from Livy's version of the tale.|date=December 2014}} says that Coriolanus retired to Aufidius' home city of [[Antium]]. Coriolanus had committed acts of [[disloyalty]] to both Rome and the Volsci, and Aufidius raised support to have Coriolanus first put on trial by the Volscians, and then [[assassinate]]d before the trial had ended.

Plutarch's tale of Coriolanus' appeal to Aufidius is quite similar to a tale from the life of [[Themistocles]], a leader of the [[Athenian democracy]] who was a contemporary of Coriolanus. During Themistocles' [[exile]] from Athens, he travelled to the home of [[Admetus of Epirus|Admetus]], King of the [[Molossians]], a man who was his personal enemy. Themistocles came to Admetus in disguise and appealed to him as a fugitive, just as Coriolanus appealed to Aufidius. Themistocles, however, never attempted military retaliation against [[Classical Athens|Athens]].

==Modern scepticism==

[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Coriolanus Act V, Scene III edit2.jpg|thumb| Act V, Scene III of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]''. Engraved by James Caldwell from a painting by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]].]]
Some modern scholars question parts of the story of Coriolanus.&lt;ref name=Lendering&gt;{{cite web|last=Lendering|first=Jona|title=Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus|url=http://www.livius.org/man-md/marcius/coriolanus.html#Assessment|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is notable that accounts of Coriolanus' life are first found in works from the third century BC, some two hundred years after Coriolanus' life, and there are few authoritative historical records prior to [[Battle of the Allia|the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 BC]].  Whether or not Coriolanus himself is a historical figure, the saga preserves a genuine popular memory of the dark, unhappy decades of the early 5th century BC when the Volscians overran [[Old Latium|Latium]] and threatened the very existence of Rome.

==Cultural references==
Shakespeare's ''Coriolanus'' is the last of his "Roman plays". Its portrayal of the hero has led to a long tradition of political interpretation of Coriolanus as an anti-populist, or even [[proto-fascist]] leader. [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s version of ''[[Coriolanus (Brecht)|Coriolanus]]'' (1951) stresses this aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, John, ''The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects'', London: Methuen, 1959, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's play also forms the basis of the 2011 motion picture [[Coriolanus (film)|''Coriolanus'']], starring and directed by [[Ralph Fiennes]], in which Coriolanus is the protagonist.

[[Heinrich Joseph von Collin]]'s 1804 play ''Coriolan'' portrayed him in the context of German romantic ideas of the tragic hero. Beethoven's 1807 ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'' was written for a production of the von Collin play.

[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote a sequence of poems in 1931 entitled "Coriolan".

[[Steven Saylor]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]'' presents Coriolanus as a plebeian, the child of a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] mother and [[plebeian]] father. His attitudes toward the changes occurring in Rome during his lifetime are reflective of what has been described. He achieves Senatorial status thanks to his military valour and connections. When he calls for the abolition of the office of Tribune, he becomes a target of the plebeians and their representatives. He flees before the trial which would ruin him and his family socially and financially, and seeks the alliance with the Volsci described above. His military campaign against Rome is successful and his forces are approaching the walls of the city until the appeal of the Roman women, including his patrician mother and his wife. When he orders his troops to withdraw, he is killed by them.

''[[The 48 Laws of Power]]'' uses Coriolanus as an example of violating Law #4: "Always Say Less Than Necessary," citing his constant insulting of the plebeians as the reason for his exile.

'''George Hislop''' (June 3, 1927 &amp;ndash; October 8, 2005) was one of [[Canada]]'s most influential [[gay]] activists. He was one of the earliest openly gay candidates for political office in Canada, and was a key figure in the early development of [[Toronto]]'s gay community.

==Early career==
Hislop studied speech and drama at the Banff School of Fine Arts, graduating in 1949. He subsequently worked as an actor, and ran an [[interior design]] company with his partner, Ron Shearer.

==Activism==
In 1971, Hislop cofounded the [[Community Homophile Association of Toronto]], one of Canada's first organizations for gays and lesbians. On August 28, 1971, he was also an organizer of [[We Demand]], the first Canadian gay rights demonstration on [[Parliament Hill]]. He later played a significant role as a contact between one of the criminals and the police in the [[Emanuel Jaques]] murder case in 1977.

==Elections==
In 1980, Hislop ran for [[Toronto City Council]]. He won the support of then-[[Mayor of Toronto|Mayor]] [[John Sewell]], a move that contributed to Sewell's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/12/111307270.pdf Andrew H. Malcolm, "Toronto Voters Oust Mayor Known for Combativeness," November 12, 1980], accessed February 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto police association openly campaigned against both Sewell and Hislop in the election.  The following year, Hislop ran in the [[Ontario general election, 1981|1981 provincial election]] as an independent candidate in [[St. George (Ontario provincial electoral district)|St. George]] to protest against the [[1981 Toronto bathhouse raids]].  Hislop was himself charged as a result of these raids, as part-owner of the Barracks bathhouse.  He placed fourth with 2,677 votes (9.3% of the total), a strong finish for an independent candidate.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, Hislop remained active as a business owner and activist.

==Later life==
In 2003, Hislop was nominated for the [[Order of Ontario]] by [[George Smitherman]]. Also that year, Hislop was one of several gay activists who launched a [[class action]] lawsuit against the federal government. The government had extended [[Canada Pension Plan]] benefits to the surviving same-sex partners of deceased pensioners as of 1998, but the change was not retroactive to earlier deaths. Shearer had died in 1986, making Hislop ineligible for survivor benefits.

The suit aimed to have retroactive benefits extended back to the 1985 inclusion of gay and lesbian equality rights in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. On November 26, 2004, the lawsuit ended in victory for Hislop and his coplaintiffs, although the federal government subsequently filed a controversial appeal of the decision. The federal government lost this appeal on March 1, 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled in Hislop's favour.

Also in 2004, Hislop was the grand marshal of Toronto's [[Gay Pride Week|Pride parade]]. 

In 2005, Hislop was the first-ever recipient of the [[International Lesbian and Gay Law Association]]'s [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award]] in honour of his contributions to the advancement of LGBT equality in Canada, and was cited by federal [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Jack Layton]] as an important influence on Layton's support of LGBT issues. In August of that year, Hislop received his first pension cheque under the 2004 court decision. 

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that Hislop, who had [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[esophagus|esophageal]] [[cancer]], died on October 8 in Toronto Grace Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Cotroneo, "George Hislop, 78: 'Canada's official homosexual'". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an obituary notice, ''[[eye weekly|Eye Weekly]]'' referred to Hislop as "the unofficial mayor of the Toronto gay community".

In October 2005, just one week after his death, Hislop was posthumously awarded the inaugural Jonathan R. Steinert and Fernando G. Ferreiro Award, Canada's largest award for contributions to LGBT communities. The $12,500 award, established by the [[Lesbian and Gay Community Appeal Foundation]], would be given to Hislop's estate. 

A park in the city's [[Church and Wellesley]] neighbourhood is also named in Hislop's honour.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Out Toronto'' (Time Out Guides, 2005), 79, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ne3C6ZDElDsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp; available online], accessed February 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of his role as a significant builder of LGBT culture and history in Canada, a portrait of Hislop by artist Norman Hatton is held by the [[Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives]]' National Portrait Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clga.ca/npc/subject/50 "George Hislop 1927 - 2005"]. [[Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Tan''' (born October 25, 1981 in [[Penang]]), also known as '''Hannah T''' or '''Hannah Sarah Tan''', is a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] singer-songwriter, actress, model and television personality. She is half-Chinese and half-[[Kelabit people|Kelabit]]. She married Bryan Lee in 2014.

==Music career==
On Tan's debut music album, ''Crossing Bridges'', she collaborated with composers/writers [[Jorgen Elofsson]], [[Phil Thornalley]], [[Andrew Fromm]] and [[Chris Rojas]]. The album also contained three songs Tan personally wrote and composed. In 2007, she appeared on the Live Earth stage at Live and Loud KL 2007 before acts such as [[Elliott Yamin]], [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]] and [[Whitney Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaolintiger.com/2007/12/05/live-and-loud-2007-part-2-hannah-tan-live/ Live and Loud Part 2 - Hannah Tan]. (Dec. 5, 2007). ''ShaolinTiger.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="587">'''Hui pan-nationalism''' refers to the common identity among diverse communities of [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-speaking [[Muslim]]s (typically members of the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic-cultural group).

Hui pan-nationalism should be distinguished from nationalist sentiments by minority groups who are also Muslim such as those of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]].

'''Icelanders''' ({{lang-is|Íslendingar}}) are a [[North Germanic peoples|North Germanic]] [[ethnic group]] and [[nation]], native to [[Iceland]], mostly speaking the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minahan|2000|p=769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelanders established the country of Iceland in 930 A.D. when Althingi (Parliament) met for the first time. Iceland came under the reign of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish kings but regained full sovereignty and independence from the [[Danish monarchy]] on 1 December 1918, when Kingdom of Iceland was established. On 17 June 1944, the monarchy was abolished and the Icelandic republic was founded. The language spoken is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], and [[Lutheranism]] is the predominant religion. Historical and DNA records indicate that around 60 to 80 percent of the male [[Settlement of Iceland|settlers]] were of [[Norsemen|Norse]] origin (primarily from [[Western Norway]]) and a similar percentage of the women were of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] stock from [[Ireland]] and peripheral [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/08_00/Icelanders.shtml|title=Icelanders, a diverse bunch?|author=|date=|website=www.genomenewsnetwork.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027144231/http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/08_00/Icelanders.shtml|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1287529 | pmid=10931763 | volume=67 | issue=3 | title=Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic ancestry in the male settlers of Iceland | date=September 2000 | journal=Am.

Icelanders have had a [[History of Iceland|tumultuous history]]. Development of the island was slow due to a lack of interest from the countries controlling it for most of its history: [[Norway]], [[Denmark–Norway]], and ultimately [[Denmark]]. Through this time, Iceland had relatively little contact with the outside world.&lt;ref name="F5"&gt;Fiske ''et al.'', 1972, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For what it is worth; Icelandic fish were sold in most of Western Europe for centuries, and links with Britain and Ireland probably always existed. Basque and later French (Breton) sailors fished around Iceland, and a strong French presence was in east of Iceland for three centuries, particulary around the town of [[Fáskrúðsfjörður]]. German and Dutch merchendaries were present in earlier times. --&gt; The island became independent in [[Danish–Icelandic_Act_of_Union|personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark]] in 1918. Since 1944, Iceland has been a [[republic]], and Icelandic society has undergone a rapid modernisation process in the post-independence era.&lt;!-- How much is normally attributed to independence? All of Western Europe modernised at the same time. --&gt;

== History ==
{{main article|History of Iceland}}

Iceland is a geologically young land mass, having formed an estimated 20 million years ago due to [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]] on the [[Mid-Atlantic ridge]]. One of the last larger islands to remain uninhabited, the first human settlement date is generally accepted to be 874 AD, although there is some evidence to suggest human activity prior to the Norse arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Jónsson ''et al.'', 1991, pp. 17-23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial migration and settlement ===
{{main article|Settlement of Iceland}}
[[Image:Iceland in Europe.svg|220px|right|thumb|Map showing Iceland in northern Europe]]
The first Viking to sight Iceland was [[Gardar Svavarsson]], who went off course due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the [[Faroe Islands]]. His reports led to the first efforts to settle the island. [[Flóki Vilgerðarson]] (b. 9th century) was the first Norseman to sail to Iceland intentionally. His story is documented in the [[Landnámabók]] manuscript, and he is said to have named the island Ísland ([[Iceland]]). The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Germanic chieftain|chieftain]] named [[Ingólfur Arnarson]]. He settled with his family in around 874, at a place he named "Bay of Smokes", or [[Reykjavík]] in Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;Þórðarson, c. 1200&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ingólfur, and also in 874, another group of Norwegians set sail across the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] with their families, livestock, slaves, and possessions, escaping the domination of the first [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|King of Norway]], [[Harald Fairhair]]. They traveled 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (600&amp;nbsp;mi) in their [[Viking]] [[longship]]s to the island of Iceland. These people were primarily of Norwegian, [[Irish People|Irish]] or Gaelic Scottish origin. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the [[Icelandic sagas]], or descendants of a "group of Norsemen who had settled in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] and intermarried with Gaelic-speaking people".&lt;ref&gt;Fiske ''et al.'', 1972, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62% of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland, which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries, although comparable to the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]], while 37% is of Nordic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/iceland/icelandic_women.htm |title=Icelandic Women are of Scots descent |publisher=Electricscotland.lcom |date=2001-03-04 |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611071506/http://www.electricscotland.com/history/iceland/icelandic_women.htm |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20-25% of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin, with the rest being Nordic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676|title=Why people in Iceland look just like us|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929074900/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic Age of Settlement (Icelandic: ''Landnámsöld'') is considered to have lasted from 874 to 930, at which point most of the island had been claimed and the [[Althing|Alþingi]] ({{lang-en|Althing}}), the assembly of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], was founded at [[Þingvellir]].&lt;ref&gt;Þorgilsson, c. 1100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardship and conflict ===

[[Image:Rock of law  in Þingvellir.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Rock of law in [[Þingvellir]] was used to make speeches.]]
In 930, on the [[Þingvellir]] ({{lang-en|Thingvellir}}) plain near [[Reykjavík]], the chieftains and their families met and established the Alþingi, Iceland's first national [[Legislative Assembly|assembly]]. However, the Alþingi lacked the power to enforce the laws it made. In 1262, struggles between rival chieftains left Iceland so divided that [[King Haakon IV]] of Norway was asked to step in as a final arbitrator for all disputes, as part of the [[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Old Covenant]]. This is known as the [[Age of the Sturlungs]].&lt;ref&gt;Byock, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland was under Norwegian leadership until 1380, when the [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|Royal House of Norway]] died out. At this point, both Iceland and Norway came under the control of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]]. With the introduction of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, the Icelanders relinquished their [[autonomy]] to the crown, including the right to initiate and consent to legislation. This meant a loss of independence for Iceland, which led to nearly 300 years of decline: perhaps largely because Denmark and its Crown did not consider Iceland to be a [[colony]] to be supported and assisted. In particular, the lack of help in [[Defense (military)|defense]] led to constant [[Turkish Abductions|raids by marauding pirates]] along the Icelandic coasts.&lt;ref name="F5"/&gt;

Unlike Norway, Denmark did not need Iceland's fish and homespun wool. This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland's trade, and no new ships were built as a result. In 1602 Iceland was forbidden to trade with other countries by order of the [[Danish Government]], and in the 18th century climatic conditions had reached an all-time low since Settlement.&lt;ref name="F5"/&gt;

[[Image:Lakagigar Iceland 2004-07-01.jpg|220px|right|thumb|[[Laki]] erupted in 1783–84 with catastrophic consequences for Iceland.]]
In 1783–84 [[Laki (volcano)|Laki]], a [[Fissure vent|volcanic fissure]] in the south of the island, erupted. The eruption produced about 15&amp;nbsp;km³ (3.6&amp;nbsp;mi³) of [[basalt]] lava, and the total volume of [[tephra]] emitted was 0.91&amp;nbsp;km³.&lt;ref&gt;Global Volcanism Program, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Particulate|aerosols]] that built up caused a cooling effect in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The consequences for Iceland were catastrophic, with approximately 25-33% of the population dying in the [[famine]] of 1783 and 1784. Around 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle, and 50% of horses died of [[Skeletal fluorosis|fluorosis]] from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released.&lt;ref name="Stone, 2004"&gt;Stone, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  This disaster is known as the [[Mist Hardship]] (Icelandic: ''[[Móðuharðindin]]'').

In 1798–99 the Alþingi was discontinued for several decades, eventually being restored in 1844. It was moved to [[Reykjavík]], the capital, after being held at [[Þingvellir]] for over nine centuries.

=== Independence and prosperity ===
[[Image:JonSigurdssonStatue.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Statue of Jón Sigurðsson in [[Reykjavík]]]]
The 19th century brought significant improvement in the Icelanders' situation. A protest movement was led by [[Jón Sigurðsson]], a [[politician|statesman]], [[historian]], and authority on [[Icelandic literature]]. Inspired by the [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] currents from mainland Europe, Jón protested strongly, through political [[Magazine|journal]]s and self-publications, for 'a return to national consciousness' and for political and social changes to be made to help speed up Iceland's development.&lt;ref name="F6"&gt;Fiske ''et al.'', 1972, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, the [[Danish government]] relaxed the trade ban that had been imposed in 1602, and Iceland gradually began to rejoin Western Europe economically and socially. With this return of contact with other peoples came a reawakening of Iceland's arts, especially its [[literature]]. Twenty years later in 1874, Iceland was granted a constitution. Icelanders today recognize Jón's efforts as largely responsible for their economic and social resurgence.&lt;ref name="F6"/&gt;

Iceland gained full sovereignty and independence from Denmark in 1918 after [[World War I]]. It became the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. The King of Denmark also served as the King of Iceland but Iceland retained only formal ties with the Danish Crown. On 17 June 1944 the monarchy was abolished and a republic was established on what would have been Jón Sigurðsson's 133rd birthday. This ended nearly six centuries of ties with Denmark.&lt;ref name="F6"/&gt;

== Demographics and society ==
{{main article|Demographics of Iceland}}

=== Genetics ===
[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The last written records of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders are from a 1408 marriage in [[Hvalsey Church]] &amp;ndash; today the most well-preserved of the Norse ruins.]]
Due to their small founding population and history of relative isolation, Icelanders have often been considered highly genetically homogeneous as compared to other European populations. For this reason, along with the extensive genealogical records for much of the population that reach back to the [[settlement of Iceland]], Icelanders have been the focus of considerable [[genomics]] research by both [[biotechnology]] companies and academic and medical researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chadwick | first1 = R. | title = The Icelandic database—do modern times need modern sagas? | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7207 | pages = 441–444 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10445931 | pmc = 1127047 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7207.441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gísli Pálsson, 'The Web of Kin: An Online Genealogical Machine', in ''Kinship and Beyond: The Genealogical Model Reconsidered'', ed. by Sandra C. Bamford, James Leach, Fertility, Reproduction and Sexuality, 15 (Berghahn Books, 2009), pp. 84-110 (pp. 100-103).&lt;/ref&gt; It was, for example, possible for researchers to reconstruct much of the maternal genome of Iceland's first known black inhabitant, [[Hans Jonatan]], from the DNA of his present-day descendants partly because the distinctively African parts of his genome were unique in Iceland until very recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Anuradha Jagadeesan and others, 'Reconstructing an African Haploid Genome from the 18th Century', ''Nature Genetics'', 50(2) (2018), 199–205 {{DOI|10.1038/s41588-017-0031-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic evidence shows that most DNA lineages found among Icelanders today can be traced to the settlement of Iceland, indicating that there has been relatively little immigration since. This evidence shows that the founder population of Iceland came from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Scandinavia]]: studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[Y-chromosomes]] indicate that 62% of Icelanders' matrilineal ancestry derives from Scotland and Ireland (with most of the rest being from Scandinavia), while 75% of their patrilineal ancestry derives from Scandinavia (with most of the rest being from the Irish and British Isles).&lt;ref&gt;S. Sunna Ebenesersdóttir and others, 'Ancient Genomes from Iceland Reveal the Making of a Human Population', ''Science'' 360(6392) (2018), 1028–32 (p. 1028) {{DOI|10.1126/science.aar2625}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Iceland's historical isolation, the genetic makeup of Icelanders today is still quite different from the founding population, due to [[founder effects]] and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;Helgason ''et al.'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the mean Norse ancestry among Iceland's settlers was 56%, whereas in the current population the figure was 70%.&lt;ref&gt;S. Sunna Ebenesersdóttir and others, 'Ancient Genomes from Iceland Reveal the Making of a Human Population', ''Science'' 360(6392) (2018), 1028–32 (p. 1030) {{DOI|10.1126/science.aar2625}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have identified other ancestries, however. One study of [[mitochondrial DNA]], [[blood groups]], and [[isozyme]]s revealed a more variable population than expected, comparable to the diversity of some other Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Árnason ''et al.'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that a tiny proportion of samples of contemporary Icelanders carry a more distant lineage, which belongs to the [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|haplogroup C]]1e, which can possibly be traced to the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] around 14,000 years ago. This hints a small proportion of Icelanders have some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry arising from [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse colonization of Greenland and North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in Icelanders: Evidence of pre-Columbian contact? |author= Sigríður Sunna Ebenesardóttir et al., 2010 |date=10 November 2010|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21419 |pmid=21069749 |volume=144 |issue=1 |journal=Am.

=== Emigration ===

==== Greenland ====
{{main article|History of Greenland}}
[[Image:Gimli1 mb.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Gimli, Manitoba]], pop. 5,720 (Statistics Canada, 2011) is home to the largest concentration of Icelanders outside of Iceland.]]
The first Europeans to emigrate to and settle in [[Greenland]] were Icelanders who did so under the leadership of [[Erik the Red]] in the late 10th century [[Common Era|CE]] and numbered around 500 people. Isolated [[fjord]]s in this harsh land offered sufficient grazing to support cattle and sheep, though the climate was too cold for cereal crops. Royal trade ships from Norway occasionally went to Greenland to trade for walrus tusks and falcons. The population eventually reached a high point of perhaps 3,000 in two communities and developed independent institutions before fading away during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasson, pp. 405-406.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Papal legate|papal legation]] was sent there as late as 1492, the year [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] attempted to find a shorter spice route to Asia but instead encountered the Americas.

==== North America ====
{{see also|Immigration to the United States|History of immigration to Canada}}
According to the ''[[Saga of Eric the Red]]'', Icelandic immigration to North America dates back to [[Vinland]] circa 1006. The colony was believed to be short-lived and abandoned by the 1020s. &lt;ref&gt;Jackson, May 1925, pp. 680-681.&lt;/ref&gt;  European settlement of the region was not archeologically and historically confirmed as more than legend until the 1960s.  The former Norse site, now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], pre-dated the arrival of Colombus in the Americas by almost 500 years.

A more recent instance of Icelandic emigration to North America occurred in 1855, when a small group settled in [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, May 1925, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Icelandic colony formed in [[Washington Island, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonisland.com/visitors-guide/island-history-culture/ |title=Island History and Culture |publisher=Washington Island |date=1996 |accessdate=2016-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611124405/http://www.washingtonisland.com/visitors-guide/island-history-culture/ |archivedate=2016-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration to the United States and Canada began in earnest in the 1870s, with most migrants initially settling in the [[Great Lakes]] area. These settlers were fleeing [[famine]] and [[overcrowding]] on Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are sizable communities of Icelandic descent in both the United States and Canada. [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], in [[Manitoba]], Canada, is home to the largest population of Icelanders outside of the main island of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderhill, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
[[File:Retro Stefson - WAVES VIENNA2011 d.jpg|thumb|Unnsteinn Manuel Stefánsson, here playing with [[Retro Stefson]], is a prominent Icelander with a foreign background.]]
From the mid-1990s, Iceland experienced rising immigration. By 2017 the population of first-generation immigrants (defined as people born abroad with both parents foreign-born and all grandparents foreign-born) stood at 35,997 (10.6% of residents), and the population of second-generation immigrants at 4,473. Correspondingly, the numbers of foreign-born people acquiring Icelandic citizenship are markedly higher than in the 1990s, standing at 703 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Kristín Loftsdóttir, “[https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/njmr.2017.7.issue-2/njmr-2017-0012/njmr-2017-0012.pdf Being ‘the Damned Foreigner’: Affective National Sentiments and Racialization of Lithuanians in Iceland.]” ''Nordic Journal of Migration Research'' 7.2 (2017): 70–77 (p. 72) {{DOI|10.1515/njmr-2017-0012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20180301221616/https://www.statice.is/publications/news-archive/population/immigrants-and-persons-with-foreign-background-2017/ Immigrants and persons with foreign background 2017]' (16 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, Icelandic identity is gradually shifting towards a more [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] form.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar J.

== Culture ==
{{main article|Culture of Iceland}}

=== Language and literature ===
{{main article|Icelandic language}}
[[Image:Skírnismál-748-2v.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A poem from the ''Poetic Edda'']]
[[File:Laxdæla saga - Kjartan died on the lap of Bolli.jpg|right|thumb|Kjartan Ólafsson and [[Bolli Þorleiksson]], characters in [[Laxdæla saga]], written in the 13th century.]]
Icelandic, a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], is the official language of [[Iceland]] (''de facto''; the laws are silent about the issue). Icelandic has inflectional grammar comparable to [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], more closely to [[Old English]] and practically identical to [[Old Norse]].

Old [[Icelandic literature]] can be divided into several categories. Three are best known to foreigners: [[Eddic poetry]], [[skaldic poetry]], and [[saga literature]], if saga literature is understood broadly. Eddic poetry is made up of heroic and mythological poems. Poetry that praises someone is considered skaldic poetry or [[court poetry]]. Finally, saga literature is prose, ranging from pure [[fiction]] to fairly factual history.&lt;ref&gt;Lahelma ''et al.'', 1994–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Written Icelandic has changed little since the 13th century. Because of this modern readers can understand the [[Icelanders' sagas]]. The sagas tell of events in Iceland in the 10th and early 11th centuries. They are considered to be the best-known pieces of [[Icelandic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovgren, 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisourcepar|Edda|the Eddas.}}

The elder or ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', the younger or ''[[Prose Edda]]'', and the [[Icelanders' sagas|sagas]] are the major pieces of Icelandic literature. The ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' is a collection of poems and stories from the late 10th century, whereas the younger or ''[[Prose Edda]]'' is a manual of poetry that contains many stories of [[Norse mythology]].

=== Religion ===
{{main article|Religion in Iceland}}
[[Image:HusavikChurch.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Church in [[Húsavík]], Iceland]]
Iceland embraced [[Christianity]] in c. AD 1000, in what is called the ''[[Christianisation of Iceland|kristnitaka]]'', and the country, while mostly secular in observance, is still predominantly Christian culturally. The Lutheran church claims some 84% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Jochens, 1999, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt; While early Icelandic Christianity was more lax in its observances than traditional [[Catholicism]], [[Pietism]], a religious movement imported from Denmark in the 18th century, had a marked effect on the island. By discouraging all but religious leisure activities, it fostered a certain dourness, which was for a long time considered an Icelandic [[stereotype]]. At the same time, it also led to a boom in printing, and Iceland today is one of the most literate societies in the world.&lt;ref name="F6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Giudice, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

While Catholicism was supplanted by [[Protestantism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], most other world religions are now represented on the island: there are small Protestant Free Churches and Catholic communities, and even a nascent [[Islam in Iceland|Muslim community]], composed of both immigrants and local converts. Perhaps unique to Iceland is the fast-growing ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið|Ásatrúarfélag]]'', a legally recognized revival of the pre-Christian [[Nordic religion]] of the original settlers. According to the [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese of Reykjavík, there were only approximately 30 [[Jew]]s in Iceland as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Reykjavík, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[First Lady of Iceland]] [[Dorrit Moussaieff]] was an [[Israel]]i-born [[Bukharian Jew]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{main article|Icelandic cuisine}}

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:P1010018-minni.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Þorramatur'', Iceland's national food.]] --&gt;
Icelandic [[cuisine]] consists mainly of [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], and [[dairy]]. Fish was once the main part of an Icelander's [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] but has recently given way to meats such as [[beef]], [[pork]], and [[poultry]].&lt;ref name="Stone, 2004"/&gt;

Iceland has many traditional foods called [[Þorramatur]]. These foods include smoked and salted [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], singed [[sheep]] heads, dried fish, smoked and pickled [[salmon]], and cured [[shark]]. [[Andrew Zimmern]], a chef who has traveled the world on his show ''[[Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern]]'', responded to the question "What's the most disgusting thing you've ever eaten?" with the response "That would have to be the fermented shark fin I had in Iceland."  Fermented shark fin is a form of Þorramatur.&lt;ref&gt;Beale ''et al.'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance art ===
{{further information|Music of Iceland}}
[[Image:Jón Þór Birgisson at the Roskilde Festival in 2006.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Sigur Rós]] has gained international fame performing mostly in Icelandic.]]The earliest indigenous Icelandic music was the ''[[rímur]]'', epic tales from the [[Viking]] era that were often performed [[a cappella]]. Christianity played a major role in the development of Icelandic music, with many hymns being written in the local idiom. [[Hallgrímur Pétursson]], a poet and priest, is noted for writing many of these hymns in the 17th century. The island's relative isolation ensured that the music maintained its regional flavor. It was only in the 19th century that the first [[pipe organ]]s, prevalent in European religious music, first appeared on the island.&lt;ref name="F9"&gt;Fiske ''et al.'', 1972, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Many singers, groups, and forms of [[music]] have come from [[Iceland]]. Most Icelandic music contains vibrant [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Pop music|pop]] traditions. Some more recent groups and singers are  [[Voces Thules]], [[The Sugarcubes]], [[Björk]], [[Sigur Rós]], and [[Of Monsters and Men]].

The [[national anthem]] is [[Lofsöngur|"Ó Guð vors lands"]] ({{lang-en|"Our Country's God"}}), written by [[Matthías Jochumsson]], with music by [[Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson]]. The song was written in 1874, when [[Iceland]] celebrated its one thousandth anniversary of settlement on the island. It was originally published with the title ''A Hymn in Commemoration of Iceland's Thousand Years''.&lt;ref name="F9"/&gt;

=== Sports ===
{{main article|Sport in Iceland}}
Iceland's [[Iceland national football team|men's national football team]] participated in their first [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after reaching the quarter finals of its first major international tournament, [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. The [[Iceland women's national football team|women's national football team]] has yet to reach a [[FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]]; its best result at a major international event was a quarterfinal finish in [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013]]. The country's first Olympic participation was in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]; however, they did not participate again until the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. Their first appearance at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] was at the [[1948 Winter Olympics]]. In 1956, [[Vilhjálmur Einarsson]] won the Olympic silver medal for the [[triple jump]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiske ''et al.'', 1972, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iceland national handball team|Icelandic national handball team]] has enjoyed relative success. The team received a silver medal at the [[Handball at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympic Games]] and a 3rd place at the [[2010 European Men's Handball Championship]].

'''Isabel Godin des Odonais''' (1728 in [[Riobamba]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], now in [[Ecuador]] &amp;ndash; 28 September 1792 in [[Cher (department)|Cher]], [[France]]) was an 18th-century woman who became separated from her husband in [[South America]] by colonial politics, and was not reunited with him until more than 20 years later. Her long journey, from western Peru to the mouth of the Amazon River, is considered unusual in the history of South America. Her story has been often repeated and inspired popular misconceptions of the dangers of the [[tropical rain forest]].

In 1749, her husband, [[Jean Godin des Odonais]], left their home in [[Riobamba]], [[Ecuador]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish South America]] to visit [[French Guiana]].  As a [[France|French]] citizen, he was refused permission by the Spanish and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] authorities to return for his family.  Isabel Godin des Odonais became famous for being the only survivor of a 42-person, 3000-mile expedition through the [[Amazon Basin]] to rejoin her husband.  They were reunited in 1770 and later returned to France together.

==Background==
Isabel Godin des Odonais ''née'' Gramesón&lt;ref name="isabel"&gt;Whitaker (2004).  Smith (2003) gives the variant Isabela Grandmaison as her maiden name, while other accounts use Isabel de Casa Mayor [http://perso.orange.fr/archisam/godin.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter of Don Pedro Gramesón y Bruno, an administrator in Riobamba, a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial]] city in the [[Viceroy of Peru]].  She was well-educated and spoke fluent Spanish, French, and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], an understood the use of [[quipus]], the [[Inca]]n method of communicating information using colored strings and [[knots]].

Jean Godin des Odonais was a [[France|French]] [[Cartography|cartographer]] and [[naturalist]] who had joined the [[French Geodesic Mission|world's first geodesy expedition]] to the [[equator]].  The team worked in the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Quito region]] from 1735 to 1744, during which time Jean and Isabel met.  They married on 27 December 1741, when Isabel was fourteen years old.

==Separation==
At first Jean decided to remain in [[Riobamba]] with his new wife, but in 1743 he offered to accompany [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|La Condamine]] on his next expedition.  He stayed behind to see Isabel through her pregnancy.  But, when he heard of his father's death in March 1749, Godin decided to return to France with his family.  He planned to travel alone to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] via the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] to test whether the journey would be safe for them to take, and to make the necessary arrangements with the French authorities.
	
Upon arriving in Cayenne, Godin found the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[colonialism|colonial]] authorities would not let him — a Frenchman of no importance — return through their territory.  Unwilling to return to France without his family, he became a reluctant resident of French Guiana, constantly writing pleas to [[Europe]] to allow for his return to Riobamba.  Eventually, La Condamine wrote on Godin's behalf to the [[Joseph I of Portugal|Portuguese king]], who due to changing political circumstances was eager to befriend the French. In 1765 he ordered a [[galiot]], crewed by thirty oarsmen, to take Godin back to his wife.  However, as Godin had written some incendiary letters against the Portuguese, he was suspicious of the offer of passage up the Amazon, and abandoned the ship at its first port.  The captain of the galiot continued upriver without him, to fetch the Frenchman's wife as ordered.

For most of their 20-year separation, Isabel received no news of her husband, while enduring the death of her children from [[smallpox]].  She moved to the smaller community of [[Guzman]].  When she heard rumors that a ship was waiting to take her down the Amazon, she sent her servant Joachim and a handful of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] to investigate.  The party returned two years after having discovered the waiting ship, four years after its initial departure.  Isabel's father, Don Pedro, went ahead to the ship to make arrangements and to wait for Isabel.

==Isabel's journey==
On 1 October 1769 a 42-person party set out for the ship: Isabel, her servant Joachim, Isabel’s two brothers Antoine and Eugenio Gramesón, Isabel’s ten-year-old nephew Joaquin, three servants: Rosa, Elvia, and Heloise, thirty-one Indians, and three Frenchman.  The route across the [[Andean mountains]] and [[Amazon Basin]] was arduous, made worse by the recent devastation by [[smallpox]] of the mission station at Canelos (in present-day [[Pastaza Province]]), depriving the party of valuable support nine days into their journey.  They found two Indian survivors who agreed to repair a forty-foot canoe, in which they continued down the Amazon.

The river journey proved difficult, with the canoe unmanageable. The Indians from Canelos deserted them, and one of the party drowned trying recover the hat of one of the Frenchmen.  With the canoe weighed down by supplies, the party set up camp and sent Joachim and one of the Frenchmen ahead in the canoe, so they could return with extra transport.  Waiting for Joachim to return, the others began to suffer from infected insect bites.  [[Infection]] killed Isabel's nephew Joaquin, then Rosa and Elvia, the remaining Frenchmen and Isabel's brothers.  Heloise wandered off in the middle of the night, never to be seen again.  With the others dead, Isabel was left wandering alone in the jungle.

When the servant Joachim arrived back at the camp, he found only the bodies of the deceased travelers.  Unable to identify Isabel's body, he sent word of her death to Don Pedro — news which later reached Jean Godin.  Isabel wandered alone and starving for nine days.  Half-crazed, she met four Indians who offered her help in reaching Cayenne.  With their help, she was able to reach the waiting ship.  The story of her incredible journey soon spread, and she was treated to an increasingly grand reception as she made her way downriver.

==Reunion==
On 22 July 1770 Isabel and Jean were reunited in the town of [[Oyapock River|Oyapock]] after more than 20 years of separation. They remained in Cayenne for a few years. On 21 April 1773, Isabel, her husband and her father decided to leave Guiana and finally make their way to France. Don Pedro, having been severely disturbed by the events leading up to their arrival in France, died on 28 November 1780. Jean Godin died in their home on the Rue Hotel-Dieu in [[Saint-Amand-Montrond]], [[Cher (department)|Cher]], on 1 March 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel died there on 27 September the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Roosevelt Robinson''' (January 31, 1919&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 1972) was an American professional [[baseball]] player who became the first [[African American]] to play in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson broke the [[baseball color line]] when the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] started him at first base on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of [[racial segregation]] in professional baseball that had relegated [[List of first black Major League Baseball players by team|black players]] to the [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] since the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Loewen"/&gt; Robinson was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1962|1962]].&lt;ref&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame, Jackie Robinson [http://www.baseballhall.org/hof/robinson-jackie] Retrieved April 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson had an exceptional 10-year MLB career. He was the recipient of the inaugural MLB [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1947, was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954, and won the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1949—the first black player so honored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRef.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinja02.shtml |title=Jackie Robinson statistics and history |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson played in six [[World Series]] and contributed to the Dodgers' [[1955 World Series]] championship.

In 1997, MLB [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retired]] his uniform number 42 across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored. MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, "[[Jackie Robinson Day]]", for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every player on every team wears No.&amp;nbsp;42.

Robinson's character, his use of [[nonviolence]], and his unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation which then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World &amp; I |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257–273 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/march/mtpub.asp |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: precursors of the civil rights movement |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Glasser |first=Ira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OneMeeting"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MLB.com |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&amp;content_id=2529821 |title=One meeting, two men, a changed world |first=Justice B. |last=Hill |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415235609/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&amp;content_id=2529821&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb | archivedate=April 15, 2008 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, [[Chock full o'Nuts]]. In the 1960s, he helped establish the [[Freedom National Bank]], an African-American-owned financial institution based in [[Harlem]], New York. After his death in 1972, in recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] and [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Early life==

===Family and personal life===
Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] in [[Cairo, Georgia]]. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (McGriff) and Jerry Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Matthew]] (nicknamed "Mack"), and Willa Mae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rampersad |first=Arnold |title=In Pharaoh's Land: Cairo, Georgia 1919–1920 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rampersad-robinson.html |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigelow"&gt;[[#Bigelow|Bigelow]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name was in honor of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who died 25 days before Robinson was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/dreamteam/jackierobinson.html |title=White House dream team: Jackie Roosevelt Robinson |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=January 20, 2002 |publisher=Whitehousekids.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415164600/http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |archivedate=April 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinsonp9"&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eigp10&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Muir High School===
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at [[John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)|John Muir High School]] (Muir Tech).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics|silver medalist]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]])&lt;ref name=Eigp10/&gt; and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |title=Jackie Robinson biography |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=The Biography Channel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610124614/http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |archivedate=June 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt;

At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the [[varsity team|varsity level]] and [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in four of them: [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="Robinsonp9"/&gt; He played [[shortstop]] and [[catcher]] on the baseball team, [[quarterback]] on the football team, and [[Shooting guard|guard]] on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the [[long jump|broad jump]]. He was also a member of the [[tennis]] team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famers]] [[Ted Williams]] and [[Bob Lemon]].&lt;ref name=Rampp37&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 1937, the ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'' newspaper reported that Robinson "for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasadena Junior College===
After Muir, Robinson attended [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; On the football team, he played quarterback and [[Safety (American football position)|safety]]. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack.&lt;ref name=Robinsonp9/&gt; As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.&lt;ref name=Rampp37/&gt; While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[Media:INTERVIEW Jackie Robinson U.pdf|Sports: Jackie Robinson]] |first=Bob |last=Stone |date=November 23, 1945 |work=[[Yank, the Army Weekly]] |volume=4 |issue=23 |type=PDF |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (''Omicron Mu Delta''), awarded to students performing "outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as [[Racism in the United States|racist]]—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.&lt;ref name="Linge, p. 18"&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCLA and afterward===
[[File:Jackie robinson ucla track.jpg|thumb|alt=Athlete in UCLA track uniform at the apex of a jump, with legs lunging forward, against a background of an academic building.|upright|Robinson doing the long jump for UCLA]]

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win [[varsity letter]]s in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memory1940/&gt;

==Military career==

In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]]. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=G.P.O. |isbn=978-1-153-75539-9 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940–65 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |year=1981 |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Chapter 2: World War II: The Army |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-02.htm |id=n. 94 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727161209/http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-02.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months.&lt;ref name=Robinsonp13&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After protests by heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]] (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of [[Truman Gibson]] (then an assistant civilian aide to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/gibson.html |title=Library of Congress: Truman K.

During the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interests. No black man had played in the major leagues since [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] in 1884, but the [[Boston Red Sox]] nevertheless held a tryout at [[Fenway Park]] for Robinson and other black players on April 16.&lt;ref name=Bryantp31&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robertson &amp; Saunders|Robertson &amp; Saunders]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.&lt;ref name=Npr2002&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/oct/redsox/ | title = The Boston Red Sox and Racism: With New Owners, Team Confronts Legacy of Intolerance | publisher = National Public Radio | date = October 11, 2002 | accessdate = April 21, 2018 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405032805/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/oct/redsox/ | archivedate = April 5, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the tryout humiliated,&lt;ref name=Bryantp31/&gt; and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |title=Robinson's many peers follow his lead |url=http://mlbnetwork.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895202&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |last=O'Connell |first=Jack |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=December 24, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822072051/http://mlbnetwork.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895202&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer.

Rickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena.
That September, he signed with [[Chet Brewer]]'s Kansas City Royals, a post-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] team in the [[California Winter League]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev.

===Minor leagues===

In 1946, Robinson arrived at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], for [[spring training]] with the [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[International League]] (the designation of "AAA" for the highest level of [[minor league baseball]] was first used in the 1946 season). [[Clay Hopper]], the manager of the Royals, asked Rickey to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate, but Rickey refused.&lt;ref name=redemption&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb |first=Chris |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Opinion+redemption+Clay+Hopper/8196800/story.html |title=Opinion: The redemption of Clay Hopper |publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=April 7, 2013 |accessdate=April 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405102841/http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Opinion%2Bredemption%2BClay%2BHopper/8196800/story.html |archivedate=April 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. As he was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in [[Vero Beach]] known as "[[Dodgertown]]" did not open until spring 1948),&lt;ref&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], pp. 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt; scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or [[Johnny Wright (baseball)|Johnny Wright]], another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In [[Sanford, Florida]], the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the [[J.

After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the ''de facto'' baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Loewen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong |last=Loewen |first=James W. |year=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-56584-100-0 |page=163|title-link=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in spring training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to [[second baseman|second base]], allowing him to make shorter throws to first base.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933586,00.html |title=Jackie Makes Good |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |date=August 26, 1946 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's performance soon rebounded.

During Robinson's first at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground out at his first at bat, Robinson ended up with four hits in his five trips to the plate; his first hit was a three-run home run in the game's third inning.&lt;ref&gt;Van Blair, Rick (1994) ''Dugout to Foxhole: Interviews with Baseball Players Whose Careers Were Affected by World War II.''

===Major leagues===

====Breaking the color barrier (1947)====
In 1947, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season. With [[Eddie Stanky]] entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a [[first baseman]].&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; On April 15, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at [[Ebbets Field]] before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black.&lt;ref name=McNeil357/&gt; Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory.&lt;ref name=McNeil357&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Ethnicity and Sports in the United States|authors=Kirsch, George B., Othello Harris, and Claire Elaine Nolte, eds.|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-313-29911-7 |publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=12, 336|chapter=The Right to Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.&lt;ref name="Satch2"/&gt;

Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.&lt;ref name=SABRbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general survey of the media reaction to Robinson at various phases of his career, ''see'' [http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proball.html www.umass.edu] and subpages. Retrieved on July 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jackie-robinson-breaks-color-barrier |title=Jackie Robinson breaks major league color barrier |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed the team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], threatened to [[Strike action|strike]] if Robinson played, but also to spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s [[Rutherford "Rud" Rennie]]. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his ''Tribune'' colleague and editor, [[Stanley Woodward (editor)|Stanley Woodward]], whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Roger|title=Rickey &amp; Robinson: The True, Untold Story of the Integration of Baseball|date=2014|publisher=Rodale Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1623362973|pages=259–267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4HhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krell|first1=David|title= "Our Bums": The Brooklyn Dodgers in History, Memory and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=McFarland|location=New York|isbn=978-1476619736|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RHNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giglio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giglio|first1=James N.|title=Musial: From Stash to Stan the Man|date=2001|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, Mo.|isbn=978-0826263131|pages=152–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TW3emrB4J50C&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President [[Ford Frick]] and [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," threatened Chandler. "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another."&lt;ref name="Giglio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward's article received the E. P.

Smith remembered his old ''Herald Tribune'' colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, "... if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the ''New York Herald Tribune''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Red|title=The Outcasts of Cooperstown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/27/archives/the-outcasts-of-cooperstown.html|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=New York Times|agency=New York Times Co.|publisher=New York Times Co.|date=July 27, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from [[Enos Slaughter]].&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_jackie.html |title=Jackie Robinson integrates Baseball |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Wormser |first=Richard |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Phillies players and manager [[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]] called Robinson a "[[nigger]]" from their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and yelled that he should "go back to the cotton fields".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ken Burns|Burns, Ken]] (writer and director) |date=1994 |title=[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]], Part 6 |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |time=minute 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickey later recalled that Chapman "did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers.

Robinson did, however, receive significant encouragement from several major league players. Robinson named [[Lee Handley|Lee "Jeep" Handley]], who played for the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well.&lt;ref name=Astor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astor|first1=Gerald|title=The Baseball Hall of Fame 50th Anniversary Book|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall Press|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, "You can hate a man for many reasons.

Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the [[Dodgers]], with a [[batting average]] of .297, an [[on-base percentage]] of .383, and a .427 [[slugging percentage]]. He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, and 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in [[sacrifice hits]], with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=roy_history |title=Rookies of the Year |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stanky's trade to the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 [[fielding percentage]] that year (second in the [[National League]] at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).&lt;ref name="McNeil94"&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/individual_stats_player.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;playerID=121314 |title=Historical Player Stats |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 12–7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]]—a [[home run]], a [[triple (baseball)|triple]], a [[double (baseball)|double]], and a [[single (baseball)|single]] in the same game.&lt;ref name="lester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larrylester42.com/my-hero/ |title=My Hero&amp;nbsp;– Jackie Robinson |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |last=Lester |first=Larry |year=2007 |publisher=LarryLester42.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120130946/http://www.larrylester42.com/my-hero |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the [[1948 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman |location=Lincoln |last=Lowenfish |first=Lee |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-1103-2 |chapter=A Year of Disappointment, Odd Choices, and an Adieu to Leo |page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Larry Doby]] (who broke the color barrier in the [[American League]] on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and [[Satchel Paige]] played for the [[Cleveland Indians]], and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson.&lt;ref name="McNeil94"/&gt; In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12500|1948}}}} today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a [[vaudeville]] tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp {{Convert|30|lb|kg}} overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Wendell Smith's book, ''Jackie Robinson: My Own Story'', was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wendell Smith and Jackie Robinson|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://baseballhall.org/node/447|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer [[George Sisler]], working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Robinson also noted that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second".&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.&lt;ref name=Sizzler&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great |last=Huhn |first=Rick |year=2004 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=978-0-8262-1555-0 |chapter=Full circle |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] with 122 runs scored.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; For the performance Robinson earned the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] for the National League.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the [[1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1949 All-Star Game]]—the first All-Star Game to include black players.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Robinson, the 1949 All-Star game featured [[Larry Doby]], [[Roy Campanella]], and [[Don Newcombe]].

That year, a song about Robinson by [[Buddy Johnson]], "Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?", reached number&amp;nbsp;13 on the charts; [[Count Basie]] recorded a famous version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/music.html |title=Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball? |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1949 World Series]].&lt;ref name="McNeil94"/&gt;

Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the [[United States House of Representatives]]' [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor [[Paul Robeson]]. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paul Robeson |last=Duberman |first=Martin |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-394-52780-2 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |pages=361–362 |chapter=The Right to Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Robinson led the National League in [[double play]]s made by a second baseman with 133.&lt;ref name="lester"/&gt; His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jackie Robinson Breaks the Color Line |last=Santella |first=Andrew |year=1996 |publisher=Children's Press |isbn=978-0-516-06637-0 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1950}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).

Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner [[Walter O'Malley]], who referred to Robinson as "Rickey's [[prima donna]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stout|Stout]], p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired.

====Pennant races and outside interests (1951–1953)====
Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the ''Montreal Standard'' as saying, "Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post"—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Linked to Montreal Job |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |date=March 25, 1951 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TAMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cE0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3670,3811383&amp;hl=en |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Offered Managerial Berth |date=March 25, 1951 |page=27 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PtoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5339,1955903&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137.&lt;ref name="lester"/&gt; He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitker|first=Steve|title=The Original San Francisco Giants: The Giants of '58|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2001|page=196|isbn=978-1-58261-335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers lost the pennant on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s famous home run, known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]], on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster [[Vin Scully]] later noted that the incident showed "how much of a competitor Robinson was."&lt;ref name="Impact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2007/m04/d12/c1895331.jsp |title=Robinson made impact on field, too |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |page=154|title-link=#Dorinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; He did, however, record a career-high [[on-base percentage]] of .436.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the [[1952 World Series]] to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show ''Youth Wants to Know'', Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]], on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |title=The Legacy of Race Through Time |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |date=April 13, 1997 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408185940/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswriter [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], whom Robinson had described as a "bigot", said, "If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the [[outfielder|outfield]], with [[Jim Gilliam]], another black player, taking over everyday second base duties.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the [[Puerto Rico Baseball League|Puerto Rican Winter League]], but according to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.&lt;ref name="Tygiel 2002, p. 34"&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals,&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another [[1953 World Series|World Series]] loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for ''Our Sports'' magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend [[Joe Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |title=Jackie Robinson and baseball highlights, 1860s–1960s |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |date=September 26, 2002 |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810071209/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jr1947.html |title=Robinson as a Dodger: 1947–1956 |work=Baseball, the Color Line, and Jackie Robinson |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star [[Chase Park Plaza Hotel|Chase Park Hotel]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What I Learned from Jackie Robinson: A Teammate's Reflections On and Off the Field |author=Erskine, Carl with Burton Rocks |chapter=Wait Till Next Year |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-145085-0 |pages=61–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Championship and retirement (1954–1956)====
In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs scored, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lester"/&gt; The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the [[1955 World Series]]. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a [[third baseman]], both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series.&lt;ref name="Impact"/&gt; Robinson missed the game because manager [[Walter Alston]] decided to play Gilliam at second and [[Don Hoak]] at third base. That season, the Dodgers' [[Don Newcombe]] became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs scored, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of [[diabetes]] and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball.&lt;ref name="Tygiel 2002, p. 34"/&gt; Robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end Game 7 of the [[1956 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nogowski|Nogowski]], pp. 43–44, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to the arch-rival [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] for [[Dick Littlefield]] and $35,000 cash (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1956}}}} today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of [[Chock full o'Nuts]] to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.&lt;ref name=Lingep114&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine two years previously,&lt;ref name=Lingep114/&gt; his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.&lt;ref name=mlb.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070603&amp;content_id=2003372&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Jackie Robinson: Gone but not forgotten |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=June 4, 2007 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|History of baseball in the United States#Racial integration in baseball}}

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the [[baseball color line]].&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated [[Great Migration (African American)|migration to the North]], where their political clout grew, and [[Harry Truman|President Harry Truman]]'s [[Military history of African Americans|desegregation of the military]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/opinion/better-late-than-never.html|title=Better Late Than Never|last=Klarman|first=Michael J. |date=May 17, 2004|work=New York Times|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter.

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.&lt;ref name="Sports 20000"/&gt; During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.&lt;ref name="BRef.com"/&gt; In 1999, he was posthumously named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2|title=The All-Century Team|year=1999|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post–"long ball" era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |pages=151–152|title-link=#Dorinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more [[base on balls|walks]] than [[strikeout]]s (740 to 291).&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sports 20000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |title=The No. 1 Most Significant Development in the 20th Century |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Kindred |first=Dave |date=July 1999 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012124045/http://sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |archivedate=October 12, 1999 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1783632 |title=Remembering Jackie Robinson |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Simon |first=Mark |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 ([[Minnie Miñoso]] was the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/04/19/SP68618.DTL |title=By The Numbers – Robinson Was All-Around Player |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Camps |first=Mark |date=April 7, 1997 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; including 19 steals of home.

Major League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death.

'''Judson "Jud" Gilbert II''' (born January 22, 1952) was a member of the [[Michigan Legislature]]. Immediately prior to this term (2010-2012) he was a member of the [[Michigan Senate|Michigan State Senate]], where he has served since 2002. Prior to that he was a member of the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1998 to 2002. Gilbert is a Roman Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  In 2010 Gilbert was elected to a third term in the Michigan State House.

Gilbert's House district covered most of [[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair County]].  His former Senate District covered all of [[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair County]] and [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]  He is a native of Algonac.  He graduated from Algonac High School and St. Clair County Community College.  He later went to [[Wayne State University]], where he studied mortuary science.  He then spent several years as a funeral home director.

Gilbert is term limited and thus not running for re-election in 2010.  However, since the term limit in the state house is 3 terms and he only served two, Gilbert is running for the State House District 81.

While in the State Senate Gilbert was an early fighter for replacing the [[Single Business Tax]] and was endorsed by the state chamber of commerce for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michamber.com/mx/feb2007 Michigan Chamber of Commerce piece praising Gilbert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320235703/http://www.michamber.com/mx/feb2007 |date=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert is the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and as such has been involved in negotiations to build the [[Detroit River International Crossing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20108140307 ''Lansing State Journal'', Aug. 14, 2010]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has stalled this project to some extent with his inquiries about particulars of the project, such as who will pay the owners of the land condemned to build the bridge crossings and what will happen if toll revenue is below projections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buildthedricnow.com/ ''Build Dric Now'' article from the Argus Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Kristang''''' (otherwise known as "Portuguese-Eurasians" or "Malacca Portuguese") are a [[Creole peoples|creole]] ethnic group of people of mixed [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Malacca]]n descent based in [[Malaysia]] and to some extent in [[Singapore]]. People of this ethnicity have, besides Portuguese, a strong [[Dutch people|Dutch]] heritage, as well as some [[British people|British]], [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]], [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] heritage due to intermarriages, which is common among the Kristang. In addition, due to the Portuguese Inquisition in the region, a lot of the Jews of Malacca assimilated into the Kristang community.&lt;ref&gt;Humanistic &amp; Secular Jews Build Communities and Congregations Worldwide: Malaysia {{cite web |url=http://ifshj.net/id5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027214511/http://ifshj.net/id5.html |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creole group arose in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) between the 16th and 17th centuries, when the city was a port and base of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Some descendants speak a distinctive [[Kristang language]] or Malacca Portuguese, a [[creole language|creole]] based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Today the government classifies them as Portuguese Eurasians.

The Kristang language is formally called Malacca-Melayu Portuguese Creole, made up of elements of each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joanmarbeck.net/ ''Language Is the Soul of our Kristang Heritage''], Joan Marbeck Website, accessed 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Malay language, or ''Bahasa Melayu'', has changed to incorporate many Kristang words. For example, ''garfu'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''garfo'') is Kristang for "fork" and ''almari''  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''armário'') is Kristang for "cupboard"; the Malay language incorporated these Kristang words whole.

Scholars believe the Kristang community originated in part from liaisons and marriages between Portuguese men (sailors, soldiers, traders, etc.) and local native women. The men came to Malacca during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|age of Portuguese explorations]], and in the early colonial years, Portuguese women did not settle in the colony. Nowadays intermarriage occurs more frequently between Kristang and people of Chinese and Indian ethnicity rather than Malay because of [[endogamous]] religious laws. These require non-Muslims intending to marry Malay-Muslims first to convert to Islam. Eurasians are not always willing to alter their religious and cultural identity in this way. In earlier centuries, Portuguese and local Malays were able to marry without such conversions, because such religious laws did not exist.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The name "Kristang" is sometimes incorrectly used for other [[Eurasian Singaporean|people of mixed European and Asian descent]] presently living in Malaysia and Singapore. This includes people of  Portuguese descent who were not part of the historical Kristang community, and people with other European ancestry, such as [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[British diaspora|British]].

The name comes from  the Portuguese creole ''Kristang'' (Christian), derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Cristão''. A derogatory term for the Malacca Portuguese community was  ''Gragok'' (slang term for Portuguese ''camarão'' (shrimp), referring to the fact that the Portuguese Malaccans were traditionally shrimp fishermen). In the native tongue, they also call themselves '''Gente Kristang''' (Christian people).

==History==

===Portuguese expeditions===
Malacca was a major destination in the great wave of sea expeditions launched by [[Portugal]] around the turn of the 16th century. It eventually was controlled as part of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The first Portuguese expedition to reach Malacca landed in 1507. The ''Sejarah Melayu'' (''[[Malay Annals]]'') noted that the Malays first called them ''Bengali Puteh'' (White Bengalis), as the Portuguese brought to mind traders from Bengal but were more pale skinned. In the early years, the Malays called the Portuguese '''Serani''' (a Malay contraction of the Arabic ''[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]]'', meaning followers of [[Jesus]] the Nazarene).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/fernandis.pdf Gerard Fernandis, "Paipia, Relijang e Tradisang" (People, Religion and Tradition), The Portuguese Eurasians in Malayasia: 'Bumiquest', "A Search for Self Identity"], ''Lusotopie'', 2000, Sciences Politiques - Bordeaux, accessed 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  A story was recorded that the Portuguese landing party inadvertently insulted the Malaccan [[sultan]] by placing a [[garland]] of flowers on his head, and he had them detained. In 1511, a Portuguese fleet came from [[Portuguese India|India]] to free the landing party and [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquer Malacca]].

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from travelling overseas due to superstition about women on ships, as well as the substantial danger of the sea route around [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Following the Portuguese colonization of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]) in 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local indigenous women, under a policy set by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], then [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India|India]]. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or "married men") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Albuquerque's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished and some 200 were recorded by 1604. By creating families, the Portuguese men would make more settled communities, with families whose children would be Catholic and loyal to the Crown.

===The Dutch takeover===
A powerful sea power, the rising [[Dutch people|Dutch]] nation took Malacca from the Portuguese in 1641. This coincided with the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] in Portugal that ended the 60-year period known as the "Union of the Crowns" (1580–1640), when the crown of Portugal was joined with the crown of Spain by [[personal union]]. Almost all political contact between Portugal and Malacca ended, and a large number of people of Portuguese descent in the city were evacuated to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]](now Jakarta), the [[Dutch East India Company]] headquarters, as war captives, where they settled in an area called "[[Koja, Jakarta|Kampung Tugu]]".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=East of Bali: From Lombok to Timor|author1=Müller, K.|author2=Pickell, D.|date=1997|publisher=Periplus|isbn=9789625931784|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSmqaNFttVkC|page=217|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Portuguese trade relations with the former colonial outpost of Macau have continued to this day.

Even after Portugal lost Malacca in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its traditions, practicing [[Catholicism]] and using the Portuguese language within the community. Some [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Dutch crypto-Catholics]] were also absorbed into the community during this time.

==Present status==
The Kristang community still has cultural and linguistic continuities with today's Portugal, especially with the [[Minho Province|Minho]] region, from where many early settlers emigrated. The Kristang continue to hold some church services in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Malaysians, including themselves, often refer to the community as "Portuguese". As the Kristang language is not taught in schools, it is nearing extinction, with the exception of within the [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] in ''[[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Ujong Pasir Malacca]]''.

The Kristang people in Malaysia do not have full ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputra]]'' status, a status which applies to [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic]] groups. However they have been given the privilege to apply to be members of a trust scheme known as ''Amanah Saham Bumiputra''. This is a privilege shared by Malaysians of [[Malaysian Siamese|Thai]] descent. The government sponsored this program to help the Malays increase their participation in the national economy. The Kristang community in Singapore is part of a larger umbrella group, known generically as the [[Eurasian Singaporean|Eurasian]] community. Some members have emigrated to [[Perth, Western Australia]] over the past three decades.

The [[Portuguese Settlement, Malacca|Portuguese Settlement]] is a thriving Kristang community in Malacca, established in 1933 with the goal of gathering the dispersed Kristang community and preserving their culture. A simple village of poor fishermen for many decades, it has recently become a major tourist attraction. This has helped to improve the income of the Kristang population.

==Culture==

===Fishing===
Since Portuguese times, the Kristang have been living by the sea. It is still an important part of their culture. Even today, with only 10 percent of the community earning their living by fishing, many men go fishing to supplement their income or just to relax with their neighbours. Traditionally men fish from small wooden ''[[perahu]]s'', or by pushing the ''[[langgiang]]'', a traditional [[bamboo]]-poled shrimp net through the shallows.

===Music and dance===
Kristang traditional music and dance, such as the ''[[Branyo]]'' and the ''Farrapeira'' are descendents of Portuguese folk dances. The [[Branyo]], descends from the southern Portuguese folk dance [[Corridinho]], and can be easily mistaken for the Malay ''[[Joget]]'' dance, which is believed to have developed from the Branyo. The adoption of western music instruments and musical scales by traditional Malay and Indian orchestras suggests a strong Portuguese influence. The most popular branyo tune, ''Jingkli Nona'', is regarded as the unofficial "anthem" for Portuguese Eurasians.

===Cuisine===
Kristang or Malacca Portuguese cuisine consists of heavy local influence, with the additions of stews and the inclusion of pork and seafood in the diet, and rice is the staple food. Among the many dishes in Kristang cuisine, the most popular is [[Devil's curry|Cari Debal]]. Other popular delicacies include Portuguese grilled fish, pineapple prawn Curry, Cari Seccu (dry curry), Caldu Pescador (Fisherman's soup), Sambal Chili Bedri (green chilli [[sambal]]), Soy Limang, Porku Tambrinyu (pork tamarind stew), Achar Pesi (fish pickle), Pang Su Si (Su Si Bun), and Sugee Cake. As is the custom, Kristang people commonly eat using their hands instead of utensils. It is similar to the [[Eurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia]]

===Names===
The Kristang people traditionally used [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] and Christian first names, while their surnames were Portuguese. Among the many common surnames are [[Fernandes]], [[Lopes]], [[Santamaria (disambiguation)|Santa Maria]], [[Siqueira]], [[Costa (surname)|De Costa]], [[Pereira (surname)|Pereira]], [[Teixeira (disambiguation)|Teixeira]], [[Gomes]] and [[Pinto (disambiguation)|Pinto]].

==Religion==
In general the Kristang practice [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. [[Christmas]] (''Natal'') is the most festive occasion of the year, when many Kristang families get together to celebrate by eating seasonal dishes, singing  [[Carol (music)|carols]] and ''branyok'', and revelling in ''[[saudade|saudadi]]''. Like many other Portuguese-speaking Catholic communities around the world, the Kristang also celebrate a string of major [[Calendar of saints|Saints' days]] at the end of June, beginning with [[John the Baptist|St. John]] (''San Juang'') on 24 June and closing with [[Peter the Apostle|St. Peter]] (''San Pedro''), the fishermen's [[patron saint]], on 29 June. The June festival of [[Saint John, Malacca|St. John's village]] is a major tourist attraction of Malacca. Tourists come to observe the festivities, which are religiously based.

==Portuguese influence on Malay language==
The Portuguese ruled Malacca from 1511 to 1641. About 300 Portuguese words were adopted in the Malay language. These include:
* ''kereta'' (from ''carreta'', car);
* ''sekolah'' (from ''escola'', school);
* ''bendera'' (from ''bandeira'', flag);
* ''mentega'' (from ''manteiga'', butter);
* ''keju'' (from ''queijo'', cheese);
* ''gereja'' (from ''igreja'', church);
* ''meja'' (from ''mesa'', table); and
* ''nenas'' (from ''ananás'', pineapple).

In 1952 he attained a degree in philosophy for a dissertation "Truth and its ontological premisses". During the period of 1956-68 he worked at Prague Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Then he took a position at the Institute for Philosophy of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]], but was expelled in 1971.

In 1985, Ladislav Hejdánek established the journal ''[[Reflexe (journal)|Reflexe. Časopis pro filosofii a teologii]]''. In 1990, he was [[habilitated]] at the Charles University in Prague, and two years later became a professor of that university.

'''Laurie J. Shrage''' (born December 4, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] political and moral philosopher whose analysis of the agendas for social change advanced by gender and sexual dissidents has been influential.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web |last=DesAutels |first=Peggy |title=Laurie Shrage: August 2013 |url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/laurieshrageaugust2013 |work=Highlighted Philosophers |publisher=American Philosophical Association |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Shrage has taught at [[Howard University]], [[Lake Forest College]], [[Scripps College]], [[California State Polytechnic University]], and now teaches at [[Florida International University]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web |last=Shrage |first=Laurie |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://philosophy.fiu.edu/faculty/laurie-shrage/cv2013.pdf |publisher=Florida International University |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her B.A. (1975) from the [[University of California, Davis]] and her M.A. (1979) and Ph.D (1983) from the [[University of California, San Diego, Philosophy]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In her first book, ''Moral Dilemmas of Feminism: Prostitution, Adultery, and Abortion'' (1994), Shrage argued for empirically informed philosophical analyses of moral problems.  She argued against the possibility of offering a universal social ethics and, as an alternative, she developed an interpretive approach to moral problems,  based in part on the work of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]].&lt;ref name=satz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Satz|first=Debra|title=''Moral Dilemmas of Feminism: Prostitution, Adultery, and Abortion'' Review|journal=Ethics|date=July 1996|volume=106|issue=4|pages=864–866|doi=10.1086/233683}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 19, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book, ''Abortion and Social Responsibility: Depolarizing the Debate'' (2003), argues for reconsidering the [[American Law Institute]]’s model abortion law developed prior to [[Roe v. Wade]].  Shrage explores abortion policies around the world, the history of reform and repeal movements in the U.S., moral and legal debates, and ethnographies of pro-life and pro-choice groups, and then recommends restricting elective abortions to roughly the end of the first trimester, in order to balance competing rights and values.&lt;ref name=sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=A. Sheth|first=Falguni|journal=The Women's Review of Books|year=2003|volume=20|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peach|first=Lucinda J.|title=Abortion and Social Responsibility: Depolarizing the Debate (review)|journal=NWSA Journal|date=January 1, 2005|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–217|doi=10.1353/nwsa.2005.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrage was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Fellow at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University (2011-12) and a fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center (1998-99).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;   She was a co-editor of the journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]] from 1998-2003.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She has served as the American Philosophical Association’s Ombuds for Non-Discrimination, 2008-11, and as the Program Chair for the American Philosophical Association, Pacific Division meeting in 2001.  She was Director of Women’s Studies at FIU (2008-11).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==
Shrage's work evaluates public policies on markets in sexual services and expressive materials, reproductive health care, legal gender identity, and marriage.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She is more interested in the active application of philosophical theory to inform public debate - in what she terms "empirically informed philosophy" - than she is in focusing her work on a particular school of philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She suggests that moral and political philosophers should pay more attention to historical and scientific accounts of political and moral problems than they currently do.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

'''Miss World Philippines''' is the annual pageant that selects representative of the Philippines to Miss World pageant.

==History==
From 1966 to 1976, the Miss Republic of the Philippines pageant was held to select the representative of the Philippines to the Miss World Pageant.

From 1977 to 1991, the official representatives came from the Mutya ng Pilipinas pageant.

From 1992 to 2010, the official representatives came from Binibining Pilipinas pageant.

In 2011, Julia Morley ended the contract with Binibining Pilipinas and awarded the franchise to [[Cory Quirino]] to hold Miss World Philippines, a separate national pageant for the Philippines' representatives to the Miss World pageant.

Under CQGQI, the Philippines won one Miss World crown (see table below).

The current title holder of Miss World Philippines is Laura Victoria Lehmann.

The historical concept and [[definition]] of [[sexual orientation]] varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word "gay" was not used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term "sexual orientation" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shively |first=M.G. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=DeCecco |first3=J. P. |year=1984 |title=Research on sexual orientation: definitions and methods |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=9 |issue=2/3 |pages=127–137 |doi=10.1300/J082v09n02_08 |pmid=6376622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerdes |first=L.C. |title=The Developing Adult | edition=Second |location=Durban: Butterworths; Austin, Texas |publisher=Butterworth Legal Publishers |year=1988 |isbn=0-409-10188-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sell |first=Randall L. |date=December 1997 |title=Defining and Measuring Sexual Orientation: A Review: How do you define sexual orientation? |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages=643–658 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/context/defining.html |accessdate=11 July 2007 |doi=10.1023/A:1024528427013 |pmid=9415799}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]].

The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]]. The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of [[homosexuality]]. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided–a thin majority (51&amp;nbsp;percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42&amp;nbsp;percent disagree."&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=.PDF |date=June 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center For The People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a partial list of confirmed '''famous people who were or are gay, lesbian or bisexual'''. Famous people who are simply rumored to be [[gay]], [[lesbian]], or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] are not listed.

The doping tests returned negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.archiefleeuwardercourant.nl/site/article.do?code=LC&amp;date=19990720&amp;id=LC-19990720-9012&amp;words=+jean-marie%20+leblanc%20jean%20marie%20leblanc|title=Loslippige Ludo Diercksens naar huis|publisher=Leeuwarder Courant|date=20 July 1999|accessdate=7 August 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran''' (17 January 1917 – 24 December 1987), popularly known as '''M. G. R.''', was an Indian actor, filmmaker and politician who served as the [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] for ten years between 1977 and 1987. He is a [[cultural icon]] in the state and is regarded as one of the most influential actors of the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/70-politicians-independence-day/|title=India at 70 70 most influential Politicians of post-independence India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was popularly known as "Makkal Thilagam" (People's King) as he was popular with the masses.He was a philanthropist and a humanitarian icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/mgr-remembered-part-26/|title=MGR Remembered – Part 26|date=8 April 2015|author=[[Sachi Sri Kantha]]|publisher=[[Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America#Organization|Sangam.org]]|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, Ramachandran and his elder brother [[M. G. Chakrapani]] became members of a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, MGR joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. After a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film ''[[Sathi Leelavathi (1936 film)|Sathi Leelavathi]]'' in a supporting role. By the late 1940s, he graduated to lead roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry. He became a member of the [[C. N. Annadurai]]-led [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK party) and rapidly rose through its ranks, using his enormous popularity as a film star to build a large political base. In 1972, three years after Annadurai's death, he left the DMK, then led by [[Karunanidhi]], MGR's once friend and now rival, to form his own party—the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK). Five years later, he steered an AIADMK-led alliance to victory in the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 1977|1977 election]], routing the DMK in the process. He became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the first film actor to become a [[chief minister (India)|chief minister]] in India. Except for a six-month interregnum in 1980, when his government was [[President's rule|overthrown]] by the Union government, he remained as chief minister till his death in 1987, leading the AIADMK to two more electoral triumphs in [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 1980|1980]] and [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 1984|1984]].{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification, excess dramatism such as once a friend now a foe|date=December 2016}}

Ramachandran's autobiography ''Naan Yaen Piranthaen'' (''Why I was Born'') was published in 2003 in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Janaki’s son alone has copyright to MGR’s autobiography: court|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/janakis-son-alone-has-copyright-to-mgrs-autobiography-court/article3600414.ece|accessdate=6 December 2016|publisher=The Hindu|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Ramachandran made his film debut in 1936, in the film ''[[Sathi Leelavathi (1936 film)|Sathi Leelavathi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090303042321/http://www.bookrags.com/M._G._Ramachandran M. G. Ramachandran]. bookrags.com&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Ellis Dungan]], an American-born film director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/09/06/stories/2004090600190300.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Americans in Tamil cinema |date=6 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally starring in romance or action films, MGR got his big breakthrough in the 1950 film ''[[Manthiri Kumari]]'', written by [[M. Karunanidhi]]. Soon he rose to popularity with the 1954 film ''[[Malaikkallan]]''. He acted as hero in the Tamil film industry's first ever [[Gevacolor]] movie, the 1955  ''[[Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956 film)|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum]]''. He rose to become the heartthrob of millions of Tamilians with movies such as ''[[Thirudadhe]]'', ''[[Enga Veettu Pillai]]'', ''[[Aayirathil Oruvan (1965 film)|Aayirathil Oruvan]]'', ''[[Anbe Vaa]]'', ''Mahadevi'', ''Panam Padaithavan'', ''Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan'', etc. He won the [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] for the film ''[[Rickshawkaran]]'' in 1972. He acted in many movies that appealed to the direct sentiments of the common man and the rich as well. His 1973 blockbuster ''Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan'' broke the previous box office records of his movies. It was one of the few movies filmed abroad in those days. It was shot in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Japan. The DMK tried very hard to illegally prevent the screening of the film using strong-arm tactics, but ultimately failed in its attempt. His acting career ended in 1987 with his last film ''Ullagam Suthi Paru'', in which he acted even though he had been diagnosed with kidney failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MGR-Sivaji-Gemini: TRINITY Album Launched|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/events/25324.html|work=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mentor ===
[[Kali N. Rathnam|Narayana Padaiyatchi Rathnam]] a pioneer of Tamil stage drama and K.P. Kesavan were chief mentors of Ramachandran in his acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sangam.org/mgr-remembered-2/|title=MGR Remembered – Part 4|date=2 February 2013|newspaper=Ilankai Tamil Sangam|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:AIADMK flag.PNG|thumb|Official flag of MGR's political party AIADMK]]
MGR was a member of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] till 1953, and he used to wear [[khādī]]. In 1953&amp;nbsp;MGR joined the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) attracted by founder C.N. Annadurai. He became a vocal Tamil and [[Dravidian race|Dravidian]] nationalist and prominent member of the DMK ("Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam" aka Dravidian Progressive Federation). He added glamour to the [[Dravidian movement]] which was sweeping Tamil Nadu. MGR became a member of the state Legislative Council in 1962. At the age of 50, he was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1967. After the death of his mentor, [[C. N. Annadurai|Annadurai]], MGR became the treasurer of DMK in 1969 after [[Muthuvel Karunanidhi]] became the Chief Minister.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph|date=December 2016}}

===1968 Assassination attempt===
The actor and politician [[Mohan R. Radha|M. R. Radha]] and MGR had worked in 25 films together. On 12 January 1967, Radha and a producer visited MGR to talk about a future film project. During the conversation, M. R. Radha stood up and shot MGR in his left ear twice and then tried to shoot himself.&lt;ref&gt;A. Srivathsan (23 December 2012) [http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-day-mr-radha-shot-mgr/article12059018.ece The day M.R. Radha shot MGR]. ''The Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the operation, MGR's voice changed. Since he had been shot in his ear, MGR lost hearing in his left ear and had ringing in the ear problems. These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see MGR at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid MGR an advance for MGR's next movie. After getting released from the hospital and finishing ''Arasakattalai'', MGR acted in Devar's movie ''Vivasaayee'' against doctors' advice. Due to the operation, MGR's speaking parts in the movie ''Kaavalkaaran'' were reduced. This was the only movie in which MGR spoke with old and new voices between scenes: MGR was acting in the film ''Kaavalkaran'' in 1967 opposite [[J. Jayalalithaa]] when the shooting occurred.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph|date=December 2016}}

''Petralthaan Pillaya'' was the last movie of MGR-MR Radha together. Shooting ended just few days before MGR was shot. The bullet was permanently lodged in his neck and his voice damaged. Within hours of the shooting, some 50,000 fans had gathered at the hospital where MGR had been taken. People cried in the streets. For six weeks, he lay in the hospital as fans awaited each report of his health. He was visited by a steady stream of commoners and luminaries of film industry, polity and bureaucracy. From his hospital bed, he conducted his campaign for the Madras Legislative Assembly. He won twice the number of votes polled by his Congress rival and the largest vote polled by any candidate for the Assembly.&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-39680-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Selvaraj Velayutham|title=Tamil cinema: the cultural politics of India's other film industry|publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008|isbn=0-415-39680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split from DMK and formation of AIADMK===
In 1972, DMK leader Karunanidhi started to project his first son M.K. Muthu in a big way in film and politics. Understanding the tactics played by Karunanidhi to corner him, MGR started to claim that corruption had grown in the party after the demise of [[Annadurai]] and in a public meeting asked for the financial details of the party to be publicized, which enraged the leadership of DMK. Consequently, MGR was expelled from the party as per Karunanidhi's plan.

Upon his ouster from DMK, Ramachandran floated a new party which he called Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later renamed [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), the only powerful opponent of the DMK. He mobilized between 1972 and 1977 to spread and preach his party ambition with films like ''Netru Indru Naalai'' (1974), ''Idhayakani'' (1975), ''Indru Pol Endrum Vazhga'' (1977), etc.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, the ouster from DMK especially needs a citation|date=December 2016}}

===Continued success in TN Assembly elections===

====1977 Assembly elections====
The [[AIADMK]] contested the 1977 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. The election was a four cornered contest between the ADMK, DMK, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Janata Party. The ADMK allied itself with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while INC(I) and Communist Party of India (CPI) contested as allies. The DMK and Janata Party (JNP) contested the elections alone. The ADMK did not field any candidate in the Usilampatti Constituency in support of the Forward Bloc leader P.K. Mookiah Thevar. Similarly, the ADMK also supported the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate M. Abdul Latheef in the Vaniyambadi Constituency. In the parliamentary elections that occurred just three months prior to these elections, there had been two major alliances – the ADMK led ADMK-INC-CPI coalition and the DMK led DMK-NCO-JNP-CPM coalition. But in the months that followed the parliamentary election, these coalitions fell apart. The [[AIADMK]] alliance won the elections by winning 144 seats out of 234 and [[MGR]] became the [[Chief Minister]] of Tamil Nadu. Upon winning the 1977 state elections, MG Ramachandran became the [[Chief Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] on 30 June 1977, remaining in office till his death in 1987. In 1979, members of his party [[Satyavani Muthu]] and [[Aravinda Bala Pajanor]] became the first non-Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu to be ministers in the [[Union Cabinet]]. The AIADMK won every state assembly election as long as MGR was alive. Although Anna Durai and Karunanidhi had acted in stage plays in trivial roles, in their younger days, before becoming chief minister, MGR was the first popular film actor to be a Chief Minister in India.

====1980 Parliament and assembly elections====
Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam allied with Indian National Congress (Indira) in the 1977 parliamentary election. However, when Janata Party won the election and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister, M. G. Ramachandran extended unconditional support to the Janata party Government. He continued his support to the Charan Singh Government in 1979. After the fall of the Charan Singh government, fresh parliamentary elections were conducted in 1980. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam struck alliance with INC(I). ADMK and Janata Party alliance won only 2 seats in Tamil Nadu in that parliamentary election. INC(I) won the election and Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.
Congress-DMK victory in the 1980 parliamentary election emboldened their alliance and made them think that people lost their faith in M. G. Ramachandran government. DMK pressed the central government to dismiss the Tamil Nadu government using similar allegations used by MGR to dismiss DMK government in 1976. The ADMK ministry and the assembly were dismissed by the central government and fresh elections conducted in 1980.
Despite their victory at the 1980 Lok Sabha polls, DMK and Indira Congress failed to win the legislative assembly election. ADMK won the election and its leader and incumbent Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran was sworn in as Chief Minister for the second time. He became the first leader since K. Kamaraj to win a re-election as Chief Minister.

====1984 assembly elections====
Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984. During the same time, M. G. Ramachandran was diagnosed with kidney failure and admitted into a hospital in New York City. Rajiv Gandhi assumed office immediately and this required a fresh mandate from the people. Indian National Congress (Indira) and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed an alliance and contested the election. M. G. Ramachandran was confined to the hospital. Video coverage of MGR recuperating in hospital along with Indira Gandhi's assassination were stitched together by the ADMK man in charge of campaigning, R. M. Veerappan. The video was distributed and played across all over Tamil Nadu. Rajiv Gandhi visited cyclone-hit areas in Tamil Nadu, which also boosted the alliance. The sympathy wave created by Indira's assassination, MGR's illness and Rajiv Gandhi's charisma helped the alliance sweep the election.[1][2] DMK leader M. Karunanidhi did not contest this election, due to the fact that the ADMK leader M.G.R was admitted to a hospital in the U.S. and Indira Gandhi being assassinated. It was a landslide victory for AIADMK-Congress combine which won 195 seats in assembly polls. The electoral victory proved the undying charisma of [[MGR]] upon the masses.

===Achievements as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu===
Once he became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, he placed great emphasis on social development, especially education. One of his most successful policies was the conversion of the "[[Midday Meal Scheme]]", introduced by the popular Congress Chief Minister and kingmaker [[K Kamaraj]], which already was encouraging underprivileged children to attend school, into "MGR's Nutritious Meal Scheme" in the government-run and -aided schools in Tamil Nadu by adding ''saththurundai''&amp;nbsp;– a nutritious sugary flour dumpling. This scheme was at a cost of Rs. 1&amp;nbsp;billion and was imposed in 1982. A little more than 120,000 children of the state were benefited. He also introduced Women's Special buses. He introduced a liquor ban in the state and preservation of old temples and historical monuments, ultimately increasing the state's tourist income. He set up a free school for the cinema technicians children in Kodambakkam called MGR Primary &amp; Higher Secondary School which provided free mid-day meals in the 1950s. He led the ADMK to victory in the 1984 assembly elections, despite not taking part in the campaigning. At that time he was undergoing medical treatment in America and his images were broadcast in Tamil Nadu through cinema halls. This was an effective campaign tactic and ADMK won the elections claiming around 56% of assembly seats, indicating the depth of his popular support. He won his seat in a double landslide victory in 1984. He still holds the record of being the chief minister with the highest consistent longevity of more than a decade.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no citation for this complete paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}

Karunanidhi claimed on 1 April 2009 and again on 13 May 2012 that MGR was ready for the merger of his party with the DMK in 1979, with [[Biju Patnaik]] acting as the mediator. The plan failed, because [[Panruti S. Ramachandran|Panruti Ramachandran]], who was close to MGR acted as a spoiler and MGR changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/01/stories/2009040159630800.htm |title=Tamil Nadu News : ADMK came close to merging with DMK: Karunanidhi |work=The Hindu |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/tamil-nadu/karuna-recalls-biju-s-bid-for-dmk-admk-merger_775093.html |title=Karuna recalls Biju's bid for DMK-ADMK merger |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and controversies===
[[File:Periyar funeral.jpg|thumb|left|MGR paying his last respects to one of his mentors Periyar]]
Even after his death, MGR proved to be very popular in the state and his rule has been cited by many of his contemporaries as best in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/12/20/polls-show-mgr-as-the-best-cm-of-tamil-nadu-1166621843.html|title=Polls show MGR as the best CM of Tamil Nadu|date=20 December 2006|work=news.oneindia.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his rule is not without criticism. Economic data under his rule showed that annual growth and per capita income was lower than the national average and the state went from being second among 25 industrialised states in development after Kamaraj's rule to tenth. This decline, according to critics has been due to shift of government resources from power and irrigation to social and agriculture sector according to Madras Institute of Development Studies reported in 1988. In addition, the emphasis on "welfare schemes" such as free electricity to farmers, mid-day meal schemes, etc. has been seen by many as taking money away from infrastructure development that could have benefited the poor. In addition, the liquor tax imposed during his rule was considered to contribute to a regressive tax mostly affecting the poor.{{Citation needed|reason=more citation are needd for the claims in this paragraph, a few peacock words without justification|date=December 2016}}

Other criticisms have been on MGR's centralised decision-making, which many blame for inefficiency and corruption taking hold of his administration. Some examples stated by the critics include Goondas act in 1982 and other acts that limited political criticism in the media, which led to a "police state" during his administration. While these criticisms have been in the minority, supporters of MGR counter that most of these problems were a result of the party members serving MGR rather than the leader himself. While he is not considered a divisive figure in the state, critics and supporters alike agree that his charisma and popularity trumped policy decisions that led to his eventual success during his tenure as chief minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/2939|author=Ingrid Widlund |title=A Vote for MGR Transaction and Devotion in South Indian Politics |volume=96|issue= 3 |year=1993|journal=Statsvetenskaplig tidskrifts|pages=225–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natwar Singh]] in his autobiography [[One Life is Not Enough]] alleges that M.G. Ramachandra covertly supported the cause of independent [[Tamil Eelam]] and financed the [[LTTE]] and their cadres were being given military training in Tamil Nadu. He also alleges that M.G.R considered [[Jaffna]] an extension of Tamil Nadu and without informing the Indian Government at the time, had gifted 40 million rupees to the [[LTTE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

MGR has been accused of being intolerant towards the media. In April 1987, the Editor of [[Ananda Vikatan]] [[S. Balasubramanian]] was sentenced to 3 months in jail by the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly]] for publishing a cartoon, depicting government ministers as bandits and lawmakers as pickpockets, though specific legislature was not specified. But due to media outcry, he was released and [[S. Balasubramanian]] later won a case against his arrest. Earlier, Vaniga Otrumai editor A.M. Paulraj was sentenced to 2 weeks imprisonment by the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly]] for his writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/arrest-of-ananda-vikattin-editor-another-press-vs-ramachandran-government-battle/1/336963.html | title=Arresting affair Arrest of Ananda Vikattin editor another press vs Ramachandran Government battle | publisher=[[India Today]] | work=S.H.

====Bharat Ratna====
[[File:MGR Statue at the MGR Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|MGR's statue at the MGR Memorial]]
After his death in 1987, he became the second Chief Minister from the state of Tamil Nadu to receive the [[Bharat Ratna]]. The timing of the award was controversial, due to the fact that it was given so quickly after his death and he was elected as Chief Minister only 11 years before the award. Many opponents, mostly outside Tamil Nadu, criticised then ruling party [[Indian National Congress|INC]], under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] to have influenced the selection committee to give the award to help win the upcoming [[Indian general election, 1989|1989 Lok Sabha election]]. The ruling party forming a coalition with [[Jayalalithaa]], the successor to MGR at that time, were able to sweep [[Tamil Nadu]], winning [[Indian general election in Tamil Nadu, 1989|38 out of 39 seats]], INC were however unable to win nationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merinews.com/article/bharat-ratna--isnt-the-arbitrary-selection--politics-making-this-highest-civilian-award-controversy-prone/15892132.shtml Bharat Ratna- Isn't the arbitrary selection &amp; politics making this highest civilian award controversy prone?].

====Commemorative Coins====
To commemorate MGR's Birth centenary in 2017, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India decided to issue ₹100 and ₹5 coins that would bear his image as a portrait along with an inscription of "DR. M. G. Ramachandran Birth Centenary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-to-mint-5-100-coins-to-commemorate-mgrs-birth-centenary/article19672634.ece Centre to mint ₹5, ₹100 coins to commemorate MGR’s birth centenary].

==Illness and death==
[[File:Chennai India.jpg|right|thumb|[[MGR Memorial|MGR's tomb and memorial]] at [[Marina beach]], Chennai]]
In October 1984, M. G. R. was diagnosed with kidney failure, which was further complicated by [[diabetes]], a mild heart attack and a massive stroke. He was rushed to the [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center|Downstate Medical Center]] in [[New York City]], United States for treatment, undergoing a kidney transplant. He returned to Chennai on 4 February 1985. He was sworn in as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for the third consecutive term on 10 February 1985. The next 2&amp;nbsp;years and 10&amp;nbsp;months were spent in frequent trips to the United States for treatment.

MGR never fully recovered from his illness and died on 24 December 1987 at 3:30&amp;nbsp;am in his Ramavaram Gardens residence in Manapakkam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/m.g.-ramachandran-death-marks-the-passing-of-an-era-of-stability-in-tamil-nadu/1/328814.html|title=M.G.

His death sparked off a frenzy of looting and rioting all over the state. Shops, cinemas, buses and other public and private property became the target of violence let loose. The police had to resort issuing shoot-at-sight orders. Schools and colleges immediately announced the holidays till the situation came in control. The violence during the funeral alone left 29 people dead and 47 police personnel badly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73864408.html?dids=73864408:73864408&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=DEC+25%2C+1987&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Popular+Tamil+Leader+Dies+in+India%3BRioting%2C+Suicides+Follow+Death+of+Tamil+Nadu's+Chief+Minister&amp;pqatl=google |title=Popular Tamil Leader Dies in India;Rioting, Suicides Follow Death of Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=25 December 1987 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB36DA04F1B596C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Tamil leader's death stirs India riots | date=26 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ma'ad''' ibn [[Adnan]] is an ancient ancestor of [[Qusai ibn Kilab]] and his descendant the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. He is featured in ancient Arabic literature.

==Origin==
According to traditions, Ma'ad is the son of [[Adnan]], the father of a group of the [[Ishmaelites|Ishmaelite Arabs]] who inhabited West and Northern Arabia. Adnan is believed by Arab genealogies to be the father of many [[Ishmaelites|Ishmaelite]] tribes along the Western coast of [[Arabia]] and the [[Nejd]].&lt;ref&gt;The chosen record of the Ancestries of Arab tribes, Abd al-Rahman al-Mughiri, Volume 1, Page 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clans of Iraq, Abbas Al-Azzawi, Volume 1, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya|The Beginning and the End]], [[Ibn Kathir]] Volume 2, Page 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulfilling the need of Knowing the origins of Arabs, [[Ahmad al-Qalqashandi]], Volume 1, Page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was reported, Ma'ad was first born of Adnan He Is Born 598 BCE .&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Page: 381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Record of Ibn Khaldun, Vol. 2, Page: 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasab Quraysh (The Genealogy of Quraysh), [[Ibn Hazm]], Page: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Record of At-Tabari, Vol. 2, Page: 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nihayat Al-Arab Fe Ma'rifat Ansab Al-Arab (Fulfilling the need of Knowing the origins of Arabs), Vol. 2, Page: 352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Ma'ad was the father of four sons: [[Nizar ibn Ma'ad|Nizar]], Quda'a, Qunus and Iyad. Quda'a was the first-born and so Ma'ad ibn Adnan was known by his [[Kunya (Arabic)|Kunya]] "Abu Quda'a." &lt;ref name="Ishaq"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Ibn Ishaq]]|first=[[Muhammad ibn Ishaq|Muhammad]]|title=The Life of Muhammad|page=4|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===In Pre-Islamic Arabia===
From the poems composed by Pre-Islamic poets, and from their statements, it can be concluded that Ma'ad was more venerated and more important than his father [[Adnan]], evidenced by the number of times when he was mentioned in Pre-Islamic poetries, and how he was described and honored by his descendants's tribes when boasting against other tribes, some other poets even considered it as "disgrace" not to be a descendant of [[Adnan]] and Ma'ad.&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Page: 379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ihsan Abbas, The "Divan" (Collection of Poems) of Labeed ibn Rabi'a (1962-Kuwait), Page: 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other poems also celebrated and honored the victory of the people of Ma'ad against the tribe of [[Madh'hij]] in South Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Page: 379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Salam, Tabaqat Ash-Shu'araa (The Ranks of Poets),Page: 5&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] attacked the [[Qedarites|Qedarite Arabs]] during the time of [[Adnan]], Ma'ad was sent away by his father, and after the defeat of the [[Qedarite]] and the death of both [[Adnan]] and [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], many [[Adnanites]] who were not forced to live in [[Mesopotamia]] have fled away to [[Yemen]], but Ma'ad, as the successor of his father, ordered them to return to [[Hijaz]] and Northern [[Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Page: 381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Record of Ibn Khaldun, Vol. 2, Page: 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], Tareekh Al-Umam Wa Al-Mulook (The History of Nations and Kings),Vol. 1, Page: 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Yaqut Al-Hamawi]], [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan|The Dictionary of Countries]], Vol. 3, Pages: 377-380&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat and displacement of the people of Ma'ad seemed to be viewed by Pre-Islamic [[Arabs]] as a disastrous event, so that it was used as a proverbial measure in describing the horror of their later defeats.&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Page: 381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Historical and Geographical Record of Abu Ubayd Al-Bakri, Vol. 1, Page: 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pre-Islamic Poetry===

Ma'ad, unlike his father, was mentioned countless times by Pre-Islamic Arab poets across the whole [[Arabian Peninsula]], including [[Ghassanid]] and [[Arab Christians|Christian]] poets,  even in the famous [[Mu'allaqat|Seven Mu'allaqat]].

From those poems, it can be seen that Ma'ad was venerated by Pre-Islamic [[Arabs]], and for some reason, they believed that all the glories throughout the whole Arab history is considered nothing when compared to the glory of Ma'ad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ignác Goldziher]] - [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|Muhammedanische Studien 1]], Page: 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Pages: 382-383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Az-Zain &amp; Mahmood Abu Al-Wafa, The "Divan" (Collection of Poems) of the people of the tribe of Huthayl (1965-Cairo), Vol. 1, Page: 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Az-Zauzani, Sharh Al-Mu'allqat As-Sab'a, Page: 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Asfahani, Kitab Al-Aghani (The Book of Songs), Vol. 11, Pages: 11-58-100-150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Hasan Fa'ur, The "Divan" (Collection of Poems) of Zuhair Ibn Abi Salam (1988), Page: 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mufdhaliyyat (The Compositions of Al-Mufdhaly), Pages: 47-293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd Rabbih Al-Andalusi, Al-Eqd Al-Fareed, Vol. 1, Page: 309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Ahmad Ibn Yahya Al-Balatheri, Ansab Al-Ashraf (Genealogies of Honorable People), Vol. 1, Page: 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Abu Sa'eed As-Sukkari, Sharh Ash'ar Al-Huthaliyyeen (The Explanation of the poems of the people of the tribe of "Huthayl"), Vol. 1, Page: 88&lt;/ref&gt;

From some other poems, it appears that the nation of Ma'ad presented a large majority among Pre-Islamic [[Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Pages: 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abd A. Mahna, The "Divan" (Collection of Poems) of Hassan Ibn Thabet (1994), Page:44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abd Ar-Rahman Al-Barqouqi, Explanation of the "Divan" (Collection of Poems) of Hassan Ibn Thabet (1929), Page: 398&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Nabataean Inscriptions===

Ma'ad was mentioned by name in the [[Namara inscription]] as a nation that was conquered by the [[Lakhmid]] king [[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr]], along with other Arab nation from North, Central-West and South Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;James A.

From some of the reports of about the relations between the [[Lakhmids]] and the nation of Ma'ad, it can be concluded that the kings of the Northern Arab kingdoms feared them and viewed them as mighty opponent because of their powerful war tactics, even when they conquered them, they treated their kings with high respect as important people, and gave them large conquered colonies to rule, as reported in the [[Namara inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Pages: 386&lt;/ref&gt; Such views are also supported by the Classical Arabic writings.&lt;ref&gt; Al-Asfahani, Kitab Al-Aghani (The Book of Songs), Vol. 2, Pages: 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Abu Al-Hasan Ibn Ali Al-Mas'udi, Murooj Ath-Thahab Wa Jawhar Al-Ma'adin, Vol. 1, Page: 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Roman-Byzantine Writings===

The nation of Ma'ad was mentioned by the Byzantine historian [[Procopius|Procopius of Caesarea]] (c. AD 500 – c. AD 565) in his historical record of wars in during his lifetime "''Wars of Justinian''".

He mentioned that a [[Saracen]] nation named "''Maddeni''" (Ma'ad) were subjects with the kingdom of the "''Homeritae''" ([[Himyarites]]), and that the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian]] sent a letter to the [[Himyarite]] king ordering him to assemble an army of Himyarite soldiers and from Ma'ad under the leadership of a king of the nation of Ma'ad named "''Kaisus''" (Qays) in order to attack the borders of the [[Sasanian Empire]], and then approved the leader of Ma'ad as a king on the region.&lt;ref&gt;H.B Dewing, Procopius's History of Wars, Page: 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jawwad Ali, The Detailed History of Arabs before Islam (1993), University of Baghdad, Vol.1, Pages: 386-387&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mazari''' (singular Mazrouei or Mazrui) is a tribe of the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazari settled throughout the [[Trucial States]] but principally in [[Abu Dhabi]]. They are considered a subsection of the [[Bani Yas]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and formed the majority of the [[Bedouin]] component of that federation of tribes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=29|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liwa ==
The [[Liwa Oasis]] was the homeplace of many of the Mazari, where they were the principal property owners of the six Bani Yas tribes in the area, consisting of some 315 houses at the turn of the 20th century. They were closely associated with the [[Marar]] at Liwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=32|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time there were also some 300 Mazari at [[Al Khan]] in [[Sharjah]] and 500 in the areas of [[Adhen, Ras Al Khaimah|Adhen]] and [[Asimah]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those of the Mazari who settled in [[Dubai]] came to consider themselves as apart from the Bani Yas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=242|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were herdsmen and records show they settled into an agrarian existence in the oasis following the decline in the value of camels and the use of traditional [[camel train]]s which took place in the Trucial States during the early 20th century. They were also involved in the seasonal pearl fisheries. Like their Bedouin counterparts the [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]], many Mazari found employment in the burgeoning oil industry as modernisation forced changes in the lifestyle of the Bedouin of the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Mazari also formed the second largest Bedouin contingent among the Ruler's retainers, being said to be loyal and "in their bedu fashion, disciplined."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=206|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict and schism ==
When [[Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan|Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan]] repelled the [[Emirate of Nejd|Wahhabis]] from the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]] in 1848, it was the Mazari, together with the Manasir, who waited South of Abu Dhabi to fall on the relieving force send from [[Najd|Nejd]] under Saad bin Mutlaq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=431|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two tribes were also linked in events further north, where they were involved in a conflict with the ''wali'' of Al Khan, Muhamad bin Ubaid in 1920. Some 75 pearling boats sailed from Al Khan each season, owned by settled Mazari and Manasir families. However, the village was frequently plundered by Bedouin Mazari and [[Al Bu Shamis]], the Ruler of Sharjah, [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi]], and the ''wali'' being accused of doing little to protect the village, whilst also insisting on a tribute of 50 bags of rice at the commencement of each pearling season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=99|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''wali'' died in 1931, the village appointed its own headman – a move which was punished by Sultan bin Saqr, who replaced the murdered headman with his brother Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=100|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outbreak of hostilities between the Bedouin tribes of Dhafra (the area between Abu Dhabi and the [[Rub' al Khali|Rub Al Kali)]] in the early 20th century rumbled on until the early 1920s, with the Mazari split between a group who sought Saudi protection and a group who migrated to Abu Dhabi and its islands. After [[Hamdan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan|Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] arranged a truce, the Mazari returned to Dhafra but fighting between the tribes continued: a conflict used by [[Ibn Saud|Abdelaziz Ibn Saud]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] to increase his influence over the tribes and exact the tax [[zakat]] from them. These shifting allegiances and schisms were to form part of the Saudi claims which led to the [[Buraimi Dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=82-3|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent Mazari today ==
A prominent UAE trading family today, one of its most notable members is the UAE's Minister of State for Youth Affairs, [[Shamma Al Mazrui|Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui]] who, in February 2016, became the youngest government minister in the world.

'''Mazen Abdul-Jawad''' (born 1977) is a [[Saudi Arabian]] man who spoke about his sexual exploits on television in July 2009. He was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes for talking publicly about sex. After the program by the [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]] (LBC) which included his comments aired, the Saudi government shut down the LBC's two offices in the country.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Television appearance==
Abdul-Jawad is a 32-year-old sales clerk for [[Saudi Arabian Airlines|Saudi Airlines]] and a divorced father of four.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;Paul Handley, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iztmpyrcMUEBytzOtpjq4ekj63KA Saudi sex braggart gets five years in jail, 1,000 lashes for], AFP 07-10-2009&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]] satellite TV program ''[[Bold Red Line]]'' on July 15, 2009, and discussed his personal sexual exploits. On the show, Jawad talked about having sex at the age of 14 with a neighbour and picking up women using the Bluetooth function on his cellphone&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; (as they are forbidden to interact with men in public), and revealed a recipe for an [[aphrodisiac]].&lt;ref&gt;Layalina Staff (2009). [http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_V.16/PR_V.16_0730_09.pdf The Layalina Review On Public Diplomacy And Arab Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183930/http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_V.16/PR_V.16_0730_09.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}. ''The Layalina Review.'' '''5''' (16):1&amp;ndash;17.&lt;/ref&gt; The program also showed Abdul-Jawad leading viewers into his bedroom, dominated by red accessories, and showing off sex toys, which were blurred for viewing. Later, three male friends join him for a discussion on what turns them on.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
Jawad was arrested on July 31 for publicising vice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=125095&amp;d=2&amp;m=8&amp;y=2009&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom|title=Sex braggart did not resist: Police|date=2 August 2009 (11 Sha`ban 1430)|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8180034.stm|title=Saudi TV sex boast man arrested|date=1 August 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Saudi religious and judicial authorities received what they said were hundreds of complaints from the public regarding the program.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; A police spokesman in Jeddah said that Abdul Jawad's appearance had violated Saudi Arabia's Islamic [[Sharia]] law code and was against Saudi customs.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; 

An anonymous source from the Saudi [[Prosecution and Investigation Commission]] (PIC) stated that the prosecution might request charging Jawad and the other defendants for [[Hirabah]], a crime defined as "waging unlawful warfare (in speech or action) against the state and society". The punishment for such a crime would be [[beheading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=125136&amp;d=4&amp;m=8&amp;y=2009&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom|title=Sex braggart may face death|date=4 August 2009 (13 Sha`ban 1430)|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2009, Jawad was convicted by a [[Jeddah]] court on charges based on Sharia law.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and 1,000 [[Flagellation|lashes]]. The sentence also includes a ban on travel and talking to the media for five years after his release.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;Abu-Nasr, Donna (October 7, 2009).

The other three men on the show were also convicted of discussing sex publicly. They were sentenced to two years imprisonment and 300 lashes each.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; A cameraman who helped film the episode was sentenced to two months in jail.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; A female journalist at LBC, one of two arrested, was sentenced to 60 lashes.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Sebastian (October 24, 2009). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8324117.stm Lashes for Saudi woman journalist]. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements==
Jawad's lawyer, Sulaiman al-Jumeii, said the case should not be considered closed, and that he planned to appeal the court's ruling, claiming that the decision was made "under pressure from public opinion". He maintained that Jawad was not referring to his own sexual experiences and that the toys shown on the program were not his own. He further argued that the case was tried before the wrong court, and that it should have been heard by a specialized court at the Information Ministry qualified to issue decisions regarding technical issues related to the case.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

Al-Jumeii filed a lawsuit against LBC, maintaining that his client was duped by the media corporation and was unaware in many cases he was being recorded.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Other==
On August 7, [[YouTube]] disabled comments for the video clip of the program. Before the clip was blocked by the [[Censorship in Saudi Arabia|government censor]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], it was viewed more than 430,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUcwbzfNZGVxgIUAv9-rqiF3IC-g|title=Saudi may shut TV offices over 'sex' talk show: report|last=Handley|first=Paul|date=2009-08-05|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milly Witkop(-Rocker)''' (March 3, 1877{{spaced ndash}}November 23, 1955) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born [[Jew]]ish [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[feminism|feminist]] writer and activist. She was the [[common-law marriage|common-law wife]] of the prominent anarcho-syndicalist leader [[Rudolf Rocker]]. The couple's son, [[Fermin Rocker]], was an artist.

==Early life and period in London==
Witkop was born Vitkopski in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[shtetl]] of [[Zlatopol]] to a Jewish Ukrainian-Russian family as the oldest of four sisters. The youngest of the four, [[Rose Witcop|Rose]], also became a well-known anarchist. In 1894, Witkop left the Ukraine for [[London]]. In the decades following the 1881 assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], many Jews left Russia as a result of [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]] throughout the Empire. Most went to the United Kingdom or the United States.&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Wolf 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Zsherminal.jpg|right|thumb|December 1906 edition of ''Germinal'']]
In London, she worked in a tailoring sweatshop and saved enough money to finance her parents' and sisters' passage to England. The hard conditions she worked under led her to question her faith. Her involvement in a bakers' strike led her to become involved with the group around the [[Jewish anarchist]] newspaper ''[[Arbayter Fraynd]]''. She became influenced by the works of the anarchist theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. In 1895, she first met Rudolf Rocker in the course of her political work. In May 1898, Rocker invited her to accompany him to [[New York City]], where he hoped to find employment. The two were, however, not admitted to the country, because they refused to get married legally and were returned to the United Kingdom with the same ship on which they had reached the United States. The matter received some newspaper coverage in the United States at the time, attacking the couple's love without marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman 1974, pg. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1898, Rocker and Witkop co-edited the ''Arbeyter Fraynd''. In March 1900, the two also started publishing the newspaper ''[[Germinal (journal)|Germinal]]'', which was more focused on cultural topics. In 1907, the couple's son, Fermin, was born. Rocker and Witkop were opposed to [[World War I]] after it broke out in 1914, unlike many other anarchists such as Kropotkin, who supported the Allied cause. To ease the poverty and deprivation caused by the joblessness that accompanied the war, Witkop and her husband opened a soup kitchen. In December 1914, however, Rocker like many Germans and Austrians in the UK, was interned as an enemy alien. Witkop continued her anti-war activities until she was also arrested in 1916. She remained imprisoned until the autumn of 1918. She then left the United Kingdom to join her husband and son in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

==Germany==
At first, the couple welcomed the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s in [[Russia]], but after the Bolshevik coup they started criticizing the [[statism]] and [[totalitarianism]] of what would become the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1918, they moved to [[Berlin]]; Rocker had been invited by [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (FVdG) chairman [[Fritz Kater]] to join him in building up what would become the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]] (FAUD), an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union.&lt;ref&gt;Vallance 1973, pg. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rocker and Witkop became members of the FAUD.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;
{{Anarcho-syndicalism sidebar}}
After its founding in early 1919, a discussion about the role of girls and women in the union started. The male-dominated organization had at first ignored gender issues, but soon women started founding their own unions, which were organized parallel to the regular unions, but still formed part of the FAUD. Witkop was one of the leading founders of the Women's Union in Berlin in 1920. On October 15, 1921, the women's unions held a national congress in [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Syndicalist Women's Union]] (SFB) was founded on a national level. Shortly thereafter, Witkop drafted ''Was will der Syndikalistische Frauenbund?'' (''What Does the Syndicalist Women's Union Want?'') as a platform for the SFB. From 1921, the ''Der Frauenbund'' was published as a supplement to the FAUD organ ''[[Der Syndikalist]]'', Witkop was one of its primary writers.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

Witkop reasoned that proletarian women were exploited not only by capitalism like male workers, but also by their male counterparts. She contended therefore that women must actively fight for their rights, much like workers must fight capitalism for theirs. She also insisted on the necessity of women taking part in class struggle. Housewives could use boycotts to support this struggle. From this, she concluded the necessity of an autonomous women's organization in the FAUD. Witkop also held that domestic work should be deemed equally valuable to wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;Rübner 1994, pg. 185–189.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1921 article in ''Der Frauenbund'', Witkop argued that the most important issue facing the SFB was the "sexual issue". She called for access to [[birth control]] and advocated a childbearing strike. A debate on the issue within the German syndicalist movement ensued. Meetings on the issue were well-attended meetings and new SFB chapers were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles 2000, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
She was not only active in the syndicalist and feminist movement, but also worked to fight racism and anti-Semitism. She was often frustrated by what she considered an unwillingness to fight anti-Semitism in the labor movement. The rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany in the late 1920s greatly troubled Witkop. After the [[Reichstag fire]] in February 1933, Witkop and Rocker fled Germany for the United States via Switzerland, France, and the UK. In the US, the couple continued to give lectures and write about anarchist topics. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] from 1936 to 1939, they started an awareness campaign to educate Americans about the events in Spain. In Fall 1937, the two moved to the Mohegan Commune near [[Lake Mohegan, New York|Lake Mohegan]] in [[Crompond, New York|Crompond]]. After World War II broke out, Witkop, like her husband and other anarchists such as [[Max Nettlau]] and [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], supported the Allies because she felt Nazism could not be defeated with pacifist means.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

After World War II, Witkop had some sympathy for the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, but was skeptical as to whether a nation state could solve the "Jewish question". She favored the idea of bi-nationality developed by [[Martin Buber]] and [[Ahad Ha'am]]. The Mohegan commune, especially Witkop, was active in sending material support to German anarchists. They sent several hundred packages to Germany.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

Witkop died on November 23, 1955. She had been suffering from difficulties of breathing for months.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

'''Moncure Daniel Conway''' (March 17, 1832 – November 15, 1907) was an American [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] minister. At various times [[Methodist]], [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian]], and a [[Freethought]], the radical writer descended from patriotic and patrician families of Virginia and Maryland but spent most of the final four decades of his life abroad in England and France, where he wrote biographies of [[Edmund Randolph]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Thomas Paine]] and his own autobiography. He led freethinkers in London's South Place Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/conway_moncure_daniel_1832-1907|title=Conway, Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Conway's parents descended from the [[First Families of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/people/moncure-daniel-conway-1832-1907|title=Moncure Daniel Conway (1832-1907) - Dickinson College|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Walter Peyton Conway, was a wealthy slave-holding gentleman farmer, county judge, and state representative; his home, known as the [[Conway House (Falmouth, Virginia)|Conway House]], still stands at 305 King Street (also known as River Road), along the [[Rappahannock River]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/moncureconway.html|title=Aboard the Underground Railroad-- Rush R. Sloane House|first=Sarah Dillard|last=Pope|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway's mother, Margaret Stone Daniel Conway, was the granddaughter of [[Thomas Stone]] of Maryland (a signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]]), and in addition to running the household, also practiced [[homeopathy]] learned from her doctor father. Both parents were [[Methodists]], his father having left the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church, his mother the [[Presbyterian]], and they hosted Methodist meetings in their home until a suitable church was finally built in Fredericksburg. An uncle, Judge Eustace Conway, advocated states' rights in Virginia's General Assembly (as did Walter Conway). Another uncle, [[Richard C.L. Moncure]], served on what later became the [[Virginia Supreme Court]], was a layman in the Episcopal Church, and became known for his integrity and hatred of intolerance. His great-uncle, [[Peter Vivian Daniel]], served on the United States Supreme Court, where he upheld slavery and the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], including in the [[Dred Scott Decision]] of 1857.

Two of his three brothers later fought for the Confederacy. His opposition to slavery reportedly came from his mother's side of the family, including his great-grandfather Travers Daniel (justice of the Stafford Court, died 1824)&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother herself (who fled to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] and lived with her daughter and son-in-law Professor Marsh after the Civil War broke out) as well as from his boyhood experiences. Nonetheless, during his youth, Moncure Conway briefly took a pro-slavery position under the influence of a cousin, Richmond editor [[John Moncure Daniel]], himself a protege of Justice Daniel.

==Early life==
Conway was born in [[Falmouth, Virginia]],

After attending the [[Fredericksburg Classical and Mathematical Academy]] (alma mater of [[George Washington]] and other famous Virginians), Conway followed his elder brother to Methodist-affiliated [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1849. During his time at Dickinson, Conway helped found the college's first student publication and was influenced by Professor [[John McClintock (theologian)|John McClintock]], which caused him to embrace Methodism as well as an anti-slavery position, although that controversy was starting to split the denomination. In Fredericksburg, uncle Eustace funded the pro-slavery Southern Conference faction and his father the at-least-theoretically anti-slavery Baltimore Conference faction.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Cincinnati]] as discussed below, Conway married [[Ellen Davis Dana]]. She was a fellow Unitarian, [[feminist]], and abolitionist. The couple had three sons (two of whom survived childhood) and a daughter during their long marriage, which ended with her death from cancer in 1898. Despite the previous tension with his own family over his opposition to slavery, Moncure Conway nevertheless brought his bride to meet them, during which Ellen broke a Southern social constraint by hugging and kissing a young slave girl in front of family members; after this, it would take 17 years before Conway reconciled with his family.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Career==

After studying law for a year in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], partly out of a moral crisis caused by seeing a lynching of a black man whose retrial had been ordered by the Court of Appeals,&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography pp. 78-81&lt;/ref&gt; Conway became a circuit-riding [[Methodist]] minister. Conway had self-published his first pamphlet in 1850, "Free Schools in Virginia: A Plea of Education, Virtue and Thrift, vs. Ignorance, Vice and Poverty", but had been unable to convince local politicians to follow his recommendations, particularly as the pro-slavery faction believed such universal education influenced by Northern mores.&lt;ref name="encyclopediavirginia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/conway_moncure_daniel_1832-1907#start_entry|title=Conway, Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Rockville Circuit included his native state and [[Washington, D.C.]] through [[Rockville, Maryland]], where he became acquainted with the Quaker [[Roger Brooke]], whom he considered his first avowed abolitionist, despite his familial relation to the jurist [[Roger Brooke Taney]].&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography pp. 92-94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, after being reassigned to a circuit around [[Frederick, Maryland]] and shortly after his beloved elder brother Peyton died of [[typhoid fever]] and his assistant Becky of another, Moncure Conway left the Methodist church and entered the [[Harvard University]] school of divinity to continue his spiritual journey. Before graduating in 1854, he met [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and fell under the influence of [[Transcendentalism]], as well as became an outspoken abolitionist after discussions with [[Theodore Parker]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Wendell Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/moncureconway.html|title=Moncure Conway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In America===
After graduating from Harvard, Conway accepted a call to the [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|First Unitarian Church]] of [[Washington, D.C.]], but he was invited to seek another position after enunciating abolitionist views. Moreover, when Conway returned to his native Virginia, his rumored connection with an attempt to rescue the fugitive slave [[Anthony Burns]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] (whose master Conway had known in Stafford, Virginia before their move to Alexandria, and who was ultimately purchased by an abolitionist and set free) aroused bitter hostility among his old neighbors and friends, as well as family. Conway fled being tarred and feathered in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Goolrick, Historic Fredericksburg: the story of an old town (Whittet &amp; Shepperson, Richmond, 1922), o. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, almost at once, Conway was invited to preach sermons at the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He served as minister at that anti-slavery congregation from late 1855 until after the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. However, when in 1859, he announced to the congregation that he no longer believed in miracles or Christ's divinity, a third of the congregation left—but the "Free Church" survived.&lt;ref name="encyclopediavirginia.org"/&gt; Conway also edited a short-lived liberal periodical called ''The Dial'' in 1860-1861, linking his emerging spiritual views to his Transcendentalist background. In Cincinnati he became more acquainted with Jews and Catholics, and counseled against discriminating against them because of their religions. However, not all his abolitionist friends agreed with his pacificism, especially his condemnation of John Brown' raid at Harper's Ferry (though he also expressed disappointment at Virginia's bellicose response).

===Civil War===
Conway had become editor of the anti-slavery weekly ''Commonwealth'' in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and in 1861, Conway published semi-anonymously ''The Rejected Stone; or Insurrection vs. Resurrection in America'', identifying himself only as a "Native of Virginia". The book was published in three editions and ultimately handed out to Union soldiers after the start of the [[American Civil War]]. During the next year, Conway advocated abolition, including in a Smithsonian lecture series in Washington, D.C., which earned him and the more moderate Unitarian minister [[William Henry Channing]] a meeting with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to discuss his argument that announcing abolition would weaken the Confederacy. While in Washington, D.C., Conway located several dozen of his father's slaves who had fled from Virginia into Georgetown. Conway secured train tickets and safe-conduct passes for them, and escorted them on a dangerous trip through Maryland to safety in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], where he believed they would be safe due to the town's accepting culture.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22595-2004Aug21.html|title=From 1850s Virginia, an Abolitionist Hero Emerges (washingtonpost.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Union occupation before the devastating [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], Conway also returned home to Falmouth in 1862, and learned that his family's house had been spared from destruction because of its association with him, although it was commandeered for use as a hospital for wounded soldiers (at which [[Walt Whitman]] would nurse).&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography pp. 316-18&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, Conway published another powerful plea for emancipation, ''The Golden Hour'' (1862). On New Year's Day, 1863 (also called Emancipation Day, because President Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], news of which reached Boston by telegraph), Conway with fellow abolitionists [[Julia Ward Howe]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]], [[George Luther Stearns]] and [[Wendell Phillips]] unveiled a marble bust of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at Stearns' home.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan J. Kytle, Romantic Reformers and the Antislavery Struggle in the Civil War Era (Cambridge University Press, 2014) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1862, after spending more and more time away from his church advancing the abolitionist cause, and growing dissatisfied with the theological, liturgical, and [[social conservatism]] of mainstream Unitarianism, Conway left that denomination's ministry, after which he maintained an uneasy and uncertain relationship with Unitarianism in America and subsequently in England until he and Ellen made a clean break.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===London===
In April 1863&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson.edu"/&gt; Fellow American abolitionists sent Conway to London to convince the [[United Kingdom]] that the [[American Civil War]] was primarily a war of abolition and to not support the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Under English influence, Conway eventually contacted [[James Murray Mason]], representative of the [[Confederate States of America]] to Britain "on behalf of the leading antislavery men of America", offering withdrawal of support for prosecution of the war in exchange for emancipation of the slaves. Mason publicly rejected the overture, embarrassing Conway's sponsors, who quickly and angrily withdrew support. Moreover, Conway had to apologize to U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]], who could have caused revocation of his passport for attempting to speak as a private citizen for the U.S. government.

[[File:Photo of Moncure D. Conway.jpg|thumb|left|Moncure Daniel Conway]]
Rather than go back to America, where Conway no longer felt welcome as a suspected traitor to his childhood Virginia friends and neighbors, and where he paid someone to take his place after being drafted to serve in the Union army, Conway traveled to Italy. There he reunited with his wife and children in [[Venice]] before moving back to London. There in 1864 he became minister of the South Place Chapel (serving in 1864–65 and 1893–97) as well as leader of the then named [[South Place Religious Society]] in [[Finsbury, London, England|Finsbury, London]]. Conway continued writing and publishing, including articles in both British and American magazines, and traveled to Paris and even Russia.&lt;ref name="Goolrick p. 100"&gt;Goolrick p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a war correspondent during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. Conway published biographies of [[Edmund Randolph]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Thomas Paine]], as well as acted as the American agent for [[Robert Browning]] and the London literary agent for [[Walt Whitman]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Louisa May Alcott]], and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].

Conway also abandoned [[theism]] after his son Emerson died in 1864. His thinking continued to move from Emersonian [[transcendentalism]] toward a more [[humanism|humanistic]] [[Freethought]]. He conducted funeral services for his friend [[Artemus Ward]], as well as preached memorial at memorial services for many other famous literary figures. Moreover, women were allowed to preach at South Place Chapel, among them [[Annie Besant]], whom Mrs. Conway had befriended.&lt;ref name="Goolrick p. 100"/&gt; However, the South Place congregation and Conway soon left fellowship with the Unitarian Church.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} For a year from November 1865 [[Cleveland Hall, London|Cleveland Hall]] was leased for Sunday evenings so Conway could "address the working classes." However, the audience consisted of well-dressed lower-middle-class people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|page=48 |last=Conway|first=Moncure Daniel|title=Autobiography: Memories and Experiences of Moncure Daniel Conway |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44kzAeY-NOUC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2013-08-27 |date=2012-06-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-05061-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conway remained the leader of South Place until 1886, when [[Stanton Coit]] took his place. Under Coit's leadership South Place was renamed to the [[Conway Hall Ethical Society|South Place Ethical Society]]. However Coit's tenure ended in 1892 in a losing power struggle, and Conway resumed leadership until his death.

Conway attended the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] of radicals [[Peter Alfred Taylor|Peter]] and [[Clementia Taylor]] at [[Aubrey House]] in [[Campden Hill]], West London. He also was a member of Clementia's "Pen and Pencil Club", at which young writers and artists read and exhibited their works.&lt;ref name="Conway2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moncure Daniel Conway|title=Autobiography Memories and Experiences of Moncure Daniel Conway. Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDdBZXAfkSgC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=June 2001|publisher=Elibron.com|isbn=978-1-4021-6692-1|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway moved to Notting Hill to be near the Taylors at Aubrey House.&lt;ref name="Conway2001"/&gt;

In 1868 Conway was one of four speakers at the first open public meeting in support of [[women's suffrage]] in [[Great Britain]]. His many literary and intellectual friends included [[Charles Dickens]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Charles Lyell]], and [[Charles Darwin]].

In the 1870s and 1880s Conway returned occasionally to the United States, where he reconciled with his Virginia family in 1875, as well as toured in the West about Demonology and the famous Englishmen he knew. In 1897 Conway and his terminally-ill (from cancer) wife Ellen returned from London to [[New York City]] to fulfill her wish of dying on American soil; she died on Christmas Day; their son Dana also died that year. As the [[Spanish–American War]] approached, Conway turned toward pacifism and became disaffected with his countrymen, moving to France to devote much of the rest of his life to the peace movement and writing. However, he occasionally returned to Fredericksburg, which had come to admire his cultural accomplishments. Conway also traveled to India, about which he wrote shortly before his death.

===India===

Conway visited [[India]] and described his experiences in ''My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East'', 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wouter Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff, Wouter J]]. (1997). ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought''. State University of New York Press. p. 457. {{ISBN|0-7914-3854-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He visited [[Helena Blavatsky]] in 1884 and denounced the [[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett|Mahatma letters]] as fraudulent. He suggested that [[Koot Hoomi]] was a fictitious creation of Blavatsky.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Moncure D. (1906). ''My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East''. Houghton, Mifflin and Company. pp. 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; Conway wrote that Blavatsky "created the imaginary Koothoomi (originally Kothume) by piecing together parts of the names of her two chief disciples, [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] and [[Allan Octavian Hume|Hume]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Versluis|Versluis, Arthur]]. (1993). ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions''. Oxford University Press. p. 291. {{ISBN|0-19-507658-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Conway died alone, at 75, in his apartment in [[Paris]]. His corpse was found on November 15, 1907 and was ultimately returned to [[Westchester County, New York]], for burial in Kensico cemetery.

==Legacy==
[[Conway Hall]] in [[Holborn, London]] is named in his honor. In 2004, Virginia Governor [[Mark R. Warner]] proclaimed Conway the only descendant of a Founding Father of the nation to physically lead slaves to freedom. Both Ohio and Virginia have erected historical markers in his honor, and Conway's childhood home was designated a U.S. and Virginia landmark.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

'''Nahum Tate''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|.|əm|_|ˈ|t|eɪ|t}} {{respell|NAY|əm|_|TAYT}}; 1652 – 30 July 1715) was an Irish [[poet]], [[hymnist]] and [[lyricist]], who became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|England's poet laureate]] in 1692.  Tate is best known for ''[[The History of King Lear]]'', his 1681 [[literary adaptation|adaptation]] of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]''.

==Life==
Nahum Tate was born in [[Dublin]] and came from a family of [[Puritan]] clerics. He was the son of [[Faithful Teate]], an Irish cleric&lt;ref name="life1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/nutter/hymnwriters.Tate_Nah.html%0A%09 |title=hymnwriters |access-date=13 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104075549/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/nutter/hymnwriters.Tate_Nah.html |archive-date=4 January 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been rector of [[Castleterra]], [[Ballyhaise]], until his house was burnt and his family attacked after he had passed on information to the government about plans for the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]].

After living at the provost's lodgings in [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Faithful Teate moved to England. He was the [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] at [[Greenwich|East Greenwich]] around 1650, and "preacher of the gospel" at [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]] from 1654 to 1658. He had returned to Dublin by 1660. He published a poem on the Trinity entitled ''Ter Tria'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ter Tria, or the Doctrine of the Three Sacred Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; Principal Graces, Faith, Hope, and Love; Main Duties, Prayer, Hearing, and Meditation''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some sermons, two of which he dedicated to [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver]] and [[Henry Cromwell]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tate, Nahum|first=Henry Leigh|last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nahum Teate followed his father to Trinity College, Dublin in 1668, and graduated BA in 1672. By 1676 he had moved to London and was writing for a living. The following year he had adopted the spelling "Tate", which would remain until his death. He died in 1715, in Southwark, London, England.&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/448/000098154/|title=Nahum Tate|work=nndb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[St George the Martyr, Southwark]] on 1 August 1715 as 'of next to the Prince Eugene, Mint'.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.co.uk/Browse/View.aspx?dbid=1624&amp;path=Southwark.St+George+the+Martyr.1695-1732.237|title=Pay as you go|work=ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:LearTate.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[The History of King Lear|Tate's version of ''King Lear'']]]]
Tate published a volume of poems in London in 1677, and became a regular writer for the stage. ''Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers'' (1678), a tragedy dealing with [[Dido]] and [[Aeneas]], was dedicated to [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]];&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; it was later adapted as the libretto for [[Henry Purcell]]'s opera ''[[Dido and Æneas|Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1688 or earlier).&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; ''The Loyal General'', with a prologue by [[John Dryden|Dryden]], played at the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]] in 1680.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Tate then turned to making a series of adaptations of Elizabethan dramas. His version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' altered the names of the characters, and changed the text so that every scene, to use his own words, was "full of respect to Majesty and the dignity of courts"; but in spite of these precautions ''The Sicilian Usurper'' (1681), as his rewrite was called, was suppressed on the third performance on account of a possible political interpretation.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; In 1681 [[Thomas Betterton]] played Tate's version of ''[[King Lear]]'',&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; which entirely omitted the Fool, and [[Happy ending|ended happily]] in marriage between [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]] and Edgar.&lt;ref name="kl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/tatelear.html|title=Nahum Tate, King Lear|work=rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though [[Joseph Addison]] protested at this mutilation of Shakespeare, [[Samuel Johnson]] defended the poetic justice of Tate's adaptation.)&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' became ''The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth'', played at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1682. Tate's [[farce]] ''Duke and no Duke'' (first printed 1685, but acted earlier at the Theatre Royal) imitated Sir [[Aston Cockayne]]'s ''Trappolin suppos'd a Prince''. His ''Cuckold's Haven'' (performed 1685 at the Theatre Royal) was derived from [[George Chapman|Chapman]] and [[John Marston (poet)|Marston]]'s ''[[Eastward Hoe|Eastward Ho]]''. ''The Island Princess, or the Generous Portugals'' (1687) was adapted from [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]. ''Injur'd Love, or the Cruel Husband'' (1707), altered from [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'', seems never to have been acted.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1682 Tate collaborated with [[John Dryden]] to complete the second half of his epic poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]''.&lt;ref name="aba"&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060502081228/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/737.html |url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/737.html Absalom | archivedate= 2006-05-02 |title= Absalom and Achitophel: The Second Part |quote= The success of ''Absalom and Achitophel'' was so great that Dryden was pressed by several persons to continue his satirical commentary upon the times. This he declined to do but he engaged his friend Nahum Tate (1652–1715), the poet and dramatist, to write a second part to ''Absalom and Achitophel''. He supervised and revised the whole poem and added the verses characterizing Thomas Shadwell and Elkanah Settle as Og and Doeg.|year= 2005| author= Ian Lancashire |work= Representative Poetry Online| publisher=[[University of Toronto Libraries]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''; its first known performance was in 1689. He also wrote the text for Purcell's Birthday Ode ''[[Come Ye Sons of Art]]'' in 1694. Tate also translated ''Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus'', [[Girolamo Fracastoro]]'s [[Latin]] [[pastoral]] poem on the subject of the disease of [[syphilis]], into English [[heroic couplet]]s.

Tate's name is also connected with the famous ''[[Tate and Brady|New Version of the Psalms of David]]'' (1696), for which he collaborated with [[Nicholas Brady (poet)|Nicholas Brady]]. Some items such as "As pants the hart" ([[Psalm 42]]) rise above the general level, and are said to be Tate's work.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; A supplement was licensed in 1703 which included the [[Christmas carol]] "[[While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks]]", one of a number of hymns by Tate.

His poems were sharply criticised by [[Alexander Pope]] in ''[[The Dunciad]]''.

Of his numerous poems the most original is ''Panacea, a poem on Tea'' (1700). In spite of his consistent [[Toryism]], he succeeded [[Thomas Shadwell|Shadwell]] as [[poet laureate]] in 1692. He died within the precincts of the Mint, [[Southwark]], where he had taken refuge from his creditors, in 1715.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt;

==Modern stagings==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
In 1985, the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City staged Tate's ''[[The History of King Lear|History of King Lear]]'' in its original form, "happy ending" and all, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at [[The Shakespeare Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. "Tate's ''Lear'' at Riverside", ''The New York Times'', 5 April 1985, and Howard Kissel. "''King Lear'' for Optimists", ''Women's Wear Daily'', 22 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; This included removing the Fool altogether, adding a [[confidante]] for Cordelia, named Arante, as well as an "abduction" scene of Cordelia on the heath. The play concluded with multiple happy endings: for Lear and Kent, and Cordelia and Edgar, who presumably wed after the play's conclusion. Musical interludes were sung by cast members during the act breaks, accompanied by a [[harpsichord]] in the [[orchestra pit]].

'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''' (c. 1445&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 7. Other sources give 1446, 1447 or 1444–45.&lt;/ref&gt; – May 17, 1510), known as '''Sandro Botticelli''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli|lang}}), was an [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian painter of the Early Renaissance]]. He belonged to the [[Florentine painting|Florentine School]] under the patronage of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], a movement that [[Giorgio Vasari]] would characterize less than a hundred years later in his ''Vita'' of Botticelli as a "[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]]". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.

As well as the small number of mythological subjects which are his best known works today, he painted a wide range of religious subjects and also some portraits. He and his workshop were especially known for their ''Madonna and Child''s, many in the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] shape.  Botticelli's best-known works are ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', both in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence.  He lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence, with probably his only significant time elsewhere the months he spent painting in [[Pisa]] in 1474 and the [[Sistine Chapel]] in Rome in 1481–82.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 199; Lightbown, 53 on the Pisa work, which does not survive&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only one of his paintings is dated, though others can be dated from other records with varying degrees of certainty, and the development of his style traced with confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, growing in mastery and reputation, and the 1480s were his most successful decade, when all his large mythological paintings were done, and many of his best Madonnas.  By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered, and he could be seen as moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and a new generation of painters creating the [[High Renaissance]] style as Botticelli returned in some ways to the Gothic style.

He has been described as "an outsider in the mainstream of Italian painting", who had a limited interest in many of the developments most associated with [[Quattrocento]] painting, such as the realistic depiction of human anatomy, perspective, and landscape, and the use of direct borrowings from classical art.  His training enabled him to represent all these aspects of painting, without adopting or contributing to their development.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 199–204, 203 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Via borgo ognissanti.JPG|thumb|Via Borgo Ognissanti in 2008, the church halfway down on the right. Like the street, it has had a Baroque makeover since Botticelli's time.]]
Botticelli was born in the city of [[Florence]] in a house in the street still called Via Borgo Ognissanti.  He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] ("All Saints") parish church.  His father was Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi, and Sandro was the youngest of his four children to survive into adulthood, all boys.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458 so, allowing for arguments as to what these statements really meant, dates between 1444 and 1446 are given.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  

His father was a tanner until 1460, before joining his son Antonio in a new business as a beater-out of [[gold leaf]], which would have brought them into contact with artists.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Vasari]] reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a [[goldsmith]].&lt;ref&gt;He was still in school in February 1458 (Lightbown, 19). According to Vasari, 147, he was an able pupil, but easily grew restless, and was initially apprenticed as a goldsmith.&lt;/ref&gt; He perhaps became an apprentice when he was about fourteen years old, which may indicate that he received a fuller education than many other Renaissance artists.  

The Ognissanti neighbourhood was mostly "a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen",&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18&lt;/ref&gt; but there were some rich families, notably the very rich Rucellai, bankers and wool-merchants, headed by [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai]], whose [[Palazzo Rucellai]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]], a landmark in [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], was being built between about 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years.  By 1458 Botticelli's family had moved to the same street as this, and were renting their house from another Rucellai, and there were other dealings involving the two families.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1464 his father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro returned to live in from 1470, if not before, and where he remained for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; He both lived and had his workshop in the house, by now a rather unusual practice, despite his brother Giovanni and his family also being in residence (and later another brother, Simone).&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including [[Amerigo Vespucci]], born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named.  The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; The name Botticelli, meaning "little barrel" came from his brother Giovanni's nickname of "Botticello", "apparently from an unfortunate resemblance".  By 1470 a document referred to the painter as "Sandro Mariano Botticelli", and it became his customary surname.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 7&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Botticelli 04 Louvre.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist'', c. 1470–1475, [[Louvre]]]]

==Career before Rome==
From around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to [[Filippo Lippi|Fra Filippo Lippi]], one of the top Florentine painters of the day, and one often patronized by the Medicis.  He was rather conservative in many respects, but gave Botticelli a solid training in the Florentine style and technique of the day, in panel painting, [[fresco]], and drawing.  Botticelli's paintings avoided technical short-cuts throughout his life, and when well treated they have survived in good condition for their age.   Elements in style and compositions that are reminiscent of Lippi also continue to appear throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 20–26&lt;/ref&gt; For this period Lippi was in fact based in [[Prato]], just outside Florence, painting what is now [[Prato Cathedral]], and it is there that Botticelli was trained.  He had probably left Lippi by April 1467, when the master went to work in [[Spoleto]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 22, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the past there was speculation that he had also had a period in a more progressive workshop, and both that of the [[Pollaiuolo brothers]] and [[Verrochio]] have been suggested, based on some undoubted influence these had on Botticelli's style.  Current thinking is that no actual period in a different workshop is needed to account for this.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 26; but see Hartt, 324, saying "Botticelli was active in the shop of Verrocchio".&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lippi died in 1469 and by 1470 at the latest, but probably a year or two earlier, Botticelli had his own workshop, which by 1472 included the young [[Filippino Lippi]], son of his master.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Hartt, 324; Legouix, 8&lt;/ref&gt; In June of that year he was commissioned by the judges of commercial cases to paint two panels from a set of the [[Seven Virtues]] for their court;&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 52; they were the ''Sei della Mercanzia'', a tribunal of six judges, chosed by the main [[Guilds of Florence]].&lt;/ref&gt; for some reason, only one, ''Fortitude'' (now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]]) was finished.  Botticelli both matched his style and composition to the other panels by [[Piero del Pollaiuolo]], and tried to outshine him "with fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention."&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 46 (quoted); Ettlingers, 19–22&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is often uncertainty in distinguishing between the contributions of Botticelli, the Lippis, and other pupils and imitators of Botticelli.  Especially in smaller works such as Madonnas, all the leading painters were copied or imitated by their own workshops and a host of unidentified lesser artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced also by the monumentality of [[Masaccio]]'s painting, it was from Lippi that Botticelli learned a more intimate and detailed manner.  Even at this early date, his work was characterized by a conception of the figure as if seen in low relief, drawn with clear contours, and minimizing strong contrasts of light and shadow which would indicate fully modelled forms. Lippi's synthesis of the new control of three-dimensional forms, tender expressiveness in face and gesture, and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli. A different influence was the new sculptural monumentality of the Pollaiuolo brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key early paintings===
A large ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' altarpiece of about 1470–72 is in the Uffizi. It is not in good condition, but shows Botticelli had mastered the posing of a group of eight figures "with a skillful semblance of easy naturalness in a closed architectural setting".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 50&lt;/ref&gt; One work that can be firmly dated is the narrow  ''[[St. Sebastian (Botticelli)|Saint Sebastian]]'' made for a pier in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] and dedicated in January 1474; it is now in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; This was painted at the same time as the Pollaiuolo brothers' much larger altarpiece of the same saint, a showpiece of anatomical poses, with the saint shown in great pain.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 003 cropframe.JPG|the Pollaiuolo brothers' painting, now National Gallery, London]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though very similar in pose, no doubt after Botticelli had seen the other painting, Botticelli's Sebastian seems calm and poised, following the legend that the arrows did not kill Sebastian, whose wounds were miraculously healed.  The almost nude body is very carefully drawn; usually Botticelli was not greatly concerned with anatomical precision, and he painted relatively few nudes, though some are among his most famous works.  The delicate winter landscape, reflecting the traditional date of the saint's martyrdom and feast-day in January, is also one of Botticelli's more impressive efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 51–52; Ettlingers, 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;     

At the start of 1474 Botticelli was asked by the authorities in Pisa to join the work frescoing the [[Camposanto]], a huge and prestigious project mostly being done by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], who spent nearly twenty years on it.  Various payments up to September are recorded, but no work survives, and it seems that whatever Botticelli started was not finished.  Whatever the outcome, that Botticelli was approached from outside Florence demonstrates a growing reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adoration of the Magi of 1476 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for [[Santa Maria Novella]] (c. 1475–76, now in the [[Uffizi]], and the first of 8 ''Adorations''),&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 324&lt;/ref&gt; was singled out for praise by Vasari, and was in a much-visited church, so spreading his reputation.  It can be thought of as marking the climax of Botticelli's early style.  Despite being commissioned by a money-changer, or perhaps money-lender, not otherwise known as an ally of the Medici, it contains the portraits of [[Cosimo de Medici]], his sons [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]] and [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni]] (all these by now dead), and his grandsons [[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo]] and [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]].  There are also portraits of the donor and, in the view of most, Botticelli himself, standing at the front on the right.  The painting was celebrated for the variety of the angles from which the faces are painted, and of their expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 65–69; Vasari, 150–152; Hartt, 324–325&lt;/ref&gt;

A large [[fresco]] for the customs house of Florence, that is now lost, depicted the execution by [[hanging]] of the leaders of the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 against the Medici.  It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 10&lt;/ref&gt; This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and may have led to his summons to Rome.  The figure of [[Francesco Salviati (bishop)|Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa]] was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the [[Pazzi family]] in 1494.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 325–326; Ettlingers, 10; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Another lost work was a [[tondo (art)|tondo]] of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal [[Francesco Gonzaga (1444–1483)|Francesco Gonzaga]]; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome.  A fresco in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1480 the Vespucci family commissioned a fresco figure of ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine]]'' for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's.  Someone else, probably the order running the church,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] to do a facing ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|Saint Jerome]]''; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition "was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Hebert Lighbown.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 73–78, 74 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known.  Most of the "text" is scribbles, but one line reads: "Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato", probably dialogue overheard from  the [[Humiliati|Uumiliati]], the order who ran the church.  Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77 (different translation to same effect)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sistine Chapel==
[[File:Eventos de la vida de Moisés (Sandro Botticelli).jpg|thumb|380px|left|''[[Youth of Moses]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]].]]
In 1481, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed [[Sistine Chapel]].  This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel; most of the frescos remain, but are now greatly overshadowed and disrupted by [[Michelangelo]]'s work of the next century, to make room for which some of them were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 38–42, 47; Lightbown, 90–92; Hartt, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] hostilities had escalated into [[excommunication]] for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small "Pazzi War".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 47; Hartt, 326; Martines, Chapter 10 for the hostilities.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] and the ''Life of [[Moses]]'', together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the [[Temptations of Christ (Botticelli)|''Temptations of Christ'']], ''[[Youth of Moses]]'' and ''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'' (or various other titles),&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 70–75; Hartt, 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the [[lunette]]s above, where Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Each painter bought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|''[[Punishment of the Sons of Corah]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]].]]

Vasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that [[Pietro Perugino]], the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 326–327; Lightbown, 92–94, thinks no one was, but that Botticelli set the style for the figures of the popes.&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted [[pilaster]]s that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 90–92, 97–99, 105–106; Hartt, 327; Shearman, 47, 50–75&lt;/ref&gt;  

Botticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent [[triptych]]-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 327&lt;/ref&gt; In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the ''Youth of Moses''.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 99–105&lt;/ref&gt; The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;    

The ''Punishment of the Sons of Corah'' contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 106–108; Ettlingers, 202&lt;/ref&gt; If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an ''Adoration of the Magi'', now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 111–113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedalletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 90, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological subjects of the 1480s==
[[File:Botticelli-primavera.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482), icon of the springtime renewal of the Florentine Renaissance, seen by [[Vasari]] at the summer palazzo of [[Pierfrancesco de' Medici]]. Left to right: [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the [[Charites|Three Graces]], [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]], [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]], [[Chloris]], [[Zephyrus]]]]
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', c. 1485. [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
The masterpieces ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' (c. 1482) and ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated [[Mars and Venus (Botticelli)|''Mars and Venus'']] and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', they have been endlessly analysed by [[art historian]]s, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]], and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Covered at length in: Lightbown, Ch. 7 &amp; 8; Wind, Ch. V, VII and VIII; Ettlingers, Ch. 3; Dempsey; Hartt, 329–334&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary [[Renaissance humanist]]s. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying "grace" and by [[John Ruskin]] as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colors.&lt;ref name=Lightbown/&gt;

The ''Primavera'' and the ''Birth'' were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the [[Villa di Castello]], owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/5allegor/20pallas.html Inventory publication]&lt;/ref&gt; it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the ''Primavera'' was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and ''The Birth of Venus'' was commissioned by someone else for a different site.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122–123; 152–153; Smith, Webster, "On the Original Location of the Primavera", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', vol. 57, no. 1, 1975, pp. 31–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3049335 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Botticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works.  A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his ''[[Mars and Venus (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a ''[[spalliera]]'', a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means "little wasps" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant [[satyr]]s play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a [[conch shell]] in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 164–168; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 138–141, with a later date.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these four large mythologies feature [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], a central figure in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 148–152; Legouix, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious paintings after Rome==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna with Saints - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Bardi Altarpiece'', 1484–85, 185 x 180 cm]]
Botticelli returned from Rome in 1482 with a reputation considerably enhanced by his work there.  As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade,&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; and most of these are religious.  By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return.  The rising star [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 329. According to Leonardo, Botticelli anticipated the method of some 18th century [[watercolour]]ists by claiming that a landscape could be begun by throwing a sponge loaded with paint at the panel.&lt;/ref&gt; left in 1481 for [[Milan]], the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and [[Andrea Verrochio]] in 1485 for [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 11&lt;/ref&gt;  

The remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Filippino Lippi]], worked on a major fresco cycle with [[Perugino]], for [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]]'s villa at Spedalletto near [[Volterra]].&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and [[altarpiece]]s and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a façade for the [[Cathedral of Florence]], receiving the next year a small payment for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put [[mosaic]]s on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 211–213&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bardi Altarpiece''===
The first major church commission after Rome was the '''''Bardi Altarpiece''''', finished and framed by February 1485,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 182&lt;/ref&gt; and now in Berlin. The frame was by no less a figure than [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], who was just becoming Lorenzo il Magnifico's favourite architect.  An enthroned Madonna and (rather large) Child sit on an elaborately-carved raised stone bench in a garden, with plants and flowers behind them closing off all but small patches of sky, to give a version of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' or closed garden, a very traditional setting for the Virgin Mary. Saints [[John the Baptist]] and an unusually elderly [[John the Evangelist]] stand in the foreground. Small and inconspicuous [[banderole]]s or ribbons carrying biblical verses elucidate the rather complex theological meaning of the work, for which Botticelli must have had a clerical advisor, but do not intrude on a simpler appreciation of the painting and its lovingly detailed rendering, which Vasari praised.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 180–185; Ettlingers, 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; It is somewhat typical of Botticelli's relaxed approach to strict perspective that the top ledge of the bench is seen from above, but the vases with lilies on it from below.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Botticelli, pala di san barnaba 01.jpg|thumb|''San Barnaba Altarpiece'', c. 1487, Uffizi, 268 x 280 cm]]

The donor, from the leading [[Bardi family]], had returned to Florence from over twenty years as a banker and wool merchant in London, where he was known as "John de Barde",&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 180; Ettlingers, 73&lt;/ref&gt; and aspects of the painting may reflect north European and even English art and popular devotional trends.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 184&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been other panels in the altarpiece, which are now missing.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===''San Barnaba Altarpiece''===
A larger and more crowded altarpiece is the '''''San Barnaba Altarpiece''''' of about 1487, now in the Uffizi, where elements of Botticelli's emotional late style begin to appear.  Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, at the same level as four angels carrying the [[Instruments of the Passion]].  Six saints stand in line below the throne.  Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large.  While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions.  Four small and rather simple ''[[predella]]'' panels survive; there were probably originally seven.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 187–190; Legouix, 31, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
With the phase of painting large secular works probably over by the late 1480s, Botticelli painted several altarpieces, and this appears to have been a peak period for his workshop's production of Madonnas. Botticelli's largest altarpiece, the ''San Marco Altarpiece'' (378 x 258 cm, Uffizi), is the only one to remain with its full ''predella'', of five panels.  In the air above four saints, the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' is taking place in a heavenly zone of gold and bright colours that recall his earlier works, with encircling angels dancing and throwing flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 198–200; Legouix, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the ''[[Cestello Annunciation]]'' (1489–90, Uffizi) forms a natural grouping with other late paintings, especially two of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] that share its sombre background colouring, and the rather exaggerated expressiveness of the bending poses of the figures.  It does have an unusually detailed landscape, still in dark colours, seen through the window, which seems to draw on north European models, perhaps from prints.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 194–198; Legouix, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 016.jpg|thumb|''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli)|Lamentation of Christ]]'', early 1490s, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.]]

Of the two ''Lamentations'', [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Milan)|one]] is in an unusual vertical format, because, like his 1474 ''Saint Sebastian'', it was painted for the side of a pillar in the Church of [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence]]; it is now in Milan.  [[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Botticelli, Munich)|The other, horizontal, one]] was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich.  In both the crowded, intertwined figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind.  The [[Swoon of the Virgin|Virgin has swooned]], and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 207–209; Legouix, 107, 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including [[Saint Peter]], usually regarded as in [[Jerusalem]] on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses.  Both probably date from 1490 to 1495.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown dates the Munich picture to 1490–92, and the Milan one to c. 1495&lt;/ref&gt;

Early records mentioned, without describing it, an altarpiece by Botticelli for the Convertite, an institution for ex-prostitutes, and various surviving unprovenanced works were proposed as candidates. It is now generally accepted that a painting in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London is the ''[[Pala delle Convertite]]'', dating to about 1491–93.  Its subject, unusual for an altarpiece, is the [[Holy Trinity]], with Christ on the cross, supported from behind by God the Father.  Angels surround the Trinity, which is flanked by two saints, with [[Book of Tobit|Tobias and the Angel]] on a far smaller scale right in the foreground.  This was probably a [[votive offering|votive]] addition, perhaps requested by the original donor.  The four predella scenes, showing the life of [[Mary Magdalen]], then taken as a reformed prostitute herself, are in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 202–207&lt;/ref&gt; 

After about 1493 or 1495 Botticelli seems to have painted no more large religious paintings, though production of Madonnas probably continued. The smaller narrative religious scenes of the last years are covered below.

==Madonnas, and tondos==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Madonna del Magnificat - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', c. 1483]]
Paintings of the [[Madonna and Child]], that is, the [[Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]], were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' type to small paintings for the home.  They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Botticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round [[tondo (art)|tondo]] format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145 cm across (about four to five feet).  This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli.  He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early ''Adoration of the Magi'' in London,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Botticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style.  Although [[Savonarola]]'s main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that "You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore",&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style.  They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint [[John the Baptist]] (the patron saint of Florence).  Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing.  Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different.  Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists.  When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 80; Lightbown, 82, 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'' in the Uffizi (118 cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the ''[[Magnificat]]'', a speech from the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:46–55|4=1:46–55}}) where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] to her cousin [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], some months before the birth of Jesus.  She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably-dressed Florentine youths.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 81–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraits==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 074.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder]]'', 1474; the medal is an inserted [[gesso]] cast of a real medal.]] 
Botticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him.  There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his ''[[Mars and Venus (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty [[Simonetta Vespucci]], who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 164&lt;/ref&gt; These figures represent a secular link to his ''Madonnas''.  

With one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage.  Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a "three-quarters" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally.  Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face.  Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds.  These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 171; Lightbown, 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same.  His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 156, 163–164, 168–172&lt;/ref&gt; Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 54.  This appears to exclude the idealized females, and certainly the portraits included in larger works.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Botticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 12&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a self-portrait and the Medici into his early ''Adoration of the Magi''.  Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 156–164&lt;/ref&gt; Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni|Tornabuoni]] family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of [[A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts|a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts]] and [[Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman|a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces]] are now in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 56, 136–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dante, printing and manuscripts==
[[File:Baccio Baldini - Inferno I.JPG|thumb|Engraving by [[Baccio Baldini]] after Botticelli.]] 
[[File:Botticelli Inferno XVIII.png|thumb|One of the few fully coloured pages of the [[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli]], illustrating canto XVIII in the eighth circle of Hell.  Dante and Virgil descending through the ten chasms of the circle via a ridge.]]
Botticelli had a lifelong interest in the great Florentine poet [[Dante Alighieri]], which produced works in several media.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 16–17, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; He is attributed with an imagined portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dante's features were well-known, from his death mask and several earlier paintings. Botticelli's aquiline version influenced many later depictions.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vasari, he "wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante", which is also referred to dismissively in another story in the ''Life'',&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 152, 154&lt;/ref&gt; but no such text has survived.  

Botticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, 35, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the first printed Dante in 1481 with [[engraving]]s by the goldsmith [[Baccio Baldini]], engraved from drawings by Botticelli: "being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and [[Divine Comedy illustrated by Botticelli|illustrated the Inferno]] which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living."&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 152, a different translation&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari, who lived when [[printmaking]] had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction.  

The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' consists of 100 cantos, and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three.  The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place.  This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.  Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 89; Landau, 108; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 302&lt;/ref&gt;  

Botticelli later began a luxury [[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli|manuscript illustrated Dante]] on [[parchment]], most of which was taken only as far as the [[underdrawing]]s, and only a few pages are fully illuminated.  This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32 x 47 cm), now divided between the [[Vatican Library]] (8 sheets) and Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 280; some are drawn on both sides of the sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Once again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing.  The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions.  The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccolò Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante.  Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings.  Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey; Lightbown, 280–282, 290&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed [[pamphlet]]s by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Medici==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Pallade e il centauro - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', c. 1482. [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]
The [[Medici family]] were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled.  [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop.  He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come.  In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 323&lt;/ref&gt; although views on this differ.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 11, 58; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 58&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]],&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; and other families allied to the Medici.  Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of ''Fortitude'' of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the ''[[Seven Virtues]]'' left unfinished by [[Piero Pollaiuolo]].  Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son.  Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London ''Adoration of the Magi'', also around 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 42–50; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 58–65, believes it is Giuliano, and the Washington version probably pre-dates his death; the Ettlingers, 168, are sceptical it is Giuliano at all.  The various museums with versions still support the identification.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who [[John Ruskin]] persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 164; Clark, 372 note for p. 92 quote.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 021.jpg|thumb|''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494–95). [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]
According to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who preached in Florence from 1490 until his [[Burning at the stake|execution]] in 1498:&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 152&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Botticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income.  None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the ''piagnoni'', the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 335–336; Davies, 105–106; Ettlingers, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the notorious "''[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]''" is not told by Vasari.  Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians.  [[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']], Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500,&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 14; Vasari, 152&lt;/ref&gt; eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below.  
[[File:Suicide lucretia.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', c. 1500. [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]].]]

In late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, [[Isabella d'Este]] wanted a painting done in Florence.  Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige.  She preferred to wait for Perugino's return.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 302&lt;/ref&gt; This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 14; Legouix, 18&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 18; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495.  This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' would be placed.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 18; Ettlingers, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  

Botticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the ''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|Calumny of Apelles]]'' (c. 1494–95), a recreation of a lost [[allegory]] by the ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]], which he may have intended for his personal use,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 230–237; Legouix, 114;&lt;/ref&gt; and the pair of ''[[The Story of Virginia (Botticelli)|The story of Virginia]]'' and ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'', which are probably from around 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 260–269; Legouix, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Boticelli - Mystische Geburt.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|''The Mystical Nativity'']] (c.&amp;nbsp;1500–01) [[National Gallery, London]].]]

''[[The Mystical Nativity]]'', a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 103–106&lt;/ref&gt; It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions.  The [[iconography]] of the familiar [[Nativity of Jesus in art|subject of the Nativity]] is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 248–253; Dempsey; Ettlingers, 96–103&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another painting, known as the ''Mystic Crucifixion'' (now [[Fogg Art Museum]]), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a [[marzocco]], the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion.  Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 242–247; Ettlingers, 103–105.  Lightbown connects it more specifically to Savonarola than the Ettlingers.&lt;/ref&gt;

His later work, especially as seen in the four panels with ''[[Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius]]'', witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of [[Fra Angelico]] nearly a century earlier.  Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter [[Carlo Crivelli]], some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent [[High Renaissance]] style, instead choosing to "move into a distinctly Gothic idiom".&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 11–12; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have seen premonitions of [[Mannerism]] in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 334, 337&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ernst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonna's a  "deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's [[physiognomy]]", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmann, Ernst, [https://archive.org/stream/botticelli00steiuoft#page/28/mode/2up ''Botticelli'', 26–28]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.

Botticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a [[confraternity]] rather than the [[artist's guild]]) until at least October 1505;&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 303–304&lt;/ref&gt; the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this.  By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died "ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight", after a period when he was "unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 154&lt;/ref&gt; He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time.  He was buried with his family outside the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti Church]] in a spot the church has now built over.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 305; Ettlingers, 15&lt;/ref&gt; This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his ''[[Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
Vasari mentions that Botticelli produced very fine drawings, which were sought out by artists after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works.  Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did.  Three [[vestment]]s survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of [[appliqué]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 296–298: Ettlingers, 175–178, who are more ready to connect studies to surviving paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshop==
[[File:Botticelli, madonna della melagrana 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Pomegranate]]'' (''Madonna della Melagrana''), c.&amp;nbsp;1487]]
In 1472 the records of the painter's guild record that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, though another source records a twenty-eight-year old, who had trained with [[Neri di Bicci]].  By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note.   Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 8; Lightbown, 311, 314&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 314&lt;/ref&gt;  

Botticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify,&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 79&lt;/ref&gt; though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable.  The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop.  Lightbown believed that "the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one", and that in only one major work on panel "do we find important parts executed by assistants";&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 312&lt;/ref&gt; but others might disagree.

The National Gallery have an ''Adoration of the Kings'' of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-and-filippino-lippi-adoration-of-the-kings National Gallery page]; see Davies, 97 for a slightly different view, and Lightbown, 311 for a very different one.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Finances===

According to Vasari's perhaps unreliable account, Botticelli "earned a great deal of money, but wasted it all through carelessness and lack of management".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, 154&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to live in the family house all his life, also having his studio there.  On his father's death in 1482 it was inherited by his brother Giovanni, who had a large family. By the end of his life it was owned by his nephews.  From the 1490s he had a modest country villa and farm at Bellosguardo (now swallowed up by the city), which was leased with his brother Simone.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===

Botticelli never married, and apparently expressed a strong dislike of the idea of marriage.  An anecdote records that his patron Tommaso Soderini, who died in 1485, suggested he marry, to which Botticelli replied that a few days before he had dreamed that he had married, woke up "struck with grief", and for the rest of the night walked the streets to avoid the dream resuming if he slept again.  The story concludes cryptically that Soderini understood "that he was not fit ground for planting vines".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 44&lt;/ref&gt;  

There has been over a century of speculation that Botticelli himself may actually have been homosexual. Many writers observed homo-eroticism in his portraits. The American art historian, [[Bernard Berenson]], for example, detecting what he believed to be latent homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Jacques Mesnil]] discovered a summary of a charge in the Florentine Archives for November 16, 1502, which read simply "Botticelli keeps a boy", an accusation of [[sodomy]] (homosexuality). No prosecution was brought. The painter would then have been about fifty-eight. Mesnil dismissed it as a customary slander by which partisans and adversaries of [[Savonarola]] abused each other. Opinion remains divided on whether this is evidence of bisexuality or homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many have backed Mesnil,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|9780195069754}}; Lightbown, 302&lt;/ref&gt;; the art historian, Scott Nethersole, has suggested that a quarter of men in Florentine were the subject of similar accusations, which "seems to have been a standard way of getting at people".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Nethersole ([[Courtauld Institute]]), quoted in Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; but others have cautioned against hasty dismissal of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Chastel, ''Art et humanisme a Florence au temps de Laurent le Magnifique'', Presses Universitaires de France, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Mesnil nevertheless concluded "woman was not the only object of his love".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Mesnil, ''Botticelli'', Paris, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance art historian, James Saslow, has noted that: "His [Botticelli's] homo-erotic sensibility surfaces mainly in religious works where he imbued such nude young saints as Sebastian with the same androgynous grace and implicit physicality as Donatello's David".&lt;ref&gt;James Saslow, ''Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in art and society, Yale University Pres, New Haven, 1986, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later reputation==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna of the Book]]'', c.1480–3.  Unusually, a small Madonna all painted by Botticelli himself]] 
After his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist. His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created,&lt;ref&gt;''Primavera'' and ''The Birth of Venus'' remained in the Grand Ducal Medici villa of Castello until 1815. (Levey 1960:292&lt;/ref&gt; and his frescos in the [[Sistine Chapel]] were upstaged by those of Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 204&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are a few mentions of paintings and their location in sources from the decades after his death.  Vasari's ''Life'' is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers "he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from [[Cimabue]] to Michelangelo".&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 203&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with [[Francesco Botticini]], another Florentine painter of the day.  Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day.  Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation.  He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 16–17; Vasari, 147–155&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1621 a picture-buying agent of [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest "as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 14&lt;/ref&gt; That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced. 

The ''Birth of Venus'' was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades.  The [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Berlin gallery]] bought the ''[[#Bardi Altarpiece|Bardi Altarpiece]]'' in 1829, but the [[National Gallery, London]] only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 204&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English collector [[William Young Ottley]] bought Botticelli's ''[[The Mystical Nativity (Botticelli)|The Mystical Nativity]]'' in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799. But when he tried to sell it in 1811, no buyer could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 204&lt;/ref&gt; After Ottley's death, its next purchaser, [[William Fuller Maitland]] of Stansted, allowed it to be exhibited in a major art exhibition held in [[Manchester]] in 1857, the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]],&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 106&lt;/ref&gt; where among many other art works it was viewed by more than a million people.  His only large painting with a mythological subject ever to be sold on the open market is the ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'', bought at [[Christie's]] by the National Gallery for a rather modest £1,050 in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 99, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was [[Alexis-François Rio]]; [[Anna Brownell Jameson]] and [[Charles Eastlake]] were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections. The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] incorporated elements of his work into their own.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Raphaelite Art in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, [[Suzanne Fagence Cooper]], p.95-96 {{ISBN|1-85177-394-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Pater]] created a literary picture of Botticelli, who was then taken up by the [[Aesthetic movement]]. The first [[monograph]] on the artist was published in 1893, the same year as [[Aby Warburg]]'s seminal dissertation on the mythologies; then, between 1900 and 1920 more books were written on Botticelli than on any other painter.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey; Lightbown, 328–329, with a list marking which "are of a certain importance"; [[Michael Levey]], "Botticelli and Nineteenth-Century England" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' ''23''.3/4 (July 1960:291–306); Ettlingers, 205&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Horne]]'s monograph in English from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 328; Dempsey, Legouix, 127&lt;/ref&gt; "one of the most stupendous achievements in Renaissance studies".&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 205 quoted, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Botticelli appears as a character, sometimes a main one, in numerous fictional depictions of 15th-century Florence in various media.  He will be portrayed by [[Sebastian de Souza]] in the second season of the TV series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/global/daniel-sharman-bradley-james-netflix-medici-1202522384/|title=Daniel Sharman and Bradley James Join Netflix's ‘Medici’ (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Clarke|first=Stewart|date=10 August 2017|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slave name''' is the [[personal name]] given by others to an [[slavery|enslaved]] person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. The modern use of the term applies mostly to [[African Americans]] and [[Afro-Caribbean|West Indians]] who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers.

Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an [[Africanization|African identity]] became common after [[emancipation]] in the 1960s by those in the [[African diaspora in the Americas]] seeking a reconnection to their African cultural roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ancient Rome==
{{Slavery}}
In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was [[manumission|freed]] might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]. As an example, one historian says that "a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Harold Whetstone Johnston]] writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the [[freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html#60 Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Americans==

A number of African-Americans and [[Afro-Caribbeans]] have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion ([[Muhammad Ali]] changed his name from Cassius Clay, [[Malcolm X]] from Malcolm Little, and [[Louis Farrakhan]] changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Farrakhan Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-farrakhan-9291850|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or involvement with the [[black nationalist]] movement (e.g., [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Assata Shakur]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Van Deburg|Deburg, William L. Van]], "Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan",  NYU Press (1997), p 269, {{ISBN|0-8147-8789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations encourage African-Americans to abandon their slave names. The [[Nation of Islam]] is perhaps the best-known of them. In his book, ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Nation of Islam leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] writes often of slave names. Some of his comments include:

* "''You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man's name.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk24.htm [[Muhammad, Elijah]]; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 24; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''You are still called by your slave-masters' names. By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America. He knows that. You have never gotten out of the shackles of slavery. You are still in them.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk34.htm Muhammad, Elijah; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 34; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[US Organization]] also advocates for African-Americans to change their slave names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-organization.org/nguzosaba/NguzoSaba.html "NGUZO SABA (The Seven Principles)" From : US Organization website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''subcontractor''' is an individual or in many cases a [[business]] that signs a [[contract]] to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.

A subcontractor is a person who is hired by a [[general contractor|general contractor (or prime contractor, or main contractor)]] to perform a specific task as part of the overall project and is normally paid for services provided to the project by the originating general contractor. While the most common concept of a subcontractor is in [[construction|building]] works and [[civil engineer]]ing, the range of opportunities for subcontractor is much wider and it is possible that the greatest number now operate in the [[information technology]] and information sectors of business.

The incentive to hire subcontractors is either to reduce [[cost]]s or to mitigate [[project]] risks. In this way, the general contractor receives the same or better service than the general contractor could have provided by itself, at lower overall risk. Many subcontractors do work for the same companies rather than different ones. This allows subcontractors to further specialize their skills.

==Types==
In [[United Kingdom]] building industry contract law, particularly when using [[Joint Contracts Tribunal|JCT standard form contracts]], three subcontractor types are identified:
; Domestic subcontractor : A subcontractor who contracts with the main contractor to supply or fix any materials or goods or execute work forming part of the main contract. Essentially this contractor is employed by the main contractor.
; Nominated subcontractor : Certain contracts permit the architect or supervising officer to reserve the right of the final selection and approval of subcontractors. The main contractor is permitted to make a profit from the use of nominated subcontractors on site, but must provide "attendance" (usually the provision of water, power, restrooms, and other services to enable the nominated subcontractor to do his job). In effect the appointment of nominated subcontractors establishes a direct contractual relationship between the client and the subcontractor.
; Named subcontractors : Effectively the same as a domestic subcontractor&amp;nbsp;— A subcontractor who contracts with the main contractor to supply or fix any materials or goods or execute work forming part of the main contract. Essentially this contractor is employed by the main contractor.

==Tax law==
Under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom|UK tax law]], certain activities that might appear to be subcontracting are actually treated differently. This is a subtlety of corporate taxation that may easily be missed or misunderstood, and may be relevant to research and development tax relief.
Examples of activities that involve outsourced work that do not count as subcontracting for tax purposes include:
* Collaborative research&amp;nbsp;– research carried out across two companies that benefits both companies.
* Externally provided workers.
* Self-employed consultants.&lt;ref name="RDelsewhere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forrestbrown.co.uk/news/what-if-our-rd-happens-elsewhere/|title=» What If Our R&amp;D Happens Elsewhere?|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sukanta Chaudhuri - Kolkata 2015-01-10 3496.JPG|thumb|Sukanta Chaudhuri. &lt;small&gt;January 2015.&lt;/small&gt;]]
'''Sukanta Chaudhuri''' (born 1950) is an  [[Indian people|Indian]] literary scholar, now Professor Emeritus at [[Jadavpur University]], [[Kolkata]]. He was educated at [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught at Presidency College from January 1973 to December 1991 and at [[Jadavpur University]] thereafter till his retirement in June 2010. At Jadavpur, he was founding Director of the School of Cultural Texts and Records, a pioneering centre of digital humanities in India. His chief fields of study are the English and European Renaissance, translation, textual studies and digital humanities. He has held visiting appointments at many places including [[All Souls College, Oxford]]; [[St John’s College, Cambridge]]; the [[School of Advanced Study]], London; the [[University of Virginia]]; and [[Loyola University, Chicago]]. He is an Honorary Fellow of the [[Asiatic Society]], Kolkata and a member of the Executive Committee of the International Shakespeare Association.

== Renaissance scholarship ==
His first major monograph ''Infirm Glory: Shakespeare and the Renaissance Image of Man'' (Oxford, 1981) was followed by ''Renaissance Pastoral and Its English Developments'' (Oxford, 1989). More  recently, he has edited ''Pastoral Poetry of the English Renaissance'' (2 vols, Manchester, 2016-17) and the Third [[Arden Shakespeare|Arden]] edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''A Midsummer Night’s Dream'' (2017). He has also edited selections of [[Francis Bacon]]'s Essays and of [[Elizabethan]] poetry for [[Oxford University Press]], and edited or co-edited several collections of essays on the Renaissance. He has studied the links and parallels between the European and the Bengal Renaissances, and the possibility of a common model of a 'Renaissance'.

== Translation ==
Chaudhuri has translated extensively from [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Sukumar Ray]], [[Rajshekhar Bose]] and other classic Bengali writers, and many modern Bengali poets. His ''Select Nonsense of Sukumar Ray'' (New Delhi: OUP, 1998) is an acclaimed recreation in English of Sukumar Ray's whimsical nonsense poems. He was General Editor of the [[Oxford Tagore Translations]] (five volumes between 2000 and 2006). He has also translated the complete limericks of [[Edward Lear]] into Bengali, and selections from the Notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] from Italian into Bengali. He is the author of ''Translation and Understanding'' (New Delhi: OUP, 1999).

== Textual studies and digital humanities ==
For many years now, he has worked extensively on textual studies and editorial theory. His book ''The Metaphysics of Text'' combines the insights of traditional bibliography and textual criticism with recent editorial theory and theories of language.Besides his editions of Shakespeare and Early Modern texts cited above, his textual inquiries have led him to the field of digital humanities, as centred in the [[School of Cultural Texts and Records]] at [[Jadavpur University]]. His work covers digital archiving, database creation and computational analysis of texts. He was Principal Investigator of two major projects under the [[British Library]]'s Endangered Archives Programme. Most importantly, he was chief co-ordinator of Bichitra, the comprehensive online variorum of the works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

== Urban studies ==
Chaudhuri is interested in urban studies. He edited the authoritative two-volume reference work ''Calcutta: The Living City'' (OUP Delhi, 1990). For many years, he wrote a fortnightly column "View from Calcutta" for the newspaper ''[[The Asian Age]]''. He writes and campaigns extensively on urban issues, especially as concerning his native city, [[Kolkata]].

== Drama ==
Chaudhuri's Bengali play ''Jaha Chai'' ('What We Desire') was performed in 2007 by the theatre group [[Nandikar]]. It was part of a worldwide project on "cultural mobility", built around the idea of [[Shakespeare]]'s lost play ''[[Cardenio]]'' and co-ordinated by the scholar [[Stephen Greenblatt]] and the [[Off-Broadway]] dramatist [[Charles L. Mee]]. Chaudhuri set the story in modern [[Bengal]], the lost play metamorphosing into a (fictional) hitherto unknown [[Tagore]] text.

He is married to [[Supriya Chaudhuri]], who also taught at the Department of English, Jadavpur University.

== Club career ==

=== Kilmarnock ===
Higginson began his career with spells at junior clubs Edina Hibs and [[Penicuik Athletic F.C.|Penicuik Athletic.]]&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt; In 1956, [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] manager [[Malky McDonald]] saw Higginson playing in a junior match and invited the youngster to a trial with the [[Scottish Football League]] club.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cult Bees &amp; Legends: Volume One |last=Lane |first=David |publisher=Woodpecker Multimedia |year=2005 |isbn=0-9543682-0-7 |location=Hampton Wick |pages=110–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He impressed enough to win a contract, but departed Killie in the summer of 1959 without making an appearance,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt; having missed two years due to his [[National Service in the United Kingdom|National Service]] and a ligament injury.&lt;ref name="RIP" /&gt;

=== Brentford ===
Along with fellow [[Scotland|Scot]] [[John Docherty (footballer, born 1940)|John Docherty]], Higginson reunited with manager Malky McDonald at English [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] side [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in June 1959, as cover for [[Forward (association football)|forward]] [[Jim Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = TW8 Matchday versus Oldham Athletic 25/08/03|last = |first = |publisher = The Yellow Printing Company Limited|year = |isbn = |location = London|pages = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his time with the club in the [[Brentford F.C.

Higginson saw out his career with [[Southern League Premier Division]] side [[Hillingdon Borough F.C.|Hillingdon Borough]],&lt;ref name="bees"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1999 |title=Official Matchday Magazine Of Brentford Football Club versus Oldham Athletic 14/08/99 |url= |location=Blackheath |page=41|publisher= Morganprint|isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching [[1970–71 FA Trophy|the final]] of the [[FA Trophy]] with the club in 1971.&lt;ref name="Street" /&gt;

== Sunday League career ==
Higginson played on in [[Sunday league football]] during the 1970s, appearing for Thornbury, Syon Villa and [[Sutton Athletic F.C.|Sutton Athletic]].&lt;ref name="Street" /&gt; He retired from all football in 1990, at age 53.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Prior to becoming a footballer, Higginson was a champion youth boxer and athlete in Scotland, taking part in the Border Games and running professionally.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Street" /&gt; While playing junior football, he also worked as a butcher.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt; While undertaking his National Service, Higginson saw active duty with the [[Royal Scots Regiment]] in [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt; While playing for Brentford, Higginson settled in [[Isleworth]]. After retiring from professional football in 1970, he worked for [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] for three years, before returning to his old job of butchering.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt; Higginson died at the age of 75 on 22 July 2012.&lt;ref name="Street" /&gt; He suffered with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in his later years. As a mark of respect, two days later the Brentford players wore [[Black armband#Mourning|black armbands]] during a [[pre-season friendly]] versus [[FC Erzgebirge Aue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2012/july/mark-of-respect-for-higginson/ |title=Mark of Respect For Higginson |date=24 July 2012 |publisher=Brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higginson's funeral was attended by many former Brentford favourites, including Peter Gelson, [[Alan Hawley (footballer)|Alan Hawley]] and [[Gordon Phillips (footballer)|Gordon Phillips]].&lt;ref name="Street" /&gt;

'''William Stainton Moses''' (1839–1892) was an [[England|English]] [[Clergy|cleric]] and spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].

==Life==
Moses was born in [[Donington, Lincolnshire|Donington]] near [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].  He was educated at [[Bedford School]], [[University College School|University College School, London]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Rigg|1912}} He was ordained as a priest of the [[Church of England]] by [[Samuel Wilberforce|Bishop Samuel Wilberforce]] in 1870.

Moses attended his first [[séance]] with Lottie Fowler in 1872. Charles Williams and [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] were the next mediums he visited. Five months after his introduction to [[spiritualism]], he claimed to have experienced [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]]. The automatic scripts of Moses began to appear in his books ''Spirit Teachings'' and ''Spirit Identity''.{{sfn|Rigg|1912}} The scripts date from 1872 to 1883 and fill 24 notebooks. All but one have been preserved by the London Spiritualist Alliance.

Moses published ''Psychography. A Treatise on One of the Objective Forms of Psychic or Spiritual Phenomena'' in 1878. In it, he coins the term "psychography" (from ''psycho'' and ''graphy'') for the spiritualist concept of channeling messages from the dead via [[automatic writing]] (also known as "independent writing", "direct writing" or "spirit writing").

Moses was one of the first vice-presidents of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR).&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}} "Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR"&lt;/ref&gt; Other early members included [[Frederic W. H. Myers]], [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[Edmund Gurney]]. In 1886 and 1887 in a series of publications the SPR exposed the tricks of the medium [[William Eglinton]]. Because of this, some spiritualist members including Moses resigned from the SPR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 139-140. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses endorsed the [[spirit photography]] of [[Édouard Isidore Buguet]], however, Buguet was exposed as a fraud.&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847''. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 151-173&lt;/ref&gt; Moses had supported Buguet in an article for ''Human Nature'' in May 1875.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]. (1938). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 150. {{ISBN|978-1111354879}} "Stainton Moses warmly endorsed Buguet in an article printed in May, 1875. In June, 1875, the French government arrested Buguet for fraud. At his trial he made a complete confession, and the police seized and produced his "spirit" doll and the collection of heads that fitted on it."&lt;/ref&gt; After Burguet was exposed later in the same year, Moses insisted that Buguet was still a genuine medium and he had been bribed to make a false confession.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1902). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and Criticism''. Volume 2. London: Methuen &amp; Co. pp. 120-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simeon Edmunds]]. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. p. 115. "Stainton Moses even insisted that the prosecution was instigated by the Church, and that Buguet had been forced or bribed into making a false confession."&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been cited by researchers as an example of spiritualists [[True-believer syndrome|willing to believe]] and refusing to accept evidence of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Houdini]]. (2011 edition). Originally published in 1924. ''A Magician Among the Spirits''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 120-124. {{ISBN|978-1-108-02748-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall]]. (1972). ''The Table-Rappers''. Book Club Associates. p. 124. {{ISBN|978-0750936842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1975). ''Mediums, Mystics &amp; the Occult''. Thomas Y. Crowell. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-690-00476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:William Stainton Moses Photograph 2.png|thumb|left|Spirit photograph featuring Moses.]]
In 1884, Moses was a founding member, together with Rogers, of the London Spiritualist Alliance, afterwards the [[College of Psychic Studies]].{{sfn|Rigg|1912}}

Moses died on 5 September 1892.{{sfn|Rigg|1912}}

==Reception==

Moses performed in dark conditions only with a small select circle of friends, he did not allow psychical researchers to attend his séances and refused to be tested.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1907). ''The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism''. Herbert B. Turner &amp; Co. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The psychical researcher [[Frank Podmore]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems reasonable to conclude that all the marvels reported at [Moses] seances were, in fact, produced by the medium's own hands: that it was he who tilted the table and produced the raps, that the scents, the seed pearls, and the Parian statuettes were brought into the room in his pockets: and that the spirit lights were, in fact, nothing more than bottles of phosphorised oil. Nor would the feats described have required any special skill on the medium's part.&lt;ref name="Podmore1902"&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1902). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism''. Volume 2. Methuen &amp; Company. pp. 283-287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was suggested that Moses looked up obituaries, daily newspapers, biographies or ''[[The Annual Register]]'' to research the history of deceased people.&lt;ref name="Podmore1902"/&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] described Moses as a "deliberate impostor" and wrote that his [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]] and all of his feats were the result of trickery.&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"/&gt; Science historian [[Sherrie Lynne Lyons]] wrote that the glowing or light-emitting hands  in séances could easily be explained by the rubbing of oil of [[phosphorus]] on the hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherrie Lynne Lyons]]. (2010). ''Species, Serpents, Spirits, and Skulls: Science at the Margins in the Victorian Age''. State University of New York Press. p. 95. {{ISBN|978-1438427980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was caught twice with a bottle of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London Watts &amp; Co. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Théodore Flournoy]] wrote that before admitting a supernatural explanation for the [[automatic writing]]s of Moses, "we must first of all be sure that he himself was not capable of elaborating them subconsciously. To my mind, he was quite capable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Théodore Flournoy]].  (1911). ''Spiritism and Psychology''. New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Moses's statements about ancient history have proven to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London Watts &amp; Co. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher [[Georgess McHargue]] has suggested that Moses' mediumship was the result of [[Autosuggestion|self-suggestion]] and unconscious trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue]]. (1972). ''Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement''. Doubleday. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0385053051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented instance of [[cryptomnesia]] occurred in 1874 with Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Righi. (2008). ''Chapter 4: Talking Boards and Ghostly Goo''. In ''Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists''. Llewellyn Publications. {{ISBN|978-0738713632}} "An early example of this occurred in 1874 with he medium William Stanton Moses, who communicated with the spirits of two brothers who had recently died in India. Upon investigation, it was discovered that one week prior to the séance, their obituary had appeared in the newspaper. This was of some importance because Moses's communications with the two spirits contained nothing that wasn't already printed in the newspaper."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2014). [http://skepdic.com/cryptomn.html "Cryptomnesia"]. ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
