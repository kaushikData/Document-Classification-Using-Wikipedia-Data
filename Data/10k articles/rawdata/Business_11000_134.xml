'''550 Madison Avenue''' (formerly known as the '''Sony Tower''' or '''Sony Plaza''' and before that the '''AT&amp;T Building'''), is an iconic [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] {{Convert|647|ft|m|0|adj=mid|-tall|abbr=off|sp=us}}, 37-story [[highrise]] [[skyscraper]] located at 550 [[Madison Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Tower|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=sonytower-newyorkcity-ny-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Philip Johnson]], it was formerly the headquarters of [[Sony Corporation of America]].&lt;ref name="sonysale2013"/&gt; The tower was purchased by the [[Olayan Group]] and Chelsfield for $1.4 billion in 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History==
===Design===
The building was designed by [[architect]] [[Philip Johnson]] and partner [[John Burgee]] and was completed in 1984. It is close – in concept – to the 1982 [[Humana Building]] by [[Michael Graves]]. It became immediately controversial for its ornamental top (sometimes mocked as "[[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chippendale Building (SONY building) |url= http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/chippendale_building_sony_building |publisher=Barry Popik|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[pediment|open pediments]] characteristic of the famous English designer's bookcases and other cabinetry), but enjoyed for its spectacular arched entrance way, measuring about seven stories in height. With these ornamental additions, the building challenged [[modernist architecture|architectural modernism]]'s demand for stark functionalism and purely efficient design. The effect the building had on the public at large has been described as legitimizing the [[postmodern architecture]] movement on the world stage. In July 2018 it was designated a New York City landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/07/johnson-burgees-att-building-new-york-city-landmark/|title=The AT&amp;T Building is now a New York City landmark - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AT&amp;T Building===
In October 1978, AT&amp;T was granted permission to add {{convert|81928|sqft|m2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the equivalent of some four floors of space on its proposed building, in exchange for agreeing to provide open public space and a three-story communications museum. The firm was granted an additional {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, about two floor's worth, as a bonus for creating a {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} covered arcade along Madison Avenue that would include seating and retail kiosks.&lt;ref name=NYT1984&gt;Gottlieb, Martin.

In 1982, with the [[Bell System divestiture]] set to take effect on January 1, 1984, AT&amp;T decided to seek a tenant to lease {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space on the 7th through 25th floors, nearly half the space in the building, and was seeking rents of as much as $60 per square foot. The company had expected to relocate as many as 1,500 employees, most who had been located at the company's old headquarters at 195 Broadway, but the impending divestiture meant it would only be moving 600 employees into 550 Madison, with others being moved to another facility in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Diane.

''[[Spirit of Communication]]'', a {{convert|20000|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=off}} bronze statue that had stood for 64 years at the top of AT&amp;T's previous headquarters building at [[195 Broadway|195]] [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], was disassembled and relocated to the lobby of 550 Madison in 1983. The {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on}} figure, modeled in 1916 by American sculptor [[Evelyn Beatrice Longman]], is holding bolts of electricity clutched in one arm reaching towards the sky and has coils of cable wound around the statue's torso.&lt;ref&gt;Teltsch, Kathleen.

Retrieved October 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After AT&amp;T moved out of the building, the statue was relocated to a spot outside of its Basking Ridge operational headquarters in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Dewan, Shaila.

Retrieved October 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the statue was relocated to AT&amp;T's current corporate headquarters in Dallas.

In 1984, the company indicated that it would not build the museum that it had originally committed to build in exchange for bonus zoning. The change of heart came as part of plans following the court-ordered divestiture of the [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] and the reduced presence it expected to have at the building.&lt;ref name=NYT1984/&gt; In the face of firm opposition from the city, AT&amp;T acquiesced to construction of a three-story exhibition space in an annex located adjoining the pedestrian walkway behind the building.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, Martin.

AT&amp;T had been granted a tax break of $42 million, under the condition that the company would keep its headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue and not rent out the space to other tenants. Having decreased in size substantially, AT&amp;T signed a 20-year lease agreement on 550 Madison with Sony and relocated its headquarters to [[32 Sixth Avenue]], between Walker and Lispenard Streets. Sony was granted an option to purchase the building. AT&amp;T returned $14.5 million to New York City to compensate it for tax abatements made as part of a 1987 renegotiation.&lt;ref name=NYT1992&gt;Dunlap, David W.

===Sony Building===
[[File:550 Madison Avenue July2015.JPG|thumb|Sony Building in 2015]]

In 1992, Sony submitted plans that required approval by the [[New York City Planning Commission]], in which it would take some of the open space in the building's [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] that had been used to obtain approval for additional floors on top of the building, and convert those areas into retail space. In exchange, the company would expand the glass-enclosed pedestrian walkway with the addition of planters and public seating. Sony expected that the proposed conversion of the {{convert|8727|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of public space could be converted into stores that could be leased at rates that ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimated could approach $200 per square foot. The company noted that the space was underutilized as a public amenity because it was "dark, windy and noisy" and that its conversion to commercial space would provide "retail continuity" with the remainder of Madison Avenue.&lt;ref name=NYT1992/&gt;

By 1996, Sony had consolidated most of the operations for its [[Sony Music Entertainment]] division at 550 Madison Avenue, for which ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "such high-profile and elaborate space is appropriate and necessary." That same year, Sony acquired additional space across the street at 555 Madison Avenue, a {{convert|445000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building built in the 1960s that underwent renovations of its lobby, windows, bathrooms and other common spaces in conjunction with Sony's lease. Sony signed leases through 2013 on an additional {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} on the sixth through ninth floors of the building, on top of an initial rental of {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space on the second through fifth floors of the building that it had made in 1995. Rents on the floors had averaged about $34 per square foot at the time. Sony connected the two buildings using fiber optic cables that were run under Madison Avenue and installed microwave communications equipment on the top of the 555 building. Sony made these moves, which included early termination of leases on space in the surrounding area at 711 Fifth Avenue on the 43rd floor at [[9 West 57th Street]], as part of an effort to lower occupancy costs by bringing its businesses closer together.&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Mervyn.

Retrieved October 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cash-strapped AT&amp;T sold the building to Sony in 2002 for $236 million, or $315 per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;Magpily, Gerald. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-55779_ITM "DealEstate — April 11, 2002"], ''[[The Deal (magazine)|Daily Deal]]'', April 11, 2002. Retrieved October 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building incorporated the Sony Wonder Technology Lab, a multimedia hands-on tour through the world of media, located in a four-story annex accessible through a glass-roofed atrium that connects 55th and 56th Streets in mid-block.&lt;ref&gt;Leimbach, Dulcie.

Retrieved October 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was open on Tuesdays through Saturdays, and Sony described the free exhibits as a "technology and entertainment museum for all ages". During 2008, the museum's third and fourth floors underwent renovations that were completed in fall 2008. Sony Wonder replaced Infoquest Center, a permanent telecommunications exhibition that had been built by AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=NYT1992/&gt; Sony permanently closed the lab on January 29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mommynearest.com/edition/nyc/article/sony-wonder-technology-lab-to-close-on-january-29|title=Sony Wonder Technology Lab to Close Its Doors January 29|last=|first=|date=2016-01-14|website=Mommy Nearest|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2010, an accumulation of ice from the [[February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard]] broke loose from an upper floor, breaking the glass ceiling of the atrium and injuring at least 15 inside who were attending a [[Purim]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =AP |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g1ibPLmiXR4R1WxvRWLi9tp-vYRwD9E5GIT00 |title=Witness: Glass 'everywhere' in NYC atrium collapse – Associated Press – March 1, 2010 |publisher=Google.com |date=February 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g1ibPLmiXR4R1WxvRWLi9tp-vYRwD9E5GIT00 "AP News; February 28, 2010"].

On November 27, the LPC [https://www.wsj.com/articles/towering-landmark-battle-looms-over-philip-johnson-building-1511912467 voted unanimously] to put the building on its calendar, though a specific date has not been set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/towering-landmark-battle-looms-over-philip-johnson-building-1511912467|title=Towering Landmark Battle Looms Over Philip Johnson Building|last=Morris|first=Keiko|date=2017-11-28|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to preserve the tower's architecture and significant interiors, demolition of the building's original ground floor lobby began in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/22/opinion-philip-johnson-att-building-550-madison-preservation-christy-maclear/|title=Opinion: "550 Madison is worthy of the most careful preservation"|date=2018-01-22|work=Dezeen|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sony Tower appears in the original Spider-Man game ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)]]'' in the first level of the game. as well as in the 2002 video game, ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]],'' in the level "Oscorp's Gambit". This is probably because Sony owns the rights to [[Spider-Man]].

''[[Marvel's Spider-Man (video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man (2018 video game)]] in the free roam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">The '''Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement''' was an agreement signed on 16 March 1921 to facilitate trade between Great Britain and the [[Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic]]. It was signed by [[Robert Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan|Robert Horne]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leonid Krasin]],  Commissar of Foreign Trade.&lt;ref&gt; Misha V. Glenny,"The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, March 1921." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 5.2 (1970): 63-82. [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200947000500203?journalCode=jcha Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]] downplayed socialism and emphasized business dealings with capitalist countries, in an effort to restart the sluggish Russian economy. Britain was the first country to accept Lenin's offer of a trade agreement. It ended the British blockade, and Russian ports now were open to British ships. Both sides agreed to refrain from hostile propaganda. It amounted to de facto diplomatic recognition and opened a period of extensive trade.&lt;ref&gt;Christine A. White,  ''British and American Commercial Relations with Soviet Russia, 1918-1924'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Lloyd George]] first raised the proposal to drop the blockade on Russia, following the [[October Revolution]] at a meeting of the [[Allied Supreme Council]], held on 14 January 1920, four days after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had been ratified. Originally trade was to be restricted to being with the "Russian people", through [[All Russian Co-operative Society|Centrosoyuz]], the All-Russian Union of Consumer [[Co-operative]] Societies. However, by the end of May 1920, Leonid Krasin had arrived in London and the terms of the agreement had shifted. Also, although originally an ''allied'' proposal, the [[French Third Republic#France and the First World War|French]] declined [[Lord Curzon]]'s invitation to participate, and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)#Italy.27s territorial settlements and the reaction|Italians]] sent a [[chargé d'affaires]] who only participated in one session. Meanwhile, the [[Bolshevik]]s, upon hearing of the Supreme Council's intention of lifting of the blockade and developing trade with the Co-operatives, responded by taking Centrosoyuz over. Lenin wrote the executive decree promulgated by the [[Council of People's Commissars]] on 27 January which put this into effect. Krasin and his fellow delegates were nominally co-opted on to the board of Centrosoyuz, 
maintaining the fiction that negotiations were being carried out with the Co-operatives Union.&lt;ref&gt; Glenny,  (1970), pp. 63-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First phase of negotiations: from 31 May, to 7 July 1920==
Krasin was accompanied by [[Viktor Nogin]] to London to engage in the negotiations. The British Cabinet discussed the proposed agreement at [[10 Downing Street]] on 28 May 1920. Lord Curzon had previously briefed the meeting:
:'We know from a great variety of sources that the Russian Government is threatened with complete economic disaster, and that it is ready to pay almost any price for the assistance which we - more than anyone else - are in a position to give. We can hardly contemplate coming to its rescue without exacting our price for it, and it seems to me that price can far better be paid in a cessation of Bolshevik hostility in parts of the world important to us, than the ostensible exchange of commodities, the existence of which on any considerable scale in Russia there is grave reason to doubt.'&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Paper: 'Negotiations with M. Krassin - Note by Lord Curzon'. C.P. 1350, 27 May 1920. CAB. 241106. as quoted ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four meetings held on 31 May, 7 June, 16 June, and 29 June. The first two were more formal, but the third meeting consisted only of Lloyd George, Krasin, Sir Robert Horne, [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] and [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. However, the last meeting was to prove crucial. Both Krasin and Lloyd George agreed that there were two principal issues:
* Hostile propaganda and subversion
* pre-1917 debts to British creditors

Faced with an impending meeting with Britain's allies, Lloyd George drew up a four-point plan:
* An armistice and end to hostile propaganda
* The exchange of prisoners
* Mutual recognition of outstanding debts for goods and services
* Exchange of trade missions
Krasin was given 7 days in which to reply and provided passage on board [[HMS Vimiera (1917)|HMS Vimiera]] to [[Reval]]. [[Georgy Chicherin]] responded on 7 July agreeing to these terms in principle.

==Second phase of negotiations: from 8 July, to 11 September 1920==
[[Lev Kamenev]] was appointed the head of the new negotiating team at Chicherin's insistence over Lenin's objections.

==Third phase of negotiations: from 12 September 1920 to 16 March 1921 ==

Negotiations were long and protracted. [[Lenin]] remarked at the 8th All Russian Congress of Soviets on 21 December 1920:
:The treaty, the trade agreement with Britain is not signed yet. At this very moment Krasin is conducting urgent talks on it in London. The British government has handed us its draft, we have given our counterdraft, but it is still obvious that the British government is dragging its feet over the agreement because the reactionary war party is still hard at work there; it has had the upper hand so far and is hindering the conclusion of a trade agreement. It is in our direct interest, and it is our direct duty to give all our support to whatever can help to fortify those parties and groupings who are striving for the signature of this treaty with us.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, ''Sochinenia'', XLII, 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Maisky]] was to underline the importance of the agreement thus:
:This diplomatic document, though modest in scope, is of truly historic significance. The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was not an ordinary trade treaty with the mere object of regulating commercial operations between two countries; it was an agreement of politico-commercial character: it gave the RSFSR defacto recognition by the most powerful capitalist power in Europe, a power which in those days still successfully contended with the USA for the role of the foremost capitalist country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;I. Maisky, 'Anglo-sovetskoe torgovoe soglashenie 1921 goda', ''Voprosy
Istorii'', No. 5, 1957, 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

** Book abstract: "The [[Seagram building]] rises over New York's [[Park Avenue]], seeming to float above the street with perfect lines of bronze and glass. Considered one of the greatest icons of twentieth-century architecture, the building was commissioned by [[Samuel Bronfman]], founder of the Canadian distillery dynasty Seagram. Bronfman's daughter [[Phyllis Lambert]] was twenty-seven years old when she took over the search for an architect and chose [[Mies van der Rohe]] (1886-1969), a pioneering modern master of what he termed "skin and bones" architecture. Mies, who designed the elegant, deceptively simple thirty-eight story tower along with [[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005), emphasized the beauty of structure and fine materials, and set the building back from the avenue, creating an urban oasis with the building's plaza. Through her choice, Lambert established her role as a leading architectural patron and singlehandedly changed the face of American urban architecture. Building Seagram is a comprehensive personal and scholarly history of a major building and its architectural, cultural, and urban legacies. Lambert makes use of previously unpublished personal archives, company correspondence, and photographs to tell an insider's view of the debates, resolutions, and unknown dramas of the building's construction, as well as its crucial role in the history of modern art and architectural culture."&lt;ref name=WorldCat-BuildingSeagram&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Seagram|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/building-seagram/oclc/813392773|work=WorldCat|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of Australia's best-selling authors, notable for his book ''[[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]]''.

==Background and early years==

Arthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains, South Africa, the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder.  Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary.  Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-man-who-made-christmas-presents-20121123-29xfk.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|title=The man who 'made Christmas presents'|date=23 November 2012|first=Patricia|last=Maunder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227054122/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-man-who-made-christmas-presents-20121123-29xfk.html|archivedate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] in the [[Limpopo province]]. He later attended [[King Edward VII School (Johannesburg)|King Edward VII School]].

In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met his future wife, Benita Solomon, and they emigrated to Sydney in 1958. They married in 1959 and had three sons&amp;nbsp;– Brett, Adam and Damon.

Courtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of [[McCann Erickson]], [[J. Walter Thompson]] and [[George Patterson Y&amp;R|George Patterson Advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=325|title=Bryce Courtenay AM|work=Speaker details|publisher=Saxton Speakers' Bureau|archivedate=4 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204124816/http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; His award-winning campaigns included ''[[Louie the Fly]]'' and the original ''[[Milkybar]] Kid'' commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/bryce-courtenay-dies-in-canberra-aged-79/story-e6frg8n6-1226522635053|title=Bryce Courtenay dies in Canberra aged 79|first=Stephen|last=Romei|date=23 November 2013|newspaper=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Geoffry Morgan Pike|Geoff Pike]], Bryce Courtenay developed the concept behind the [[Yowie (chocolate)|Cadbury Yowie]], a chocolate that contained a children's toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal.

On 1 April 1991, Damon (who was born with the blood condition [[haemophilia]]) died at age 24 from [[AIDS-related complications]], contracted through a blood transfusion.

Courtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute [[myeloid leukaemia]].&lt;ref name="Benita's death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/sad-serenade-for-courtenay/2007/03/11/1173548008005.html|title=Sad Serenade for Courtenay|last=Sharp|first=Annette|date=12 March 2007|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130013455/http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/sad-serenade-for-courtenay/2007/03/11/1173548008005.html|archivedate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later lived in [[Canberra]] with his second wife, Christine Gee.

==Writing==
His novels are primarily set in Australia, his adopted country, or South Africa, the country of his birth. His first book, [[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]], was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay's fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia's best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a [[The Power of One (film)|film]], as well as being re-released in an edition for children.

Courtenay was one of Australia's most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s2871243.htm|title=Blockbusters And Bestsellers|work=[[First Tuesday Book Club]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111214538/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s2871243.htm|archivedate=11 November 2012|date=11 May 2012|authorlink=Jennifer Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only ''The Power of One'' has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because "American publishers for the most part have difficulties about Australia, they are interested in books in their own country first and foremost. However, we receive many e-mails and letters from Americans who have read my books and I am hoping in the future that publishers will recognize that there is a market for all my books in the U.S."&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;{{citation|url=http://ebookauthor.com.au/index.php/australian-author/Fiction-eBooks/bryce-courtenay-australian-author|title=Bryce Courtenay|publisher=eBooks International|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501175854/http://ebookauthor.com.au/index.php/australian-author/Fiction-eBooks/bryce-courtenay-australian-author|archivedate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business identification number''' or '''BIN''' is a proposed identification number to replace eighteen different registration numbers required to be obtained by a company to operate in [[India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9693">The '''Continental Irish Car of the Year''' (previously '''Semperit Irish Car of the Year''') award was established in 1978 based on similar [[Car of the Year]] awards. It is organised and judged by the Irish Motoring Writers Association (IMWA), a grouping of Irish motoring journalists. The award was sponsored by German tyre manufacturer Continental Tyres / [[Semperit]]. In December 2009, the title of the award was changed to ''Continental Irish Car of the Year'', as the sponsor sought to raise the profile of the Continental Tyres brand in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continental Irish Car of the Year 2010 list announced|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/athlone/article/18538/continental-irish-car-of-the-year-2010-list-announced|publisher=advertiser.ie|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W213) Estate, 2017.jpg |right|thumb|The current winner is the Mercedes-Benz E-Class]]
The award has five category winners, ''Continental Irish Small Car of the Year'', ''Continental Irish Compact Family Car of the Year'', ''Continental Irish Family Car of the Year'', ''Continental Irish Executive / Luxury Car of the Year'', and the ''Continental Irish Performance Car of the Year''. It also has a ''"Continental Irish Van of the Year"'', The winner of that category for 2017 is the [[Citroën Dispatch]].

[[Ford of Europe|Ford]] has won the competition seven times, with the Ford Mondeo winning the overall title the most times for an individual model. The award for 2017 went to the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]], marking the first time the prestigious award has gone to the premium car maker. The awards event takes place each year, at a venue in Dublin in the end of November.

==Current rules==
Cars are assessed by the twenty eight jurors on the following criteria: {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

* Use of new technology/new ideas.
* Safety factors.
* Equipment level, fuel economy, practicality.
* Environmental impact (emissions, recyclability).
* Use of space, comfort, ventilation and layout.
* Build quality, fit and finishing.
* Ride, dynamic qualities, road holding, steering, maneuverability.
* Engine, ease of driving, braking.
* Price, warranty, dealer network, after sales service.
* Driver/user feedback.

==Results==
The first receiver of the award was the [[Volkswagen Golf]] Diesel, when it received the inaugural award in 1978. It débuted some four years after the regular Volkswagen Golf. The second receiver, the [[Volkswagen Derby]], was around 1½ years old when it won the award, as was the third receiver, the [[Fiat Ritmo]]. The [[Datsun Stanza]] received the award soon after its launch, while the next receiver, the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]], had been on sale since September 1980. Mercedes won the award of 2017, the first time in the forty year history of the award. The Peugeot 3008 won the accolade for 2018 the second time the car has won the award.

It was a similar story with the [[Renault 19]], which was launched in 1988.

CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in [[Critical Quality Attributes]]. Those attributes with a higher impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determining Criticality-Process Parameters and Quality Attributes Part I: Criticality as a Continuum|url=http://www.biopharminternational.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=830461&amp;pageID=1|publisher=biopharminternational|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within the process and the subsequent production of substandard products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Process Parameters and Critical Quality Attributes: Why Does the Selection Process Take so Long?|url=http://www.propharmagroup.com/blog/critical-process-parameters-and-critical-quality-attributes-why-does-selection-process-take-so|publisher=ProPharma Group|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]] are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.

One method of defining CPPs is to look at the effect of certain production processes on critical quality attributes. Those production parameters which have a measurable effect on those quality attributes that have been identified as critical can be considered CPPs and must always be in a state of control.

The '''Dogs of the Dow''' is an [[investment strategy]] popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in 1991, which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) stocks whose [[dividend]] is the highest fraction of their price.

==History==
Selecting some components of the DJIA is not a new idea. An article by H. G. Schneider was published in ''[[The Journal of Finance]]'' in 1951, based on selecting stocks by their [[price–earnings ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated). [http://www.investorhome.com/dogs.htm "'Dogs of the Dow' and the 'Foolish Four'"]. investorhome.com. Retrieved May 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Proponents of the Dogs of the Dow strategy argue that [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] companies do not alter their dividend to reflect trading conditions and, therefore, the dividend is a measure of the average worth of the company; the stock price, in contrast, fluctuates through the [[business cycle]]. This should mean that companies with a [[High-yield stocks|high yield]], with a high dividend relative to stock price, are near the bottom of their business cycle and are likely to see their stock price increase faster than low-yield companies.

Under this model, an investor annually reinvesting in high-yield companies should out-perform the overall market. The logic behind this is that a high-dividend yield suggests both that the stock is oversold and that management believes in its company's prospects and is willing to back that up by paying out a relatively high dividend.  Investors are thereby hoping to benefit from both above-average stock-price gains as well as a relatively high quarterly dividend.  Of course, several assumptions are made in this argument.

The first assumption is that the dividend price reflects the company size rather than the company business model.  The second is that companies have a natural, repeating cycle in which good performances are predicted by bad ones. Due to the nature of the concept, the Dogs may come from a small number of sectors. For example, the ten stocks that belonged to the 2015 Dogs of the Dow list came from only six sectors, including industrials, energy, and healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Chart (undated) | url = http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/3701a6-dogs-of-the-dow-2015|title = Dogs of the Dow 1015 – Comparing Performance Between S&amp;P 500 and Dogs of the Dow – Stock List Is Based on DogsOfTheDow.com. | access-date = May 11, 2016 | publisher = Hello Money (hellomoney.co)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] which covers eleven sectors.

==Results==
O'Higgins and others back-tested the strategy as far back as the 1920s and found that investing in the Dogs consistently outperformed the market as a whole. Since that time, the data shows that the Dogs of the Dow as well as the popular variant, the Small Dogs of the Dow, have performed well.

For example, for the twenty years from 1992 to 2011, the Dogs of the Dow matched the average annual total return of the DJIA (10.8 percent) and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (9.6 percent), as reported by the [http://www.dogsofthedow.com/ Dogs of the Dow] website located at dogsofthedow.com.

The Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five lowest-priced Dogs of the Dow, outperformed both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 with an average annual total return of 12.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff (undated) | title= Dogs of the Dow Total Return: Dog Years|url=http://www.dogsofthedow.com/dogyrs.htm|publisher= Dogs of the Dow | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When each individual year is reviewed, it is clear that both the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow did not outperform each and every year. In fact, the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow struggled to keep up with the Dow during latter stages of the [[dot-com boom|dot-com boom (1998 and 1999)]] as well as during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis (2007–2009)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff (undated) | title=Dogs of the Dow|url=http://www.dogsofthedow.com |publisher=Dogs of the Dow | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that an investor would be best served by viewing this as a longer-term strategy by giving this portfolio of stocks time to recover in case of a rare-but-extreme economic event (e.g., dot-com boom, financial crisis).

==Criticism==
On January 8, 2014, John S. Tobey wrote an article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine where he criticized the Dogs.  He said that it should use [[price weighting]], instead of [[equal weighting]], because that is what the DJIA uses. He said that, for the year 2013, using the price weighting the Dogs would have returned less, rather than more, than the DJIA. He suggested that it is too simple and it should use more factors such as [[dividend payout ratio|dividend–payout ratio]], growth of cash and earnings, price performance, and many other things. However, he did not say how to combine these into a strategy. He also criticized it for back-testing (although the method was published in 1991). He also said that the strategy would not work well for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = January 8, 2014 | author = Tobey John S. | title=Ditch 'Dogs of the Dow' – The Mutts Have Bad Genes, Improper Breeding and False Papers | work = [[Forbes]] | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2014/01/08/ditch-dogs-of-the-dow-the-mutts-have-bad-genes-improper-breeding-and-false-papers | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Expectation damages''' are [[damages]] recoverable from a [[breach of contract|breach]] of [[contract]] by the non-breaching party. An award of expectation damages protects the injured party's interest in realizing the value of the expectancy that was created by the promise of the other party.

The purpose of expectation damages is to put the non-breaching [[plaintiff|party]] in the position it would have occupied had the contract been fulfilled. Expectation damages can be contrasted to [[reliance damages]] and [[restitution|restitution damages]], which are remedies that address other types of interests of parties involved in [[contract|enforceable promises]].

The default for expectation damages are monetary damages which are subject to limitations or exceptions (see below)

Expectation damages are measured by the diminution in value, coupled with [[consequential damages|consequential]] and [[incidental damages|incidental]] damages.

== Measuring Expectation Damages ==
In expectation damages, the measure of damages is the difference between what was given and what was promised, along with consequential and incidental expenses minus any payments received from the breaching party and any costs saved as a result of the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The proper amount is that which gives the non-breaching party the "benefit of the bargain." However, it is important to note that expectation damages are not punitive; its theoretical purpose is to place the injured, non-breaching party in the same position that they would have occupied had there been full performance of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|56|2013|litigants=Clark v Macourt |parallelcite=(2013) 253 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, it is the amount that makes the injured party indifferent to the breach.

Examples: 
*General contractor accepts an offer from a subcontractor and enters into a contract.  The general contractor breaches / repudiates their contract part way through the subcontractor's performance.  Generally, the subcontractor is entitled to seek an amount equal to the contract price or unrealized value of the promised performance plus costs incurred in preparing or performing under the contract (and costs incidental to the breach e.g., storage costs, restocking fees for returns; penalties or costs for canceling contracts, supply orders etc.) minus any progress payments made by the general contractor and minus costs saved by the breach; can include anticipated profit.
*Neal signs a contract agreeing to buy 10 hours of landscaping services from John's Landscaping for $50 an hour. If Neal breaks the contract and doesn't use any of John's Landscaping's services, expectation damages paid to John's Landscaping would be $500 minus any costs John's Landscaping may have saved, which is the economic loss they suffered. If John's Landscaping breaks the contract, and Neal is forced to hire another service for $60 an hour, expectation (direct) damages paid to Neal would equal $100 ($10 an hour, the difference in price between the original contract and the new contract).

==Potential Exceptions or Limitations ==

* Duty to mitigate - the aggrieved party has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages. Failure to take such steps can cut off damages which arose from such a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate.  This is a duty of reasonable care thus no duty to take steps which are unreasonably burdensome. Example - buyer breaches contract to purchase produce; seller is expected to mitigate e.g., "cover" under the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code or resale; failure to make reasonable attempts to resell can be a ground to deny damages arising from breach e.g., spoilage.  Breaching party is liable for costs which arise from an effort to take reasonable steps to mitigate.  E.g., party continues to work after being notified of a breach and running up the bill.  (however, this might be reasonable if the aggrieved party reasonably believed they had a better chance of selling a completed product to an alternative buyer).
* Reasonable certainty - must be able to calculate the damages based on reasonably certain facts or comparable situations. Cannot have a calculation based wholly on guesses. In cases of doubt, many jurisdictions have adopted a view that the breaching party should bear the risk of doubt rather than the aggrieved party.
* Foreseeability - Generally, no consequential damages unless they are known or foreseeable.  e.g., No lost profits for third party transactions (e.g., Hadley v. Baxendale case below), holding that Baxendale could only be held liable for losses that were generally foreseeable, or if Hadley had mentioned his special circumstances in advance. The mere fact that a party is sending something to be repaired does not indicate that they would lose profits if it were not delivered on time. The court suggested various other circumstances under which Hadley could have entered into this contract that would not have presented such dire circumstances, and noted that where special circumstances exist, provisions can be made in the contract voluntarily entered into by the parties to impose extra damages for a breach. e.g. [[Hadley v Baxendale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hadley v Baxendale]] |court=EWHC |division =Exch |year=1854 |num=J70 |paralleicte=[1854] 156 [[English Reports|ER]] 145 |copurtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cost of performance or a proposed measure of damage greatly exceeds market value of full performance ([[Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.|Peevyhouse v Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co]]) E.g., land owner contract with coal company promised restoration of land after mining complete - coal company refused to comply; court found the cost of restoration (~$30k) grossly exceeded value of the property in unrestored condition ($300 price difference between condition before and after coal mining). However, this case has been widely criticized; 2nd Restatement of the Law criticized it; many courts will not follow this rule thus would decline to award damages based on market value based on view that damages should be awarded based on actual harm to injured party versus hypothetical market value - dependent on jurisdiction)

'''Federico Santa María Carrera''' (c. August 15, 1845 - December 20, 1925)  was a [[Chile]]an businessman and [[philanthropist]]. He was of [[Basque people|Basque]] descent and member of the notable [[Carrera family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={09b31ebd-bb5c-419c-87c7-3069540a13e3}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federico Santa María was born in [[Valparaíso, Chile|Valparaíso]], the son of Juan Antonio Santa María Artigas and of Magdalena Carrera Aguirre. Although he was a member of two of the most respected and influential Chilean families of the 19th century, the [[Domingo Santa María|Santa María]] and the [[Carrera family|Carrera]] families, he made his huge fortune in the sugar markets of [[Paris]], in which he arrived when he was very young.

His importance in the sugar market was considerable: he became a major power in the French economy. During [[World War I]] he closed down all his businesses, declaring that he did not want to profit from war. He also supported the French Army, donating clothes and weapons for an entire regiment. 

However, once the war ended, in 1922 he started to purchase important quantities of sugar in the stock market. As analysts later declared that sugar production would be at a deficit that year, this led to enormous profits for Santa Maria. For this success he was investigated by the French national assembly, but it was determined that he had acted within legal bounds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecas.usm.cl/web/wp-content/uploads/historicos/087_80%20a%C3%B1os%20de%20universidad.pdf|title=Especial 80 años Universidad Santa Maria|last=|first=|date=|website=Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Federico Santa Maria was a very atypical millionaire for his time. Profoundly anti-clerical, he never got married yet lived together for decades with the French woman Anna Guillaud&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciperchile.cl/2014/11/03/agustin-edwards-una-biografia-desclasificada-del-dueno-de-el-mercurio/|title=Agustín Edwards Eastman: Una biografía desclasificada del dueño de El Mercurio {{!}} CIPER Chile CIPER Chile » Centro de Investigación e Información Periodística|website=ciperchile.cl|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Because he had no descendants, he gave his entire fortune to his hometown [[Valparaíso]] for the founding of a technical and engineering school. The result of his legacy was the [[UTFSM|Federico Santa María Technical University]].

He was a distant relative of famous Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]].

The plant currently comprises {{convert|2900000|sqft|m2}} of production space and employs 3,510 hourly workers and 140 salaried workers &amp;mdash; and currently manufactures the [[Ford Mustang]] coupe and the tenth generation [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Lincoln Continental]].

==History==
[[File:FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S NEW CASTING PLANT AT FLAT ROCK - NARA - 549726.jpg|thumb|right|Casting plant, 1973.]]
Following three years of work and the largest single investment by Ford, the Michigan Casting Center (MCC) opened in January 1972, at the time one of the most technologically advanced casting facilities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Opens a Giant Casting Centre|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6GwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4YkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=2695%2C4464032|work=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 January 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the sizable capital investment, frequent union labor problems and work injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit plant|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jTQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d1EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=1110%2C375353|work=Windsor Star|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=1 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and declining demand for the V8 engine blocks produced there led to the facility's closure in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Will Close Unit in Flat Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/business/ford-will-close-unit-in-flat-rock.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=15 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Rock Mayor Hopeful|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IFwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AasFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20closed&amp;pg=1337%2C2901659|work=The Argus-Press|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=3 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worker, [[Robert Williams (robot fatality)|Robert Williams]], was killed by an [[industrial robot]] arm on January 25, 1979. He is the first known human to be killed by a robot.

[[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]] started construction of a new building on the site of the Michigan Casting Center in 1985 and cars started production at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA in September 1987 with the [[Mazda MX-6]] and [[Ford Probe]] coupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manji|first=James F.|title=Building cars with Mazda quality.

Ford repurchased a 50% share in the plant on April 15, 1992, and it officially became a joint-venture and was renamed AutoAlliance International on July 1, 1992.&lt;ref name=Mazda2008&gt;{{cite web|title=North American All-New Mazda6 Production Begins at AutoAlliance International|url=http://www.mazda.com/publicity/release/2008/200807/080723.html|work=Mazda|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The plant began production of all models of the [[Mazda 626]] sold in America starting in 1993.  During this era, [[Deepak Ahuja]] was Chief Financial Officer of the joint venture.&lt;ref name="star-20111111"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/magazine/fall-2011/PDF/alumni-profile-deepak-ahuja.pdf|title=Alumni profile: Deepak Ahuja|work=McCormick Magazine|issue=Fall 2011|page=42|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=18 September 2018|first=Leanne|last=Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Contour]]-derived [[Mercury Cougar]] was produced at the plant from 1998 to 2002. Production of North American [[Mazda 6]] began in the 2003 model year, followed by the [[Ford Mustang]] starting in 2005.

The last Mazda 6 rolled off the line on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda 6 back to the [[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu factory]] in Japan and opened a new factory in Salamanca, Mexico to build the [[Mazda 2]] and [[Mazda 3]] subcompact and compact cars.

On September 10, 2012, Ford Motor Company re-took full management control of the plant, renaming it the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant, and confirming $555 million in investments designed to retool the plant for the production of the 2013 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] midsize sedan.&lt;ref name="media.ford.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112164832/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2015, Ford confirmed that the new 2017 [[Lincoln Continental]] sedan would be produced at the Flat Rock plant starting in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Continental to be made at Ford Flat Rock plant|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2015/07/15/ford-confirms-lincoln-continental-production-flat-rock-michigan-plant/30197835|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2017, Ford announced that it will begin manufacturing an electric small SUV by 2020, and a high passenger volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing by 2021, both to be built at Flat Rock.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/01/03/ford-adding-electrified-f-150-mustang-transit-by-2020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesco Illy''' ({{lang-hu|Illy Ferenc}}; 1892, [[Temesvár]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] (now [[Timișoara]], [[Romania]]) – 1956, [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] financial accountant, bookkeeper, business magnate, philanthropist, the founder of [[illy]] and [[inventor]] of coffee machinery.

==Biography==
Illy was born to a middle-class family in Temesvár (now [[Timisoara]], [[Romania]]). His father, János Illy was a carpenter. His mother, Aloisia Rössler was [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]]. He studied economics in Temesvár. After secondary school he moved to [[Vienna]], where he worked for two big Transylvanian companies.
At the age of 22 he was [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and served from 1914 at almost every front of the First World War, including at the [[Battle of Kraśnik]] and the [[Battles of the Isonzo]].

After the war he stayed with his sister in [[Trieste]], where he soon married a Triestine woman. He found work with companies dealing with [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee roasting]]. He later invented his own method for maintaining the quality of freshly roasted coffee so it could be delivered to other locations rather than roasting it on site. He formed a partnership with the local coffee manufacturers Hausbrandt.

In 1933 Illy founded [[illycaffè]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Fortune magazine |title=Crisis in a Coffee Cup |first=Nicholas |last=Stein |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which invented the first automatic coffee machine which substituted pressurized water for steam. The ''Illetta'' became the predecessor of today's [[espresso machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Tagliabue |title=Coffeehouses as Fashion Boutiques; Selling Cachet by the Cup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/business/worldbusiness/26eurocoffee.html?pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/C/Coffee |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 December 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, the food chemist [[Ernesto Illy]] (1925–2008) took over the management of the coffee company, which is now in the hands of the third generation Illys.

==Career==
Wilson was offered numerous modeling projects since high school. She declined those offers due to the rules of her Catholic high school (Assumption) banning their students from working in modeling, TV and movies. When she graduated, she was cast in a [[Pond's]] commercial that aired in mid-2004.  After which, she received more modeling and acting offers. Wilson is now the endorser of several products and brands in the Philippines, such as [[Bench (Philippine clothing brand)|Bench]], [[Garnier]], [[TechnoMarine]], [[Ginebra San Miguel]], [[Century Pacific Food|Argentina Corned Beef]], [[Fila (company)|Fila]], Belo Sexy Solutions, [[Unilever|Cream Silk]], [[American Apparel]], [[Cadbury]], [[Globe Telecom|Globe Tattoo]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Wade Ceramics|Wade]], [[The SM Store|SM Accessories]], Kashieca, and [[Jaguar XF|Jaguar]]. Wilson appears in Bench fashion shows every year and has been on several magazine covers. Wilson is also a VJ for [[Channel V]] and is the host of ''[[Asia's Next Top Model]]'' since its [[Asia's Next Top Model (cycle 3)|third cycle]] in 2015. Currently, she is also the marketing director of [[Sunnies Studios]], an eyewear brand she co-owns with Bea Soriano, Eric Dee Jr. and Martine Cajucom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnies Studios|url=http://www.zalora.sg/magazine/#story/sunnies-studios_955827|website=Zalora|publisher=Zalora|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laurente|first1=Zoe|title=Sunnies Studios by the Numbers|url=http://www.stylebible.ph/fashion/style-report/sunnies-studios-by-the-numbers/|website=Style Bible PH|publisher=Summit Digital|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
[[File:Samson &amp; Gert Kerstshow 2010.JPG|thumb|right|The Samson and Gert Christmas show 2009]]
Verhulst already knew on a very early age that he wanted to become famous (own words).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In 1987 he applied at the "Koninkijk Conservatorium Antwerpen"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; (translated: The Royal Academy of fine Arts Antwerp) where he was rejected, he would recall this as a gift from Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.studio100fan.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2141 |title=Forum • Toon onderwerp - [Interview&amp;#93; De 7 hoofdzonden volgens Gert Verhulst |publisher=Studio100fan.eu |date=2005-12-18 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he got his first job at the former BRTN (now [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]) as [[continuity announcer]].

=== Samson en Gert ===
'''Samson &amp; Gert''' is a [[Flanders|Flemish]] children's television series produced by Eline van Noppen, centered on the talking dog Samson and his owner Gert. In its entire run, the show was originally aired on [[Eén|TV1]] from Christmas Day 1989 until 1 December 1997, where it moved to [[Ketnet]] and continues airing all of its episodes to this day. As a [[continuity announcer]] Verhulst wanted to make the announcements before children's television programmes more appealing by having an animal puppet next to him.&lt;ref name="cinenews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starnews.cinenews.be/nl/sterren/Gert-Verhulst/biografie/ |title=Biografie : Gert Verhulst |language=fr|publisher=Starnews.cinenews.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got in touch with [[puppeteer]] Danny Verbiest, who created the puppet dog Samson. Samson, an [[Old English Sheepdog]], made his screen debut on 2 September 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ketnet.be/agenda/eerste-aflevering-samson-en-gert |title=Eerste keer Samson en Gert &amp;#124; Ketnet |publisher=Ketnet.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair's popularity grew very rapidly in [[Flanders]] and they were given their own television series in 1990. The show, named ''Samson'', premiered on 2 September 1990. During the show, Samson and Gert and their friends would encounter many funny and chaotic situations. The plot would be interrupted for contests, fan mail and a variety of cartoons, such as [[The Smurfs]], [[Ovide and the Gang]], and [[Mrs. Pepper Pot (anime)|Mrs. Pepper Pot]].

=== Zeg eens Euh! ===
Verhulst presented the language game "Zeg eens Euh!" (translated: Say Uh!) It was a game that was broadcast on Friday between 1992 and 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrt.be/tijdslijn/zeg-eens-euh |title=Zeg eens euh &amp;#124; VRT |publisher=Vrt.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose concept was clearly inspired by the British radio game, ''[[Just a Minute]]''. The panelists alternately were given a theme that they had to talk about for one minute. Together with the theme they got a banned word that they could not use. In the panel were four Flemish celebrities including: "Emiel Goelen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/3808/Showbizz/video/detail/2237029/Emiel-Goelen-overleden-een-fragment-uit-Zeg-Eens-Euh.dhtml |title=Emiel Goelen overleden: een fragment uit 'Zeg Eens Euh!' |language=nl|publisher=HLN.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Margriet Hermans]]", "[[Koen Crucke]]" &amp; "Jaak Pijpen". Occasionally one of these panelists was replaced by "Mark Tijsmans", "Andrea Croonenberghs", "[[Walter Baele]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.een.be/programmas/de-generatieshow/90-rosa-boycot-zeg-eens-euh |title=Eén - De generatieshow - 90 &amp;#124; Rosa boycot Zeg eens euh &amp;#124; Eén |publisher=Een.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; "Paul Ambach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.een.be/programmas/de-generatieshow/90-zeg-eens-euh-met-rosa-en-boogie-boy |title=Eén - De generatieshow - 90 &amp;#124; Zeg eens euh met Rosa en Boogie boy &amp;#124; Eén |publisher=Een.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer months, the viewer share rose from 700,000 to 800,000 viewers. When Verhulst moved to [[Vtm|VTM]], "Donaat Deriemaecker" took over the game but after a scandal involving one of the panel members, Emiel Goelen, the show was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-visie.be/nieuws/belgie/tv-visie-summertube-3-zeg-eens-euh_23983/ |title=TV-Visie SummerTube (3): 'Zeg eens Euh' &amp;#124; TVvisie |publisher=Tv-visie.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Move to VTM ===
In 1997 Verhulst moved to [[Vtm|VTM]] where he presented "Wat zegt u?" (translated: What do you say ?).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbizzsite.be/bio/gert-verhulst |title=Gert Verhulst &amp;#124; Showbizzsite |language=nl|publisher=Showbizzsite.be |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by "Linx"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zangtalent.be/nl/85/1254/Gert-Verhulst |title=ZangTalent - Gert Verhulst |publisher=Zangtalent.be |date=1968-01-24 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the summer of 1998 Verhulst presented "Sterrenslag" (translated: Star battle)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.demorgen.be/plus/sterrenslag-met-gert-verhulst-a-1412191744303/ |title=Sterrenslag met Gert Verhulst &amp;#124; archief &amp;#124; De Morgen |language=nl|publisher=Demorgen.be |date=1998-06-09 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for several weeks because presenter 'Herbert Bruynseels' had had to withdraw due to illness. In the summer of 1999, the dialect game "Watte ?" (translated What?) started&lt;ref name="cinenews1"/&gt; with the panel members: "Walter De Donder", "[[Koen Crucke]]" and "Simonne Peeters".

Verhulst founded "[[Studio 100]]" in 1996 together with "Danny Verbiest", and "Hans Bourlon". They came together in 1989, when the programme "[[Samson en Gert]]" (translated "Samson and Gert") was first produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/929/TV-Gids/article/detail/1152537/2010/09/02/Ketnet-en-Studio-100-vieren-20-jaar-Samson-en-Gert.dhtml |title=Ketnet en Studio 100 vieren 20 jaar 'Samson en Gert' |language=nl|publisher=HLN.be |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio 100 started in 1996 with one program [[Samson en Gert]]. They immediately decided to create a new program to be able to advertise themselves more. They chose [[Kabouter Plop]] (translated Gnome Plop).&lt;ref name="derijkstebelgen1"/&gt; It has been broadcast on [[Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij|VTM]] since 1997. In 1999, Studio 100 expanded significantly with four new projects, all launched in [[Flanders]]: a musical, a film, and two new television programmes. For both the musical and the film, [[Vtm]] was asked to provide financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rektoverso.be/artikel/samson-en-gert-20-jaar-samen-op-de-moto |title=Samson en Gert 20 jaar samen op de moto &amp;#124; rekto:verso |publisher=Rektoverso.be |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of '99, Studio 100 and the [[Medialaan|VMMa]] (Vlaamse Media Maatschappij, founded in 1987 as Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij by nine publishers each with an 11.1% share),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fokuskmo.be/editorial/gert-verhulst-hans-bourlon-studio-100-is-vrij-typisch-vlaams/ |title=Gert Verhulst &amp; Hans Bourlon: ‘Studio 100 is vrij typisch Vlaams’ - Fokus KMO |publisher=Fokuskmo.be |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that they would incorporate [[Meli Park]].

'''Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit''' (19 February 1822&amp;nbsp;– 23 February 1876), was an [[Andorra]]n nobleman and politician.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit was born on 19 February 1822 in [[La Seu d'Urgell]] in the Catalan [[Pyrenees]], close to the [[Principality of Andorra]]. He was the only son of Josep Plandolit Targarona and Maria Rosa Areny.{{sfn|Obiols|Miró|2014|p=203}}{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}} He belonged to one of the most prominent Catalan families at the time, with a long industrial and commercial background that traces its origins back to the 17th century.{{sfn|Codina et al.|2006|p=6}}

His mother died nine months after his birth, in September. Afterward, Josep and his son moved to Andorra, settling in [[Ordino]] where he eventually remarried. Josep died on 17 July 1843 aged 55 at the family estate after a long illness.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}}

In 1841, at the age of 19, Areny-Plandolit married Maria Dolors Parella, Baroness of Senaller.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}} 

=== Wife's murder ===
Tragedy struck on 19 June 1855, when his first wife was murdered at the age of 30 in [[Barcelona]], where the family had property they frequently visited. Her attacker, Blas Durana Atauri, stabbed her 13 times in a carefully premeditated attack.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=627}} The crime became well-known in 19th-century Barcelona and shocked the public at the time because of the status and personality of those involved and also for its bizarre aftermath.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=632}}{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}

Durana was an infantry colonel in the [[Spanish Army]] and was stationed in Barcelona at the time. He frequently attended social gatherings where he attempted to climb the social ladder and court women. He soon caught wind of the Baroness and fell deeply in love with her. Parella initially welcomed and tolerated his compliments, but became alarmed when Durana began appearing at an increasing amount of the same gatherings, apparently not letting up.{{sfn|Olmos|2015|loc=''El Correo''}} 

[[File:Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit 02.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Areny-Plandolit in 1866]]
After complaining to her husband, Areny-Plandolit was annoyed enough to ask his friend, [[Captain General of Catalonia]] Juan Zapatero y Navas, for help. Zapatero agreed to redeploy Durana to [[Lugo]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to mend the situation.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} Durana was able to continue his amorous siege by making up excuses and taking advantage of every opportunity to return to Barcelona, apparently still motivated by love. Fueled by frustration and envy, this feeling eventually turned into hatred. Desperate and embittered, he decided to kill Parella.{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}

Durana had spent the day of the attack carefully observing the Areny-Plandolit and Parella property, hiding in an alleyway on the opposite street. He attacked the Baroness at dusk when she finally came out of the house in order to visit a theater; she died within twenty minutes.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=628}} As he did not attempt to flee, he was quickly captured by a local militia to whom he quickly identified himself and triumphantly admitted his crime.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=628}} 

Durana's lawyer tried to argue that mental instability was to blame and referred to past incidents to prove this claim.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=631}} However, he was quickly convicted and sentenced to be executed by garrotte.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=629}} Although Durana remained calm and composed during the sentencing, the method of execution came unexpectedly since he had expected to be put in front of a firing squad, something more befitting a colonel. His request to change the method of execution was denied.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=632}}{{sfn|Pallarès-Personat|2007}}

Durana committed suicide on the eve of the execution by means of [[Mercury(II) cyanide|mercuric cyanide]], likely smuggled in by an army comrade on an earlier visit to him in prison.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}}{{sfn|Blanche|1862|pp=633–635}} Rumors had been going around that the trial had been a farce and that the colonel, as a result of his rank, would somehow be allowed to escape his fate. As a result, a large crowd had gathered on the morning of the execution to witness the event. To avoid a riot, authorities wheeled out his dead body and went through the motions of the execution; essentially executing his corpse.{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=634}}{{sfn|Bofarull i Terrades|2002}}

Areny-Plandolit was not present at the burial of his first wife and appears not to have mourned for long, if at all.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} He remarried a little more than three months later, to Carolina de Plandolit, his cousin.{{sfn|Pérez|2017|loc=''Taxidermidades''}} They had ten children.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}}

=== New Reform ===
{{seealso|Andorra#19th century: the New Reform and the Andorran Question{{!}}New Reform and the Andorran Question}}
Andorra in the mid-19th century was a country in an economic crisis. Areny-Plandolit led the [[reforms]] to replace the aristocratic and [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] that previously ruled the state. The political system was largely governed based on the privileges of a small social group formed of traditional wealthy Andorran families, to whom his family also belonged. This type of oligarchical governance made it possible for them to control all the decisions made by the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council of the Valleys]], and to manage public resources as they pleased.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=178–179}}

With a total estimated population of only 4,000 residents, whose economic power was growing and eventually even surpassing that of the original wealthy families, more and more voices were demanding social and political changes. The General Council reacted with a steady refusal and inaction. This led to a group of reformists led by Areny-Plandolit to organize meetings in order to discuss the best way to bring about reform.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998}}

[[File:Pla de la Nova Reforma d'Andorra.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A picture of the Plan of the New Reform of Andorra in a glass box in a museum|Plan of the New Reform of Andorra]]
On 22 April 1866, The New Reform ({{lang-ca|Nova Reforma}}) was decreed by the Episcopal [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]], Bishop [[Josep Caixal i Estradé]], and established the basis of the [[Constitution of Andorra|Andorran constitution]] and symbols (such as the [[Flag of Andorra|tricolor flag]]) of Andorra. It was ratified three years later by [[Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]].{{sfn|Pons|2018|loc=''El Nacional''}}

The reforms had several effects. Most importantly, it gave every citizen of the country the right to vote. It also promised regular elections; in this case twelve of the twenty-four councilors were to be elected every two years, with a maximum post length of four years. There was also the creation of the position of town commissioner in order to control public spending and put a halt to the waste of resources.{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}}

After producing the official document listing the reforms in May 1866, Areny-Plandolit was elected [[List of First Syndics of the General Council|First Syndic]] of the General Council, a position akin to [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]].{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=345–347}}

{{Quote|text = To name the authorities constituting the Common, all the voters of each parish shall have a right to vote. To name the four members of the General Council, all of the voters of each parish shall also have the right to vote.{{sfn|d'Areny-Plandolit|1866}} |title = Excerpt from the Plan of the New Reform}}

'''Guillermo Bauer''' or '''Wilhelm Bauer''' was the proprietor of the first steam-operated [[flour mill]] in [[Argentina]]. 

==Biography==
He was born on 17 February 1844 in Berg, [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] as George Philip Wilhelm Bauer. His parents were Philip Bauer and Catharina Uhlmann. He married María Elisa Sigel, born on 18 December 1851, in Wilheim-Kirchheim, [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], who was also German.

The first mill was authorized in 1859 by the provincial government of [[Antonio Gaspoz]], who built it on the banks of the Cululú River. The steam mill was installed in the colony of San Carlos by Guillermo Bauer and Juan Siegel, who hoped to have eight mills operational before 1890. They benefitted from the inauguration of the railroad in 1885, because they were able to ship their product to the port of [[Rosario]], where Guillermo was able to receive more money for his product. 

By the late 1800s, they were able to cut normal operating costs to the point where the horse-driven mills were closing. Soon after, in the 1890s, Guillermo was honored by the local governor, [[Luciano Leiva]], for giving flour to the poor and contributing money to the local area to stimulate growth. After contributing to the health of many people and giving selflessly, he was honored by a reprographic shop in Rosario, and eventually met [[Pope Leo XIII]], who was touched by his kindness. Guillermo was made the patron saint of reprographers in the early 1900s, and is still honored in many shops today.

He died on 26 April 1912 in Argentina.

The '''John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation''' was founded in 1925&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4932668 | accessdate = 18 November 2014 | publisher = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | title = Company Overview of John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Olga and [[Simon Guggenheim]] in memory of their son, who died on April 26, 1922. The organization awards [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s to professionals who have demonstrated exceptional ability by publishing a significant body of work in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the creative arts, excluding the performing arts.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; The roll of Fellows includes numerous [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureates, [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and other prize winners.

==Details==
Fellowships are intended to provide gifted and skilled people the opportunity to work with as much creative freedom as possible. They are not available to support training or immediate postgraduate work. Fellowships last for between six and twelve months (occasionally longer). The average award amount in 2003 was US$36,000 to 221 fellows. The Foundation supports only individuals. It does not make grants to institutions or organizations. According to Foundation president [[Edward Hirsch]], between 1925 and 2005 the Foundation granted close to $240 million in Fellowships to more than 15,500 individuals. The Foundation selects its Fellows on the basis of two separate competitions, one for Canada and the United States, the other for Latin America and the Caribbean. Competitors submit applications to one of the two Committees of Selection, consisting of about six distinguished scholars or artists.

In 2004 the Foundation awarded 185 Canadian and United States Fellowships for a total of $6,912,000 (an average grant of $37,362). There were 3,268 applicants. In the same year it awarded 36 Latin American and Caribbean Fellowships for a total of $1,188,000 (an average grant of $33,000). There were 819 applicants. 

The Guggenheim art museums are funded separately by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]].

Ferré's grandfather Maurice Ferré Perotín was a French engineer who was involved in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] before settling in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; Ferre's father, Antonio Ferré Bagayado or "Bacallao", was born in [[Havana]], Cuba and grew up there.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWniCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Luis+Alberto+Ferr%C3%A9+Aguayo++grandfather+french&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilycrRjezTAhULCcAKHcUHAmoQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Luis%20Alberto%20Ferr%C3%A9%20Aguayo%20%20grandfather%20french&amp;f=false Memoir] By Rosario Ferré&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he immigrated to Puerto Rico, where he founded the company [[Puerto Rico Iron Works]], in Barrio [[Playa (Ponce)|Playa de Ponce]], Ponce, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/ferre-1029.html|title=Luis Ferré, former governor and Corporation member|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=October 29, 2003|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elboricua.com/PresidentialMedalofFreedom.html Puerto Rico Iron Works]&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico  Ferré met and married María Aguayo Casals, a cousin of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cellist [[Pablo Casals]], [[Pilar Defilló Amiguet|whose mother]] was a Puerto Rico-born Catalan musician.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; Antonio and María had four sons, Luis, [[José Ferré|José]], Carlos and Hermán Ferré, and two daughters, Rosario and [[Isolina Ferré|Isolina]], this latter would became a nun of international prominence.&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

Ferré studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1924 and master's degree in 1925, and music at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/luis-ferre-obituary.htm|title=Former Puerto Rican Gov.

==Industrialist==
Upon his return to [[Puerto Rico]], Ferré helped transform his father's company into a successful business from which he earned a fortune. In 1948, he acquired ''[[El Nuevo Día|El Día]],'' a fledgling newspaper that was later renamed ''El Nuevo Día,'' becoming the newspaper with the largest circulation in Puerto Rico at the time. In the 1950s, Ferré's ''Empresas Ferré'' (Ferre Enterprises) acquired Puerto Rico Cement and [[Ponce Cement]], which capitalized on the economic boom which Puerto Rico enjoyed based on the ambitious industrialization projects undertaken in association with the [[Operation Bootstrap]]. Ferré's  brother, José, had moved to Miami with his family. His son [[Maurice Ferré|Maurice]] expanded a successful business there, selling bagged pre-mixed cement and sand under the name Mezcla Lista. Maurice Ferré was elected Mayor of Miami.

==Political life==
Ferré became active in politics in the 1940s. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Ponce in 1940 and [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]] in 1948.

===Representative===
In 1948, Puerto Ricans were allowed to elect their governor; previously the position was filled by appointment by the United States president. [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] was elected governor of Puerto Rico. A movement began which aimed to adopt a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] relationship with the United States of America. In 1951, a [[referendum]] was held to decide whether to approve or not the option granted by the [[United States Congress]] to draft Puerto Rico's first constitution.  Ferré abstained from participating in the process; the pro-statehood party to which he belonged favored the 1951 [[referendum]]. He believed that the process would mean "an acceptance of a colony and condemn the people to a perpetual condition of second class citizenship". Ferré later participated in the constitutional assembly created by the [[referendum]], which drafted the constitution.&lt;ref name="Univision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=3&amp;schid=0&amp;secid=0&amp;cid=281161|title=Falleció el ex gobernador Luis A.

In 1952 the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was adopted, renaming the body politic of the territory of Puerto Rico as the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]]. Ferré was elected as a member of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|Constitutional Assembly]]. That same year Ferré was elected representative in the [[Puerto Rico]] House of Representatives. He ran under the [[Republican Statehood Party]] ("Partido Estadista Republicano) and officially assumed his duties as representative on January 11, 1953.

===Governor and Senator===
On July 23, 1967, a [[plebiscite]] was held to decide if the people of [[Puerto Rico]] desired to become an independent nation, a state of the United States of America, or continue the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] relation established in 1952. The majority of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]] opted for the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] option (see [[Puerto Rican status referendums]]). Disagreement among the current pro-statehood party led by [[Miguel A. García Méndez]] led Ferré and others to found the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] or [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|PNP]].

In the following general election in 1968, Ferré ran for [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] and defeated Luis Negrón López, the candidate of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] (PPD) by a slight margin. The ruling party had split with the creation of the [[People's Party (Puerto Rico)|People's Party]], which ran incumbent PDP-elected Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella as its gubernatorial candidate,  ending [[Luis Muñoz Marín]]'s PPD's hold on the governor's seat, which had lasted 20 years.

During Ferré's administration, Puerto Rico was in an economic boom at 7% GDP Growth and the unemployment at 10%, the lowest until 1999. His work as governor of Puerto Rico included defending the federal minimum wage and granting workers a Christmas bonus. He visited [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] troops in [[Vietnam]]. In 1970, his first wife, Lorencita, died at La Fortaleza after being bed-ridden for years. Their daughter, [[Rosario Ferré]], an acclaimed novelist and writer, stepped into the role of [[First Lady]].

During his governorship, he paid special attention to youth affairs and bringing young Puerto Ricans into public service.  He successfully had the Puerto Rico Constitution amended to lower the voting age to 18, strongly supported the New Progressive Party Youth organization as party president, and appointed then-young statehooders such as [[Antonio Quiñones Calderón]] and [[Francisco "Pompi" González]] to high-level administration jobs, campaigned for a 26-year-old at large House candidate, nominated a future Senate President and Secretary of State, teenager [[Kenneth McClintock]] as Puerto Rico delegate to the 1971 [[White House Conference on Youth]], and strengthened college scholarship programs.

Before the Congress created the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1971, Ferré had already created Puerto Rico's [[Environmental Quality Board]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gobierno.pr/JCA/Inicio/&lt;/ref&gt; charged with protecting the islands' environment.

In the elections of 1972 he sought reelection but lost to [[Rafael Hernández Colón]] of the PPD.  The PPD had claimed that many corruption scandals (rather minor compared to similar ones in the various administrations following Ferré's) had been overlooked by the Ferré administration. A bloody student strike at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras]] in 1971 had been neutralized by the Puerto Rican police using brute force, something about which Ferré had mixed feelings. Hernández played the youth card in his campaign (when elected he was the youngest Puerto Rican governor). All these issues, along with the reunification of the People's Party and the PDP, contributed to a PDP win over Ferré in the election.

Ferré remained active in politics and in 1976, he was elected to the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]]. Ferré served as the eighth president of the Senate from 1977 to 1981 and continued serving as senator until 1985.

Years after leaving La Fortaleza, he married Tiody De Jesús, a nurse who later became a physician.

After serving as senator, Ferré continued to be active in politics, especially representing the [[United States Republican Party]] on the island. Between 1989 and 1991, Ferré served with former Governor [[Carlos Romero Barceló]], former representative [[Benny Frankie Cerezo]], PNP leader [[Kenneth McClintock]] and former congressional staffer [[David Gerken]] as the New Progressive Party's negotiating team while Congress considered Puerto Rico political status legislation introduced by Senator [[J. Bennett Johnston]].

==Renaissance man==

Ferré was also a talented pianist who recorded several albums of his piano music. On January 3, 1959 he founded the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], in his hometown of Ponce.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/obituaries/22FERR.html?ex=1382241600&amp;en=dce8bfcd789466ca&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND|title=Luis A. Ferré, Who Pushed Puerto Rican Statehood, Dies at 99|author=Douglas Martin|work=The New York Times|date=October 22, 2003|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum initially displayed 71 paintings from his personal collection and today displays over 3,000 pieces. Among other things, Ferré is credited with having rescued from oblivion the painting ''[[Flaming June]]'' by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter [[Frederic Lord Leighton]] – purchasing it in 1963, when it was considered "too old fashioned" and getting it prominently displayed at the Museo of Arte de Ponce.

"El Centro de Bellas Artes", the center for performing arts in [[Santurce, Puerto Rico]] also bears his name, as well as the main highway connecting San Juan and Ponce. He also assisted in the creation of the [[Casals Festival]]  and the [[Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music]]. He was a member of [[Phi Sigma Alpha]] Fraternity. As a sportsman, Ferré practiced fencing, and is honored annually with the "Campeonato Nacional de Esgrima" in Puerto Rico.

His philanthropic deeds and defense for democracy earned him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], awarded by President [[George H. W. Bush]] on November 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031022.html|title=Statement on Don Luis Ferre|author=George W. Bush|publisher=The White House|date=October 22, 2003|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Luis A. Ferre sculpture.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture of Ferré inside the [[Capitol of Puerto Rico]]]]
On September 29, 2003, Ferré was hospitalized with a [[urinary tract infection]] and underwent surgery for an [[intestine|intestinal blockage]] on October 1. While in the hospital he developed [[pneumonia]] before finally succumbing to [[respiratory failure]] on the morning of October 21, 2003.

His body lay in state in Puerto Rico's capitol building in San Juan, then transported to his museum in Ponce, before being taken for a state funeral and burial in that city. His funeral and ceremonies honoring him were attended by numerous politicians. He is interred at the Las Mercedes Cemetery in Ponce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsuralavista.com/periodico/?p=34766 ''Conmemoran Natalicio de Don Luis A. Ferré Aguayo.''] February 22, 2011. El Sur a la Vista. Ponce, Puerto Rico. Retrieved March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the awards that were bestowed on Luis A. Ferré was the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], an honor which was also subsequently bestowed on his sister [[Sor Isolina Ferre]].  The sculptor [[Tomás Batista]] was also commissioned to make a bust of Ferré, which is exhibited in the [[Ponce Museum of Art]].  Another [[Tomás Batista]] bust of him was unveiled by his widow, Tiody, Senate President [[Kenneth McClintock]] and Senate Vice President [[Orlando Parga]] in February, 2008 at the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]]'s Hall of Governors.

In 2003 the historic United States Courthouse and Post Office Building in Ponce, Puerto Rico was named the [[Luis A. Ferré United States Courthouse and Post Office Building]] by an Act of the U.S. Congress.

The segment of [[PR-163|Las Américas Avenue]] that includes the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico]] was renamed the ''Luis A. Ferré Boulevard'' in November, 2010, in his honor.

Matte was born in [[Santiago]]. Her [[paternal]] grandmother, Rosa Ester Alessandri Rodríguez, was the daughter of [[Arturo Alessandri]], Chile’s president during 1920-1925 and 1932-1938.  She is also the sister of [[Jorge Alessandri]], President of Chile between 1958 and 1964. Her paternal grandfather, [[Arturo Matte Larraín]], was a lawyer and congressman, Minister of the State, presidential candidate (1952), and a founder of forestal and paper company [[CMPC (company)|CMPC]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Es}} La Tercera [http://diario.latercera.com/2010/02/10/01/contenido/13_23586_9.html Perfil empresarial y linaje político marcan a titular de Vivienda]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Matte lost her father, [[Arturo Matte Alessandri]], in 1965 when she was 14 years of age.  She completed her schooling in Santiago's ''Colegio Santa Úrsula''.  She completed her university studies in the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] majoring in [[civil engineering]].  In 1974, she married [[Hernán Larraín Fernández]], who is a Chilean Senator and former President of the Senate between 2004–2005, with whom she has six children.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Es}} Radio Cooperativa [http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20100209/pags/20100209160448.html Magdalena Matte]&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Career==
She has worked in the private sector, mainly in the company ''Papeleria Dimar'', of which she has been both executive and investor.  In 2002, she worked with ''Fondo Confianza'' though the foundation ''La Vaca'', wherein she aided in funding [[entrepreneur]]ial women of low-economic resources.  She created 230 work and education centers which cater to 3,000 women in the area of [[Maule Region|El Maule Sur]].

==Politics==
On February 9, 2010, Chile’s then-President-elect Sebastián Piñera nominated Magdalena Matte as his Minister of Housing and Urban Development. In April 19 (2011), Magdalena stepped down as minister due to the suspect millionaire compensation payment to the construction company Kodama.&lt;ref&gt;[[La Tercera|La Tercera (Santiago)]], April 17, 2011, Reports, pp.4-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=476900 emol, 19 de abril de 2011, 11.03 horas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativa.cl/magdalena-matte-la-quinta-baja-en-el-gabinete-del-presidente-pinera/prontus_nots/2011-04-19/114310.html Radio Cooperativa, April 19, 2011, 11.45 hrs.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kodama's case.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}
'''Merger control''' refers to the procedure of reviewing [[mergers , acquisitions]] under [[antitrust]] / competition law. Over 130 nations worldwide have adopted a regime providing for merger control. National or supernational competition agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] [[European Commission]] or the [[US]] [[Federal Trade Commission]] are normally entrusted with the role of reviewing mergers.

Merger control regimes are adopted to prevent anti-competitive consequences of concentrations (as mergers and acquisitions are also known). Accordingly, most merger control regimes normally provide for one of the following substantive tests:

* Does the concentration significantly impede [[effective competition]]? ([[European Union|EU]], [[Germany]])
* Does the concentration substantially lessen competition? ([[United States|US]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])
* Does the concentration lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position? ([[Switzerland]], [[Russia]])

In practice most merger control regimes are based on very similar underlying principles. In simple terms, the creation of a dominant position would usually result in a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to [[effective competition]].

The large majority of modern merger control regimes are of an ''ex-ante'' nature, i.e. the reviewing authorities carry out their assessment before the transaction is implemented.

While it is indisputable that a concentration may lead to a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the antitrust authority faces the challenge of applying various [[Economics|economic]] theories and rules in a legally binding procedure.

==Horizontal mergers==

The vast majority of significant competition issues associated with mergers arises in horizontal mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 1.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A horizontal merger is one between parties that are competitors at the same level of production and/or distribution of a good or service, i.e., in the same [[relevant market]].&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of anticompetitive effects associated with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and coordinated effects.

'''Unilateral effects''', also known as non-coordinated effects, arise where, as a result of the merger, competition between the products of the merging firms is eliminated, allowing the merged entity to unilaterally exercise market power, for instance by profitably raising the price of one or both merging parties’ products, thus harming consumers.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 2.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homogeneous products|homogeneous markets]], unilateral effects can be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player with only a few or no other competitors. In these markets, an important role in the assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice  and the  Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 6.3 http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#6c&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Differentiated Bertrand competition|differentiated markets]], unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two merging companies have highly [[Substitute good|substitutable goods]]. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the [[substitutability]] of the products supplied by the two firms – the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 28 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coordinated effects''' arise where, under certain market conditions (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully be able to [[Coordination game|coordinate]] their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of unilateral effects, the most common form of coordinated effects is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market.

The main question in analysing coordinated effects should be whether the merger materially increases the likelihood that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing [[Coordination game|coordination]]. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger.  This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to coordinated effects.&lt;ref&gt;International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. D.3 and D.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[European Union]] merger control regime, in order for coordinated effects to arise the so-called "[[Airtours]] criteria" have to be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;From the judgment of the General Court of the European Union which introduced these criteria. See Case T-342/99, Airtours v Commission, [2002] ECR II-2585.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "[[Airtours]] criteria", coordination is more likely to emerge in markets where it is relatively simple to reach a common understanding on the terms of coordination. In addition, three conditions are necessary for coordination to be sustainable. First, the coordinating firms must be able to monitor to a sufficient degree whether the terms of [[Coordination game|coordination]] are being adhered to. Second, discipline requires that there is some form of credible deterrent mechanism that can be activated if deviation is detected. Third, the reactions of outsiders, such as current and future competitors not participating in the coordination, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the results expected from the [[Coordination game|coordination]].&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 41 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-horizontal mergers==

There are two basic forms of non-horizontal mergers: vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertical mergers''' are mergers between firms that operate at different but complementary levels in the chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product.  In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same [[relevant market]].  As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either [[relevant market]]. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other.  Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical effects can produce competitive harm in the form of foreclosure. A merger is said to result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies' ability and/or incentive to compete.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 29 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of foreclosure can be distinguished. The first is where the merger is likely to raise the costs of downstream rivals by restricting their access to an important input (input foreclosure). The second is where the merger is likely to foreclose upstream rivals by restricting their access to a sufficient customer base (customer foreclosure).&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 30 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be noted that in general vertical merger concerns are likely to arise only if market power already exists in one or more markets along the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.10 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conglomerate mergers''' involve firms that operate in different [[Relevant market|product markets]], without a vertical relationship.  They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets.  In practice, the focus is on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.12 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Merger review in this area is controversial, as commentators and enforcement agencies disagree on the extent to which one can predict competitive harm resulting from such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.13 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such a disagreement is for instance illustrated by the different outcomes of the merger control reviews by the authorities of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] of the [[Honeywell#GE-Honeywell merger attempt|GE/Honeywell merger attempt]].

Proponents of conglomerate theories of harm argue that in a small number of cases, where the parties to the merger have strong market positions in their respective markets, potential harm may arise when the merging group is likely to foreclose other rivals from the market in a way similar to vertical mergers, particularly by means of tying and bundling their products.  When as a result of foreclosure rival companies become less effective competitors, consumer harm may result.

However, it should be stressed that in these cases there is a real risk of foregoing efficiency gains that benefits consumer welfare and thus the theory of competitive harm needs to be supported by substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.14-3.15 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory and voluntary regimes==

A merger control regime is described as "mandatory" when filing of a transaction is compulsory. Mandatory regimes normally also contain a so-called "suspensory clause", which implies that the parties to a transaction are indefinitely prevented from closing the deal until they have received merger clearance. The majority of merger jurisdictions worldwide have mandatory merger control systems. An examples of a mandatory system with suspensory clause is provided by the [[European Union]] merger control.&lt;ref&gt;See Regulation of the Council (EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EU Merger Regulation) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction can also be made between "local" and "global" bars on closing/implementation; some mandatory regimes provide that the transaction cannot be implemented within the particular jurisdiction (local bar on closing) and some provide that the transaction cannot be closed/implemented anywhere in the world prior to merger clearance (global bar on closing). A number of jurisdictions worldwide have a merger control regime which imposes a global bar on closing. This creates obstacles for the parties to a concentration to close a transaction until a number of the regulatory clearances required are obtained.

A merger control regime is described as "voluntary" when the parties are not prevented from closing the deal and implementing the transaction in advance of having applied for and received merger clearance.  In these circumstances the merging parties are effectively taking the risk that the competition authority will not require them to undo the deal if in due course it is found that the transaction is likely to have an anti-competitive effect.  Voluntary regimes are fairly exceptional. The United Kingdom, for instance, has a voluntary merger control regime. However, the [[Office of Fair Trading]] can request the parties to a merger that has already completed to hold the two businesses separate pending an investigation (so called "[[initial undertakings]]").

Mandatory regimes can be considered effective in preventing anticompetitive concentrations since it is almost impossible to unravel a merger once it has been implemented (for example because key staff have been made redundant, assets have been sold and information has been exchanged). On the other hand, voluntary regimes are seen as constituting less of a burden for merging firms.

'''Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation''' (the '''MiSK Foundation''') ({{lang-ar|مؤسسة الأمير محمد بن سلمان بن عبدالعزيز الخيرية}}) is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] foundation established by Saudi crown prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] in 2011 to develop and empower Saudi youth to become participants in the future economy. MiSK specifically focuses on four key areas: education, creative and digital media, technology, and culture and arts.  It pursues this agenda both through its own programs, and through partnerships with local and global organisations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/misk-foundation-and-bloomberg/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Created in 2011, the MiSK foundation was initiated by Mohammad bin Salman, then advisor to the Governor of Riyadh. The foundation aims to increase economic opportunities in Saudi society, where seventy percent of the population is under the age of 30, in step with the [[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] national restructuring plan.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/q-a-saudi-nonprofit-misk-paves-the-way-for-youth-90230|title=Q&amp;A: Saudi nonprofit MiSK paves the way for youth|website=Devex.com|date=8 May 2017|author=Elizabeth Dickinson|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/young-saudis-see-cushy-jobs-vanish-along-with-nations-oil-wealth.html|title=Young Saudis See Cushy Jobs Vanish Along With Nation’s Oil Wealth|website=Nytimes.com|date=16 February 2016|author=Ben Hubbard|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the MiSK Foundation was one of the main partners of the 9th [[UNESCO]] Youth Forum in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/9th-unesco-youth-forum/partners|title=Main sponsors|website=Unesco.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the two organisations signed a Framework Agreement to collaborate on the development of youth, education, emerging technologies, culture, and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_and_misk_foundation_join_forces_for_knowledge_societi/ |title=UNESCO and MiSK Foundation join forces for knowledge societies|website=Unesco.org|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th International Forum of NGOs was held in Riyadh in May 2017 in partnership with the MiSK foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/youth-and-their-social-impact-7th-international-forum-ngos-official-partnership-unesco|title="Youth and their Social Impact" – 7th International Forum of NGOs in official partnership with UNESCO|website=Unesco.org|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiSK Global Forum started in 2016 and was initially conceived as a two-day forum, with a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustg.com/two-day-misk-global-forum-in-riyadh-showcases-ideas-of-innovation-and-global-culture-to-empower-youth/|title=Two-Day MiSK Global Forum in Riyadh Showcases Ideas of Innovation And Global Culture to Empower Youth|website=Sustg.com|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 25 to 27 November 2016, the MiSK [[Hackathon]] connected more than 100 youths from London and Riyadh by satellite in a competition broadcast over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-driven-blood-bank-donation-invention-scoops-100k-top-prize-at-inaugural-uksaudi-misk-hackathon-603272386.html|title=Data-Driven Blood Bank Donation Invention Scoops $100k Top Prize at Inaugural UK/Saudi MiSK Hackathon|website=Prnewswire.com|date=27 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Foundation launched a campaign with [[Google]] named ''We Are All Online'', an initiative to share best practices in the promotion of online safety for Saudi youth, one of the most connected nations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-youtube/young-saudis-getting-creative-on-youtube-idUSBRE9AH0GY20131118|title=Young Saudis getting creative on YouTube|website=Reuters.com|date=18 November 2013|author=Matt Smith|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the Foundation became a member of the [[MIT Media Lab]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/elite-universities-selling-themselves-mit-harvard-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman|title=Elite universities are selling themselves – and look who’s buying|website=Theguardian.com|date=30 March 2018|author1=Grif Peterson|author2=Yarden Katz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the MiSK Foundation organised a New York-based youth-oriented forum, the MiSK-UNDP Youth Forum, that drew 400 participants and raised awareness on ways that Saudi and Arab youth could further involve themselves with the issues of counter extremism and the refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/youth-take-on-global-challenges-at-saudi-un-forum-1.629112|title=Youth take on global challenges at Saudi-UN forum|website=Thenational.ae|date=16 September 2017|author=Mina Al Oraibi|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a month after the [[Killing of Jamal Khashoggi|death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]  pulled funding to the foundation. The decision ended a joint initiative between the Gates Foundation and the MiSK Foundation called the ''MiSK Grand Challenges'', which made grants to organisations around the world working to create innovative solutions to development challenges. In 2017, the Gates Foundation had committed $5 million to the MiSK Grant Challenges. “Jamal Khashoggi’s abduction and murder are extremely troubling,” said the Gates Foundation in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-with-saudi-charity-over-journalists-murder/|title=Gates Foundation cuts ties with Saudi charity over journalist’s murder|last=Roberts|first=Paul|date=2 November 2018|work=Seattle Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5147080/gates-foundation-pulls-funding-from-saudi-charity-over-khashoggi-murder/|title=Gates Foundation Pulls Funding From Saudi Charity Over Khashoggi Murder|last=Denny|first=Andrew|date=4 November 2018|work=Inquisitr|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation’s work is focused on [[Education in Saudi Arabia|education]], [[Culture of Saudi Arabia|culture]] and [[Media of Saudi Arabia|media]]. It provides contributions to youth development, with a spotlight on technology and the arts, in order to build a knowledge-based economy.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"/&gt; The MiSK Foundation also tackles problems related to terrorism by convening events both in Saudi Arabia and internationally, including the annual Tweeps Forum and the MiSK UNDP Youth Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uae/the-national-news/20170917/281539406128649|title=Youth has its say|website=Pressreader.com|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This state of the art center will be located at the heart of Jordan's [[scientific]], [[academic]] and [[R&amp;D]] corridor. Furthermore, the center will extend its services to cover not only [[Jordan]] but the region as a whole.

The center is planned to be the regions' cornerstone for [[technology commercialization]] and [[entrepreneurship]] development. The QRCE will target university students, [[research]]ers, [[innovators]], [[entrepreneur]]s and others. According to PSUT's development plan, the next step will be the establishment of a [[business]] school to be linked to the center.

Working closely with local and international organizations; the QRCE focuses on issues such as: [[capacity building]], [[Consultant|consulting]], [[counseling]] and developing the local "Entrepreneurial Personality &amp; Spirit".{{cn|date=July 2018}} Furthermore, the QRCE is actively working on extending the [[intellectual wealth]] of Jordan while maintaining strong links with the business community in general.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

{{Competition law}}
Though in general, each business may decide with whom they wish to deal, there are some situations when a '''refusal to deal''' may be considered an unlawful [[anti-competitive practice]], if it prevents or reduces [[competition]] in a [[Market (economics)|market]]. The unlawful behaviour may involve two or more companies refusing to use, buy from or otherwise deal with a person or business, such as a competitor, for the purpose inflicting some economic loss on the target or otherwise force them out of the market. A refusal to deal (also known as a group [[boycott]]) is forbidden in some countries which have restricted market economies, though the actual acts or situations which may constitute such unacceptable behaviour may vary significantly between jurisdictions. 

==Definitions==
Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission defines the refusal to deal as:

{{Quote|Agreements involving [[competitor]]s that involve restricting the supply of goods are prohibited if they have the purpose or effect of substantially lessening [[competition]] in a market in which the businesses operate.|Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|Refusal to deal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Refusal to deal|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ACCC Publishing Unit|isbn=1-921227-28-1|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/publications/refusal-to-deal |author=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indian Competition Act 2002 defines the refusal to deal as:
{{Quote|"Refusal to deal" includes any agreement which restricts, or is likely to restrict, by any method the persons or classes of persons to whom goods are sold or from whom goods are bought|The Competition Act|2002 (India) S4-d}}

'''René Willums Leegte''' (born 8 July 1968 in [[The Hague]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician and former businessman. As a member of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] he was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives of the Netherlands]] between 26 October 2010 and 24 March 2015. He focused on matters of [[natural environment]], [[sustainable development]] and [[energy]].

In January 2015 Leegte laid down his party spokesmanship for [[Groningen gas field|gas winning in Groningen]] and earthquakes in the region. He did so after having a conversation on the topic and party strategy on it being overheard during a trainride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2014049-leegte-vvd-staat-dossier-gaswinning-af.html |title=Leegte (VVD) staat dossier gaswinning af |publisher=Nederlandse Omroep Stichting |date=18 January 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leegte resigned as member of the House of Representatives on 24 March 2015 after having had an additional paid job for over a year at an organisation which was subjected to his parliamentary portfolio. Leegte did not enter the job in the register, nor reported the earnings, he also used his parliamentary emailadress for the additional job. Leegte felt this conflicted with the integrity rules of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and thus resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2026581-vvd-tweede-kamerlid-rene-leegte-stapt-op |title=VVD-Tweede Kamerlid René Leegte stapt op |language=Dutch |publisher=Nederlandse Omroep Stichting |date=24 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, his assignment supported the early development of [[naval aviation]], and he was recognized as an aviation expert alongside Captain [[Washington Irving Chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aviation in the Navy|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022472/1911-03-21/ed-1/seq-8/|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=The Bridgeport Evening Farmer|date=21 March 1911|location=Bridgeport, Connecticut|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He detached from there in May 1911 to attend the summer session at the [[Naval War College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Navy Times|journal=Army-Navy-Air Force Register and Defense Times|date=27 May 1911|volume=49|issue=1640|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFE-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing the summer course, Wainwright received orders to the battleship {{USS|Florida|BB-30}}. While leading a landing party from that ship in battle at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], he earned the [[Medal of Honor]] for his outstanding conduct on April 21-22, 1914.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

In seizing the customhouse, he encountered for many hours the heaviest and most pernicious concealed fire of the entire day, but his courage and coolness under trying conditions were marked.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1914, Wainwright detached from the ''Florida'' with orders to the Naval Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Navy Times|journal=Army-Navy-Air Force Register and Defense Times|date=12 September 1914|volume=56|issue=1782|page=342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFE-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a promotion to Lieutenant Commander on April 28, 1915.

'''Roberto Rocca''' (1922 – June 10, 2003) was a prominent [[Italy|Italian]]-born naturalized [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman.

==Overview==
Roberto Rocca was born in [[Milan]], in 1922, as the eldest son of Maria Queirazza and [[Agostino Rocca]]. The elder Rocca was an [[engineering]] apprentice who would later become a member of the [[board of directors]] of the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]] (IRI), the centerpiece of the [[corporate state]] advanced by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=konex&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com/premios/curriculum.asp?ID=372 ''Fundación Konex'': Roberto Rocca {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Roberto Rocca enlisted in the [[Italian Navy]], serving from June 1942 until September 8, 1943, as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in [[Naval Engineering]] on board a [[submarine]]. He graduated as [[Mechanical Engineer]] at the [[Politecnico di Milano]] in July 1945, though seven months later, the family left Italy for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=techint&gt;[http://www.techint.com/group/en/files/TechintBrochure08.pdf Techint]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/roberto-rocca-548280.html ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father's new establishment, [[Techint]], prospered during the administration of populist President [[Juan Perón]], and Rocca enrolled at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], earning a degree in science at the end of 1949.&lt;ref name=konex/&gt;

Involved in Techint since its initial, 1945 establishment, Rocca served an engineer and in the company's technical department. He was named head of the technical department in 1959, and oversaw the company's expansion into the [[steel industry]].&lt;ref name=konex/&gt; He became General Manager of Techint at the end of 1969, and CEO upon his father's retirement in 1975.&lt;ref name=dalmine&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021130150550/http://fondazione.dalmine.it/presentazione/arocca.asp Fondazione Dalmine: Agostino Rocca {{it icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agostino Rocca died in 1978, leaving his elder son as Chairman and CEO. Techint was, by then, a conglomerate with 15,000 employees, two steel manufacturing facilities in Argentina and with international engineering and construction interests. Buffeted by problems in the [[Argentine economy]] during the 1980s, Techint expanded its [[Latin America]]n activities. 

Techint participated in the [[privatization]] drive adopted by President [[Carlos Menem]] in the early 1990s, purchasing a majority stake in Argentina's then-leading steel manufacturer, the state-owned {{Interlanguage link multi|Somisa|es}}, in 1992. Techint bids for two electric utilities serving the Buenos Aires area came in second, however.&lt;ref name=techint/&gt; 

Rocca converted Somisa into Siderar, and integrated Techint's [[cold rolled steel]] operations (for which Somisa had long been a leading supplier, reportedly at a loss to the state concern) into Siderca. Between 1992 and 1996 Siderar raised its share of domestic consumption of flat steel (used in major aplliances and the auto industry, among others) from about 56 percent to about 79 percent.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Siderar-SAIC-Company-History.html Funding Universe: Siderar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relinquishing the presidency of Techint to his elder son, Agostino, in 1993, he became president of Siderca in 1996, as well as of [[Dalmine]], a steelmaker based in [[Bergamo]], Italy, acquired in 1996 &lt;ref name=konex/&gt;. Rocca embarked on a five-year investment program for Siderar, modernizing operations and shedding unprofitable units. Productivity almost tripled during this period, and costs per ton fell by 28 percent.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

Siderar was listed on the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] in 1996. A further joint venture was entered into with [[Tamsa]], in [[Mexico]], and a controlling stake was purchased in [[Sidor]] (the leading steelmaker in [[Venezuela]]) in 1998, Confab ([[Brazil]]), in 1999, and in [[JFE Group|NKK]] ([[Japan]]), in 2000, making it the first Japanese steel company in foreign majority ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfe-holdings.co.jp/en/release/nkk/40-6/art04.html NKK press release (August 1, 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Konex Foundation]] from Argentina, granted him the Diamond [[Konex Award]] for Institutions-Community-Enterprizes as the most important businessman in the last decade in his country.

The family was shaken by the April 28, 2001, aviation death of Agostino Rocca, president of Techint and Roberto Rocca's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ragnilecco.com/page.lasso?cl=9&amp;l=1&amp;lvl1=64&amp;lvl2=566&amp;sez=SP Ragni di Lecco: Agostino Rocca {{it icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Agostino's younger brother, [[Paolo Rocca]], was appointed to the post. Subsequently, Siderca was listed on the [[NYSE]], and Techint's steel operations, the group's centerpiece, were reorganized as [[Tenaris]] in October 2002, basing the subsidiary in [[Luxembourg]] and converting Techint into a [[holding company|holding]] company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenaris.com/en/AboutUs/Milestones.asp Tenaris:About us]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A patron of the arts and philanthropist, Rocca served as Vice President of the [[Mozarteum Argentino]], Honorary President of the ''Círculo Italiano'' and Honorary Member of the Institute for Industrial Development (IDI), all prominent [[non-profit]] organizations in Argentina. He was elected the first chairman of Tenaris, but died in his native Milan, on June 10, 2003, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=konex/&gt;

Growing alongside the Argentine economic recovery that followed, Siderca's steel tube shipments grew from 2.5 million tons in 2003&lt;ref name=funding/&gt; to 4.5 million in 2008.&lt;ref name=techint/&gt;

In 1990, Teresa Heinz met Senator Kerry at an [[Earth Day]] rally. This was the only reported time the two met before Senator Heinz died in a plane crash on April 4, 1991.

In May 2004, she said: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"My legal name is still Teresa Heinz. Teresa Heinz Kerry is my name... for politics. Just so people don't ask me questions about so and so is so and so's wife or this and that. Teresa Heinz is what I've been all my growing-up life, adult life, more than any other name. And it's the name of my boys, you know ?... So, that's my legal name and that's my office name, my Pittsburgh name."&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

Heinz Endowment.&lt;ref name="dep"&gt;[http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/DEPUTATE/polycomm/update/12-22-95/Vol1No47.htm The Title of the Web Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306001326/http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/DEPUTATE/polycomm/update/12-22-95/Vol1No47.htm |date=March 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, she was a Delegate to the [[Earth Summit]], representing Non-Governmental Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnkerry.com/about/teresa/ |title=John Kerry |publisher=John Kerry |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808135141/http://www.johnkerry.com/about/teresa/ |archivedate=August 8, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icte.umsl.edu/docs/newsletter/vol10i.pdf|format=PDF|title=TERESA HEINZ TO RECEIVE WORLD ECOLOGY AWARD|website=Icte.umsl.edu|accessdate=2017-01-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705092828/http://icte.umsl.edu/docs/newsletter/vol10i.pdf|archivedate=July 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, with Kerry and environmentalist academic Dr. [[Anthony Cortese]], she co-founded Second Nature, which brings "Education for Sustainability" to college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondnature.org/aboutsn/aboutsn.htm Second Nature | About SN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209103932/http://www.secondnature.org/aboutsn/aboutsn.htm |date=February 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, she founded the [[Heinz Award]]s, including a category for Outstanding Contributions to the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/ |title=The Heinz Awards |publisher=The Heinz Awards |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, with a $20 million grant, the Heinz Endowments provided initial funding for The Heinz Center,&lt;ref name="dep" /&gt; "a nonprofit institution dedicated to improving the scientific and economic foundation for environmental policy through multisectoral collaboration among industry, government, academia, and environmental organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heinzctr.org/index.shtml |title=The Heinz Center – Home Page |publisher=Heinzctr.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080409142050/http%3A//www.heinzctr.org/index.shtml |archivedate=April 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, Heinz has hosted an annual "Women's Health and the Environment" conference series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzfamily.org/programs/womensconferences.html |title=Heinz Family Philanthropies – Women's Conferences |publisher=Heinzfamily.org |date=October 1, 2004 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded Teresa Heinz Scholars for Environmental Research, which annually awards eight $10,000 awards for doctoral dissertation support and eight $5,000 awards for Masters' thesis support for research having "public policy relevance that increases society's understanding of environmental concerns and proposed solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/environmentalscholars.html|title=Heinz Family Philanthropies - Scholars for Environmental Research|date=2004-06-05|access-date=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605020512/http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/environmentalscholars.html|archivedate=June 5, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heinz is a board member of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentaldefense.org/aboutus.cfm?tagID=365 Board of Trustees – About Us – Environmental Defense] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201234617/http://www.environmentaldefense.org/aboutus.cfm?tagID=365 |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's economic security programs and advocacy===
In 1995, the book ''Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future'' (later republished as ''The Pension Book'') was published, with support from the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation, and a foreword by Heinz.&lt;ref name="hfp_retirement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|title=Heinz Family Philanthropies - Women's Retirement Initiative|date=2003-12-19|access-date=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219200600/http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|archivedate=December 19, 2003|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|title=Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future - Karen and Blackwell, Kate Ferguson|date=2007-09-26|access-date=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222803/http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|archivedate=September 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by the issues uncovered by ''Pensions in Crisis'', Heinz and her foundation created the Women's Retirement Initiative to "extend that investigation and examine how the dynamics of our pension and retirement system contribute to the disproportionate rate of poverty among older women."&lt;ref name="hfp_retirement" /&gt;

In 1996, the Heinz Foundations created WISER, the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzfamily.org/issues/womensecosec_02.html |title=Heinz Family Philanthropies – WISER |publisher=Heinzfamily.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth==
Heinz and Kerry signed a prenuptial agreement and have kept their premarital assets separate{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.
Heinz has declined to disclose her personal tax returns, citing family trusts and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} She is estimated to be worth between $750 million and $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/27/nation/na-heinz27|title=Estimate of Heinz Fortune Doubled|last=Vartabedian|first=Ralph|date=2004-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her most recently released income tax of 2003, Kerry and Heinz paid an effective federal income tax rate of 12%{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

Heinz and Kerry live an affluent life. They own a six-floor, $7 million townhome in Boston's [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood, an ocean-front home on [[Nantucket]] recently listed for sale at $25 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balling |first=Joshua |url=http://www.ack.net/Kerry-Heinzhouse060916.html |title=Kerry-Heinz house on market for $25 million - News - The Inquirer and Mirror - Nantucket, MA |website=Ack.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a $5 million ski retreat in [[Idaho]], a $4 million estate in [[Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania]], near the Heinz family's home base of Pittsburgh, and a $5 million home in the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Politics==
Like her first husband, Heinz was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for most of her voting life, and she remained a registered Republican despite being married to Kerry. In January 2003, she changed her registration to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

In 2003, Heinz was named to the [[PoliticsPA]] list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women| work = [[PoliticsPA]]| publisher = The Publius Group| year = 2001| url = http://www.politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209095936/http://politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archivedate=February 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinz is said to have been encouraged to run for her first husband's vacant Senate seat after his death. Heinz declined and refused to endorse Republican Congressman [[Rick Santorum]]'s [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1994|1994 bid]] for the seat. She publicly denounced him as the "antithesis" of her late husband, and later called him "[[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] with attitude." It was rumored she would challenge Santorum in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006]] (as a Democrat), but she did not enter the race, and the Democratic nomination went to [[Treasurer of Pennsylvania|State Treasurer]] [[Bob Casey, Jr.]], who went on to defeat Santorum.

Heinz has a reputation in the media as a very direct personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Making of a Non-President | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49993-2004Nov14.html | author = Kurtz, Howard |work=Washington Post | page = C01 | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 | authorlink = Howard Kurtz }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek | title = How Bush Did It |work=Newsweek | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619172718/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek |archivedate = June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in ''[[USA Today]]'' in July 2004, Heinz was asked about the differences between then-First Lady [[Laura Bush]] and herself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job—I mean, since she's been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I’m older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger–because I’m older, and I’ve had different experiences. And it’s not a criticism of her. It’s just, you know, what life is about.
"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The real running mates |work=USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-10-19-teresa_x.htm | date = October 20, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Heinz retracted the statement later, saying she was "sincerely sorry" for the remark. "I had forgotten that Mrs. Bush had worked as a schoolteacher and librarian, and there couldn't be a more important job than teaching our children", Heinz said. "As someone who has been both a full time mom and full time in the workforce, I know we all have valuable experiences that shape who we are. I appreciate and honor Mrs. Bush's service to the country as first lady, and am sincerely sorry I had not remembered her important work in the past."&lt;ref name = Apology&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/20/theresa.apologizes.laura | title = Heinz Kerry apologizes for remark | publisher = CNN | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush brushed it off, saying, "It didn't matter to me. It didn't hurt my feelings. It was perfectly all right that she apologized. She didn't have to apologize. I know how tough it is. And actually I know those trick questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = CNN | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/21/laura.teresa/ | title = Laura Bush brushes aside Heinz Kerry's remarks | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">The '''Texas Enterprise Fund''' is a business incentive fund that was created by legislation in 2003. The fund, which had an initial $295 million investment, is used for ensuring the growth of business in [[Texas]]. One of Texas’ most competitive recruitment tools, these funds are used primarily to attract new business to the state or assist with the substantial expansion of an existing business as part of a competitive recruitment situation. Sources indicate that since 2003 the Fund has yielded up to $6.3 billion in capital investment in Texas by out-of-state companies [https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123323/http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004974.html].

In 2004, authorization was given for the fund to grant $20 million to [[Countrywide Financial]] in return for a promise "to create 7,500 new jobs in the state by 2010." The grant (all of which are approved by the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House) is one of the largest made from the fund in terms of the size and the number of jobs promised. In the fall of 2007, while slashing jobs and with its stock price plummeting, Countrywide was eventually acquired in a [[fire sale]]  by [[Bank of America]]. But thanks to the "claw-back" provisions in the program, grantees return all funds to the state for jobs not created.

In 2012, it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] would be adding a new campus in Austin, creating 3,600 new jobs.  The Fund would be investing $21 million over ten years.[http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/17021/]

The project is focused on expanding knowledge about the relationships between trade costs and private sector growth and export competitiveness in developing countries.  A major focus is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance (net benefits) of related reform measures.  The project has two primary parts: research and policy relevant analysis, and support for new data.&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTPROGRAMS/EXTTRADERESEARCH/EXTTRADECOSTANDFACILITATION/0,,menuPK:1697684~pagePK:64168176~piPK:64168140~theSitePK:1697658,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2018}}

The project analyzes trade facilitation effects in a broad sense, as its analysis spans the entire realm of a typical international trade transaction; this includes, among other topics, the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments, the efficiency of supply chain-related infrastructure, the harmonization of product standards, and conformance to international or regional regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTPROGRAMS/EXTTRADERESEARCH/EXTTRADECOSTANDFACILITATION/0,,contentMDK:20696563~menuPK:1743267~pagePK:64168182~piPK:64168060~theSitePK:1697658,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2018}}

An '''unfair competitive advantage''', sometimes referred to as an '''exclusive competitive advantage''', provides a degree of certainty for eliminating [[competition (economics)|competition]].

This opportunity may exist as:

{{term|Physical}} {{defn|e.g. infrastructure, location, equipment; i.e.  You own the only land with access to the ocean for a shipping port.}}

{{term|Intellectual/[[technological]]}}{{defn|e.g.patents, trademarks, brands, lists, software, [[trade secret]]s}}

{{term|Human}}{{defn|e.g. skills, expertise, [[knowledge]], attitude, advisers, i.e. Only one person in the word has the formula or how to do something}}

{{term|[[Reputation]]}}{{defn|of the product, person, or organization, i.e. a brand is already recognized as the industry standard}}

The main point to consider regarding an unfair competitive advantage is that the same opportunities are not available to everyone; unless the possessor of the unfair competitive advantage decides to grant permission for people to share the opportunity.

While the origins of the term are unclear, the term is often used by marketing professionals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">'''Youth Business China''' ({{zh|c=中国青年创业国际计划}}), abbreviated '''YBC''', is a [[non-profit]] program in the [[People's Republic of China]] that aims to promote youth [[entrepreneurship]]. It is headquartered in [[Beijing]].

==History==

YBC was initiated by the [[All-China Youth Federation]] (ACYF), the [[Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security]], the [[All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce]], and other agencies in November 2003; YBC is implemented by the [[China Youth &amp; Children Foundation for Social Education]].

By using the tried model from Youth Business International and marshalling resources from all [[social sector]]s of China, especially the business community, YBC provides business [[mentoring]], [[seed money]], skills training and network support to young entrepreneurs, thus helps them succeed in business [[Startup company|start-up]]s.

YBC helps young people aged between 18 - 35 who are unemployed, under-employed and have a viable business idea and the passion for entrepreneurship but who lack business experience and have no access to seed money.

YBC provides young entrepreneurs with between US$4,000 to US$6,600 seed money; one to one accompanied mentoring; knowledge and know-how in running a business and access to business networks

As a non-profit programme with a [[think-tank]] function, YBC has been pursuing its goal to "promote entrepreneurship, enhance employability, create job opportunities, revitalise the economy, implement social responsibility and promote social harmony". YBC inspires the potential of youth and encourages them to take action.

In 2005, YBC was accredited as the best practice program by the [[UN Secretary General]]'s [[Youth Employment Network]] Office China.

==Cooperation==
In September 2008, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP China]] established a Chinese center for [[microenterprise]] development in cooperation with YBC, providing support and training to microenterprises and enterprise starters to use technology to build and grow their business. It provides accessory training rooms serving surplus rural workers, social youths, college students and migrant workers. The HP Microenterprise Development Program, which was introduced to China in 2007, is a nonprofit community investment program.
