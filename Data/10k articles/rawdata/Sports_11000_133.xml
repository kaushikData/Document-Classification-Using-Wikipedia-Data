The '''1963 [[Norwegian Football Cup]]''' was the first all-Norwegian cup, as it was the first year clubs from [[Northern Norway]] were allowed to participate in the cup. Of the two northern Norwegian teams that participated this year, [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]] made it all the way to the fourth round. 

The surprise team of the cup this year was [[Sagene IF|Sagene]], a team that made it to the quarter final, despite playing in the third division (tier three).

[[Skeid Fotball|Skeid]] won the cup, beating [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]] 2-1 in the final.

'''Alumni Coliseum''' is a multi-use sports arena located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, KY|Richmond]], [[Kentucky]].

==History==
Built in 1963, the '''Paul S. McBrayer Arena''' located inside Alumni Coliseum, is capable of seating around 6,500 people in both chairback seats and on wooden benches (8,000 for concerts) arranged in a horseshoe shape, facing a wall at the right side of the arena where staging is usually set up for events. The arena's ceiling is made completely of wooden beams and is believed to be the largest of its kind in existence. It was named for the former EKU Men's Basketball Coach Paul McBrayer who compiled a record of 219-144. The floor graphics were updated for the 2005-06 seasons and the banners were redone to be more unified. The building replaced [[Weaver Gymnasium]], which had been home to the Colonels since 1930.
In 2018, [[Donald Trump]] held a rally here, making history as the first sitting president to visit the city of Richmond.

==Usage==
The arena is home to the [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels]] men's and women's basketball team, and the women's volleyball team.  In addition to university sponsored athletics Alumni Coliseum has also played host to a variety of other sporting events, including the All "A" Classic High School basketball tournament, [[KHSAA]] Region 5 Swimming and Diving Championships, and continues to host the [[Special Olympics]] Kentucky Summer Games.

The arena has also hosted numerous musical performers over the years, more recently including [[3 Doors Down]], O.A.R. ([[Of A Revolution]]), [[Diamond Rio]], [[They Might be Giants]], [[Nappy Roots]] and [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. It also hosted the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament in 1979. On October 13, 2018 the arena hosted a political rally led by President Donald J. Trump, which was the first visit to Richmond, Kentucky by a sitting U.S. president.

The Donald Combs Natatorium, located behind the basketball arena, is the former home of the university's swimming and diving team and is now used predominantly for EKU recreation and the [[Model Laboratory School]] Swim team.  The natatorium houses a 6 lane 25 yard swimming pool as well as one and three meter diving boards.

The Alumni Coliseum also houses four other basketball courts in an auxiliary gymnasium, an outdoor swimming pool, eight classrooms, the [[Chad Bratzke]] Student Academic Athletic Success Center, and twenty additional offices.

==History==
Built in less than four months at the Interstate Fairgrounds, the stadium opened {{Years or months ago|1958}} in 1958 and has a [[seating capacity]] {{nowrap|of 6,803—&lt;ref name="milbb"&gt;[http://www.minorleagueballparks.com/avis_wa.html Avista Stadium] at minorleagueballparks.com, URL accessed October 18, 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kcIFUZK3?url=http://www.minorleagueballparks.com/avis_wa.html Archived] 10/18/09&lt;/ref&gt;}}large for Class A ballpark. The facility was built for [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] in the [[Pacific Coast League]], which it hosted for 24 of its first 25 seasons.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; The parent club in 1958 was the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who had just moved out west from [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]] and moved their PCL affiliate, the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], north to Spokane. They stayed for fourteen seasons, through 1971, then departed to [[New Mexico]] and became the [[Albuquerque Dukes]].

After one year in the short-season Northwest League as a Dodger affiliate, the Triple-A PCL returned in 1973, from [[Portland Beavers|Portland]], as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]' top affiliate. The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] became the Indians' parent club in 1976, the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1979, and the [[California Angels]] in 1982. The Indians left for [[Las Vegas 51s|Las Vegas]] after the 1982 season and the NWL returned in 1983 and has remained for over three decades.

Ferris, its original wooden grandstand was built in 1936.&lt;ref name=ssfcsic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4NVXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DfUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6625,9204351 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=Washington|title=So Spokane ball fans can sit in comfort while diamond stars perform|date= June 30, 1936 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferris was a former player and manager for the Indians who secured funding from the [[Works Progress Administration]] to build it.&lt;ref name=fhtcto/&gt; A fire in October 1948 damaged most of the grandstands,&lt;ref name=fdffgb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S_w0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=deUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5948,6106826|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=Spokane, Washington|title=Fire destroys Ferris Field's grandstand, parts of bleachers|date=October 30, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iscohtf&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HIUzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r_UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5648,6415080 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=Washington|title=Investigators seek cause of $100,000 Ferris Field fire|date=October 30, 1948 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was rebuilt using concrete and steel in the spring of 1949.&lt;ref name=ffcrlun&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0mtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yPUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7226,3466099|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=Washington|title=Ferris Field construction rushed; line-up named|date=April 8, 1949 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier baseball venues in Spokane were Recreation Park ({{coord|47.668|-117.368}}), Natatorium Park ({{coord|47.673|-117.459}}), and the original Twickenham Park.&lt;ref name=fhtcto/&gt;&lt;ref name=instpst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t486&amp;ymd=20100223&amp;content_id=8120524&amp;vkey=team1 |work=Minor League Baseball |last=Price |first=Jim |agency=(''Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington)|title=Indians stadiums of the past |date=June 21, 2003|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, four-year-old Memorial Stadium (now [[Joe Albi Stadium]]) was considered as a potential minor league baseball venue.&lt;ref name=msmbufpb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=suVXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kvYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7081%2C1313667|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=Memorial Stadium may be used for pro baseball |date=June 15, 1954 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
For three seasons beginning in [[2004 NCAA Division I baseball season|2004]], the [[Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball|Gonzaga Bulldogs]] used the stadium as its home venue while its [[Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex|current venue]] was being built.&lt;ref name=gonzaga&gt;{{cite web |title=Patterson Baseball Complex Dedication on Friday |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/News+and+Events/newsdetail.asp?EventID=2827&amp;DepartmentID= |work=Gonzaga.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69aFsBm9W?url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/News+and+Events/newsdetail.asp?EventID=2827&amp;DepartmentID= |archivedate=2012-08-01 |date=18 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their former ballpark was displaced by the new [[McCarthey Athletic Center]].

In 2011, the [[Spokane Chiefs]] hosted the first outdoor game in [[Western Hockey League]] history at Avista Stadium on January 15; the home team routed the [[Kootenay Ice]] {{nowrap|11–2.&lt;ref name=criiwhl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports/hockey/article/474454--chiefs-rout-ice-in-whl-s-first-ever-outdoor-game|newspaper=Hamilton Spectator|title=Chiefs rout Ice in WHL's first-ever outdoor game |date=January 16, 2011|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">The '''Banana Boat Team''' or '''Banana Boat Crew''' is a hypothetical pop culture [[NBA]] superteam, consisting of [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Carmelo Anthony]], and [[Chris Paul]].

==History==
The Banana Boat team first formed after a photo surfaced of James, Wade, Paul, and Wade's wife [[Gabrielle Union]] on vacation in 2015. Anthony, while not featured in the picture, was on vacation with them at the time, and is considered the 'fourth member' of the Banana Boat Team. The four NBA superstars have been friends since they were children, and have consistently gone on vacation together. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/20161740/how-lebron-cp3-wade-melo-ride-together|title=Banana Boat 2018: How LeBron, CP3, Wade and Melo could ride together|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Dwyane Wade posted on Snapchat that ‘The Banana Boys are reunited.' Snapchat gave the group their own "Banana Boys" Snapchat filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/the-banana-boat-boys-have-reunited-for-the-offseason-of-2016-062816|title=The Banana Boat Boys have reunited for the offseason of 2016 - FOX Sports|date=28 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, LeBron James expressed great interest in forming the super team in Los Angeles with the [[Lakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2016/03/lebron-james-wants-play-same-team-carmelo-anthony-dwyane-wade-chris-paul|title=LeBron James Wants to Play on the Same NBA Team as Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Paul At Least Once|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelab.bleacherreport.com/brotherhood/|title=Brotherhood|website=thelab.bleacherreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Chris Paul also expressed interest in forming the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2017/02/chris-paul-playing-with-lebron-james-carmelo-anthony-anythings-possible|title=Chris Paul on the Idea of Him Playing With LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony: 'Anything’s Possible'|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 NBA offseason, two of the four Banana Boat crew members, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade joined forces in Cleveland. Chris Paul was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], and Carmelo Anthony was traded to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].

On July 23, 2018, it was reported that Anthony would join Paul on the Rockets after signing a one-year deal at the veteran's minimum of $2.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/sports/carmelo-anthony-houston-rockets.html|title=Carmelo Anthony Set to Sign With Rockets|last=[[Marc Stein (reporter)|Stein, Marc]]|first=|date=July 23, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 23, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories''''' is a 2013 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[sports film]]. The movie is an [[independent film]] about the life of [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Roberto Clemente]] who wore jersey number 21. It is the first feature dramatic film on Clemente's life and was written and directed by California filmmaker and [[Pittsburgh]] native [[Richard Rossi]] and stars two-time Olympian high-jumper [[Jamie Nieto]] in the title role of Roberto Clemente and [[Project Runway]] Winner [[Marilinda Rivera]] as his wife Vera Clemente. Rossi searched for some time and had difficulty casting the lead. "I'd find someone who looked like him and had those aspects, but they wouldn't be a good athlete," said Rossi. "I'd play catch with them, have them swing the bat. I didn't think we'd find all of those components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/olympicfeatures/how-an-olympic-high-jumper-became-clemente-in-indie-film-647531/ |title=How an Olympic high jumper became Clemente in indie film - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2012-08-04 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Rossi appears in a supporting role playing the part of the agent "Birddog," who persuaded Clemente to leave the Brooklyn Dodgers to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Clemente made his Pittsburgh debut in 1955 and went on to be named to 12 all-star teams while leading the National League in batting four times, winning one most valuable player award and two World Series rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Roberto Clemente Biopic, Filmed in Long Beach, Set for First Public Screening|url=http://lbpost.com/sports/2000004183-roberto-clemente-biopic-filmed-in-long-beach-set-for-first-public-screening|website=lbpost|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fenno|first1=Nathan|title=Olympic high jumper paralyzed by freak injury now hopes to walk down aisle at wedding|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-paralyzed-olympian-20170603-story.html|accessdate=6 June 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|issue=Sunday Front Page Sports Section|date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme and structure==
The film dramatizes how the Hall of Famer faced racism, dedicated himself to humanitarian work, and died in a plane crash en route to [[Nicaragua]] to deliver supplies to earthquake victims in 1972. The “21 Clemente Stories” are 21 vignettes, each from a letter in his complete name using the 21 letters in Roberto Walker Clemente.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mellen|first1=Greg|title=Film about baseball Hall of Fame's Roberto Clemente to play in Long Beach|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/clemente-631156-film-roberto.html|accessdate=December 31, 2015|publisher=Orange County Register|date=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The first “R” stands for Rookie and the last “E” for earthquake, referring to the Nicaraguan quake that led to Clemente's death on an aid mission," Rossi said.&lt;ref name="auburnpub"&gt;{{cite web|author=Carrie Chantler|url=http://auburnpub.com/entertainment/capturing-clemente-film-about-baseball-legend-makes-ny-premiere-in/article_9ee3f3d4-66b2-5943-9f90-5981fc16fdc6.html |title=Capturing Clemente: Film about Pittsburgh Pirates legend makes NY premiere in Auburn |publisher=Auburnpub.com |date=2013-08-29 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I want people to learn about Clemente, to feel the emotion of the true love he felt for his family, his fans, his team, and the disadvantaged poor he died helping".&lt;ref name="auburnpub" /&gt; One of the scenes in the movie features a conversation Clemente has with a nun.

Some claim the canonization requirement of a miracle was met on July 22, 2017, when Jaime Nieto, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a backflip accident three years after the Clemente film was released, walked 130 steps at his own wedding to fellow Olympian [[Shevon Stoddart]].

==Production==
Rossi worked on the writing of the screenplay for five years, but his stories originated in childhood. When he was growing up in the West View section of Pittsburgh, he sat in [[Three Rivers Stadium]] and watched Clemente advance the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] to the [[1971 World Series]]. Clemente's attitude towards his fans made an impression on Rossi. “He used to say it is most important to spend the greatest amount of time doing things you love,” Rossi said. “He would talk about people in mills spending money on tickets for games, and how impressed he was at that. It was before free agency, but I don't think it would have mattered.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/aande/movies/4442273-74/clemente-rossi-says#axzz2d7lVwjPi |title=Filmmaker's Clemente movie a testament to grace, power |publisher=TribLIVE |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Rossi recalls, he wrote about Clemente for so many assignments in elementary school (starting in third grade) that one of the teachers finally chastised him for it. 

Rossi believes that Clemente is just as important to the sport of baseball as Jackie Robinson and thinks that his number should be universally retired like the color-barrier breaking Dodger. He originally planned to make the film with a budget like that of "42: The Jackie Robinson Story," but health problems prompted him to jumpstart production and stop waiting for an elusive check from a wealthy investor. “My doc said ‘these kind of moments are wake up calls…if there’s anything you want to do,’” Rossi said. “I said ‘I want to make my Clemente movie’ which is an odd response. Most people want to go on vacation or tour Europe or something. I wanted to make this film.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruiz|first1=Jason|title=Completed Roberto Clemente Biopic, Filmed in Long Beach, Set for First Public Screening|url=http://lbpost.com/sports/2000004183-roberto-clemente-biopic-filmed-in-long-beach-set-for-first-public-screening#.U-u1z1Y2Fj4|accessdate=December 31, 2015|publisher=Long Beach Post|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ZumMallen|first1=Ryan|title=Roberto Clemente Biopic a Dream Come True|url=http://www.gazettes.com/sports/feature-roberto-clemente-biopic-a-dream-come-true/article_b4857726-2450-11e4-b669-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=December 31, 2015|agency=Gazettes Sports|publisher=Gazettes Inc.|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors and technicians volunteered their time and donated their services to the project. The film is a blend of news and game footage along with scripted and acted scenes.

'''Blacktown International Sportspark''' (formally known as Blacktown Olympic Park) is a multi-sports venue located in [[Rooty Hill, New South Wales|Rooty Hill]], a suburb in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The venue includes two [[cricket]] grounds, which have also been used for [[Australian rules football]], an [[Track and field|athletics track and field]], three [[baseball field|baseball diamonds]], two [[Association football pitch|soccer fields]], four [[softball]] diamonds, administration centers and park land.

It was constructed for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] to host [[Softball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|softball]] and [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|baseball]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities have since been used as a training and administrative base for the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]] from 2010 to 2012, and for the [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC]] since 2012. Since 2010 the [[Sydney Blue Sox]] of the [[Australian Baseball League]] have used the main baseball stadium as their home field.

==Facilities==
* [[Blacktown Baseball Stadium]]
* [[Blacktown ISP Oval]]
* Blacktown Softball Stadium

==Australian Rules Football/Cricket Centre Developments==
Construction of the Australian Rules Football/Cricket centre which features two ovals for Australian Rules Football &amp; Cricket, stadium, function facilities and Indoor Practice Centre for Cricket commenced in 2008. The official opening of the centre was held in on 22nd August 2009 with the Mayor of Blacktown City, Councillor Charlie Lowles joined by Chief Executive Officers from AFL NSW/ACT and Cricket NSW.

==Greater Western Sydney Giants==
Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) had a presence at [[Blacktown]] from 2010 to 2014 at which time the AFL moved the senior team to [[Sydney Olympic Park]], [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] in Sydney's inner west. This move was supported by the NSW Government which spent $45&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-to-retain-nrl-grand-final-20100608-xsk6.html|title=NSW to retain NRL grand final|date=2010-06-08|website=Brisbane Times|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; million to upgrade the [[Sydney Showground Stadium]] at Sydney Olympic Park providing a new home for the Western Sydney AFL team. 

==Proposed developments==
As part of Australia's unsuccessful [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|2018–2022 FIFA World Cup bid]], the athletics track at the western end of the park was proposed to be developed into a soccer stadium named Blacktown Stadium. The stadium would have had 41,000-seat, a figure which would be downgraded to 26,000 post-tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/101001/20100714-0611/www.australia2018-2022.com.au/australias-bid_stadiums_blacktown-stadium---sydney.html Blacktown Stadium – Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Western Sydney Wanderers proposed to build a centre of excellence, consisting of a training base, offices and a youth academy at Blacktown International Sportspark. As part of the multimillion-dollar elite training base and academy, purpose-built grass playing fields, administration facilities, medical rooms and offices on the southern side of the precinct would be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Western Sydney Wanderers set to confirm $18 million centre of excellence in Blacktown|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/western-sydney-wanderers/western-sydney-wanderers-set-to-confirm-18-million-centre-of-excellence-in-blacktown-20141204-1201au.html?rand=1417691873628|publisher=smh.com.au|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-day match between Cricket Australia XI and New Zealanders in October 2015 was abandoned after concerns over the pitch, New Zealand apparently refusing to bat because of the dangerous state of the wicket. In that match, Ryan Carters (209) and Aaron Finch (288 not out) scored 503 for the opening wicket and the match score remained as Cricket Australia XI 503/1 (dec). The stand easily eclipsed the previous Australian record of 456 set by openers Ernie Mayne and Bill Ponsford for Victoria state in 1923–24.

'''Bradman Oval''' is situated at [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]] in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|southern highlands]] area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was named after cricketer [[Don Bradman]], who lived locally and played at the ground in the 1920s. His ashes are scattered on and near the Oval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradman.com.au/library_library_detail.aspx?view%3D14 |title=Bradman library (Archived copy) |accessdate=2010-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225001009/http://www.bradman.com.au/library_library_detail.aspx?view=14 |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5014211|Bradman Oval and Collection of Cricket Memorabilia|hr=01399|fn=EF14/5819; H00/00082/1|accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an attractive ground, with a white picket fence and an old fashioned pavilion. The [[Eucalyptus macarthurii|Camden Woollybutt]] is the main gum tree species surrounding the playing surface.

Bradman Oval and the nearby [[International Cricket Hall of Fame]] (which incorporates the Bradman Museum that operated 1989-2010) are tourist attractions for cricket fans in Australia, and for people visiting from overseas.

== History ==
The land on which Bradman Oval is situated was originally part of Glebe Park, granted to the Church of England by [[John Oxley]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

In 1883 the Bowral Cricket Club was formed and cricket has been played on the ground since 1893.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

Bradman first played on this oval when he was 12 and scored 29 not out for the Bowral Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

Bradman became a member of the Bowral Cricket Club in 1925. During his first season in the [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] District competition, Bradman scored 1,318 runs, an average of 94.14 runs. He also took 51 wickets, averaging 7.8 and held 26 catches.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

Another memorable game on this ground was in 1925 when Bradman scored 234 against the [[Wingello, New South Wales|Wingello]] team that included [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

In 1947 the "A Glebe" wicket was formally named the Bradman Oval. Later, improvements were made to the oval through the efforts of Bowral Municipal Council, and Gordon Whatman of Bowral personally maintained the wicket area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

In 1976 the reopening of a rehabilitated Bradman Oval was performed by Sir Donald Bradman himself in the company of O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Bradman Oval Bowral Ellyse Perry batting.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Ellyse Perry]] batting, [[Paul Reiffel]] [[Umpire (cricket)|umpiring]] at a women's [[Test cricket|Test match]] at [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]], February 2008.]]
Bradman Oval is bounded by Glebe Street, Boolwey Street, St Jude Street and Bowral Street. A large parkland area dominated by a stand of mature eucalypts possibly remnants of the original vegetation. A stand of these on the eastern corner impart a sense of enclosure and offer a gateway to the corner site. A line of maturing quercus occupy the St Jude's Rd boundary, and a line of exotic trees are being established between the eucalypts and Bradman Oval. The park contains a childrens playground with old road roller and adventure playground on the eastern side and is the location of the [[International Cricket Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Bradman Oval is historically significant at a State level through its association with Sir Donald Bradman's cricketing activities, an association which has been reinforced by the recent construction of the Bradman Museum and the name change to Bradman Oval to commemorate national cricketing history. Bradman Oval provides a tangible link to Sir Donald Bradman's formative years. As the former Glebe Park, the Bradman Oval represents the country town parks of the turn of the century which were characterised by a simple planting layout of trees and a few shrubs and reflects a phase in the development of Bowral when attention was turning to the garden environment. Aesthetically, the park's simple layout is further enhanced by the combination of mature Eucalyptus and deciduous trees which enhance the surroundings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

Bradman Oval was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 23 June 2000.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1399/&gt;

In addition to hosting cricket matches, it also includes several other events and ceremonies. As of 2017, there have been 166 Canterbury Cricket Weeks held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/domestic/lv-county-championship/kent-surrey,315389,EN.html |title=Arafat returns to haunt Kent |publisher=ECB |date=2011-08-10 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week continued through the Second World War with cricket being held on the ground each season.&lt;ref name=times4aug44&gt;Cricket – Canterbury Week, ''[[The Times]]'', 1944-08-04, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The politician and journalist [[Bill Deedes]] wrote in 2000: "while the Second World War was on, I consoled myself by thinking that Canterbury Cricket Week, founded in 1842 with its tents and famous lime tree, unchanging in a changing world, was the sort of thing I was in business to preserve."&lt;ref name=tory2dec15&gt;[[Simon Heffer]] (2015-12-02) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/12027874/Christmas-revives-belief-in-crickets-traditional-festive-spirit.html Old Stagers knew how to take cricket to the people], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' page 13.

The [[Old Stagers]] amateur theatre group has close links with Canterbury Cricket Week, originally being formed to perform at the festival.&lt;ref name=tory2dec15 /&gt;

==Impact==
Canterbury Cricket Week usually has Kent's highest attendance at the St. Lawrence Ground. It was once considered a major commercial and cricketing highlight of the year.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7533774.stm |title=Canterbury cricket festival |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were concerns that it could be eclipsed by the growth in popularity of [[Twenty20]] but is still considered unique in cricket and is not expected to change.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

==2012==
In 2012, the 161st Canterbury Cricket Week was scheduled to clash with the second week of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]] leading to fears of a reduced attendance at the Cricket Week. However, Kent Chief Executive Jamie Clifford stated that he believed that it would bring in larger crowds, mainly from people who didn't have tickets to the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/15961214.stm |title=Kent chief executive not concerned at Olympic clash |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[China]]''' competed in the '''[[1974 Asian Games]]''' which were held in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] from September 1, 1974 to September 16, 1974 for the first time. This time, the Asian Games Federation conference, which was held ten months before the Games, decided to expel the [[Republic of China]] from the games and accepted the entry of the People's Republic of China.

'''''Gopher Dunes''''' is a [[dirt track racing|dirt track]] near the community of [[Courtland, Ontario|Courtland]] in [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="dirtbiketipsandtricks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirt-bike-tips-and-pics.com/gopher-dunes-ontario.html|title=Location of Gopher Dunes|publisher=Dirt Bike Tips and Tricks|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its sponsors are either locally based companies or local franchises of popular restaurants like ''[[Wendy's]]'' and ''[[Kelsey's Neighbourhood Bar &amp; Grill]]''.&lt;ref name="gopherdunes1986"/&gt;

==Summary==
The track is internationally renowned for being one of the toughest tracks which require [[Physical exercise|conditioning]].&lt;ref name="monsterenergyca"/&gt; There are {{convert|26|km|mi}} of trails in addition to a child-oriented track that is much shorter - all strategically places on {{convert|20|acre|sqft}} of land.&lt;ref name="gopherdunes1986"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopherdunes.com/www.gopherdunes.com/About_Us.html|title=Gopher Dunes - Tracks and Trails/Year of Establishment/Founders' information|publisher=Gopher Dunes|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dirtbiketipsandtricks"/&gt; The kiddie (referred to on the official web site as ''pee-wee'') track can only be attempted by motorbikes up to 125cc (e.g., [[Suzuki DR-Z 125]]) and quads up to 110cc.&lt;ref name="gopherdunes1986"/&gt; [[Dirt bike]]s can commonly be seen on the track as recreational biking is encouraged along with organized racing.

The summers of 2016 and 2017 have provided the perfect weather for both professional performers and amateur users alike who generally like the solid performance that the track provides for their vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://motocross.transworld.net/news/2017-gopher-dunes-mx-race-report/ ''2017 GOPHER DUNES MX | RACE REPORT''] at Motocross Transworld&lt;/ref&gt; The warm, dry summers needed for optimal racing are essentially proof that [[global warming]] may be beneficial for Gopher Dunes in the short term even though farmers and the economy will be affected on a long-term basis.

Attempts to maintain profitability in recent years have been affected by illegitimate facilities that have opened up within {{convert|30|mi|km|disp=or}} of Gopher Dunes. These improvised facilities on improperly zoned land have ruined the peace and quiet that comes with living in rural Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2012/06/19/bylaw-changes-take-on-yappy-dogs-dirt-bikes|title=Bylaw changes take on yappy dogs, dirt bikes|publisher=[[The Simcoe Reformer]]|accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">A '''hippogonal''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɒ|ɡ|ə|n|əl}}) [[chess]] move is one similar to a [[knight (chess)|knight]]'s move.  That is, a leap ''m'' squares in one of the [[orthogonal]] directions, and ''n'' squares in the other, for integer values of ''m'' and ''n''. It need not be a 2:1 ratio for m and n.  A specific type of hippogonal move can be written ''(m,n)'', usually with the smaller number first.

For example, the knight itself moves two squares in one orthogonal direction and one in the other—it moves hippogonally. It is a (1,2) hippogonal mover, sometimes referred to as a (1,2) leaper.

Other hippogonally moving pieces include the [[camel (chess)|camel]], a [[fairy chess piece]], which moves three squares in one direction and one in the other, and thus is a (1,3) hippogonal mover.

'''Jamal Al-Gashey''' ({{lang-ar|جمال الجاشي}}; born 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=Simon|title=One day in September : the full story of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and the Israeli revenge operation "Wrath of God"|date=2000|publisher=Arcade|location=New York|isbn=1-55970-547-7|page=49|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a member of the [[Black September (group)|Black September]] offshoot of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and is the last surviving member of the group of eight Black September members who carried out the [[Munich massacre|massacre of eleven Israeli athletes]] during the [[1972 Munich Olympics]]. He is visible several times in videos of the event, identifiable by his blue and white striped jacket. During the abortive rescue attempt by [[Bavaria]]n border guards and Munich police which resulted in the deaths of nine hostages and five of the Black September members, Al-Gashey was shot in the wrist attempting to aid a fellow Black September member.

==Early life==
In interviews, Al-Gashey has said that he was brought up in conditions of great poverty, mostly in the [[Shatila refugee camp]] in [[Lebanon]]. His family was displaced in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], but always harbored a desire to return. Al-Gashey claimed that the injustice of being forced to live in squalor and rely on handouts while the "intruders" were living on his land fostered his hatred for Israel. This led to his joining the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in 1967. He said that during his initial training he felt, for the first time, "truly Palestinian&amp;nbsp;... not just a wretched refugee, but a revolutionary fighting for a cause."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Personal interview, in ''[[One Day in September]]''. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Munich massacre==
In July 1972, Al-Gashey was one of several young Black September members recruited for what he referred to as "special training," without having any idea what their target might be. He flew to Munich at the end of August 1972, staying in a hotel and even attending a couple of Olympic events. On the night of 4 September, Al-Gashey met for dinner with the other members of the strike team, along with a senior Black September operative (believed to be [[Abu Daoud]]), who briefed them on their upcoming mission and drove with them in taxis to the Olympic Village. Al-Gashey claims that until that dinner meeting, he had no clue that the team's target was to be the [[Israel]]i Olympians.

Although charged with multiple crimes related to the massacre, Al-Gashey and his surviving compatriots never stood trial. Nearly eight weeks after the massacre, on 29 October, [[Lufthansa Flight 615|a Lufthansa jet was hijacked]] by two Black September members, who demanded the release of the three Munich survivors. The jailed fedayeen were subsequently released by the [[West Germany|West German]] government.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenfeter|first=Yael|title=Israel in shock as Munich killers freed|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/israel-in-shock-as-munich-killers-freed-1.322811|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they landed in Libya, they were interviewed, with footage of this press conference being shown in the film ''[[One Day in September]]''. Jamal Al-Gashey can be seen seated in the middle of the three, between his cousin Adnan (who was believed to be the hostage-taker who shot and killed five of the hostages tied up in one of the helicopters&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/0902/munich/story5.html When the Terror Began]'' (2002). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Retrieved 7 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) and Mohammed Safady. When asked directly if he had killed any of the Israelis, Adnan Al-Gashey simply replied, "It's not important for me to say if I killed Israelim (sic) or not."&lt;ref name=pcon&gt;Press conference, as shown in ''[[One Day in September]]''. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-massacre life==
It is believed that Al-Gashey has spent the subsequent time since his release in hiding in North Africa. He married and has two daughters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He is the only member of the group to consent to interviews, having given a brief statement in 1992 to a Palestinian journalist. In 1999, Al-Gashey emerged from hiding to give a more in-depth interview in the film ''[[One Day in September]]''. Since Al-Gashey believed that Israeli agents were still trying to kill him, he was disguised and his face shown only in blurry shadow as a precaution. Director [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]] noted Al-Gashey's edgy, almost paranoid behavior throughout the interview, but was able to convince him that the film he was working on would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. During the 1999 interview, he explained,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm proud of what I did at Munich because it helped the Palestinian cause enormously&amp;nbsp;... before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle, but on that day, the name of 'Palestine' was repeated all around the world.&lt;ref name=pcon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Lajos Balogh''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈlɒjoʃ ˈbɒloɡ}}; 10 May 1903 – 9 October 1986) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] athlete and later coach, architect, enigineer, politician and sports official. Achieving his best results in the [[long jump]], Balogh was a multiple [[Hungarian Athletics Championships]] winner, [[Universiade]] medalist and Olympic participant.

Beside his competitive sports career Balogh worked as engineer and architect, focusing on sports and training constructions. He was a member of the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party]] and was arrested together with a number of other party members with fabricated charges in 1947, when the Communist Party carried out a coup d’état against the ruling Smallholders Party. He was soon released.

After retiring from sports he earned a coaching degree and also studied the biomechanics of sports movements. He was president of the [[Hungarian Athletics Association]] for a brief period in 1946 and later became a [[docent]] at the Faculty of Athletics of the [[University of Physical Education|College of Physical Education]].

==Career==

===Athletics career===
Born in [[Budapest]], the capital of Hungary, Balogh competed for [[Műegyetemi AFC]] – the sports club of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] – between 1922 and 1936, subsequently he switched to [[Magyar AC]] (1937–1944). Competing in sprint events, decathlon and long jump, Balogh achieved his best results in the latter one, winning four [[Hungarian Athletics Championships]] titles (1928, 1930, 1931, 1933). He also improved the Hungarian national record, first in 1929 to 7.43 metres, then in 1933 to 7.49 metres.&lt;ref name=mek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC00523/00835.htm|title=Lajos Balogh Biography|publisher=Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár|work=Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon (Hungarian Biographical Encyclopaedia)|accessdate=24 October 2014|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his university years he participated at the [[Universiade]] – also known then as Student World Championships and International University Games –, winning the bronze medal in the long jump in 1928 and the silver in 1930. Balogh was also present at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Allocated to the Group C in the qualifying round of the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics – Men's long jump|long jump]], he finished sixth of out then jumpers with 6.79 metres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1928/ATH/mens-long-jump-qualifying-round.html|title=Athletics at the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Games: Men's Long Jump Qualifying Round|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus failed to make it to the final round and eventually ranked 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1928/ATH/mens-long-jump.html|title=Athletics at the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Games: Men's Long Jump|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement he worked as a coach and sports official and earned his coaching diploma in 1953.&lt;ref name=mek /&gt; One of his most notable students is Olympic champion high jumper [[Ibolya Csák]]. In 1946 he acted as president of the [[Hungarian Athletics Association]] for a brief period.&lt;ref name=nevpont&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nevpont.hu/view.php?id=891|title=Lajos Balogh Biography|publisher=Névpont|accessdate=24 October 2014|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside sports===
Balogh graduated from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] in 1931, subsequently he worked for ''Óbuda Bridge Engineering Company'' and ''Budapest Electronic Works''. In 1946 he was promoted to Deputy Head of the Energy Policy Division of Ministry of Industry, however, a year later he was arrested by the Communists with the fabricated charge of conspiration against the state. He was eventually released and worked as engineer first for ''Ganz Electric Works'' (1948–1949), then for the ''Metalworkers' Union of Budapest'' and later for the ''Gheorghiu Dej Shipbuilding Company'' (1951–1956).&lt;ref name=mek /&gt; After 1956 he became a [[docent]] at the Faculty of Athletics of the [[University of Physical Education|College of Physical Education]], a position he held until 1963.&lt;ref name=nevpont /&gt;

As an architect he planned and constructed sports facilities. Among his notable works are the stadium of [[Pécsi VSK (men's football)|Pécsi VSK]], the training fields of the [[Népstadion]] and the facilities of [[Vasas SC]] and [[Budapest Honvéd SE]]. He also contributed to the rebuilding and expansion of the sports center of [[MTK Budapest]] and [[Újpesti TE]].&lt;ref name=mek /&gt;

==Personal life==
Balogh married to [[Anna Kael]], a fellow sportswoman and silver medalist of [[World Gymnastics Championships]] in 1934. Their daughter, [[Anikó Balogh]], became an athlete and competed in the javelin throw. Their grandsons, [[Attila Petőváry]] and [[Zsolt Petőváry]] are former Hungarian international water polo players.&lt;ref name=mek /&gt;&lt;ref name=nevpont /&gt;

'''Limón Fútbol Club''', commonly known as '''Limón''',  is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Limón]], Costa Rica. It plays in the [[Liga FPD]].

The team play their home matches at the Estadio Juan Gobán, although the more recent Estadio Nuevo de Limón serves as an alternative ground.

==History==
In 2009, local businessman Carlos Howden Pascal decided to invest in local second division soccer team [[Asociacion Deportiva Limonense|A.D.

[[Cardiff Arms Park]] is a [[rugby union]] stadium situated in the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. One of rugby union's most famous stadiums, it is home to [[Cardiff RFC]] and (until 2009 when they moved to the Cardiff City Stadium) was also home to the [[Cardiff Blues]].&lt;ref name="famous"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1092730.stm |publisher=BBC |title= Arms Park groundsman's dream job |accessdate=17 March 2008 | date=30 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the site had two stadiums: the Cardiff Rugby Ground and also the National Stadium. Until 1966 it was also home to the only Welsh first-class cricket club, [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]].

The Arms Park officially opened on 7 April 1984, but by 1999 the [[Millennium Stadium]], which was the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site since 1881, had replaced it as the [[national stadium]] of Wales. The future of the remaining Cardiff Rugby Ground has been in doubt since the announcement in 2007 that the Cardiff Blues would be moving to the new Cardiff City stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1318602,00.html |title=Cardiff City &amp;#124; CITY AND BLUES SIGN STADIUM CONTRACT |publisher=Cardiffcityfc.co.uk |accessdate=10 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722110941/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~1318602%2C00.html |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has been host to many sports apart from rugby union and cricket, including athletics, association football, [[greyhound racing]], tennis, [[British baseball]] and [[boxing]].&lt;ref name="Tennis"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Post_War.html |publisher= Glamorgan County Cricket Club &amp; CricketArchive |title= Post-war developments in Sophia Gardens |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stadium also hosted many music concerts including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[U2]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

'''Muscat FC''' is a [[Liberia]]n football club based in [[Paynesville, Liberia|Paynesville]]. It has established itself as one of the best football clubs since its founding on March 16, 2008 in Du-Port Road, Paynesville. Our teams have been successful in 3rd division leagues organized by the Liberia Football Association in Monrovia and other regions in Liberia. Through the efforts of our officials, players and coaching staff, we were able to clinch the 2nd Runner-up trophy in the 2012–13 Liberia football Association 3rd division play-offs thus promoting MUSCAT FC as a Second Division Team in Liberia.

Muscat FC has positively engage young people in Liberia by being committed to support their game and encourage education for all through sports (football). Ninety-five (95%) of our players are high school graduates and pursuing higher education with the support of administrative staffs.    MUSCAT FC developmental goals are to better each player's physical and mental skills to understand the importance of being a team-player and encourage them to leave in school to have a future after their time of playing soccer.

==Club History==
'''Fourth (4th) Division'''

The club played in the 4th division league for three season as Pelima FC, from 2008–2010 in the Paynesville sub-committee league. After splendid performance from the club, we got promoted to the third division league in 2010.

'''Third (3rd) Division'''

Muscat FC Liberia continue its splendid performance in the third division league (St. Paul bridge sub-committee) for three seasons and got promoted to the second division in 2013. The team played nineteen (19) league games, winning 16, draw 2 and lost 1 to the champion team of Lofa. The team performance attracted the partnership of two young Liberian (Mr. Charles B. Massaley and Mr. Flomo B. Gborkorquellie) to assist Mr. Theo Yaba Collins who was the sole sponsor of this club. With the combine support of these three young and passionate Liberians, Muscat FC Liberia was greatly supported in securing promotion to the second division.

'''Second (2nd) Division'''

Muscat FC played in the second division league in 2014 successfully in the first phase, earning the second spot on the league table. During the second phase, Muscat was unlucky to have six points deducted from the league table for allegedly fielding an illegal player thereby awarding the points to Gardnesville. At the end of the league season (2014), Muscat FC was relegated to the third division league. In March 2015, we lost one of our promising stars Opor Thompson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">'''''NASCAR Drivers: Non-Stop''''' was an hour-long [[television]] series that aired on [[ESPN2]] that profiles at least three different drivers during a particular [[Nextel Cup]] or [[Busch Series]] race weekend. The show coincides with the latter half of the [[NASCAR]] broadcast schedule. The show's first two seasons ran on [[FX Networks]] on Friday nights and was known as '''''NASCAR Drivers: 360'''''.

The series of episodes gives the viewer a behind-the-scenes view of what the drivers do between the different race weekends as well as how they perform in individual races. The first half of the episode would show the driver away from the track usually with family and friends, while the last half of the show usually details how each of the drivers perform in each of their race weekend events.

When the show was on FX Network the theme was composed by [[Niels Bye Nielsen]]. Since its move to ESPN2 the show has received a new theme and music, in a slightly faster paced style.

'''Mohamad Najib bin Haji Tarif''' is a [[Brunei]]an [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[DPMM FC]] as a [[midfielder]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-sided full-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=N. Tarif|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/najib-tarif/241515/|date=|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Starting out with the likes of NBT FC and [[AM Gunners]] of the [[Brunei Premier League]], Najib's performances at the [[2012 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]] as team captain prompted a move from [[Royal Brunei Police Force Sports Council|MS PDB]] to Brunei's only professional club, DPMM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPMM FC get fresh legs|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/04/05/dpmm-fc-get-fresh-legs|date=5 April 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=31 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605091412/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/04/05/dpmm-fc-get-fresh-legs|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing only seven times in the [[2015 S.League|2015 season]], his club head coach [[Steve Kean]] advised him to switch to the left-back position for him to gain playing time (as he has done to [[Helmi Zambin]] and [[Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir]]). A season-ending injury to first-choice [[Sairol Sahari]] meant that he would be relied on much more heavily in [[2016 S.League|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sairol out for the season|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/04/28/sairol-out-season|date=28 April 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najib became the starting left-back for DPMM's [[2017 DPMM FC season|2017 campaign]] which ended in a disappointing 8th place, leading to the dismissal of coach [[Steve Kean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC AND GARENA YOUNG LIONS SHARE SPOILS|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/05/14/dpmm-fc-and-garena-young-lions-share-spoils/|date=14 May 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steve Kean, One-on-one: The reduction of foreign players in the S.League is "hard to understand"|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/steve-kean-one-one-reduction-foreign-players-sleague-hard-understand|date=20 December 2017|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]] Singapore|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was back on the sidelines  with the arrival of [[Suhaimi Anak Sulau]] in the [[2018 Singapore Premier League|following season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behe and Iggy strike for Warriors but DPMM come back to earn SG Cup dra|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/behe-and-iggy-strike-warriors-dpmm-come-back-earn-sg-cup-draw?page=0%2C1|date=23 August 2018|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]] Singapore|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

Najib has played for [[Brunei national under-21 football team|Brunei Under-21]] since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASEAN U-21 Championship 2005 (Piala Hassanal Bolkiah)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/asean-u21-05.html|date=22 June 2005|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only player to have played in 4 [[Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy|Hassanal Bolkiah tournaments]], winning the trophy in 2012. He regards his injury-time free-kick  against [[Cambodia national under-21 football team|Cambodia]] in that year's opening match as the best goal he has ever scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brunei skipper: It's the best goal I've ever scored|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/02/27/brunei-skipper-its-best-goal-ive-ever-scored|date=27 February 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=31 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402215218/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/02/27/brunei-skipper-its-best-goal-ive-ever-scored|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najib scored in [[Brunei national under-23 football team|Brunei Under-23]]'s first match against [[Timor-Leste national under-23 football team|Timor-Leste]] at the [[Football at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games|2011 SEA Games football tournament]], but the team lost 1–2. He then played in all five matches as Brunei finished fifth in their group.

Najib's full international debut for the [[Brunei national football team|Wasps]] came in the [[2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualification]] held in the [[Philippines]] where he played in all three games. He was also ever-present for Brunei's [[AFF Suzuki Cup]] qualifying campaigns in [[2012 AFF Championship qualification|2012]] and [[2014 AFF Championship qualification|2014]]. For the [[2016 AFF Championship qualification|2016 edition]] he was deployed at left-back, but did not finish the game due to injury which would keep him out of the rest of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fatigue, injuries contribute to loss|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/10/24/fatigue-injuries-contribute-loss|date=24 October 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najib was in the list for the [[2016 AFC Solidarity Cup]] but initially did not travel with the rest of the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/11/01/helmi-azwan-join-team-afc-solidarity-cup|title=Helmi, Azwan join team for AFC Solidarity Cup|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=1 November 2016|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101103139/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/11/01/helmi-azwan-join-team-afc-solidarity-cup|archivedate=1 November 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he recovered and made the starting lineup for the opening match, and kept his place at left-back for the whole tournament as Brunei finished in fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laos claim AFC Solidarity Cup third place|url=http://www.the-afc.com/afc-solidarity-cup-2016/laos-claim-afc-solidarity-cup-third-place|date=14 November 2016|publisher=Asian Football Confederation|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najib linked up with the Brunei national team for the two-legged [[2018 AFF Championship qualification|2018 AFF Suzuki Cup qualifying]] matches against [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] in early September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minister urges national team to make impact at AFF Suzuki Cup qualifier|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/minister-urges-national-team-to-make-impact-at-aff-suzuki-cup-qualifier/|date=30 August 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the first leg at left-back in a 3–1 loss on 1 September in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/aff-suzuki-cup-football/935614/timor-leste-a-step-closer-to-reaching-aff-suzuki-cup/|title=Timor Leste a step closer to reaching AFF Suzuki Cup|publisher=[[Fox Sports Asia]]|date=2 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place in a more advanced role on the return leg at [[Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium]] a week later and scored the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei win 1-0 against Timor Leste but miss out on AFF final round|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/brunei-win-1-0-against-timor-leste-but-miss-out-on-aff-final-round/|date=9 September 2018|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His winning goal gave Brunei their first ever home win for an international game, but the scoreline was not enough to qualify for the Suzuki Cup competition proper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">[[File:Petzl croll.JPG|thumb|400px|A Petzl Croll with the gate closed, open and with a rope locked in place.]]
A '''Petzl Croll''' is an [[Ascender (climbing)|ascending device]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petzl.com/en/outdoor/ascenders-0/croll Petzl Sport - Croll Chest Ascender]&lt;/ref&gt; used in caving and industrial rope access made by the French company [[Petzl]]. Its name comes from the town [[Crolles]] where Petzl's company headquarters are located but might also be a reference to the nearby cave system of the [[Dent de Crolles]], the exploration of which triggered a lot of technical effort leading to innovation in caving equipment.

==Usage==
The Croll is normally used in the chest position and in conjunction with an upper ascender or [[Jumar]]. This configuration allows a climber, caver or rope access worker to rapidly ascend a rope.

==History==
In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked [[Fernand Petzl]], who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the Petzl Croll, that he had developed by adapting the [[Jumar]] to the specificity of pit caving. Following these developments, Fernand Petzl started in the 1970s a small caving equipment manufacturing company [[Petzl]].

==Standards==

'''Physical education,''' also known as '''Phys Ed.''', '''PE''', '''gym''', or '''gym class''', and known in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as '''physical training''' or '''PT''',&lt;ref&gt;

It is taken during primary and [[secondary education]] and encourages [[psychomotor learning]] in a [[play (activity)|play]] or movement exploration setting to promote health.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D.

==Asia==
In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like [[soccer|football]], [[badminton]], [[captain ball]], and [[basketball]] during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as [[fencing]], and [[skateboarding]] are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[marksmanship|shooting]], and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?)  

An Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/napfa-fitness-test-education-tool|title=Napfa: From fitness test to education tool|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4&amp;nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[Test (assessment)|examinations]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like badminton, [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) 

In the [[Philippines]], PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the [[Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme]] instead for fifth and sixth year. Some schools have integrated martial arts training into their physical education curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930151303/http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm |date=September 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523121915/http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imafp.com/Chapters/IMAFP_commissions/IMAFP_mindanao.htm |title=Regional Commissions and Chapters International Modern Arnis Federation Philippines Mindanao Commission |publisher=Imafp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115150606/http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 |date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |title=Sunday Inquirer Magazine: Life Lessons from Karate |publisher=Showbizandstyle.inquirer.net |date=2008-12-14 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304154557/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SMATrinitasORBenteng.JPG|thumb|Indonesian high school students playing the traditional game "Benteng"]]
In [[Indonesia]], students ranging from [[kindergarten]] to [[high school]] have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have [[gymnastics]]. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts [[Pencak Silat]] and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from [[junior high school]], games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.

In Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.

In 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, [[Norman Lacy]] MP on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MinisterialStatementOnNewDirectionsInPhysicalEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Physical Education |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the goal of physical education is to "develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shape America Home Page|url = http://www.shapeamerica.org|website = www.shapeamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by [[Naperville Central High School]]. In the state of [[Illinois]] this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that [[student]]s who are physically fit are more [[academics|academically]] alert and experience growth in [[brain cell]]s or enhancement in [[brain]] development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates [[cardiovascular exercise]], [[core strength]] training, cross lateral movements, and [[literacy]] and [[math]] strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance [[learning]] and improve achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancing P.E. in Illinois, http://iphionline.org/pdf/P.E._Case_Study_Naperville.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;BC curriculum package&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- Not a strong source for this information. See actual curriculum documents for more reliable information regarding what students are learning.  --&gt;

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025619/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation &lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education https://www.supportrealteachers.org/the-importance-of-quality-physical-education.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiJncBRC1ARIsAOvG-a5DFCcyvtwvTO6TWrGWTlSx7w1mmTqLbz4jFcQRk2MNf73vNIItQS8aAvUSEALw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Scotland]] has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[England]], pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week in year 7, 8 and 9 and at least one in year 10 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum in England: physical education programmes of study|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=24 November 2016}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|50px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]] it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}


In Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.

==Trends==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Corta-Mato Escolar 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children participating in a school race]]
Physical education [[fad|trends]] have developed recently{{when|date=March 2014}} to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical [[sports]]. Introducing students to activities like [[bowling]], [[walking]]/[[hiking]], or [[frisbee]] at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. 

Some [[teacher]]s have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as [[yoga]], deep breathing and [[tai chi]]. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi for Mental Health {{!}} Psych Central News|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/05/24/tai-chi-for-mental-health/14015.html|website=Psych Central News|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lu C. (2007 {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about [[lacrosse]] in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

PE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that over the past three years{{when|date=June 2018}} obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled.&lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education. (n.d.). Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://www.veanea.org/home/1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jf;fhjk;sfdbkdfl'b.jpg|thumbnail]]

SHAPE America's National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the incorporation of [[health]] and [[nutrition]] into the physical education curriculum. The [[Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004]] required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=REYNOLDS|first=GRETCHEN|title=Phys Ed: Can Exercise Make Kids Smarter?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/phys-ed-can-exercise-make-kids-smarter/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, G {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts [[standardized testing]] test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremarche|first1=Pamela V.|last2=Robinson|first2=Ellyn M.|last3=Graham|first3=Louise B.|title=Physical Education and Its Effect on Elementary Testing Results|journal=Physical Educator|date=2007|volume=64|issue=2 |pages=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. [[Martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], teach children [[self-defense]] and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: [[aquatic sports|aquatics]], conditioning activities, [[gymnastics]], individual/dual sports, [[team sports]], rhythms, and [[dance]].

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834 |title=Physical Education – Jul 18, 1975 – NBC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1975-07-18 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. &lt;!-- This makes no sense as written. Can someone clarify?) Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have cases physical education programs have been cut.--&gt;&lt;!-- A lot of research shows the benefits of physical education however there can also be a lot of negative experiences students deal with regarding physical education.  --&gt;&lt;!-- A section detailing possible negative experiences students may face during physical education would be beneficial  --&gt;

==Technology use in physical education==

New technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder.  With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Wang, L., Myers, D., &amp; Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Educators may use technologies such as [[pedometer]]s and [[heart rate monitor]]s to make step and heart rate goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, M., Karp, G., Goc, H., &amp; Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include [[video projector]]s, [[GPS]] and games and gaming systems such as [[Kinect]], [[Wii]] Fit and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. [[GPS]] systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames{{clarify|date=October 2014}} can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/using-pedometers-to-assess-physical-activity-participation-levels |title=Using pedometers to assess physical activity participation levels |publisher=Humankinetics.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/lessonideas/pedometer/pedometerlessonndex.html |title=PEC: Pedometer Lesson Activities |publisher=Pecentral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sling swimsuit''' is a [[one-piece swimsuit]] which is supported by fabric at the neck. In practice, sling swimsuits provide as little, or even less, coverage (or as much exposure) as a [[bikini]]. [[Monokini]] types also exist. The sling swimsuit is also known by a variety of names including "suspender bikini", "sling bikini", "suspender thong", "slingshot swimsuit" or just "slingshot". It is so named because of its resemblance to the Y-shape frame of a [[slingshot]]. It is sometimes listed as a [[Bikini variants|bikini variant]]. When designed for or worn by a man, it is often called a "mankini".

Usually, a sling swimsuit comprises a bikini bottom of any style, with side straps extending upwards to cover the breasts, then going over the shoulders and behind the neck or extending down the back. The sling swimsuit leaves the sides of the torso uncovered, while covering the nipples and pubic area. Behind the neck, the straps may join and reach down the back to the buttocks [[thong (garment)|thong]] or string style.&lt;ref name=JenPa&gt;Jenny Pate, [http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/History-of-Swimsuits/461234 History of the swimsuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907051823/http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/History-of-Swimsuits/461234 |date=2008-09-07 }}, Article Dashboard&lt;/ref&gt; 

The variation of sling swimsuits is a '''pretzel swimsuit''', which has the straps behind the neck and another set of straps around the midriff, instead of straps down the back.&lt;ref name=JenPa/&gt; Even more "risqué" [[Europe]]an designs include the bodyform-suspender (by German manufacturer Nixxxe)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411114530/http://www.nixxxe.com/shop.php?action=details&amp;artnr=1015&amp;lang=en NIXXXE.com - Bodyform-Suspender]&lt;/ref&gt; and other open bust and/or crotchless variants such as the "peekaboo" slingshot (by Spanish manufacturer the-Bikinis)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-bikinis.com/PeekaBoo-SlingShot/vmchk.html|title=PeekaBoo SlingShot|work=the-bikinis.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "ouvert" sling bikini (by German manufacturer Tangaland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangaland24.de/products/en/extrem-Bikini/Ouvert-Sling-Bikini.html|title=String Tanga transparent swimsuits|author=Gerorge G.|work=micro Bikini Onlinestore Tangaland|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sling swimsuit worn by men is often called a '''mankini'''. It was popularized by [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], who donned one in the film ''[[Borat]]''. The buzz around the film started building during the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2006, when Baron Cohen posed in character on the beach in a fluorescent green mankini, alongside four models.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Friedman &amp; Lorenza Munoz, "[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1150656071.html?dids=1150656071:1150656071&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+2006&amp;author=Josh+Friedman+and+Lorenza+Munoz&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Fox+scales+back+%60Borat%27+movie%27s+opening%3B+The+comedy+will+first+be+shown+in+800+theaters%2C+down+from+2%2C000%2C+amid+a+lack+of+awareness.&amp;pqatl=google Fox scales back `Borat' movie's opening; The comedy will first be shown in 800 theaters, down from 2,000, amid a lack of awareness]", ''The Los Angeles Times'', page C1, 2006-10-25&lt;/ref&gt; A [[garden gnome]] in the 2011 film ''[[Gnomeo and Juliet]]'' was also shown wearing a mankini, which gets referred to as a Borat-Mankini by newspapers.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/mobile/7422124.html Gnomeo &amp; Juliet – Houston Chronicle].

==History==
Corresponding to the introduction of [[Lycra]] into swimwear, sling swimsuits emerged in the early 1990s. They are more popular on some beaches of Europe, including [[Saint-Tropez]], [[Marbella]], [[Mykonos]] and [[Ibiza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://swimsuits.lovetoknow.com/Slingshot_Suspender_Bikini Slingshot Suspender Bikinis: A History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730105128/http://swimsuits.lovetoknow.com/Slingshot_Suspender_Bikini |date=2012-07-30 }}, Love to know swimsuits, Glam Publisher Network&lt;/ref&gt; Suspender-like straps running between the breasts and around the neck that held the suit up were introduced in the mainstream in 1994. News reports said that within a week of putting the suit on their racks, [[New York City|New York]]'s major stores had sold 150. By season's end, the tally sold was over 3000, at a cost of $24 a suit.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Correspondent, "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4D23272FD283B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Itsy bitsy teenie weenie... trivia think swimsuits.

The '''Switzerland national cricket team''' represents the country of [[Switzerland]] (also known as the [[Swiss Confederation]]) in [[international cricket]].

==History==
Cricket has been played in Switzerland since at least 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketswitzerland.ch/about-1/ |title=About - Cricket Switzerland |publisher=Cricketswitzerland.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association (renamed to Cricket Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketswitzerland.ch |title=Cricket Switzerland - Cricket Switzerland |publisher=Cricketswitzerland.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014), became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/84.html |title=The Home of CricketArchive |publisher=Cricketarchive.co.uk |date=2015-08-06 |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hosted the first tournament for European affiliate members in [[Zuoz]] in 1997, the European Nations Cup, where they came fifth in the seven team tournament. They then played in the successor tournament, the [[European Cricket Council]] Trophy in 1999, 2001 and 2003, their best result coming in 1999 when they reached the semi-finals. They then played in the European Representative Championship in [[Slovenia]] in 2004, where they came third in the six team tournament.

The national played in Division Four of the [[European Cricket Championship|European Championship]] in 2009 having been promoted from Division Five, playing [[Austria national cricket team|Austria]], [[Cyprus national cricket team|Cyprus]], [[Finland national cricket team|Finland]], [[Luxembourg national cricket team|Luxembourg]] and [[Slovenia national cricket team|Slovenia]].

Switzerland was ranked to participate in ICC European Division II, Belgium 2011. Unfortunately internal differences prevented Switzerland from participating in the tournament and hence was demoted to Division III. These internal differences resulted from two rival governing bodies attempting to govern cricket in Switzerland, neither of which are members of the [[Swiss Olympic Association]], which led to Switzerland breaching membership regulations of the [[International Cricket Council]]. This led to Switzerland's affiliate membership being removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/newsdetails.php?newsId=20708_1340883300|title=ICC Annual Conference in Kuala Lumpur|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently 21 clubs playing in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketswitzerland.ch/about-1/clubs-affiliates/ |title=Clubs &amp; Affiliates - Cricket Switzerland |publisher=Cricketswitzerland.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''12th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 8 April 1854.  Typically held annually, the event is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. The race was won by Oxford who triumphed over Cambridge by seven lengths.

==Background==
[[Image:Selwyns.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn ''(standing)'' was the umpire for the fifth time.&lt;ref name=mac213&gt;MacMichael, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")&lt;ref name=blues&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 1 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").&lt;ref name=blues/&gt;  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 7 November 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Cambridge by nine lengths in the [[The Boat Race 1852|previous race]].  Cambridge led overall with seven wins to Oxford's four.&lt;ref name=results&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race – Results| accessdate = 7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no Boat Race in 1853 as the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] was scheduled for the same time as that proposed by Cambridge in their challenge to Oxford.  The universities did however race each other that year, in the [[Grand Challenge Cup]], which was won by Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, pp. 197&amp;ndash;202&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 February 1854, a challenge was sent to Oxford by the former Light Blue [[Coxswain|cox]] [[Thomas Selby Egan]], who had assumed temporary captaincy of [[Cambridge University Boat Club]], despite having coached the Dark Blues to victory in the 1852 race.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Rowing in England: A Social History : the Amateur Debate | first = Eric |last = Halladay | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ee8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22Egan%22+Oxford+coach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_c9cVPKpLoevPILMgKAL&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Egan%22%20Oxford%20coach&amp;f=false | pages = 45&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | date = 18 October 1990 | isbn = 978-0-7190260-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Oxford arrived at Putney as favourites to win the race, Cambridge's style was enough to force the odds to evens.  However, in a practice race, the Dark Blues defeated a [[Waterman (occupation)|watermen]] scratch crew easily and restored their position as pre-race favourites.&lt;ref name=drink40&gt;Drinkwater, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Both crews rowed in {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} long boats manufactured by Searle.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;  The umpire for the race was [[Charles Jasper Selwyn]] and the starter was Edward Searle.&lt;ref name="Burnell p. 49"&gt;Burnell p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11&amp;nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 1&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (70.1&amp;nbsp;kg), {{convert|5.75|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.&lt;ref name=mac211/&gt;  Cambridge saw one rower return from the 1852 race in F. Johnson, while Oxford's crew contained two former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] in Nind and the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] president Olliver Meade King.&lt;ref name=mac211/&gt;

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is competed]]
Oxford were pre-race favourites.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  They won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Cambridge the Surrey side of the river.&lt;ref name=mac211/&gt;  The race commenced at 10.40am,&lt;ref name=drink40/&gt; with Oxford pulling away from the start.  The Dark Blues were clear of Cambridge by the time the crews reached the Crab Tree.  By [[Hammersmith Bridge]] both coxes were forced to take evasive action as a result of a barge blocking their route.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  With a lead of two lengths after the bridge, Oxford continued to increase their lead, eventually passing the flag-boat with a seven-length advantage in a time of 25 minutes 29 seconds.  It was their third consecutive victory and took the overall record to 7&amp;ndash;5 in Cambridge's favour.&lt;ref name="results"/&gt;

In a speech in the evening's celebrations, Charles Selwyn, who had umpired this and the previous four Boat Races, declared that he was "no longer young and active enough" to continue to act in the capacity of umpire;&lt;ref name=mac213/&gt; he would be replaced in 1856 by W. G. Rich,&lt;ref name="Burnell p. 49"/&gt; the former [[Cambridge University Boat Club]] president who had rowed in both the [[The Boat Race 1849 (March)|March]] and [[The Boat Race 1849 (December)|December races]] of 1849.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, pp. 150, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Palm Beach Municipal Stadium''', referred to as "Municipal Stadium," is a former [[baseball park]] in the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] [[United States]], in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. Located at 755 Hank Aaron Drive, it was the long-time [[spring training]] home for the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves]] and [[Montreal Expos]]. The Braves played spring training games at the stadium from [[1963 Milwaukee Braves season|1963]] to [[1997 Atlanta Braves season|1997]], while the Expos played there from 1969 to 1972 and from 1981 to 1997.

The stadium was constructed in 1962 to replace midtown [[Connie Mack Field]], which had been the West Palm Beach spring training home of the [[History of the Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia and Kansas City Athletics]] from 1946 to 1962.

The first game was played on Saturday, March 9, 1963, under overcast skies and extremely high winds which blew sand from the outfield areas, directly toward seating area, which were not as yet totally landscaped at that time. Mayor C. Ben Holleman threw out the first ball and the [[1963 Kansas City Athletics season|Kansas City Athletics]] defeated the Milwaukee Braves 3-0 in front of a medium sized crowd of 3,265 fans. [[Warren Spahn]] started for Milwaukee and was the losing pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='WPB' A's Spoil Braves' Municipal Stadium Debut |author=Bob Balfe |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=1963-03-10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6_8iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dswFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1044,2048216&amp;dq=west+palm+beach+municipal+stadium&amp;hl=en|accessdate=|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark later hosted the 1982 and 1992 Florida State League All-Star Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MAJOR TALENT SHOW: ALL-STARS COME OUT TONIGHT AT STADIUM|author=Dave George|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=1992-06-27 |url=|accessdate=|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanta and Montreal played their final spring training game at the ballpark on Wednesday March 26, 1997, which saw Montreal come through with a 2-0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Around the NL|author=|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=1997-03-27 |url=|accessdate=|page=5C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was later demolished in 2002 and there is nothing to mark its former place, which is now covered by a [[Home Depot]] location.
